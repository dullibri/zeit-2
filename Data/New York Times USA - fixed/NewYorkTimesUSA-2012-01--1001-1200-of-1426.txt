HEADLINE: Applications Surge to Berkeley and Virginia

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG, DANIEL E. SLOTNIK and REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: Getting an early handle on overall application trends at nearly four dozen colleges and universities, and counting. 

 BODY:
10:55 a.m. | Updated 
This is the time of year when The Choice blog reaches out to more than 100 colleges across a broad spectrum -- public and private, elite and (perhaps) more welcoming -- to sketch a portrait of this year's full application cycle, including early and regular submissions.
The more than 40 colleges and universities that have thus far responded to our queries (as depicted in the running tally above) are hardly a representative sample of the nation's more than 2,000 four-year institutions of higher education. So we will save you the trouble of telling us the list isn't comprehensive. 
And yet, to those students who applied to these and other universities this year, perhaps these preliminary statistics begin to provide a bit of a rough sense of the relative dimensions of the pools in which you've chosen to dive -- if not necessarily definitive reasons why one particular college got hot, and another cooled down. And yet, the institutions themselves, at least, have their theories, and in some cases we do, too.
At the University of California, Berkeley, applications are up nearly 17 percent over a year ago -- a "notable increase'' that was mirrored at other campuses in the U.C. system, says Janet Gilmore, a Berkeley spokeswoman. The relatively low cost of a public education in California, even with steep, state-mandated hikes in tuition in recent years, is likely a factor. (And yet, the university did not announce until after its Nov. 30 application deadline that it would, as my Times colleague Jennifer Medina wrote at the time, "offer far more financial aid to middle-class students starting next fall, with families earning up to $140,000 a year expected to contribute no more than 15 percent of their annual income.'') 
Cost also appeared to be on the minds of applicants to Babson College in Boston, where applications are up more than 8 percent over a year ago. "Families are looking more at the aspect of 'value,' and not solely at the sticker price,'' Grant M. Gosselin, dean of undergraduate admissions, wrote in an e-mail. "Families are asking more questions about four-year graduation rates (as opposed to five- and six-year rates), employment placement rates upon graduation, and long-term economic potential."
And what of those that saw a drop in applications?
For Columbia University, which saw a nearly 9 percent drop in undergraduate applications from last year, one culprit is the 33 percent increase in submissions in 2011, when compared to 2010. What helped cause last year's upward swing? It was the first year that Columbia agreed to accept the Common Application, the universal form accepted by more than 450 colleges and universities. (The University of Virginia saw a similar jump in applications this year -- nearly 18 percent -- after restoring an early admission program, after a four-year hiatus.)
And sometimes, it is worth pointing out to the current college applicants in our readership (and those who will follow them), it's not necessarily clear what is behind a particular application trend.
Colleges that wish to have their preliminary data considered for inclusion in the chart above should e-mail it, following the same format, to Dan Slotnik's attention at thechoicenyt@gmail.com. Meanwhile, we welcome your comments, as always, using the box below.
We will continue to update the chart above, as news warrants. You can find a chart with the most up-to-date early admission figures for this year's application cycle here. And here's is our full chart for the 2011 admissions year.
An earlier version of this post cited the announcement of a program to provide tuition relief to middle class students as a possible factor in the rise in applications at the University of California, Berkeley. That program was announced after the university's Nov. 30 deadline for regular applications. The earlier post, and the accompanying chart, also reported, erroneously, that Middlebury College had a 4.56 percent drop in applications; in fact, its applications increased by that percentage.

HEADLINE: $4.62 Million Mercedes Gullwing Leads Strong Auction Weekend in Arizona

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Auction houses reported robust sales from their events in and around Scottsdale, Ariz. 

 BODY:
As the auctions in and around Scottsdale, Ariz., over the weekend proved, the uppermost reaches of the collector-car hobby remain virtually unfazed by the various crises roiling the global economy.
A 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing, one of 29 alloy-bodied Gullwings to have been produced by the German automaker, shattered preauction estimates on its way to a $4.2 million gavel price and a $4.62 final sale with buyer's premium. As Rob Sass noted in his preview of the sale, a bidder would have found little fault with the example consigned by Gooding & Company:
With competition-inspired Rudge knock-off wheels and plaid bucket seats reminiscent of those found in some of the automaker's most famous endurance racers of the era, it is expected to bring more than double the price of a steel-bodied Gullwing, with a preauction estimate of $2.5 million to $3 million.
Gooding's other marquee concession, a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT Long Wheelbase California Spider, sold for $3.9 million, a shade higher than its uppermost preauction estimate. Gooding, based in Santa Monica, Calif., realized total sales of $39.8 million over two days.
RM Auctions held a Ferrari-centric sale at the Arizona Biltmore resort in Phoenix, where a 1957 Ferrari 410 Superamerica coupe, bodied by Scaglietti, led the group, selling for $1,815,000. It was a newer classic from the Scuderia, however, a 1991 F40 originally owned by former automotive executive Lee Iacocca, that prompted the fiercest bidding. With fewer than 300 miles on the odometer, the F40 sold for $781,000, a public-auction record for the hypercar, according to RM.
In Scottsdale, Barrett-Jackson, the house that has anchored this collector-car weekend for nearly 40 years, reported more than $70 million in sales, led by a 1948 Tucker that sold for $2,915,000. The house also realized $2.2 million for a low-mileage, metal-body Mercedes Gullwing, a significant price for a nonalloy model.
The next major auction weekend falls in late February, when RM brings the roadster-heavy Milhous collection to Boca Raton, Fla.

HEADLINE: The New Gilded Age - Who Will Benefit?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: On the eve of Davos, Chrystia Freeland writes about the twin Gilded Ages of our time: one benefiting the "one percent" of the West and the other the emerging economies. To what extent is the middle class in Europe, the United States and Japan being squeezed between the two? 

 BODY:
As IHT Rendezvous kicks off a week of special coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, our colleague Chrystia Freeland, an IHT Page Two columnist and global editor at large at Reuters, writes about the new Gilded Age. 
"In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the opening of the American frontier created the Gilded Age and the robber barons who ruled it. Today, as the world economy is being reshaped by the technology revolution and globalization, the resulting economic transformation is creating a new gilded age and a new plutocracy," says Chrystia.
This plutocracy is the so-called "one percent." And what of the other 99 percent? That is less clear. 
Chrystia writes:
"It is easy to say, get more education, but if you are 40 or 50, it is hard to do," said John van Reenan, head of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. "In the last 15 years, it is the middle classes who have suffered." 
Mr. van Reenan, who is teaching at Stanford Business School in California this month, said these tensions had been building for years, but had been exacerbated by the financial crisis. That, he said, has brought a wave of populist protest, including the Tea Party on the right and the Occupy movement.
In your opinion, to what extent is the middle class in Europe, the U.S. and Japan being left behind by the twin gilded ages of the one percent and of the emerging world? Is education the key to survival? If not, then what is? Must Westerners readjust their view of a good life?

HIGHLIGHT: A study predicts that climate change will cut into the future profits of California cattlemen. 

 BODY:
To see how thoroughly the concept of ecosystem services -- the economic analysis of the natural world's intersection with human endeavors -- is embedded in climate change research, check out this forecast from a group led by researchers at Duke University and the Environmental Defense Fund.
It examines the future of cattle ranching, an industry that is bound up with America's self-image, thanks to Hollywood, pulp novels and Cormac McCarthy, through the lens of a climate-changed California landscape. It concludes that, whether the state's climate becomes warmer and wetter or warmer and drier, it will be more expensive to raise cattle because there will be less forage to sustain the animals. 
Significant amounts of forage -- nature's free "service" to the cattlemen -- will either be dessicated (under the warmer and drier projection) as the arid conditions in southeastern California inch northward or will be replaced by less-digestible scrub and brush (under the warmer and wetter projection), the study projects.
The loss will cost California ranchers tens of millions of dollars annually if it is warmer and wetter over the next 60 years or so, and $123 million to $209 million a year if it is warmer and drier, the article suggests.
In coming decades, "there will be fewer places to graze cattle and cattle grazing lands will be less productive," said Linwood Pendleton, one of the study's lead authors, an ecosystems services specialist at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment. "And because we've built up cities and highways around them, there's nowhere to move to."

Rebecca Shaw of theEnvironmental Defense Fund agrees. "If you look at the way climate is going to change the distribution of ecosystems in California, we are likely to see a decrease in grasslands and range lands and an increase in woody biomass and shrubs" -- in the warmer and wetter projection -- or a spread of arid landscapes where little grows, under the warmer and drier projection, she said.
Shrubland, while biodiverse, does not provide good cattle forage, Dr. Shaw said, "so shrublands grow at the expense of grasslands."
A year ago, the federal Agriculture Department reported that there were about 5.2 million head of cattle in California, less than 10 percent of which were raised largely in feedlots, with little opportunity to graze.
 Another fact sheet, from the California Beef Council, said that about 11,800 ranches in California raised beef cattle. The total income brought in by the state's cattle industry in 2010 was $2.09 billion.
The findings of the new report, published in the journal Climactic Change, can be extrapolated well beyond California's boundaries, to Plains states like Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska, where cattle are a bigger slice of the agricultural economy, Dr. Pendleton said.
"It is the grass-fed beef that everyone's telling us we should be eating that is going to take a hit," he said, adding that in most cases, "you will just have fewer cows on the same land."
One variable that could upend some of the study's projections is the number and intensity of wildfires in a climate-changed California. Dr. Shaw said that the bigger and hotter a fire, the more likely it would consume the woody scrub growth and give grasses a chance to regrow. 
Jennifer Witherspoon, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the group was working with the California Cattlemen's Association to create a legal framework through which ranchers could have extra economic incentives to preserve rangeland under the terms of California's landmark cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

HEADLINE: How to Get Help Paying for Heating Oil

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: The government as well as private nonprofit groups offer help to people who are having difficulty paying their heating bills, especially as heating oil prices rise this winter. 

 BODY:
As the threat of an actual winter intensifies, advocates for the poor have been worrying about how low-income households will cope with the high cost of heating oil.
Heating oil prices may hit record levels this year, even as natural gas prices plunge - a divergence that I wrote about over the weekend with my colleague Clifford Krauss.
Some advocates warn of a coming crisis in the Northeast, where 80 percent of the nation's oil users live, especially since the federal government cut financing for heating assistance this year.
There is help out there: People having trouble paying for heat can turn to state Low Income Home Energy Assistance offices. Income qualifications vary by state, and are set as a percentage of the federal poverty level or state median income. In New York, the maximum allowable income is 60 percent of the state median, or $42,312 for a family of four, while in New Jersey it is 225 percent of the federal poverty level, or $47,770 for a family of four. For most states, the maximum income to qualify averages about 150 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $33,525 for a family of four.
People seeking assistance can contact the National Energy Assistance Referral service through a toll-free number to learn the local agency that can help them:(866) 674-6327 or TTY (866) 367-6228. Alternatively, they can e-mail energyassistance@ncat.org. 
Even though the winter has thus far been mild, demand for services has been high and there may not be enough money to go around, said Joseph P. Kennedy II, founder of Citizens Energy, a nonprofit company that provides one-time 100-gallon oil deliveries each season to about 200,000 needy households in 25 states.
Mr. Kennedy said the organization typically receives about 50,000 calls about heating assistance the first day the program opens. This year, there were 500,000 in the first hour. "In the warmest winter that we've had on record," he said, needy families are "having to pay more to stay warm than they ever have." 
The lack of assistance, coupled with high oil prices, has been taking its toll, especially in places like central Massachusetts, where people often lack access to cheaper alternatives like natural gas. "We're seeing a lot more people in trouble, with the economic situation," said Bob LaFlamme, who owns Crowley Fuel in North Brookfield, Mass., and has been rallying area select boards to help organize an aid effort. "It's a perfect storm of disaster for some people."
Cindy Shea, founder of Hearts for Heat in Worcester County, Mass., said people in need often do not know where to get help. "We have people that just get by, like the 85-year-old man that was a veteran and I found him just sitting in his house, freezing," she said. "He didn't know how to find any other resources so he just hunkered down. But he could have easily frozen to death." 
Ms. Shea said she would like to see more community-based organizations like hers throughout New England. "It's really a good solution to this problem," she said. "We've managed to raise thousands of dollars from people in our town to help people in our town. Towns are just saying, 'Look, we cannot afford to have some of the people in our town freezing to death in their homes.'"

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Bad Year for Wall St. Not Reflected in Chiefs' Pay | Wall Street stocks and profits took a beating in 2011. But there is one corner of the Street that took a lighter hit: the compensation paid to chief executives.
Three big banks disclosed on Friday what their top executives would receive in deferred stock for their work in 2011. Such stock is expected to make up most of their bonus as banks are increasingly paying employees more in deferred stock. Those awards to top bank executives are coming as lower-level employees are finding out that their own bonuses will be much smaller than a year ago.
Brian Foley, a compensation expert in White Plains, said that for top executives, he would have expected "the belt to come in a few more notches" this year given the banks' lackluster stock performance. He added that executive suite pay packages this year might further lower morale inside the banks.
"A lot of people in the middle took big hits this year," he said. "It could create some big 'us versus them issues' as to why the rank and file are taking a bigger hit than the senior executives." DealBook »

HEADLINE: Unlocking Seaweed's Next-Gen Crude: Sugar

BYLINE: JOSIE GARTHWAITE


HIGHLIGHT: A start-up pins its hopes on research showing that a genetically modified strain of bacteria can break down the sugars in brown seaweed, or macro-algae, to produce ethanol. 

 BODY:
Seaweed often brings to mind thoughts of surf and sushi, not fuel. But that could change if a biotechnology start-up called Bio Architecture Labsucceeds in building a new kind of energy company from designer bacteria and a low-cost process for harvesting seaweed. 
The key is a genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli bacterium, which can break down the sugars in brown seaweed, or macro-algae, to produce ethanol, according to new research published in the peer-reviewed journal Science. 
As one of the 14 study authors, BAL's co-founder and chief science officer, Yasuo Yoshikuni, explained in an interview by phone, "Sugar is the next-generation crude oil - it can go to fuels and chemicals." BAL's breakthrough, he says, is about finding a way to "unlock the sugars in seaweed."
Fast-growing, sugar-rich seaweed has much to offer as a biomass feedstock. Unlike corn and sugar cane, it does not compete with food crops for land, and it does not require freshwater. What is more, seaweed does not contain lignin, a compound found in the cell walls of some plants like corn that enables them to stand up and is difficult to break down. 
From an environmental standpoint, Mr. Yoshikuni said, seaweed can help to clean up water by absorbing pollution and waste from agricultural fertilizers, municipal solid waste and seafood production.
But seaweed presents challenges, too. Industrially available microbes cannot metabolize a sugar called alginate, which makes up half of the sugar content in seaweed. 
"A couple microbes found in the ocean can metabolize alginate," Mr. Yoshikuni said. So his team introduced genes from a marine microbe to a widely used microbe, E. coli. They also introduced an "ethanol producing component," or pathway. The microbe could easily be engineered with a pathway for producing, say, jet fuel or butanol, Mr. Yoshikuni said.

The research published in Science shows Mr. Yoshikuni and his colleagues achieved as much as 80 percent of the maximum theoretical yield from the sugar composition in seaweed.
It is one thing to demonstrate the technology, and quite another to implement it at a scale that takes a bite out of the current market for petroleum-based fuels and chemicals. Yet according to BAL's chief executive, Dan Trunfio, "We're not trying to create an industrial miracle. Seaweed has been grown at commercial scale for 100 years." You can find seaweed aquafarms in China just as cornfields are found in the United States, he said in an interview by phone. 
Farmed at 18 to 22 dry tons per acre, Mr. Trunfio said, seaweed can yield 1,500 gallons of ethanol per acre. That is 50 percent more ethanol per acre than sugar cane and triple the ethanol per acre of corn, at a fraction of the cost.
Founded in 2008, BAL is based amid a small cluster of biotech start-ups adjacent to the bayside Aquatic Park in Berkeley, Calif. But its ambitions extend far beyond the West Coast. BAL has four aquafarming operations throughout Chile, and offices in Puerto Montt, a hub in the Los Lagos region for the nation's salmon industry. 
It is in Los Lagos where BAL is now setting up a pilot facility to demonstrate its process from start to finish: farming and harvesting of native Macrocystis pyrifera seaweed, crushing the feedstock, then fermenting its carbohydrates to produce fuel or chemically synthesizing them to produce chemicals. 
Along with its subsidiaries BALChile and BALBiofuels Chile, BAL broke ground on the project in mid-December; it plans to begin operations this year. 
Mr. Trunfio said that Chile was a hospitable place for a company at this stage of developing biofuel from seaweed. "Chile has a vast aquaculture industry, and seaweed is included in that," he said. 
It also helps that the Chilean government is "very supportive of renewable fuels and energy," he added. In partnership with the Universidad de Los Lagos, BAL has received a $7.5 million grant from Chile's economic development agency, Innova CORFO, to set up research and biofuel production in Chile.
BAL's backers span three continents. In addition to its work in Chile, BAL has formed a strategic partnership with Statoil, a Norwegian producer of offshore oil and gas. Under the partnership, Statoil agreed to finance development and demonstration of technology for converting coastal Norwegian seaweed to ethanol. 
In the United States, BAL has received funding as a subcontractor for DuPont under an $8.8 million grant from the Energy Department's ARPA-E program for work producing isobutanol from seaweed. And according to Mr. Trunfio, the company is now "getting ready" to begin aquafarming on the East Coast with a new partner.
In total, BAL has raised $37.5 million, including $12 million in venture capital. More financing will be needed to bring BAL's biochemicals and ethanol to market, Mr. Trunfio said. But if all goes well, he says, the company could be selling renewable chemicals by 2014 and fuel within five years.

HEADLINE: Beyond Hype, a Closer Look at New York's Choice on Shale Gas

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New Yorkers debate next steps on the fate of the state's vast natural gas resource. 

 BODY:
More than 40,000 comments have been submitted to New York State aimed at shaping how Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo deals with the huge natural gas resource locked in the state's portion of sprawling geological formations known as the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale.
The comments are not publicly viewable at this point. (You can submit a Freedom of Information Law request for an eventual CD, I was told.) But any quick sift of the Web provides a pretty solid sense of the range of views -- from environmentalists pursuing an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing and related processes, widely called fracking, to landowners seeking the freedom to benefit from their mineral rights. There was a fresh anti-gas rally in Albany this morning, focused on passing bills (sponsored by lawmakers representing New York City constituents far from the resource) that would limit the governor's ability to move ahead.
Here's some background behind the shouting: 
The comments submitted to the state by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (online here) are particularly useful to explore. The E.P.A. stance could be characterized as concerned but supportive, which is a strong contrast from the agency's tougher stance in 2009, as described in a recent post on the Politics on the Hudson blog. I also encourage you to read coverage from Brian Nearing of the Albany Times Union. One concern from the agency is over how the state and industry will work out how to pay for the cost of overseeing the gas extraction.
For the last several years, the public discourse on this momentous, multi-layered economic and environmental issue has largely been shaped from the edges -- by vocal and histrionic campaigners seeking a blanket ban on the process and industry groups and property owners resisting regulation and bitterly fighting any talk of a ban. 
To see how this has played out, review the fight over the iconic symbol in this debate -- the flaming faucets in Josh Fox's film "Gasland." Here's what the Colorado Department of Natural Resources wrote in 2010, Fox's response and a relevant subsequent Denver Post column.
In quieter corners, including at environmental groups focused on energy and climate policy as well as land preservation, the goal has never been a ban, but instead a push to create the set of rules, policies, revenue flows and relationships that give the greatest social and economic benefits with the least risk of environmental regrets.
Below you can read two views on New York's next steps -- one from Susan Oliver, an upstate landowner, and the other from , the president of Riverkeeper, a regional environmental group.
Here's Oliver, who is a volunteer with the Joint Landowners Coalition of New York: 
 Throughout the four years this issue has been debated, the forgotten voice has been the upstate landowner. There seems to be two sides to the issue: the person who uses energy, but doesn't feel comfortable living near its development, and the industry that coaxes it from the ground. The former considers himself an environmentalist. I disagree. The true environmentalists are the farmers and other upstaters who have spent a lifetime taking care of their land, paying taxes, and braving the hardships that often come with rural life. NY uses more natural gas than any other state except CA and TX. But it imports 95 percent of it. 
Many of the natural gas issue opponents acknowledge that natural gas is better than coal and oil, but feel we can get the gas from somewhere else. And I've heard folks say that since there already is enough gas coming out of PA's ground, there's no need for us to put up with truck traffic through the Catskills. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but what's wrong with this debate is that instead of rolling up their sleeves and finding the best environmental protections we can enact, the anti-natgas folks perpetuate misinformation - such as the famed flaming faucet - which was proven before it even appeared in Gasland to be caused by naturally occurring methane. The best chance we have at protecting our environment and saving the people too - those that have been without economic opportunity for decades - is to have earnest, informed landowners serve as stewards of their own properties with airtight, environmentally sound leases. 
The Joint Landowners Coalition of NY (JLCNY) has done just that. Spending thousands of hours studying this issues in the SGEIS, they have provided two dozen pages of highly informed and technical input into the most effective ways to prevent gas migration, which setbacks make the most sense, and ways to reduce truck traffic. They have taken a pragmatic but earnest look at protecting grasslands and birds; at the best recommendations for handling fluids and protecting water; and verified for themselves the characteristics of the most secure wellpads. The farmers I know wouldn't risk their land or their way of life for anything. They don't have to. We can have safe natural gas development in NY, just as the thirty or so other states do. We can be responsible for producing the energy we use. And that's greener than importing it.
Here's Paul Gallay, in a response to a query I sent earlier this month asking whether Riverkeeper wants an outright ban or mainly tougher rules and regulations (a distinction that I thought was unclear in a recent Huffington Post piece by Gallay):
We have yet to see proof that fracking can be done safely or that it would be a net positive for the state's economy or its upstate communities. If the state can provide the facts and analysis needed to ameliorate each of these concerns, it should do so.
As recently as [January 4], the governor's office admitted that it is waiting for the facts on fracking. Of course, if the State wants these facts, why hasn't it done a proper study of fracking's socio-economic impacts? Riverkeeper called DEC out for failing to take the required hard look at potential adverse socio-economic impacts, in a letter to Commissioner Martens two months ago. We've received no response from Martens.
A recent press report indicates that DEC will commission a second socioeconomic impact analysis, but the agency has done no formal announcement about any such review. Perhaps that's because the state is still requiring the public to get its EIS comments in on January 11th and doesn't want to admit that the EIS remains so incomplete on such a major issue.
When we asked DEC for the scope of work of the second socioeconomic impact study, a member of the executive team declined to send it to us, "on advice of counsel." Great way to earn the public's trust! So, we'll seek it under the Freedom of Information to determine whether it really addresses all of the still-unanswered questions on this issue.
And, as far as health impacts are concerned, when the Director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health admits that more research is needed on the health impacts on fracking (and Rob Jackson of Duke University says in this same article that it will take three to five years to determine fracking's health impacts), it shows just how serious these questions are -- especially outside New York, in communities where fracking is already going .
Bottom line: As I said in my submission to the Huffington Post, there are good reasons to believe that fracking would do real and significant damage to New York's environment, public health and community character, and would not be a net benefit to our economy. 
For more, I encourage you to explore materials posted by Duke University in the wake of an incredibly informative public forum on shale gas earlier this month. 
If you have time, I also encourage you to read two articles published recently in the New York State Bar Association Journal:
"Homeowners and Gas Drilling Leases: Boom or Bust?" by Elizabeth Radow, a lawyer who leads the hydraulic fracturing committee for the League of Women Voters of New York State.
"The Marcellus Shale: A Game Changer for the New York Economy?"* by Scott R. Kurkoski, an upstate lawyer who is chairman of the Broome County Bar Association Oil and Gas Committee and attorney for the Joint Landowners Coalition of New York.
Regular readers of Dot Earth know my view, which is that a responsible mix of regulation, transparency, liability and corporate-community exchanges can produce economic and energy benefits while limiting environmental risks. 
That, too, was the bottom line in "The Fracking Song," the engaging and creative contribution by New York University students to discourse on shale gas drilling:
Now it's not that drillers should never be fracking
But the current regulation is severely lacking
Reduce the toxins, contain the gas and wastewater
And the people won't get sick and the planet won't get hotter. [music video here]
There'll be here on this issue in coming weeks. I'd encourage you to use comments here to point to resources that back up your stance.

HEADLINE: Charles Duhigg Responds to Readers on Apple and the iEconomy

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A reporter will discuss the challenges posed by increasingly globalized high-tech industries, based on a deep look inside the economics of Apple's manufacturing. 

 BODY:
7:36 p.m. | Updated Charles Duhigg has provided answers to select reader questions. See the comments, below.
On the front page of Sunday's newspaper, Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher published the first of a series of articles on The iEconomy, examining the challenges posed by increasingly globalized high-tech industries. In a deep look inside the economics of Apple's manufacturing, Mr. Duhigg and Mr. Bradsher described the powerful incentives that first drew Apple's assembly work overseas, and the subsequent pressure that encouraged related jobs to follow suit:
Apple employs 43,000 people in the United States and 20,000 overseas, a small fraction of the more than 400,000 American workers at General Motors in the 1950s, or the hundreds of thousands at General Electric in the 1980s. Many more people work for Apple's contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble iPads, iPhones and Apple's other products. But almost none of them work in the United States. Instead, they work for foreign companies in Asia, Europe and elsewhere, at factories that almost all electronics designers rely upon to build their wares.
"Apple's an example of why it's so hard to create middle-class jobs in the U.S. now," said Jared Bernstein, who until last year was an economic adviser to the White House. 
The article was accompanied online by an animated graphic detailing the economic pressures underlying the process.
But the problem, the article noted, isn't unique to the maker of the iPhone and the iPad:
Similar stories could be told about almost any electronics company - and outsourcing has also become common in hundreds of industries, including accounting, legal services, banking, auto manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.
But while Apple is far from alone, it offers a window into why the success of some prominent companies has not translated into large numbers of domestic jobs. What's more, the company's decisions pose broader questions about what corporate America owes Americans as the global and national economies are increasingly intertwined. 
The article, which followed months of reporting, also arrived shortly after Apple released a list of its major suppliers for the first time, and weeks after an episode of the public radio program "This American Life" focused intently on labor conditions at an Apple supplier in China. 
Twitter users had lots to say, from the admiring:
RT iOpening: "@nytimesbusiness: Deep look inside the Apple #iEconomy is stirring lots of sharp comments. nyti.ms/zcbtIK"
- MariaHalkias (@MariaHalkias) January 22, 2012
To the skeptical:
@cduhigg @nytimesbusiness would the middle class be better off without the iPhone? User delight, app developers, productivities don't count?
- Joe Zou (@zzbar) January 21, 2012
@cduhigg Let's say I want to develop + manufacture something here in US...few sources to pay for US development of prototypes.
- Warren G. Lewis -(@Luminescer) January 21, 2012
At Slate, Matthew Yglesias took a distinctive view:
The more interesting question, to me, is why we don't hear more about the possibility of letting the workers come to America. At the same time that a lot of companies seem to want to move certain kinds of production to foreign countries to take advantage of their labor forces, an awful lot of people seem to want to move to the United States.

HEADLINE: A Loophole Poses Risks to Investors in Chinese Companies

BYLINE: DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: A vehicle known as a variable interest entity allows Chinese companies like Alibaba to accept money from foreign investors through an offshore entity, even in restricted industries. The government is taking a closer look. 

 BODY:
SHANGHAI - Jack Ma, the chairman of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, surprised investors last May when he acknowledged that he had transferred the assets of the company's online payment platform to a private company that he controlled.
Executives at Yahoo, which owns around 40 percent of the privately held Alibaba Group, complained that they had not been properly informed of the move, and that the Alibaba board did not approve the transfer.
While the dispute was later resolved, it raised questions about the risks of investing in Chinese companies using a little-known regulatory loophole. Legal analysts scrambled to explain that investments in China's Internet industry, among others, had hidden risks, and that government scrutiny of the loophole was increasing.
 "There's still a lot of uncertainty," Steven Xiang, the Shanghai-based managing partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the American law firm, said. "No regulatory changes have occurred yet. But investors need to consider their risk appetite."
For years, big Internet companies in China, like Alibaba and Baidu, have raised billions of dollars by effectively skirting Chinese regulations that ban foreign investors from acquiring stakes in companies operating in restricted industries, like energy, telecommunications and the Internet.
Using a complex investment vehicle known as the variable interest entity - or V.I.E. - Chinese companies have been able to accept money from foreign investors through offshore entities they set up.
In the case of Alibaba, Mr. Ma controls a Chinese company that transfers its economic returns and governance structure to an offshore entity in the Cayman Islands. That vehicle, in turn, is contractually tied to the Alibaba Group and the Hong Kong-listed Alibaba.com, which it operates.
Sina.com was one of the first to use this complex arrangement. But virtually every major Chinese Internet company has adopted a similar structure.
Worries about United States-listed Chinese companies using this regulatory loophole are often confused with efforts by much smaller Chinese companies to list in the United States through so-called backdoor listings, or by acquiring the shell of an American company and merging Chinese assets into it. Companies using that method came under attack last year because of accounting scandals.
There is no relationship between the two. But last year, investors grew nervous about Chinese stocks, and short-sellers tried to capitalize on the concerns to pummel the share prices of United States-listed Chinese companies.
Chinese companies using the V.I.E. structure are generally much larger and include many of the most profitable young companies in China.
Private companies often chose this route because they had difficulty raising capital in China, where state-run banks tend to favor government-owned companies.
That is perhaps one reason Chinese regulators long ago gave tacit approval to such arrangements. As a result, about 108 of 225 Chinese companies listed on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange use the V.I.E. structure, according to a study done by Fredrik Oqvist, an independent analyst in Beijing.
But in recent years, the Chinese government has grown increasingly uneasy with the arrangement. Several regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce and the central bank, have questioned the viability of the complex structure in public statements.
Last October, some Western law firms cautioned clients that the China Securities Regulatory Commission had written an internal memo raising doubts about the V.I.E., noting that "foreign parties with unknown motives own significant stakes in major Chinese Internet enterprises."
Legal experts, though, doubt Chinese regulators will abolish the practice or even force big Chinese companies to unwind their structures any time soon.
"That'd be like taking a knife to about 80 U.S.-listed companies that have used this structure over the past 12 years," said Lawrence Sussman, managing partner in the Beijing office of O'Melveny & Myers, the United States law firm. "This structure is unlikely to go away."
But many legal analysts say the risks are real.
"We've developed a structure that's fraught with risk," said Paul Gillis, a visiting professor of accounting at Peking University in Beijing. "And until recently, I don't think investors realized the risks. The Alibaba case is the one that set some of this off."
Alibaba said it had no choice but to transfer the assets of its online payment platform, Alipay, to a private company controlled by Mr. Ma after Beijing regulators tightened controls over online payment systems and threatened to make the operations of Alipay illegal. That could have posed dangers to Alibaba's fast-growing e-commerce unit, Taobao.
An Alibaba Group spokesman, John Spelich, said that the disagreement with Yahoo was resolved and that worries about the V.I.E. structure were exaggerated.
The V.I.E. structure "is a longstanding, well-recognized and legally compliant model, and there is no indication that it is about to change with regard to responsible companies that play by the rules," he said in a statement. "As far as I am concerned, last year's entire V.I.E. controversy was nothing but a tempest in a teapot that benefited the shorts and excited the traditional critics of China and open international trade and investment."
But some critics saw Alibaba's move as a sign that Mr. Ma, the company's chairman, could move a valuable piece of the Alibaba Group off the books to hide its value from one of its biggest shareholders, Yahoo.
At the time of the move, Alibaba and Yahoo had been at odds over Yahoo's stake in the company. The Alibaba Group remains one of Yahoo's most valuable assets, and Alibaba has been pressing Yahoo to give up that stake and sell it back to Chinese investors.
The dispute was resolved in July, when Mr. Ma agreed to certain conditions. If Alipay goes public with a stock offering, Alipay will pay the Alibaba Group - which is partly owned by Yahoo and Softbank of Japan - at least $2 billion but no more than $6 billion, plus certain licensing fees.
If Yahoo disposes of its stake ahead of an Alipay stock offering, its stake in Alibaba will most likely be adjusted to reflect Alipay's value before an offering, analysts say. A sign of confidence in the deal came when last September, when an investment group that included Silver Lake Partners and DST Global agreed to pay about $1.6 billion to acquire a stake in the Alibaba Group, valuing the company at about $32 billion.
Still, the controversy over Alipay leaves open many questions, analysts say. Chief among them is who really controls Alibaba and other Chinese companies that use the V.I.E. structure - the global investors who financed the companies, or the Chinese who control the local operation.
Steven M. Dickinson, a lawyer who has worked in China for years at the United States law firm Harris & Moure, said global investors were ignoring risks. While the Chinese government may not soon move to unravel the deals, it could do so at any time, he says. And if it is to their advantage, the local Chinese owners could also dismantle the structure without approval.
"It's prohibited for foreigners to own an Internet company of any kind in China - not discouraged, but prohibited," Mr. Dickinson said. "Every lawyer agrees that if this goes to court in China, those contracts are void; they're illegal."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Gross National Happiness

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do you read fiction? Does it help? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Economy: Obama Rejects Keystone
President Obama's jobs panel urges a broadened tax base and more oil drilling. But he rejects the Keystone pipeline and instead wishes Betty White a happy birthday. CNN's Fareed Zakaria says oil prices will stay high. Andrew Sullivan says President Obama will outsmart all his critics, and Mitt Romney gives him a little help. Cullen Roche is not seeing a lot of inflation in our future. All six recovery indicators are positive for the first time since May 2011. Ed Yardeni says a strong recovery is coming. Mark Thoma explains how the Federal Reserve can prevent the next financial crisis. The Chamber of Commerce says uncertainty continues to be the biggest challenge for small businesses. Kodak files for bankruptcy.
The Data: A Good Week for Builders
Builder confidence rises for the fourth consecutive month, and the American Institute of Architects billing index is positive for the second straight month. But the residential remodeling index and housing starts (pdf) both decline. Industrial production (pdf) increases while producer prices ease. Mark Perry reports that auto plants are at capacity and the revenues of our top 500 manufacturing firms almost equal the gross domestic product of Japan (not that anyone can trust G.D.P. numbers any more). Steve Hamm suggests measuring Gross National Happiness.
The Big Story: SOPA Backlash
A bunch of major Web sites protest the SOPA/PIPA legislation. Both Sally Cohn and this video explain what's going on. This issue is so serious that even Mark Zuckerberg is tweeting about it. Two of the bill's sponsors back out and the Internet community cheers. But another sponsor calls the protests a publicity stunt. The White House does not support either bill. Pippa is upset, too.
Around the Country: New York Stories
As manufacturing activity (pdf) in the region expands, New York City's Transit Workers Union extends its Rate-My-Rat contest. A store in Chelsea is the spot to watch in 2012, and here's how one of New York's hottest co-working spaces started. The story of this 92-year-old family-run manufacturer in Queens offers hope. A new law allows wineries to ship directly to New Jersey homes. Target plans to sell goods from small-business boutiques.
Around the World: China Is Not a Threat
These countries are the economic winners and losers since 2007. Iceland is recovering from its meltdown. Former President Bill Clinton says that economic success is tied to global collaboration. His wife says, "Get me a ladder!" A breakthrough is saving lives in rural Africa. A small tech business in Pakistan tries to succeed. Google apologizes to a Kenyan start-up for its "dirty" business tactics. Britain's oldest shopkeeper retires. World manufacturing eyes its next growth market: Iraq. More than half of China's people now live in cities - and they get around on the world's largest bus. With the Chinese economy slowing more than expected, Connor Sen explains why the country poses no long-term military threat to the United States: "It's hard to imagine China sending millions of young men off to die in battle when the country will be starved for young labor within a decade."
Ideas: Doctors Are Making Rookie Mistakes
A new small-business deal siteand a new remix for Fresh Prince fans were both introduced last week. When it comes to running their own businesses, doctors are making rookie mistakes.

As Jessica Alba adds entrepreneur to her credits, a bunch of other celebrities say hello. A Mississippi sports radio start-up is booming.
Your People: Call Your Mom
Do your employees consider their jobs to be among the most stressful in America? Well, just tell them to call but not to text their mothers. Rich Mogull explains how to monitor employees without going too far:"Investigators and managers shouldn't be allowed to track everything an employee is doing and peek in whenever they want. This is where you open yourself up to legal risk or make your employees feel like they are living in a bad reality TV show." Rohit Bhargava offers three ways to inspire employees using social media - including: "There are plenty of organizations and meet-up-style events that are promoted through social media. Offer an incentive to employees to attend those events. It can be a great way for them to learn something and make new connections." Workers agree that having a wellness program encourages them to work harder and perform better.
Boss of the Week: Cliff Wilson
Learning that a potential buyer would close down his manufacturing plant, this retiring 76-year-old business owner turned down the offer and instead sold his company to his employees. Eight years later, the company is fully employee-owned and thriving.
Finance: Raising Fees Creatively
As some A.T.M. owners find new and more creative ways to raise their fees, a small California bank expands its business lending staff. A new service from Bill.com enables banks to offer business customers online accounts-payable and accounts-receivable services. A solar start-up raises $41 million. David Beisel says you know a venture capitalist is serious when he or she visits your office. A subscription service that produces and delivers hands-on activity boxes for children raises $5 million.
Technology: Windows XP Still Rules
While tablet adoption rises in the corporate world, Windows XP (not Windows 7) still rules the business desktop. Zappos says its customer database was hacked. I.B.M. announces new cloud services for social networking and collaboration. A mobile payments provider, BilltoMobile, unveils a new one-click mobile Web transaction process for making purchases with a wireless device. Lisa Braithwaite gives great advice for speaking on Skype including: "Remember: people can see you."
The Week's Bests
Things to Avoid When Raising Capital. Ashkan Karbasfrooshan warns about liquidation preferences: "The liquidation preference determines how the pie is shared in a liquidity event (M&A, I.P.O.). In a fair situation: investors get their money back before anyone else does, even though the risk-and-return trade-off would require that everyone wins or loses together. But with leverage a venture capitalist will be able to land a 1x liquidation preference; which is standard. If they ask for anything more than that, tell them to take a hike; you'll never see a return."
Way to Be Disciplined. Brett and Kate McKay offer suggestions for strengthening (and conserving) willpower, including: "Look for ways to monitor, gather data, and 'quantify' your life. Keep a food diary of what you eat each day. Weigh yourself every morning (while you may have heard weight loss gurus tell you this is a bad idea, studies have shown that those who weigh themselves daily are more successful at shedding the pounds). Use Web sites like Mint.com to keep track of your finances, and apps that track how you spend your time online. And so on. The more clear reminders you have of both your progress and your backsliding, the more likely it is you'll stay on track.
Justification for Buying a Kindle. Anne Kreamer offers the business case for reading novels: To bring the subject home, think about how many different people you interact with during the course of a given day - co-workers, clients, passing strangers, store clerks. Then think about how much effort you devoted to thinking about their emotional state or the emotional quality of your interaction. It's when we read fiction that we have the time and opportunity to think deeply about the feelings of others, really imagining the shape and flavor of alternate worlds of experience."
This Week's Question: Do you read fiction? Have any novels been meaningful to the running of your business?

HEADLINE: Free Pass for Matchmaking at a Setting in the Alps

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The sky-high corporate fees at Davos are waived for heads of state and other high-ranking government officials who are the real deal makers with each other and with industry. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- The stars of the guest list for this year's annual World Economic Forum, which begins here Wednesday, are a who's who of government leaders pulling the strings of the global economy. On the list are Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany; Timothy F. Geithner, the United States secretary of the Treasury; Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank; and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
The cost of their tickets? Nothing.
 Last year, you may recall that I wrote a column detailing the extraordinary entrance fees that corporate executives pay for the opportunity to do matchmaking in the Alps. A quick refresher: It costs a minimum of $71,000 for an individual corporate invitation. An invitation for two that includes access to private events costs $301,000. An invitation for a delegation of five, $622,000. And that's before the planes, hotels and restaurant meals.
But that column did not detail that for about 900 other individuals from the world of government, academia, nonprofit groups - and, yes, members of the media - the sky-high corporate fees also are waived. The invitation comes gratis, though all their travel and lodging costs fall to those guests.
You could argue that the more than $100 million that moguls and corporations spend to send 1,600 superconnected executives here by private plane is used to subsidize those who fly on commercial airlines. (In fairness, not every mogul flies by corporate jet: George Soros, the hedge fund manager, flew commercial. He was on my flight Sunday night.) And many public officials, of course, fly on private government planes. Mr. Geithner, for example, will be flying on a military plane.
Among those who get "comped" are often big and small nonprofit organizations and "social entrepreneurs" seeking a voice in the conversation and a chance to rub elbows with potential benefactors. People like Kumi Naidoo, the executive director of Greenpeace International, and Giorgio Jackson, the 24-year-old leader of a student movement in Santiago, Chile, that nearly paralyzed the country, are on the get-in-free list.
About 200 academics, people like the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist and co-author of "This Time is Different," are also offered free admission. And about 20 religious leaders, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana (who is said to be considered among the candidates to be the next pope), make the list.
It is a notable and noble effort by the World Economic Forum to take this multi-stakeholder approach and, in truth, it gives all kinds of people from all parts of the world a seat at the table, even if some say they are being co-opted by the "elite." (By the way, since when did elite become a pejorative term?)
Critics contend that all of the nonbusiness leaders and high-minded conversations - this year's theme is "The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models" - are a cover for the paying invitees to mingle in the halls and make deals. To some extent, that is true. There is no question that Davos is a matchmaking haven for chief executives. I know one executive who conducts more than 20 meetings a day with people from all over the globe that he said would otherwise take him three months of red-eye flights to do.
There is another, perhaps cynical, unspoken draw for the C.E.O. set paying six figures to frolic in the snow. The 40 heads of state and 90 ministers who come to the conference free of charge are, of course, the headliners, but they are also doing the real deal making behind the scenes with each other - and with industry.
For government officials, Davos has the same allure that it does for business: a series of quick-hit meetings with their counterparts. It gives executives the chance to jockey for position on the other side of the table with a government leader who could have an infrastructure project that needs financing, deals that can be worth millions if not billions of dollars. Or executives will spend weeks before arriving trying to get a 15-minute meeting with Mrs. Merkel or Ms. Lagarde in the hope of influencing the dialogue over the euro.
That may help explain why the World Economic Forum brought in $157 million in revenue last year from its members and strategic corporate partners.
In case you're curious, it spent virtually all of it: $156 million. How was it spent? The organization employs 337 full-time employees and 369 "full-time equivalents" annually that it says cost a total of about $69 million. The conferences it convenes - besides the meeting in Davos, it organizes another big event in China and four other regional events - cost about $60 million more for space, elaborate signs and furniture, meals, event planning and security. (The security costs in Davos alone are estimated to be about $8 million, which are borne by the World Economic Forum and the Swiss government.) The organization says it spent another $26 million on office costs.
Adrian Monck, head of communications for the World Economic Forum, said that because there was such a cross-section of paying invitees from all kinds of industries, nobody could skew the selection of people invited to attend free. "The funding diversity means no one is 'paying' for the people we choose to come - that's our 'editorial integrity,' " he said in an e-mail.
Money may always raise questions about events like Davos. But in the end, the event is, as Mr. Monck wrote on his blog, an effort to convene a global conversation and a reflection that "that every view must be integrated, that one cannot simply abrogate one's membership in a community. It is an old idea."

HEADLINE: The Best States to Grow Up In

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Racial and ethnic differences often undercut public support for programs that support the well-being of children, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Newborn children can't choose the states in which they grow up any more than they can choose the size of their parents' bank accounts. But voters in every state choose how much to spend on public programs benefiting children, with telling results. 
The Foundation for Child Development's new report on state-level differences in the Index of Child Well-Being - a broad quality-of-life indicator based on 25 indicators - shows enormous variation, as does another set of indicators known as Kids Count, developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. 
In states near the top of the list, like Connecticut, New Jersey and Utah, the successes have been celebrated. States in the South and Southwest generally rank lower, with New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana, Nevada and Arizona at the bottom.
Those, like Newt Gingrich, who believe, that less fortunate children lack a work ethic might point to regional differences in moral character. But evidence suggests that regional differences in willingness to pay taxes, sometimes called "tax morale," are at work.

States that rank low on the Index of Child Well-Being are those less willing to tax adults to invest in children. 
Analysis of state differences by William O'Hare, Mark Mather and Genevieve Dupuis points to the positive impact of per-pupil spending on education, higher Medicaid child-eligibility thresholds and higher levels of Temporary Assistance to Needy Children benefits on child well-being. 
Average public spending on children varies far more across states than spending on the elderly, who receive benefits primarily through the federal government. Higher state and local spending, in turn, often requires higher state and local tax rates. 
Children can't vote, so adults must vote for (and pay for) higher taxes on their behalf. Calculations of economic self-interest probably play a role. Parents currently raising children gain more directly from public spending on them. State policy makers know that investments in their future work force can pay off, yielding higher state income (and tax revenues) in the future. 
But levels of trust and concern for others also affect willingness to pay taxes, just as they affect people's willingness to contribute to charities or tithe to a church. Unfortunately, as the political scientist Robert Putnam asserts, racial and ethnic diversity tends to weaken social solidarity. 
Children are directly affected. Research by the economists Alberto Alesina, Reza Baqir and William Easterly, among others, shows that racial and ethnic diversity tend to undermine support for public spending on education and other services at the municipal level. 
Other research indicates that the causal linkages are complicated. Levels of segregation, interaction and political representation all have an impact. The political scientist Daniel Hopkins shows that a sudden change in the racial and ethnic composition of a community may have a particularly divisive effect. 
But some institutions - and political jurisdictions - do a better job of coping with these stresses than others do. Professor Putnam points to the success of policies adopted by the United States armed forces to bring recruits together and build their trust for one another. 
As a previous Foundation for Child Development report by Donald Hernandez and Suzanne E. Macartney emphasizes, immigrant children in the United States are geographically concentrated in a few states where they remain economically and socially vulnerable. The new analysis of state differences shows that African-American and Hispanic children have lower levels of well-being than white children. The higher the percentage of children in a state who are minorities, the lower the state's index of child well-being. 
But demography is not destiny. Some states with large numbers of immigrants and minority children, like New Jersey, New York and Illinois rank fairly high, while others, like Texas, Florida and California, rank quite low. 
More detailed research on the success stories among states promoting child well-being might reveal strategic innovations in efforts to overcome differences and build strong political coalitions. 
We need a strong care ethic as well as a strong work ethic. Both can strengthen tax morale and lead to public investments that make children happier, healthier and more productive in their future jobs.

HEADLINE: On Super Bowls, Elections and Stock Prices

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: While the old Super Bowl theory of the stock market no longer seems to work, there is an election-year correlation that might be worth noting if the game is not close. 

 BODY:
If the Super Bowl game in two weeks is not close, Barack Obama may be in trouble when November rolls around. On the other hand, a close game would give him a better-than-even chance of winning the election.
That, anyway, is the result of my efforts today to find some relationship between election-year football games and November election results. I'll explain why later.
Of course, there used to be a theory that held that the Super Bowl could forecast the stock market. That worked really well for a couple of decades. Since then, it has been useless.
Before we get to those examples of spurious correlation, let me note one fact about the game coming up. If the New York Giants win, they will be the worst team ever (as measured by regular season records) to win. As it is, they appear to be the worst team ever to get into the game.

They finished the regular season with 9 wins and 7 losses.
Two other teams with a record that bad made it to the final game. They lost.
In 1980, the Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4) beat the Los Angeles Rams (9-7) by a score of 31-19.
In 2009, Pittsburgh (12-4) beat the Arizona Cardinals (9-7), by 27-23.
Each of those losers had managed to outscore their opponents during the regular season, although the Cardinals did so by a one-point margin. The 2011 Giants gave up 400 points during the regular season while scoring 394 points.
Three 10-6 teams have won, the most recent being the Green Bay Packers a year ago. The others were the Giants in 2008 and the San Francisco 49ers in 1989.
Over all, the best team (as measured by regular season record) has won 25 and lost 13. The other seven games involved teams with identical regular season records.
But of the last six Super Bowls, the (regular season) better team won only one. That was the Pittsburgh victory in 2009.
There is a case that election-year history favors the Giants. In election years, a team from the old National Football League has won the Super Bowl nine times, the most recent being the Giants four years ago. The Pittsburgh Steelers, an old N.F.L. team now in the American Football Conference, won two of the nine, in 1976 and 1980. Only two teams from the old American Football League have won in election years -- the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984 and the New England Patriots in 2004. The Republicans won both those elections.
There used to be a theory that the winner of the Super Bowl foretold how the stock market would do. If an old N.F.L. team won, the market would rise. If an old A.F.L. team won, the market would fall.
Of course, the theory was developed and tweaked based on early Super Bowls, including the decision to count Pittsburgh as being an old N.F.L. team, rather than as a representative of the A.F.C. But it kept working even after that, and it developed a real following on Wall Street.
From 1967, the year Green Bay (old N.F.L.) won the first Super Bowl, through 1989, when the San Francisco 49ers (N.F.L.) won, the market was up after all 16 old-N.F.L. teams won, and down six of seven times after old A.F.L. teams prevailed. The only time it failed was after the Oakland Raiders won in 1984, and that year the S.&P. 500 rose just 1.4 percent.
Since then, the theory has forecast the market correctly 11 times, while getting it wrong 10 times. (I am not counting 2003, when Tampa Bay won. That team came into the league after the merger, first joining the A.F.C. and then moving to the N.F.C. It is not clear what the theory would have forecast that year. If you go by the idea that the team was first in the A.F.C., and therefore that its victory was a bearish indicator, that was another loss for the theory. Stocks soared in 2003.)
The Giants' victory in 2008 was followed by the worst year for stocks since 1931, before there was an N.F.L. championship game.
I searched for evidence that the Super Bowl result somehow forecasts the presidential election. And I found a relationship, which proves that if you try hard enough, you can almost always find some correlation.
Here it is:
If the game is a runaway, the Republicans will win in November.
Of the 11 election-year Super Bowls so far, the Democrats are 4-3 when the game was decided by less than 14 points. But when the game was not close, the Republicans won all four times. The last such romp was in 1988.

HEADLINE: Romney Warns of 'October Surprises' if Gingrich Is Nominee

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney raised the possibility that Newt Gingrich might have broken laws in representing corporate interests. 

 BODY:
TAMPA -- Mitt Romney raised the possibility that Newt Gingrich might have broken laws in representing corporate interests and warned of politically damaging "October surprises" if Mr. Gingrich became the Republican presidential nominee. 
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Florida residents who have lost their homes and businesses, Mr. Romney demanded that Mr. Gingrich release all documents related to his work for Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, and other clients.
"Let's see what they show; let's see who his clients were," Mr. Romney said, pointing specifically to work Mr. Gingrich did on behalf of health care companies. "That could represent not just evidence of lobbying, but potentially wrongful activity of some kind."
Mr. Romney did not elaborate about what illegal activity he suspected. And a spokesman for Mr. Romney declined to say whether Mr. Romney had specific knowledge about "wrongdoing" by Mr. Gingrich.
"We won't know until they release records," said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser for the campaign. "We'll find out once he releases those documents. I don't think we'll know until he comes clean."
Mr. Romney also demanded that Mr. Gingrich return the $1.7 million that he was paid by Freddie Mac, citing comments that Mr. Gingrich made during a debate last year that people who profited from the mortgage giant should give the money back.
And Mr. Romney repeated his concern that Mr. Gingrich had a record in public life that was "highly erratic." 
"He's gone from pillar to post, almost like a pinball machine, from item to item, in a way which is highly erratic and does not suggest a stable, thoughtful course, which is normally associated with leadership," Mr. Romney said.
The aggressive attacks on Mr. Gingrich come as Mr. Romney's campaign sought to take the offensive after weeks in which he has been in a defensive crouch over his work at Bain Capital and his hesitance to release his personal tax returns.
Speaking on ABC's "Good Morning America" before Mr. Romney's remarks in Tampa, Mr. Gingrich insisted again that he had "done no lobbying work" for the mortgage institution and he accused Mr. Romney of lying.
"I did no lobbying, period," Mr. Gingrich said. "It's not true. He knows it's not true. He is deliberately saying things he knows are false. I just think that's what the next week will be like."
But Mr. Gingrich called on the consulting organization he once led to release records about his work for Freddie Mac.
"I think it would be very helpful and our attorneys are talking with the company," Mr. Gingrich said on ABC. "You know I left the company, so it's their decision and Nancy Desmond, the president of the company, has to make the decision. But I'd be very comfortable releasing them."
That is not likely to be good enough for Mr. Romney, who insisted that Mr. Gingrich was a lobbyist in spite of his denials.
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck," Mr. Romney said. "We just need to understand what his activity has been over the last 15 years and make sure it's conformed with all the regulations that might exist."
Mr. Romney's decision to focus on Mr. Gingrich's work at Freddie Mac is also an attempt to tie Mr. Gingrich to the biggest economic crisis in Florida. On Monday morning, Mr. Romney convened a sober discussion about the housing crisis that is crushing this state.
The discussion with eight Florida residents who have lost their jobs and homes put human faces on those statistics, with several of the people around a small, round table telling Mr. Romney that they had lost their homes and businesses while they struggled to stay employed.
"I'm going to be living in my home until I get kicked out," said Candice Tammey, a Tampa resident. "I'm able to pay my utilities. But it's very discouraging. The system is not working for the people who really need it."
Mr. Romney said at the discussion that nearly one quarter of all the homes in foreclosure in the country were in Florida. He called the situation for those around the table "tragic, tragic. Just tragic." 
"It will get better," Mr. Romney promised Ms. Tammey. "It won't always be like this. This is a detour."
He added, "We've seen signs of improvement before only to drop back down" and said that if elected president, "I will care very deeply about getting it better very quickly."
Mr. Romney's campaign also said they planned to release its first negative television ad in Florida on Monday. The ad will say that Mr. Gingrich "cashed in" while Florida families suffered through the housing crisis, according to the campaign.
The campaign announced the ad during a conference call in which Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota and a backer of Mr. Romney, repeatedly bashed Mr. Gingrich as an "influence peddler" in Washington.
"Newt Gingrich has spent almost his entire adult life as a member of Congress or someone who has been an influence peddler," Mr. Pawlenty told reporters. "The notion that he was paid $1.7 million as a historian for Freddie Mac is just B.S. I mean it's just nonsense."
Mr. Pawlenty described Mr. Gingrich as someone who has "so many questionable and unfortunate activities." And he demanded more transparency from Mr. Gingrich about his years after he left office.
"To say that he wasn't a lobbyist is incredible hair splitting," Mr. Pawlenty said.
Gingrich Responds
At a rally outside of Tampa, Mr. Gingrich responded to Mr. Romney's attacks by repeatedly calling him a "desperate" candidate who will say anything to try and recover his footing.
"If you've been campaigning for six years and you begin to see it slip away, you get desperate," Mr. Gingrich said of Mr. Romney. "And when you get desperate, you say almost anything."
To the specifics of Mr. Romney's attacks, Mr. Gingrich called them "baloney."
"It used to be pious baloney, but now it's desperate baloney," Mr. Gingrich said, dismissing the accusations. "Pretty soon he'll be able to open a delicatessen.''
Mr. Gingrich predicted that Mr. Romney would reprise his attacks at the debate Monday night, and he promised to be ready for whatever comes his way.
"I've been memorizing old phrases like 'there you go again,'" Mr. Gingrich said, referring to a famous debate quip once used by Ronald Reagan. "I'm thinking maybe I'll finally convince him I'm a Reaganite."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Senate Candidates Look to Limit Outside Advertising

BYLINE: ABBY GOODNOUGH and JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Massachusetts Senate candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren on Monday morning agreed to try to limit third-party advertisers from weighing in on their race. 

 BODY:
9:45 p.m. | Updated BOSTON - Senator Scott P. Brown and Elizabeth Warren, his likely Democratic opponent, agreed Monday on a plan to try to stop outside groups from running attack ads in their high-profile, high-stakes race. But while they labored over a mutually acceptable agreement, the hardest part - trying to enforce it - comes now. 
The agreement requires each side to donate to a charity of the other's choosing whenever a third-party ad is aired supporting them or attacking their opponent. Both parties will also sign letters to outside groups and to television station managers, calling on them to stop running ads in the race.
But Brett Kappel, an election lawyer at the firm Arent Fox, said there was "zero" chance that all such groups would comply, no matter how much pressure Mr. Brown and Ms. Warren exert. 
"There just isn't much they can do legally to put a stop to it," Mr. Kappel said in an e-mail, adding that "people who want to affect the outcome of this race will do what they want, regardless of what the candidates would prefer." 
Mr. Kappel also predicted that television stations, which reap the financial benefits of outside advertising, would not go along with the plan. "Even if they didn't have an economic incentive," he said, "they wouldn't want to be accused of being a censor for one or both campaigns." 
The agreement came after more than a week of tense correspondence between the two candidates over the issue, including a meeting between campaign aides on Friday that failed to produce a final plan. Mr. Brown, who is seeking his first full term after winning a special election for the seat in 2010, was the first to propose a ban on third-party advertising, saying that third-party ads "spend millions of dollars from anonymous donors portraying their opposition unfairly and misleading voters." 
Ms. Warren quickly agreed to call for an end to such ads, but the two sides haggled over how to put teeth in their agreement. On Friday, Ms. Warren said Mr. Brown's proposal had "loopholes that Karl Rove could drive a tank through." Mr. Rove, the Republican strategist, helped found a "super PAC," American Crossroads, whose affiliate, Crossroads GPS, has already spent more than $1 million on ads attacking Ms. Warren.
At the same time, two outside groups -- the League of Women Voters and the League of Conservation Voters - have spent about $2 million on ads attacking Mr. Brown's environmental record. 
On Monday, Navin Nayak, senior vice president of campaigns for the League of Conservation Voters, said his group would try to comply with the plan. "While we cannot take direction from any candidate on our independent activities," Mr. Nayak said in a statement, "we are inclined to respect the People's Pledge agreed to by Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown." 
The League of Women Voters was more noncommittal, with its national president, Elisabeth MacNamara, saying in a statement that the ads it ran about Mr. Brown's environmental record in April 2011 were "not in support or opposition of any candidate but in support of the Clean Air Act."
 "The only votes we are interested in influencing are the votes in Congress," Ms. MacNamara said.
Steven Law, president and CEO of American Crossroads, said that because the agreement still allowed union phone banks, direct mail advertising and get-out-the-vote operations, the agreement had "loopholes the Teamsters could drive a truck though, the longshoremen could steer a ship through, the machinists could fit a plane through, and government unions could drive forklifts of paperwork through." 
Another independent group, which is called Rethink Brown and aims, according to its Web site, to "encourage Massachusetts voters to make up their own minds about U.S. Senator Scott Brown's actual record and potentially `rethink' their initial opinions about him," said it would suspend its advertising in the race, "provided that other third parties do the same." The group said in a statement that it would get out its message through the internet and the news media instead.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Releases a Freddie Mac Contract With Few Details

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL and MIKE MCINTIRE


HIGHLIGHT: The contract covers one year, 2006, and paid the Gingrich Group $300,000. 

 BODY:
8:45 p.m. | Updated TAMPA, Fla. -- It was the Big Reveal that showed almost nothing.
After Mitt Romney repeatedly challenged him to release documents relating to his work for Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage giant, Newt Gingrich released a contract that is mostly legal boilerplate, and contains no details about the advice he gave or ways in which he would make use of his expertise or political contacts.
But the yearlong contract did show that Mr. Gingrich was hired by the division of Freddie Mac responsible for lobbying -- its office of public policy, which paid the Gingrich Group $300,000 for 2006. 
And the agreement spelled out the expected services in a single sentence: "Consultant will provide consulting and related services as required by Freddie Mac's director, public policy.'' 
At least one clause implies that more detailed records were submitted as part of Mr. Gingrich's consultancy. A provision in the "compensation" section of the contract required Mr. Gingrich to submit a "detailed description of the services performed during the prior month" on the 15th of every month. His payment was contingent upon receiving those invoices. Those invoices were not made available Monday.
Mr. Gingrich worked for Freddie Mac on and off over a six-year period, from 1999 to 2006. The contract released on Monday evening was for only part of this span. 
The director of public policy whom Mr. Gingrich worked with at Freddie Mac during this period was Craig Thomas, a registered lobbyist whose role included pressuring lawmakers, according to The Washington Examiner. 
Absent from Mr. Gingrich's Freddie Mac contract is any specific prohibition against lobbying, which can be found in some of his other consulting agreements. For instance, a contract he had with a plastics company in 2001 described the consulting services he would perform, and included this caveat: "It is further acknowledged and agreed by company that consultant does not provide lobbying services of any kind or participate in lobbying activities."
The release of the contract is unlikely to end the controversy over Mr. Gingrich's work for Freddie Mac. 
After stating in the debate on Monday night that he merely advised Freddie Mac as a "historian,'' Mr. Gingrich was widely mocked, but he has continued to state that he was not a lobbyist, which is technically correct since he was not registered under federal law.
Mr. Romney has said the work was lobbying in all but name and he has pressed Mr. Gingrich to be more specific about what he did for the agency, which many conservatives blame as the key cause of the housing bubble that led to the financial crisis. Mr. Gingrich has said he advised Freddie Mac that its support of subprime mortgages was "insane" and was inflating the housing bubble. 
Mr. Gingrich has said for the past couple of weeks that he would be fine with having his contracts with Freddie Mac released but did not have ultimate authority because he had given up operational control of the company once he entered the nomination race. 
An investigation by The Times last year cited five officials who worked with Mr. Gingrich at the agency, who said he never gave such advice. Instead, they described him as being enlisted to help push back against conservatives who wanted to dismantle Freddie Mac. At another point he addressed donors to a Freddie Mac political action committee.
The issue is likely to be a key one in tonight's debate and in the Florida primary because the state is suffering under a severe collapse in housing prices.

HEADLINE: Tampa, Fla., Debate Fact-Check

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements made by the Republican presidential candidates in Thursday night's debate. 

 BODY:
Santorum and Terri Schiavo
Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, was asked about his involvement in the case of Terri Schiavo, the young Florida woman who suffered brain damage in 1990. After her husband filed a petition to remove her feeding tube, a state court ruled in 2000 that she was in a persistent vegetative state. Her feeding tube was removed but then reinserted after her parents appealed the ruling.
After the tube was removed once again, Congress intervened in 2005, enacting a law allowing for the parents' case to be heard in federal court. 
Tonight, Mr. Santorum said he "didn't call for Congressional intervention, I called for a judicial hearing" to review a case in which the parents, who were constituents of his from Pennsylvania, and Ms. Schiavo's husband were on different sides.
But a New York Times Magazine article in May 2005 about Mr. Santorum said he "not only pushed the Senate to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, but he also traveled to Florida and prayed with her parents."
- 
Rate of Illegal Immigration 
Rick Santorum said the rate of illegal immigration in the United States was dropping.
That is correct. Illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America has dropped sharply in recent years.
In 2010, the number of apprehensions by the Border Patrol along the Southwest border dropped to 448,000, the lowest number since 1972, and a decline of 35 percent in the two years since President Obama took office, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
The decline under the Obama administration accelerated a drop in border apprehensions that began under President George W. Bush. Since 2005, apprehensions at the Mexican border are down 61 percent. The apprehensions figure is widely accepted as a rough guide to the number of immigrants crossing illegally.
The Mexican census has reported a sharp drop since 2008 in the number of Mexican migrants leaving Mexico. During the Obama administration, the population of illegal immigrants from Mexico living in the United States has dropped by about 500,000, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.

Dodd-Frank and Small Banks
In condemning the new Dodd-Frank law tightening regulation of the financial sector, Mitt Romney cited the law's negative effect on smaller community banks in particular. But lobbyists won exemptions for community banks from many if not most of the Dodd-Frank limitations on banking. A top lobbyist for the sector publicly described the legislation as beneficial for smaller banks because it leveled the playing field with bigger banks and set a limit on their size.

American Presence in the Persian Gulf
If there has been one major theme to the foreign-policy debate among the Republican candidates, it has been a race to show who -- save for Representative Ron Paul -- can get tougher on Iran and its suspected nuclear weapons program.
But it is possible that President Obama already has a tougher plan in place in the Persian Gulf than Mitt Romney is imagining. He said that to counter the Iranian threat, "we ought to have an aircraft carrier in the gulf.'' 
In fact, White House and Pentagon officials say they keep an average of 1.8 carriers in the gulf at any one time now -- that allows one to go off station periodically -- and have built up antimissile defenses around Iran.
- 
Size of the U.S. Navy
Mr. Romney repeated a statement he has made before, and it is still wrong, or misleading at best. "Our Navy is now smaller than at any time since 1917," he said.
Nonpartisan fact checkers at PolitiFact have described the claim as "pants on fire" wrong, calling it "a statement that, despite being close to accurate in its numbers, uses those numbers in service of a ridiculous point."
In a lengthy explanation, PolitiFact concluded: "A wide range of experts told us it's wrong to assume that a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. Quite the contrary: The United States is the world's unquestioned military leader today, not just because of the number of ships and aircraft in its arsenal but also because each is stocked with top-of-the-line technology and highly trained personnel. Thanks to the development of everything from nuclear weapons to drones, comparing today's military to that of 60 to 100 years ago presents an egregious comparison of apples and oranges."
Moreover, given the long lead times for major military acquisitions, if the Navy or other military services were woefully small, that development would have begun long before Mr. Obama took office.
- 
Gingrich as Lobbyist
Newt Gingrich repeated once again that he was never a lobbyist. 
It is true that Mr. Gingrich never registered as a lobbyist at the federal or state level. But he did many of the same things lobbyists do, including meeting with state lawmakers, members of Congress and federal officials to promote issues important to companies that were paying his consulting firm as much as $200,000 a year.
In at least two states, Georgia and Florida, Mr. Gingrich pitched the services of his clients to legislators who were considering changes to state health care laws. Records from his firm, the Center for Health Transformation, show that he also talked to federal health officials about projects that two of his clients, I.B.M. and HealthTrio, were working on, and he urged members of Congress to approve changes to Medicare that would benefit other companies that were paying him.
His dealings with Novo Nordisk, a drug maker, show how his work could easily be viewed as lobbying. Novo, a Danish company, paid Mr. Gingrich to help expand the market for its diabetes treatments in the United States. A spokesman for the company said Mr. Gingrich did no lobbying, and provided only "guidance and strategic advice."
But in its annual report to shareholders, Novo Nordisk offered a different take. It listed Mr. Gingrich's work for the company under the category of public policy activities, noting, "Such activities are often referred to as lobbying.''

Santorum's Loss in 2006
Mr. Santorum said that when he lost his re-election bid for the Senate from Pennsylvania in 2006 - by 18 percentage points - it was a "meltdown" year for Republicans and that at least he "stood tall for what I believed in."
It was a bad year for Republicans, but Mr. Santorum omitted at least one factor in his loss that infuriated conservative voters: he had endorsed Senator Arlen Specter, then a Republican, for re-election in the 2004 Republican primary over a conservative, Pat Toomey.
Mr. Santorum has said he supported Mr. Specter because Mr. Specter, who supported abortion rights, had agreed to support President George W. Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court. Mr. Specter has said there was no such agreement.
- 
Romney's Inheritance 
Mr. Romney said at one point that he and his wife Ann did not inherit their wealth from his parents.
This is not entirely accurate, according to Mr. Romney's previous remarks on the topic.
In an interview with C-Span in March 2006, Mr. Romney said that upon the death of his father, George, the wealthy former chief executive of American Motors, he received an inheritance. But he quickly donated the money to Brigham Young University, he said. (The younger Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, attended the college, which is tied to the Mormon Church.)
"I did get a check from my dad when he passed away," Mr. Romney told Brian Lamb during the interview. "I shouldn't say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad.
"But I turned and gave that away to charity," Mr. Romney said. "In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor, the George W. Romney School of Public Management."
Mr. Romney continued: "And as an institute of public management, it helps young people learn about government and about serving in public service. And that's where his inheritance ended up."
Even so, Mr. Romney benefited heavily from his father's wealth: he relied on George Romney for a loan that he used to buy his first home, in Belmont, Mass., for $42,000.
- 
Gingrich on Leaving the House
Mr. Gingrich made it sound as if he left the speakership out of a simple desire to do something else. As Mr. Romney pointed out a moment later, Mr. Gingrich had to resign in disgrace. Mr. Romney was right.
The proximate cause of his departure was that House Republicans, under Mr. Gingrich's leadership, suffered unexpectedly big losses in the 1998 midterm elections.
But his own conservative troops had turned against him a couple of years earlier, saying that he had gone along with President Bill Clinton in spending too much money and not reining in taxes. Mr. Gingrich's ouster created chaos in the House and the party.

HEADLINE: S.B.A. Readying Program to Invest in Start-Ups

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: For all of the different kinds of financing a small company can obtain from the S.B.A., the agency has not had a way to nurture fast-growing start-ups since 2004. 

 BODY:
With its legislative agenda for job creation stuck for the foreseeable future, the Obama administration has turned inward, looking to the federal bureaucracy for new ways to jump-start the economy.
Lately its gaze has settled on the Small Business Administration. Yes, it has proposed merging the S.B.A. into a much bigger government agency dedicated to business and trade. But an arguably more consequential decision came in December, when the S.B.A. unveiled a new $1 billion program to invest in young companies by loaning money to venture capital funds. Unlike the reorganization, which faces long odds in coming to pass, the new investment program, part of the administration's Startup America campaign, is likely to commence this spring. But what remains unclear is whether it can win over the venture capital industry that it is meant to assist.
The new program would allow venture funds licensed by the S.B.A., known as small-business investment companies, to borrow money from the agency to augment the capital they have raised from private investors. A successful fund that borrows money generates higher returns for investors when it sells those stakes, since the lenders don't share in the profits. Companies seeking financing would not contact the S.B.A. directly, but instead - as with any venture financing - would approach the small-business investment company, which would judge prospects on the strength of their business plan and management.
The new effort, christened the Early Stage Innovation Fund, fills a gap in the S.B.A.'s menu of assistance. For all of the different kinds of financing a small company can obtain from the S.B.A., the agency has not had a way to nurture fast-growing start-ups since 2004. That earlier program, which allowed small-business investment companies to essentially sell equity stakes in their portfolio companies to the agency, collapsed with big losses in the wake of the tech bubble a decade ago. The program's complex terms, set by Congress, ensured its failure, said Brett Palmer, president of the Small Business Investor Alliance, a trade association for the investment companies. When a fund went belly-up, the government's claim took priority for recovering assets, alienating other investors. However, the government saw very little of the profits on successful investments.
"The taxpayer had too much downside risk and not enough upside risk," said Mr. Palmer. "It was overly complicated so nobody really understood how it worked, candidly. It still has people baffled."
The new fund is more straightforward, and is an in fact a variation on another, much more successful, S.B.A. program, in which the investment companies loan the money they've borrowed from the S.B.A. to their portfolio companies. But investment companies can seldom reach the youngest start-ups, because these businesses often lack the cash flow required to make the quarterly interest payments, so the agency has tweaked the rules for the Early Stage Innovation Fund to make it easier for venture funds to use debt to buy equity.
The S.B.A. plans to use the Innovation Fund to channel investment into growth companies normally overlooked by venture capital funds. It turns out there is a gap in the venture economy that mirrors the agency's own: venture funds typically invest in more established companies. In the first nine months of 2011, they reported directing just $727 million to companies in the so-called "seed" or conceptual stage, or 3 percent of the total $21 billion invested in the period, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Early-stage companies, usually those still testing a product or service, received $6 billion, just over a quarter of the total. At least half of the investments venture funds participating in this program make must be in companies without positive cash flow from operations.
Moreover, nearly three-quarters of venture financings go to companies in just three states: California, Massachusetts and New York, said Sean Greene, the S.B.A.'s associate administrator for investment and special adviser for innovation "There are places all over the country - Raleigh-Durham, Minneapolis, Austin - where there already is a big innovation ecosystem and there are already funds that are investing in those ecosystems," Mr. Greene said. "But those firms are facing great challenges raising capital right now." The new fund "will have a significant impact on the seed investment activity in the other 47 states."
Mr. Greene said the S.B.A. had taken steps to minimize taxpayer risk in the new fund. Leverage is limited to the amount of private capital a fund has raised, up to $50 million. (In the regular S.B.I.C. program, the limit is three times the investment capital, up to $150 million.) A fund must also raise at least $20 million privately. In effect, then, only between four and 10 funds can participate in any year.
But Mr. Palmer said that could create other problems. "It's a question of whether this innovation fund is too small to gather enough attention from the players who would invest in such a fund," he said. "The limited partner community is very cautious - they really want to do a deep dive before they put their money into any investment class. Is it worth limited partners' time to learn about the new product for which there may only be four or five funds, and of which they'd only be a fraction of each?"
Clay Thorp, of Hatteras Venture Partners in Durham, N.C., said that the poor track record of the S.B.A.'s earlier program could make investors wary of the new one. But, he added, "the changes they've made answer a lot of problems from the prior program. I think there really needs to be an education program for the limited-partner community and others about why this program is better. And the S.B.A. is doing that."
One concern that remains, Mr. Thorp said, is that the new program, like the old, is "a debt structure underneath an equity fund" - an inherent mismatch, since interest and debt payments are predictable while an equity investment is anything but. "The perfect policy would have been an equity program where the S.B.A. would be a limited partner in the S.B.I.C. fund." But Mr. Thorpe acknowledged there is little appetite in Washington for something so ambitious - and risky. "Within the constraints that they have, they've done the very best that they can."
That, he added, may be good enough for his own fund. "The way they've modified the program makes it much more attractive to early-stage venture capital groups like Hatteras, and we'll continue to evaluate whether this might be a program for us," he said.
Mr. Greene said that the S.B.A. hoped to solicit applications from investment companies in April and issue its first licenses by the end of September.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faulted Over Pay at Rescued Firms

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Federal auditors said that the government failed to rein in executive compensation at the biggest companies it bailed out during the financial crisis because its main concern was simply getting its money back. 
Months after the emergency rescues began in the fall of 2008, the Obama administration announced pay caps of $500,000 for executives of seven companies that received major assistance from the taxpayers. Congress then passed a law requiring the Treasury to establish a special master to administer the cap and other new compensation rules for those that received the most money from the Trouble Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
Though Kenneth Feinberg, the special master, had been appointed to oversee the pay, a report released early Tuesday said that he had been pressured by both the companies and the Treasury to get around the caps.
Forty-nine people received packages worth $5 million or more from 2009 to 2011, according to the report.
Two of the seven companies that were singled out, Bank of America and Citigroup, were so eager to avoid the pay caps that they paid back their bailout money long before anyone expected them to be able to.
The other five companies were the American International Group, Chrysler, Chrysler Financial, General Motors and Ally Financial, which was formerly the General Motors Acceptance Corporation.
Negotiators for the companies told Mr. Feinberg that their top people needed big cash salaries, or at least payment in stock that could be sold right away. Otherwise they would quit, the argument went, harming the companies' profitability and the likelihood they could ever pay back the government.
In one bargaining session, the chief executive of Ally Financial offered the example of an employee making $1.5 million, with $1 million of it in cash.
''This individual is in their early 40s, with two kids in private school, who is now considered cash poor,'' Ally's chief explained, adding that such people ''would not meet their monthly expenses'' if the new rules were followed.
A.I.G., G.M. and Ally still collectively owe the taxpayers about $87 billion.
''Under conflicting principles and pressures,'' Mr. Feinberg approved multimillion-dollar packages for many executives, the audit said. Mr. Feinberg developed a system for approving or rejecting the requests.

HEADLINE: Chesapeake to Cut Number of Gas Rigs

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Chesapeake Energy, the nation's second biggest natural gas producer, announced Monday that it would cut production of gas in response to plummeting prices.
The announcement was not unexpected, and it followed a trend that has been under way for several months: oil and gas companies have been transferring drilling rigs to oil fields from natural gas fields. But given that Chesapeake has been the industry's most public champion of natural gas, its announcement of an 8 percent cut in daily production led to a substantial rally in gas prices that had fallen last week to their lowest level in a decade.
Natural gas prices have been steadily falling over the last two years because of a glut stemming from mushrooming production in shale fields like the Haynesville in Louisiana, the Barnett in Texas and the Marcellus in Pennsylvania. Warm weather so far this winter has also cut normal seasonal demand significantly. 
Aubrey K. McClendon, Chesapeake's chief executive, said in a statement, ''We have committed to cut our dry gas drilling to bare minimum levels.''
The company, based in Oklahoma City, said it would reallocate its investments from natural gas drilling to fields that are rich in oil and other hydrocarbon liquids like ethane, butane and propane, which are used as feedstocks for refining gasoline, diesel, heating and petrochemicals. Those fields are mainly in Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming.
Oil prices have remained strong the last two years because of instability in the Middle East and North Africa and growing demand in China and other developing countries. Since natural gas is not easily exported, prices in the United States are not tied to natural gas prices in Europe and Asia, which are still high.
Chesapeake, which has been responsible for almost a tenth of national gas output, said it would cut spending on drilling gas wells to $900 million in 2012 from $3.1 billion last year. The company said it would idle half of its drilling rigs in the next several months in fields that produce gas but no oil or hydrocarbon liquids.
The announcement showed that the oil industry does not know what to do with all the gas it is able to produce in shale fields, which were considered almost useless until a decade ago when new production techniques, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, were first employed in a major way.
''This is a sign that the low price of gas has changed expectations for at least the next three to five years,'' said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research, a consultancy. ''If they thought the price would recover in a year or so, they would keep drilling.''
The Energy Department released a report on Monday predicting that shale gas production would increase to 13.6 trillion cubic feet in 2035, or 49 percent of total domestic natural production, from 5 trillion cubic feet in 2010, or 23 percent.
Gas futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied by almost 8 percent on Monday. Chesapeake shares rose by $1.32 to close at $22.28.
Halliburton, a leading service provider to oil and gas producers, warned last week that the slump in natural gas drilling could cause disruptions in its first-quarter operations and earnings. But the company said it expected that the shift to oil drilling from gas would not hurt its earnings over the year.
''We are very optimistic about 2012 and fully expect that North American revenue and operating income will increase over 2011,'' said Dave J. Lesar, Halliburton's chief executive, in a conference call.

HEADLINE: Europe and U.S. Tighten Vise of Sanctions on Iran

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and ALAN COWELL; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels, and Alan Cowell from London. Reporting was contributed by Michael Schwirtz from Moscow, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, and Steven Lee Myers and Brian Knowlton from Washington.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Monday to impose a phased ban on oil purchases from Iran that officials said was needed to help force a shift in policy and avert the risk of military strikes against Tehran, as the United States expanded its sanctions to include the country's third-largest bank.
European Union countries will not sign new oil contracts with Iran and will end existing ones by July 1, foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said in a statement. The ban will cover imports of crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products. It will also cover the export of major equipment and technology for the sector. The European market accounts for about a fifth of Iran's oil exports. 
''To avoid any military solution, which could have irreparable consequences, we have decided to go further down the path of sanctions,'' Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, told reporters. ''It is a good decision that sends a strong message and which I hope will persuade Iran that it must change its position, change its line and accept the dialogue that we propose.''
The decision, while significant for the numbers of countries it encompasses, will do nothing to stop the flow of oil to Asia, a much larger market for Iran. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, Iran's top export destinations in 2010 included China, with 20 percent of exports; Japan, with 17 percent; India, with 16 percent; and South Korea, with 9 percent. Europe's biggest importer was Italy, with 10 percent.
The American move targeted Bank Tejarat, the 23rd financial institution in Iran now subject to American sanctions, even as the Obama administration considered including the country's central bank in its restrictions.
''At a time when banks around the world are cutting off Iran and its currency is depreciating rapidly, today's action against Bank Tejarat strikes at one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system,'' the Treasury under secretary for terrorism, David S. Cohen, said in a statement. ''Today's sanction against Bank Tejarat will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous, and further impair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program.''
The European ministers said the assets of the Iranian central bank within the European Union would be frozen, with limited exemptions to permit the continuation of legitimate trade, the ministers' statement said. ''Trade in gold, precious metals and diamonds with Iranian public bodies and the central bank will no more be permitted, nor will the delivery of Iranian-denominated bank notes and coinage to the Iranian central bank,'' the statement said.
The European measures include a plan to review the economic impact of the oil ban on certain ailing European Union members, notably Greece and Italy. But officials said such a review would do no more than possibly delay sanctions in certain areas.
Western politicians believe Iran is building a nuclear weapons capability, but the government in Tehran insists that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Amid the heightened tensions over the standoff, Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic corridor for Western energy supplies. Two Iranian lawmakers repeated that threat on Monday.
European diplomats said tougher sanctions were their best hope of reducing the risk of a military strike against Iran, probably by Israel. Israel has publicly agreed that sufficiently tough sanctions could force an economically shaky Iran to comply with international demands to curtail its nuclear program.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called the new sanctions a ''step in the right direction.''
''True, it is still impossible to know what the result of these sanctions will be,'' Mr. Netanyahu said. ''Very strong and quick pressure on Iran is necessary. Sanctions will have to be evaluated on the basis of results.''
In a statement, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel; and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, described the measures as ''an unprecedented package of sanctions on Iran.''
''Iran has so far had no regard for its international obligations and is already exporting and threatening violence around its region,'' the statement said. ''Until Iran comes to the table,'' the three leaders added, ''we will be united behind strong measures to undermine the regime's ability to fund its nuclear program.''
American officials welcomed the decision in Brussels.
''The measures agreed to today by the E.U. Foreign Affairs Council are another strong step in the international effort to dramatically increase the pressure on Iran,'' said a statement released by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''This new, concerted pressure will sharpen the choice for Iran's leaders and increase their cost of defiance of basic international obligations,'' they added.
But the reaction from Moscow was critical. ''In essence this is an attempt to strangle an entire sector of the Iranian economy,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ''It is clear that this is pressure, diktat, an attempt to punish Iran for intractable behavior. As we have told our European partners before, this is a mistaken policy. Under this kind of pressure, Iran will not agree to any kind of concessions or change in its policies.''
In a separate statement, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that ''we have continued hope that negotiations will be resumed soon.''

HEADLINE: Travel Hiring Is on the Rise

BYLINE: By HARRIET EDLESON

 BODY:
As the economy has begun to improve from its darkest days in late 2008 and 2009, hiring in the travel and tourism industry has become one of the bright spots.
The industry -- which includes hotels, rental cars, airlines and entertainment -- shed jobs quickly as the economy spiraled downward. But in the last year or so, travel businesses have begun to hire again, albeit slowly and cautiously.
''Clearly, the travel and tourism industry suffered pretty heavily during the downturn,'' said Adrian Cooper, chief executive of Oxford Economics, a London-based economic forecasting consultant with offices in New York. ''Now we're seeing an improvement in jobs in travel and tourism. It's one of the healthiest sectors in the United States, and down the supply chain. There is still some ways to go, getting back to the peak in 2007.'' 
But, he added, ''we see it outpace other sectors.''
One beneficiary has been Maria Sutherland, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, who has lost two jobs in the retail fashion business in the last two years. ''I needed something where I was going to be secure,'' Ms. Sutherland, 23, said.
So in September, after losing her second job when a retail store closed, she applied for the job of ''insider'' at the W Hotel in Union Square, to help guests secure hard-to-get restaurant reservations or theater tickets. In early December, she got good news. ''I was ecstatic,'' she said.
In the first half of 2011, the travel industry added 16,000 jobs a month, on average, though that slowed to an average 2,000 new jobs a month from July to November, said David Huether, senior vice president for economics and research for the U.S. Travel Association. Total employment reached a low of 7.3 million jobs in December 2009, and since then the travel and tourism industry has gained 224,000 jobs.
Two factors drive travel jobs, Mr. Huether said. International travelers to the United States support one of every eight travel jobs, while domestic travel supports the rest.
Even with the early signs of a recovery in the industry, said Henry H. Harteveldt, co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, an airline and travel industry analyst based in San Francisco, ''it's been a very tentative recovery marked by a lot of financial and organizational discipline'' by employers.
As to the travelers themselves, ''travel is very opportunistic,'' he said. ''It's discretionary. 'I am going to keep a very tight grip on my wallet,' is what people are saying.''
Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, offered a similar assessment of the hotel industry. ''It's a recovery but not an impressive recovery,'' he said.
Putting the situation in perspective, occupancy for 2009 was 54.6 percent, according to Smith Travel Research, almost the lowest since the Depression. (The lowest was 53.4 percent in 1971.) Occupancy for 2011 was 59.8 percent and is projected to climb to 61 percent in 2012, Smith Travel Research said. Employment in the airline industry suffered, too, in the weak economy. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics, part of the Transportation Department, calculated 28 consecutive months of decreases in full-time employment for airlines, leading up to November 2010. Finally, in December 2010, employment began to improve.
Cruise capacity has also been growing, and is projected to grow 5 percent from 2011 to 2012, Mr. Harteveldt said.
The health of the travel industry affects related businesses, Mr. Cooper of Oxford Economics said, noting that the ''supply chain to the travel industry is quite long.'' Demand for air travel, for instance, affects not only airlines but also plane and parts construction and jet fuel.
Wages vary but even at entry level tend to be higher than minimum wage. Randy Pullen, president of Wage Watch, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said there were ''not many of those'' minimum-wage jobs in the travel and hospitality industry. Even housekeepers, he said, make more than minimum wage, and tend to make more in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington and Seattle. In Arizona, they may make $10 plus tips, whereas in New York, it is $10 to $12. A bellman can make minimum wage plus tips for a total of $35,000, Mr. Pullen said.
Hotels have also been able to take advantage of the downturn, said Joseph McInerney, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, by hiring people with a higher level of education and sophistication, like those with bachelor's degrees from Cornell School of Hotel Administration or Florida International's hospitality and tourism school.
The prognosis for 2012 is ''very positive,'' Mr. McInerney said. Job seekers may not be able to get their dream job initially but can work their way up, he said.
Sharae Martin, 21, started work last Thursday at the new Greater Cleveland Aquarium. ''It's very exciting to me because to me it feels like I am getting my independence back,'' Ms. Martin said.
She said she was looking for a job in customer service when she heard that the new aquarium was hiring.
Though her goal is to become a pharmacist, for now she is happy to be working. ''Now that I have a job, I'm secure,'' she said. ''I feel very good about my position in life right now.''

HEADLINE: Regents and Cuomo Split on School Performance Grants

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
ALBANY -- On the issue of public school funding, at least one point of disagreement emerged at a hearing on Monday between the budgets proposed by the state's Board of Regents and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo: the amount of money to be devoted to performance grants.
In his executive budget, put forth last week, Mr. Cuomo set aside $250 million for the grants, which would reward school districts that are managed well and where students perform well. At the hearing before the State Legislature, the education commissioner, John B. King Jr., said the Regents would set aside just $50 million for the grants, the same amount that was proposed by Mr. Cuomo last year. The remaining $200 million would go to districts across the state serving a large number of poor students. 
Mr. Cuomo's proposal stipulates that some $600 million of the $805 million increase in state aid go to poor districts.
The difference of opinion between the governor and the Regents reflects a difference in approach. Mr. Cuomo argues that devoting more money to rewarding school districts for their performance will encourage them all -- rich or poor, successful or struggling -- to push harder to improve schools.
''Right now, New York is first in spending in education and 38th in results,'' Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in an e-mail. ''Just spending more on the bureaucracy without demanding accountability and results doesn't work.''
For his part, Dr. King said the Regents' plan was part of an effort to offset the effects that caps on increases in state aid, at 4 percent, and property taxes -- at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is less -- would have on education spending statewide.
Based on projections by the Regents, which Dr. King presented at the hearing, the caps would carve an $18 billion gap between schools districts' expenditures and revenues for the 2016-17 school year. (The property tax cap will affect only local governments and school districts outside New York City, which pays for schools and other services through a variety of taxes.)
Ultimately, the goal is to bridge the persistent differences in performance between students in rich and poor districts, Dr. King said. The other part of the effort includes installing a system to assess the quality of teachers and principals working in public schools. Mr. Cuomo made it a prime target in his budget address, giving districts, and their unions, one year to reach a compromise on an evaluation system or face losing their share of the state aid increase.
Dr. King and the New York City schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, endorsed the governor's evaluation proposal on Monday. During his own testimony, Mr. Walcott told legislators, ''If our teachers succeed, our students succeed.''
One overarching issue raised by the school district officials and union leaders who testified was the cost of complying with the requirements of the federal Race to the Top program, which awarded New York $700 million in education funding in exchange for certain commitments, which have been written into law. One of them calls for the adoption of an evaluation system for teachers and principals statewide. Another calls for the use of a new curriculum standard, known as common core.
Among the specifics was Mr. Walcott's suggestion that special-needs children be able to opt out of taking yellow buses to school, currently a requirement, which could save the city $5 million to $10 million annually.
Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, a Democrat from Nassau County, wanted to know how music and band teachers would be evaluated, given that there are no standardized tests to gauge their students' performance. Dr. King replied, ''Student performance is an important factor, but not the only factor.'' He added that classroom observations would be ''critical.''

HEADLINE: A Piece of the Manhattan Dream, Only $331.76 a Month

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
With 11-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls, piles of hardcover books and views of chimneys and water towers, Arnold Warwick's apartment is a 1,200-square-foot monument to the Greenwich Village of our fantasies.
And at $331.76 a month, it might be one of the very best deals in New York City. 
''I don't plan on dying, because I don't want to give up a rent-controlled apartment,'' said Mr. Warwick, who is 80 and has lived in one of the apartments above the Cherry Lane Theater for half a century. ''I pay so little I'm almost embarrassed.''
In New York, there is no shame in handing over thousands of dollars a month to live in somebody's basement or crawl space. This unfortunate hiccup in the magic of the city makes the 16,000 remaining rent-controlled units in Manhattan mouthwatering in almost any context.
Cheaper apartments than the ones above the Cherry Lane do exist in the five boroughs, and a few of them even rent for less than three figures. But Mr. Warwick's apartment, which has four small bedrooms built up around a wide-open living room, isn't just cheap. It is also a fabulous apartment.
His home is nestled on Commerce Street, a winding little road that stood in for Paris on the series finale of ''Sex and the City.''
A two-bedroom apartment in that area rents for an average of $4,745 per month, according to the brokerage firm Citi Habitats. And just down the block, at 17 Commerce Street, a 2,200-square-foot federal-style town house is currently for sale for $4.975 million.
Yet in Mr. Warwick's apartment, where he raised three children with his wife, Jane, who died in 2010, you can still catch a whiff of the neighborhood's arty past, long since subsumed by financiers and millionaires. It wafts up the stairs from the theater below.
The Cherry Lane was founded in 1924, in a building originally constructed as a brewery almost 90 years earlier. Today, it holds two stages that stretch between two connected buildings, 38 Commerce and 40-42 Commerce. The apartments are stacked in the floors above, and tenants are sometimes treated to a visceral reminder of what lies below.
''The first week I moved in, I was sitting on the couch home alone and I heard people screaming,'' a second-floor tenant, Heather Campbell, said. ''I almost called the police because I thought someone was being abused.''
The properties are owned by Angelina Fiordellisi, the executive director of the Cherry Lane Theater. She bought them in 1996 -- back when the first four rows of one theater flooded with every rainstorm -- with the help of her husband, Matt Williams, a successful television writer and producer whose credits include ''The Cosby Show,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''Home Improvement.'' (Ms. Fiordellisi said the set of ''Home Improvement'' was modeled on the couple's former home in California.)
Ms. Fiordellisi bought the eight apartments on Commerce Street, with their rambling spaces and slanted floors, because they came with the theater, not because she had a hankering to be a landlord.
''I wasn't interested in making any money off the apartments,'' she said. ''I was just hoping they would pay for themselves.''
The apartments bring in about $65,000 in rent a year, she said, and between property taxes and the cost of heat, water, maintenance and management, they just barely break even.
Early in her tenure, Ms. Fiordellisi took possession of two apartments. One was being sublet illegally and the other was not the tenant's primary residence, she said. But she has also cut her tenants some breaks.
Ms. Campbell and her husband, Adam Rosen, do not have a rent-regulated unit, but they pay only $2,500 for a glorious three-bedroom -- its elegant design and hip details recall a cheery romantic movie about things that don't really happen.
The reason for their bargain is not blackmail but sentiment. Mr. Rosen's grandmother Kim Hunter, a founding member of the Actors Studio and an Oscar winner for her portrayal of Stella Kowalski in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' lived in that apartment for about 50 years. When she died of a heart attack in 2002 -- in the apartment -- her children asked Ms. Fiordellisi if they could keep the place in the family. She said yes, and they agreed on a rent that the couple, with their young son, could afford.
''Four generations in the same apartment!'' Ms. Fiordellisi wrote in an e-mail. ''I love it!''
Evidently.
During the recession, the theater faced a steep decline in foundation support and ticket sales, and serious financial difficulties were staring it in the face. Ms. Fiordellisi almost sold it. But the Cherry Lane has since streamlined its operating costs and built up a robust rental business in its theater space, and it has paid off 80 percent of the $250,000 debt that once threatened to shut it down.
So Ms. Fiordellisi's tenants and her theater will continue to be roomies, as she cheerfully shoulders some of the best deals around. But there are some who do not share her sunny view of those bargains.
''I've had people actually get angry with me,'' said one of Mr. Warwick's neighbors, who declined to be identified by name and risk being chastised by strangers. She took over a rent-controlled lease from her parents, and she would not specify what she paid, except to say that it is under $400 a month.
''I'm an inheritor,'' the tenant said recently by telephone, a slight quiver in her voice. ''It's not a very popular position these days.'' And then, very politely, she ended the call.

HEADLINE: One Small Event Derails Many Lives

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
By Penelope Lively
229 pages. Viking. $26.95.
The plot of Penelope Lively's vital new novel is one big snowball: an avalanche of events that starts with the mugging of an elderly woman named Charlotte Rainsford one fine April day in London. By the end of the book this single event will have derailed seven lives, sending these characters' stories swerving off into new directions, perhaps even permanently bending the arc of their dreams and ambitions.
This, of course, is a variation on familiar Lively themes, reminding us of her preoccupation with the ways the past molds or fails to mold the present; the role that chance (from a wartime bomb to a fortuitous meeting on an airplane) plays in people's lives; the haphazard might-have-beens that follow an impulsive choice made long ago. 
In her 1993 novel ''Cleopatra's Sister,'' Ms. Lively looked at the unpredictable series of events that brought her heroine and hero together, explicating the connections between private dramas and great public events. And in her 2005 antimemoir, ''Making It Up,'' she imagined alternative lives for herself, exploring those hinge moments when ''things might have gone entirely differently, when life might have spun off in some other direction,'' those moments that create wonder at the ''apparently arbitrary outcome'' of one's own life. What if Ms. Lively had become an archaeologist instead of a writer? What if she'd had an illegitimate child?
In the case of ''How It All Began'' Charlotte's mugging results in a broken hip, which leads to her moving in, temporarily, with her daughter and son-in-law, Rose and Gerry, which leads to Rose's taking time off from her job as an assistant to a snobbish old historian named Henry, which leads him to ask his niece Marion to accompany him on a lecture trip to Manchester, which leads to her decision to leave a message for Jeremy, the married man she's been seeing, which leads Jeremy's wife, Stella, to discover the message -- and the affair -- and to file for divorce.
Writing with her usual poise and cutting cinematically from one character's story to another's, Ms. Lively elegantly orchestrates these events while using them as a setup for another series of developments, including Marion's encounter with a potential new client named George during her trip with her uncle to Manchester, and the married Rose's growing infatuation with Anton, an earnest immigrant from Central Europe who is struggling to learn English with her mother's help.
''Thus have various lives collided,'' Ms. Lively writes, ''the human version of a motorway shunt, and the rogue white van that slammed on the brakes is miles away now, impervious, offstage, enjoying a fry-up at the next services. Just as our mugger does not come into this story, not now, anyway -- job done, damage complete, he (or she) is now superfluous.''
In summary, the human pileup in ''How It All Began'' may sound a bit contrived -- the novelist as whimsical God, concocting circumstances that will tip over all her characters' assumptions -- but Ms. Lively executes her game plan with such verve that the reader easily shrugs off such doubts. As she's done in so many earlier books, Ms. Lively writes with an astringent blend of sympathy and detachment, emotional wisdom and satiric wit, and the result, here, is a Chekhovian tale that's entertaining, even funny on the surface, but ultimately melancholy in its awareness of time and lost opportunities, its characters' apprehension of mortality and the limits to their dreams.
Charlotte, especially, is made aware of the frailties of age when her broken hip renders her dependent on her daughter and son-in-law: the last thing this fiercely self-reliant woman ever wanted. She finds herself housebound, distracted by pain, bored, unable even to enjoy her longtime passion, books, and this, after a lifetime of reading for enlightenment and instruction, of reading to ''find out how sex works, how babies are born,'' what ''it is to be good, or bad'' and to ''find out what it is that other people experience that she is missing.''
''For years now,'' she thinks, ''pain has been a constant companion, cozily there in bed with one in the morning, keeping pace all day, coyly retreating perhaps for a while only to come romping back: here I am, remember me? Ah, old age. The twilight years -- that delicate phrase. Twilight my foot -- roaring dawn of a new life, more like, the one you didn't know about. We all avert our eyes, and then -- wham! you're in there too, wondering how the hell this can have happened, and maybe it is an early circle of hell, and here come the gleeful devils with their pitchforks, stabbing and prodding.'' Except, she reminds herself, ''that life goes on in parallel -- real life, good life with all its gifts and graces,'' like new tulips and the birds at the bird feeder.
At 76, Henry, too, has begun to cope with the encroachments of time, or, in his case, fallout from his willful blindness to the changes (social, economic, political) all around him. He thinks back on the class-bound world he knew in his youth -- ''familiar territory'' where ''you knew where you were with it'' -- and compares it to modern London, where ''today's disparate and polyglot populace'' leaves him feeling dislocated. Here, now, he thinks, ''you cannot place anyone in context, you cannot judge prosperity, hazard a guess at occupation, know if this person would speak English, Russian, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croat, Urdu, Pashto.''
As a historian, Henry acknowledges that he has ''a soft spot for what is known as the Cleopatra's nose theory of history -- the proposal that had the nose of Cleopatra been an inch longer, the fortunes of Rome would have been different.'' It's a bit of a reductio ad absurdum, he admits, but nonetheless ''a reference to random causality that makes a lot of sense when we think about the erratic sequence of events that we call history.''
What Ms. Lively has done in this captivating volume is to use all her copious storytelling gifts to show how a similar kind of random causality rules individual lives, how one unlucky event can set off unexpected chain reactions, how the so-called butterfly effect -- whereby the flapping of a tiny butterfly's wings can supposedly lead to a huge storm elsewhere in the world -- ripples through the ebb and flow of daily life.

PERSON: Bingham Ray 

HEADLINE: Bingham Ray, 57, Executive Who Championed Independent Films

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Bingham Ray, a colorful indie-film executive who helped steer art-house movies like ''Bowling for Columbine'' and ''Hotel Rwanda'' to the masses, died on Monday in a hospice in Provo, Utah. He was 57.
The cause was a series of strokes, according to the San Francisco Film Society, where he had only recently become its executive director, an appointment he described in October as ''too good to be true.'' He was in Utah to attend the Sundance Film Festival. 
Volatile and blunt, Mr. Ray championed stylized, intellectually challenging films, buying distribution rights to movies that few believed had a box-office prayer. ''The words 'fearless' and 'brave' are tossed around a lot in our world, but that's the only way to describe Bingham,'' said Eamonn Bowles, the president of Magnolia Pictures.
Mr. Ray helped create a business model in which art-house movies grew into a powerful economic and cultural force. He co-founded one of the first major indie distributors, October Films, in 1991, working with Jeff Lipsky in a house in suburban Los Angeles.
October Films, along with Miramax Films and Sony Pictures Classics, was designed to snap up indie gems from festivals like Sundance and distribute them broadly, relying on guerrilla marketing campaigns and the Oscars to get them noticed. ''Secrets & Lies,'' directed by Mike Leigh, and Lars von Trier's ''Breaking the Waves,'' both from 1996, were two of October's biggest successes. October Films was also responsible for David Lynch's ''Lost Highway'' and one of the first widely seen Iranian movies, ''The White Balloon,'' directed by Jafar Panahi.
Mr. Ray left October Films in 1999, when it was sold to USA Networks. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the company emerged in 2002 as Focus Features, which remains an art-house leader. ''If you draw a line back to the rise of independent film, you find Bingham,'' Mr. Bowles said.
Born on Oct. 1, 1954, Mr. Ray grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was fascinated with movies from an early age; one of his first jobs was as a projectionist in a Greenwich Village theater. He started his formal career in 1981 in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's New York office, where he sold library titles to hospitals, colleges and ships at sea.
He worked at five other distribution companies, including New Yorker Films and Avenue Pictures, where he oversaw the release of Gus Van Sant's ''Drugstore Cowboy'' in 1989 before founding October Films.
From 2001 to 2004 Mr. Ray was president of United Artists, working to revive its reputation for serving up top-notch specialty films. ''Bowling for Columbine,'' a Michael Moore documentary on the American gun culture, and Terry George's ''Hotel Rwanda,'' starring Don Cheadle in a fact-based tale set during the Rwandan genocide, were two United Artists films released under Mr. Ray's watch. His subsequent jobs included running Sidney Kimmel Entertainment.
He was also a consultant to the Film Society of Lincoln Center, IFC Films and Snag Films, which focuses on documentaries, and an adjunct professor at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
Mr. Ray is survived by his wife, Nancy King; their children Nick, Annabel and Becca; and his sisters, Susan Clair and Deb Pope.
Peter Biskind's book ''Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film'' (2004), captured the excitement Mr. Ray felt about art-house movies. ''We're not as well-heeled as some of these other companies, but we're hungrier, because it's me, and I'm really, really hungry,'' Mr. Biskind quotes him as saying during a Sundance bidding war. ''This film, I'm drooling. I would chop my left arm to do it.''

HEADLINE: Giffords Visits Food Bank That Her Well-Wishers Aided

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Marisa Gerber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TUCSON -- Just before Christmas 2010, Representative Gabrielle Giffords took her staff to the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona here so they could see firsthand how the organization was helping the less fortunate during the recession.
For many politicians, visiting a food bank is a chance to show they care, even if they only shake a few hands and take a quick tour. But that Saturday, Ms. Giffords stayed for more than an hour chatting with the staff and touring the vast warehouse.
Two weeks later, Ms. Giffords became national news on a different visit to her district when a lone gunman shot and grievously wounded her during a meet-and-greet at a local supermarket. Afterward, her husband, Mark E. Kelly, told well-wishers who felt compelled to donate something in the congresswoman's honor to give to the food bank, among other charities. About $325,000 poured in from Albany, from Little Rock, from Yuma -- more than enough to build the Gabrielle Giffords Family Assistance Center, an office at the food bank where the needy can get information about food stamps and other benefits. 
Ms. Giffords returned to the food bank on Monday in a bittersweet visit. Ms. Giffords said Sunday that she was resigning from Congress to focus on her recovery, and her stop at the food bank marked her last official visit to her district as a congresswoman.
Though she plans to remain involved with the food bank, she will no longer be able to work in Washington to help obtain government grants and other aid. To come full circle, though, she wanted to see for the first time the assistance center that was paid for with donations from those wanting to help in the wake of her shooting.
Ms. Giffords walked slowly with a limp, but smiled widely as she was escorted into the warehouse. Dressed in jeans, running shoes, a green top and blue scarf, she received a round of applause by the 100 or so workers who assembled to greet her. She did not speak to reporters.
She spent 10 minutes in the assistance center before being given a tour by William Carnegie, the chief executive of the food bank, who held her hand as they walked past pallets of bottled water, Capri Sun juice, Rice Krispies and jars of peanut butter. The two, accompanied by an entourage of aides, then disappeared into the warehouse out of view.
Ms. Giffords has had a long affiliation with the food bank, which serves 220,000 people a month, about twice as many people as it did four years ago, before the downturn began. She worked on food drives while in high school, something she insisted that her Congressional staff do as well. While in Washington, she helped the food bank obtain solar panels to reduce its electricity bill and made sure it had its share of federal food aid.
Before arriving at the food bank on Monday, Ms. Giffords went to her Congressional office to finish the Congress on Your Corner event that was cut short last Jan. 8, when Jared L. Loughner, who has been charged with killing 6 people and injured 13, including Ms. Giffords, is accused of opening fire. She met with seniors, ranchers and veterans who served as informal advisers during her time in Congress, and who were supposed to meet with Ms. Giffords before the shooting began.
Workers at the food bank said they admired Ms. Giffords's willingness to finish what she started by meeting with those constituents. They also wondered whether her replacement in Congress would pay as much attention to the underprivileged.
''They'll have big shoes to fill,'' said Ruben Ramirez, who provides food to churches and other groups that serve the needy.
Ms. Giffords's successor will be chosen in June or July in a special election. In November, voters will again elect a representative for this district, which is being redrawn.
Though Ms. Giffords's district is one of the more liberal in the state, it is far from certain that another Democrat will be elected. About a dozen candidates are expected to run for her seat, including some favored by the Tea Party.
Some voters, while saddened by Ms. Giffords's departure, said that a Democrat has a good chance of retaining her seat.
''Many Republicans in the district voted for her,'' said Terry Parker, 64, a registered Democrat from Tucson, while having lunch in nearby Tubac on Sunday. ''She was one of those people who wanted what was best for the district, not the party.''
Cynthia Rose, 62, a gift shop owner in Tubac and a registered Republican, disagreed. ''Personally, I didn't care for her politics,'' she said. ''I want a Republican to be elected here.''

HEADLINE: Flat Finish As Investors Await Greek Debt Deal

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Markets ended flat on Monday as few developments affected stocks except investor hopes that Greece would eventually reach a deal with private creditors on lowering its debt.
Greece's private creditors are being asked to accept longer maturities and lower interest rates on new bonds swapped for their existing ones. 
The major Wall Street stock indexes wavered little all day. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 0.05 percent, or 0.62 points, to 1,316. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.09 percent, or 11.66 points, to 12,708.82. The Nasdaq composite index also lost 0.09 percent, or 2.53 points, to close at 2,784.17.
Greece, which is negotiating alongside fellow members of the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, wants interest rates as low as 3 percent on the new bonds. But the private creditors believe that is too low, and are aiming for about 4.5 percent.
Both sides said a deal was nevertheless close, heartening investors. The euro was the main beneficiary, climbing 1.3 percent to $1.3033.
Greek officials say negotiations on the private debt write-down are continuing by phone, with no appointment yet for new face-to-face talks.
Greece was to be the main topic of discussion at Monday's meeting in Brussels of the finance ministers for the 17 European Union members that use the euro.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed up 0.9 percent, while the DAX in Germany rose 0.5 percent. The CAC 40 in France was also 0.5 percent higher.
Optimism that Greece would clinch a deal has brightened market sentiment this year, along with a run of successful European bond auctions and solid economic and corporate news, not least from the United States and China. Many stock indexes have risen to five-month highs, while the euro has headed back toward the $1.30 mark.
Though the Federal Reserve is expected to keep its loose monetary policy unchanged, there will be great interest in the outcome of this week's rate-setting meeting. It will be the first time the Fed will publish its interest rate forecasts out to 2016, part of a strategy to enhance communication with financial markets.
Investors will be particularly interested to see how long policy makers expect interest rates to remain low. Previously, the Fed said it expected to keep them low until the middle of 2013.
''Most, ourselves included, expect the projections to suggest the Fed sees rates on hold well into 2014,'' said Adam Cole, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
In the oil markets, traders were watching developments in the Persian Gulf. Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if the United States and other countries impose more sanctions on it because of its nuclear program. Many analysts doubt that Iran could set up a blockade for long, but any supply shortages would cause supplies to tighten. Benchmark crude was up $1.25 to $99.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 99 16/32. The yield was 2.06 percent, up from 2.03 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Arguing to Apply Some Stimulus Along With the Austerity

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- With much of Europe embarked on a program of budget-cutting and belt-tightening, doubts about whether more austerity is the answer to today's economic troubles are popping up in the strangest places.
On a concrete wall in Oporto, Portugal, where a tough austerity effort has hit hard, a somber graffiti mural depicts a submarine in a nose dive.
''Austerity doesn't save,'' the caption warns. ''It sinks.''
As Western countries grapple with lingering economic malaise, even some traditionalists within the policy-making fraternity are starting to worry that such slogans might be right. But as a phalanx of politicians, academics and other experts gathers this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, perhaps the biggest question they will face is whether it is possible to develop policies to revive growth even as Western countries seek to reduce debt. 
Europe and the United States are both locked into fiscal strategies based on curbing government debt and paring borrowing. Europe has been following a German prescription intended to save the euro zone. Meanwhile, Washington, which is in the throes of a heated presidential campaign, is divided over whether to extenda payroll tax cut for the rest of the year and has committed, at least on paper, to cutting spending by $1.2 trillion starting this year.
Whether austerity will help revive economies over the long term is the subject of an intensifying debate, especially as much of Europe heads into what looks like its second recession in three years. The United States -- where belt-tightening, though painful, has not been nearly so severe -- shows glimmers of a recovery.
''It is clear that austerity alone is a recipe for stagnation and decline,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and professor at Columbia University in New York. ''The likelihood that things would work out well is extraordinarily small.''
Recently, there have been signs the tide is shifting. In the past several weeks, European politicians have begun to insist quite publicly that austerity can no longer be the sole answer to putting even the most heavily indebted economies on the path to a brighter future.
After months of talk of almost nothing but cuts, Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France delivered such a message to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, during recent visits to Berlin, with a surprising result: ''Growth'' has become the new watchword on everybody's lips -- even Mrs. Merkel's.
''Budget consolidation is one of the legs Europe's future must be built on,'' Mrs. Merkel said this month after meeting with the Italian and French leaders. ''But of course we need a second leg,'' she added, which is ''economic growth, jobs and employment.''
Germany is still insistent that the most foolproof path to sustainable recovery is through structural change, including the overhaul of rigid labor markets and changes to pension laws, much like those Germany painfully pushed through in the 1990s.
But the fruits of such labors often take years to emerge. In the meantime, the concern is that economies that are already in a slowdown will be weakened further by large cuts in national spending and by tax increases that governments are embracing to satisfy lenders and to placate the financial markets.
''You could say that if there's no austerity, growth might be higher,'' said Stefan Schneider, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ''But then again, no austerity would probably escalate the bond crisis in Europe, and then you would wind up with total chaos.''
In the United States, where the budget deficit remains high and President Barack Obama has pressed for more stimulus, there are tentative signs of an economic comeback. The unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in December, its lowest level in nearly three years, after about 200,000 jobs were added.
The outlook remains fragile. The phaseout of an earlier stimulus program cost the United States an estimated half a percentage point in growth last year, and could further reduce potential gains in 2012. Washington is also likely to provide less government support this year amid continued wrangling between Republicans and Democrats over economic policy.
But the U.S. Federal Reserve has been more accepting than the European Central Bank of keeping interest rates low and of pumping extra money into the banking system in a bid to restart the engines of the economy.
''The U.S. government has been willing to provide more stimulus than the Europeans, and the Federal Reserve has been more accommodative on monetary policy,'' said Paul De Grawe, a professor of economics at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. ''So America's environment is easier right now because its macroeconomic policies are less contractionary than in Europe.''
In Europe, Mr. De Grawe added, ''excessive austerity, no fiscal stimulus and a European Central Bank not willing to do the same as the Fed is the wrong policy mix.''
That policy mix is showing signs of changing, however, with the E.C.B. starting to lend hundreds of billions of euros to banks to prevent a freezing of the financial system and in the hopes of greasing the wheels of commerce.
Still, austerity remains the dominant feature in Europe. Ireland, one of the first countries to receive a financial lifeline in the current crisis, has been held up by Mrs. Merkel and others as a model for exiting the sovereign debt crisis . But the group of creditors administering a bailout of 65 billion, or nearly $85 billion at current exchange rates, for Ireland reported that even though the country had succeeded in reducing its staggering deficit last year, its sluggish economy would grow even more slowly in 2012 than first thought.
That could make it harder for the government of Prime Minister Enda Kenny to meet its deficit target and to return to borrowing at reasonable rates in financial markets.
Similarly, an austerity program in Britain appears to be falling short of its goals, largely because economic growth has consistently failed to measure up to government expectations. In Spain, austerity programs will lead the economy to contract an estimated 1.5 percent this year, the central bank said this week, instead of growing by that much, as originally thought.
Further south, Mr. Monti has grown increasingly alarmed about the risk that Italy will stumble into what he calls an ''austerity trap.'' On the morning of his visit this month to the German Chancellery, he warned in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt that if Italians did not see concrete rewards for their willingness to cut and save, there would be protests against Europe and Germany, which ''is seen as a ringleader of E.U. intolerance.''
Mr. Monti then headed back to Rome, where he put the finishing touches on a set of measures announced last week that aim to revive the sluggish, protectionist Italian economy by investing 5.5 billion in infrastructure and opening up professional guilds to competition.
In France, Mr. Sarkozy, who has pressed Mrs. Merkel to put greater emphasis on growth, took steps of his own this month toward economic renewal and job creation. Last week, he announced at a meeting of business and labor leaders a modest 430 million program for employee training and a separate set of measures intended to help companies hold on to workers.
French unions denounced the measures as little more than a political ploy that would have little real effect on employment.
Would more stimulus spending help Europe?
Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, says the most deeply indebted countries have little room to maneuver because increased borrowing would only make it more expensive for them to sell their bonds.
On the other hand, should European countries be ''willing to be in a recession for five years just to prove their credibility?'' Mr. Rogoff asked. ''That's not tenable.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Adviser Accuses Brazil of Ruining Relations

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Horta Moriconi contributed reporting

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Iran's efforts to cultivate political support in Latin America at a time of rising international tension over its nuclear program appear to have encountered a significant obstacle: Brazil, the region's economic powerhouse.
After President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran took a four-country tour of Latin America this month, during which he met with several outspoken critics of the United States but was notably not invited to stop in Brazil, one of his top advisers took a public swipe at Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, saying she had ''destroyed years of good relations'' between the two nations. 
''The Brazilian president has been striking against everything that Lula accomplished,'' Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who has worked as Mr. Ahmadinejad's top media adviser, said in an interview published Monday by Folha de Sao Paulo, a leading Brazilian newspaper, in which he compared Ms. Rousseff to her predecessor and political mentor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Mr. da Silva, who left office a year ago, visited Tehran in 2010, wading into Middle East diplomacy in an attempt to defuse the crisis over Iran's nuclear program. Together with Turkey's government, he forged a fuel-swap deal for Iran to ship low-enriched uranium abroad.
That agreement failed after the Obama administration rejected it and Iran said it planned to continue enriching uranium. Even so, Brazil's exports to Iran soared in the ensuing months; Iran briefly surpassed Russia at one point in 2011 as the largest export market for Brazilian beef.
In recent months, however, trade ties between the two nations have frayed somewhat. Brazil's exports to Iran climbed to $2.1 billion in 2010 from $1.2 billion a year earlier. But now some Brazilian companies have complained that it has become harder to obtain Iranian import licenses, curbing what had been an otherwise dynamic market for Brazil.
''Since October, we noticed an abrupt break in purchases by Iran,'' said Francisco Turra, president of the Brazilian Poultry Union, a trade group. He said that officials at Iran's Embassy in Brasilia and at Brazil's Embassy in Tehran had assured his group that Brazilian exports were still welcome in Iran. Mr. Turra said he was awaiting the release of the new export statistics to determine how to proceed.
The views of Mr. Javanfekr, an influential if polarizing political figure in Iran, present a dilemma for Brazil as it attempts to hew to a pragmatic foreign policy that maintains access to important markets while avoiding confrontation.
Nevertheless, last year, after the election of Ms. Rousseff, Mr. da Silva's chosen successor, Brazil supported a move by the United Nations to investigate claims of human rights abuses in Iran, an initiative led by Washington. The decision was viewed as a subtle shift from Mr. da Silva's previous relations with Tehran.
Tovar da Silva Nunes, the spokesman for Brazil's Foreign Affairs Ministry, declined to comment on Mr. Javanfekr's remarks. Instead, Mr. da Silva Nunes said ties with Iran remained warm, reflected by a meeting at the United Nations in September between Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, arranged at Iran's request. Moreover, Mr. da Silva Nunes said Brazil remained ''skeptical'' about the use of sanctions to exert pressure on Iran.
How closely Mr. Javanfekr's remarks adhere to the views of the Iranian political establishment is a matter of debate. Though he wields influence in the Iranian president's circle of top advisers, having served as the head of the official Islamic Republic News Agency and Iran's official daily newspaper, Mr. Javanfekr has also come under scrutiny amid a rivalry within Iran's leadership. A Tehran court recently gave Mr. Javanfekr a one-year jail sentence for insulting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, exposing the friction between Mr. Ahmadinejad and conservatives in government.
In his swing through Latin America this month, Mr. Ahmadinejad visited just four nations, all with tense ties with Washington but limited regional influence: Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador. The itinerary did not include the region's largest countries: Brazil, Mexico, Colombia or Argentina.
Iran's efforts to make new friends in Latin America also seemed to gain little traction during the tour. In one exception, while in Managua, Nicaragua's capital, Mr. Ahmadinejad met with Desi Bouterse, the convicted drug trafficker who is now president of tiny Suriname.
However, Iran's ambassador in Brasilia, Mohsen Shaterzadeh, surprised reporters on Saturday by telling them that Mr. Ahmadinejad was still planning to visit Brazil sometime this year. He did not mention a date. Mr. da Silva Nunes, the spokesman for Brazil's Foreign Affairs Ministry, said Monday that no formal request for a visit had yet been made.

HEADLINE: Confident Obama Knows Wild Cards Can Loom Large

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama prepares to address the state of the union on Tuesday night, the state of his presidency has been improving lately -- thanks to encouraging economic news as well as divisive infighting among Republicans.
''I'm absolutely confident we're going to win this thing,'' Mr. Obama told about 50 donors dining at the Manhattan town house of the filmmaker Spike Lee last Thursday evening. 
While Mr. Obama stressed that his bravado hinged on supporters' helping him as they did in 2008, the cautious confidence taking root within the White House and at his Chicago campaign headquarters also reflects the clashes cleaving Republicans.
On the presidential campaign trail and in Congress, Republicans have turned on one another with a ferocity that distresses party leaders, who fear that it can only benefit Mr. Obama. Democrats are enjoying the show, though mindful that much could change in the nine months before Election Day -- as it often has in Mr. Obama's term, and not for the better.
Lawmakers returned for the year's Congressional session with many House Republicans in a rebellious mood over their leaders' and Senate Republicans' past budget compromises with Mr. Obama. Many veteran Republicans counter that the militancy of junior conservatives has driven the party's and Congress's public support to among the lowest levels in the history of polling, while Mr. Obama's ratings have inched up. The party's disarray is a far cry from a year ago when Republicans, having just won control of the House, were ascendant.
More vicious yet is the Republican race for the presidential nomination. After South Carolina's primary results on Saturday scrambled the contest, the battling between the two front-runners -- former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Speaker Newt Gingrich -- escalated to full-scale war as the fight shifted to Florida.
Yet the Obama circle is full of people, not least the president, who have learned by hard experience to temper their hopes, and to fear the spring for annually bringing headwinds from elsewhere -- Europe, the Mideast, Japan, the Gulf of Mexico -- just when officials and economists were seeing ''green shoots'' in the economy.
And ultimately the economy is Mr. Obama's chief adversary. He is running for a second term with an unemployment rate -- 8.5 percent in December -- that is higher than for any modern president who was able to win re-election.
But the trend in the jobless rate has been downward. And in other ways, ''U.S. economic data have been on a positive streak,'' Jerry Webman, chief economist for Oppenheimer Funds Inc., wrote in his weekly analysis on Monday.
''While the economy may not be expanding like gangbusters,'' he added, ''modest improvement in growth is likely as we move into 2012.''
A positive trend is most likely the best that Mr. Obama can hope for before November, and if the ultimate Republican nominee emerges bloodied and weak, he could be helped in making his case to voters to stay the economic course.
The president and his advisers are confident their course will lead to a full recovery, though not this year. That long-term prospect has stoked Mr. Obama's competitive juices, lest a Republican take the White House and with it the eventual credit for economic gains. And his shows of competitiveness, like at last week's four New York fund-raisers, have heartened Democrats who more often fret that Mr. Obama is too cool, too conciliatory for the fight ahead of him.
But for this year, the White House is hardly complacent about the economy. They need only review the fairly bullish State of the Union address that Mr. Obama delivered last year.
''We are poised for progress,'' he said. ''Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.''
Within months, a tsunami in Japan, a worsening of the European debt crisis and a spike in oil prices amid upheaval in the Mideast all combined to stall the recovery and threaten a relapse to recession. Similarly, White House hopes in late 2009 and early 2010 were dashed that spring by an earlier flare-up of Europe's woes and, in April, the explosion of a BP rig that had oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico until August, devastating coastal economies.
The ups and downs have been reflected in Mr. Obama's job approval ratings. After they slid through most of 2009 and early 2010, by spring of 2010 his approval rating had broken 50 percent in the New York Times/CBS News polls and others, only to slide again after the oil spill and other events.
In 2011, except for a spike at the time of Osama bin Laden's killing, Mr. Obama's approval ratings dipped again as he fought with Congressional Republicans over the budget. They picked up at year's end as he went on the offensive for a job creation plan, and economic data improved.
For a third year, Europe remains a wild card as the continent seems near or in a recession, threatening fallout for export industries here.
And of course the outcome of Republicans' nomination fight will go far in deciding Mr. Obama's fate, by defining the choice for voters.
Democrats consider Mr. Gingrich, given his erratic style and controversial record, as the easier candidate to beat. But Obama advisers continue to believe Mr. Romney will most likely be the nominee given his superior organization, though his drubbing by Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina has raised doubts and left Democrats looking to Florida's Jan. 31 primary to clarify matters.
Many Democrats say the intraparty attacks by Mr. Gingrich especially are certain to weaken Mr. Romney. But some in Mr. Obama's circle privately caution that the assaults also could strengthen Mr. Romney for a general election fight, by forcing him to improve his debate skills and answer the attacks against him -- just as Mr. Obama, his advisers acknowledge, was helped by his long 2008 battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton.

HEADLINE: Twists and Turns in the Republican Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Upset by Gingrich Shifts G.O.P. Campaign'' (front page, Jan. 22):
The candidacy of Newt Gingrich has gone from ridiculous and impossible to conceivable. The fact that Republicans in South Carolina can embrace this deeply flawed politician speaks volumes about disturbing undercurrents in American society.
The evidence is undeniable that Mr. Gingrich is a hypocrite of the first order, taking ''do as I say, not as I do'' to the extreme. He is prone to volatile, wild and often contradictory notions, which he expresses with inflamed passion and certitude, a frightening combination for a potential president. 
If voters can ignore his behavior and history -- or view his record favorably -- it can only be because they are obsessed with finding an unethical pugilist who can take on and bloody President Obama. This speaks of deep, ugly prejudices that make facts and rational discourse irrelevant.
ROGER C. BOHMRICH Mount Kisco, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Newt Gingrich's winning performance in the South Carolina Republican primary highlights the former speaker's ability to confront and resolve the vital issues affecting the American people now and in the foreseeable future: our deeply injured economy, jobs, energy, education, health care, national security, foreign policy, irresponsible media and a grossly ineffective, oversized, overregulating, overspending, overreaching government.
Now it is up to the voters to make the most important decision of our lifetimes in the 2012 elections. Republicans should nominate Mr. Gingrich for president, and elect sufficient qualified Congressional candidates to gain control of the Senate and maintain control of the House.
DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., Jan. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
I am a retiree living in South Carolina, and I have always considered myself an independent. I look at the issues, qualifications and positions of the candidates before deciding for whom to vote.
Unfortunately, this time around, the excessively ideological positions taken by the Republican candidates scared me. Hence I was one of those who ran to vote for Mr. Gingrich. This was not because I would like to see him as president, but because I would like this cast of characters to wear one another out some more, so that President Obama can have a better chance for a second term.
I am not exactly happy with the president, but at least he does not scare me.
BILSEL ALISBAH Hilton Head, S.C., Jan. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
In 1994, I was the chief federal lobbyist for Chemical Bank, later merged into what is now JP Morgan Chase, and was invited to Long Island MacArthur Airport to meet with Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Only five people showed up. He pulled out a notebook and district by district explained how the Republicans would pull off the impossible and recapture the House. He was smart, strategic and right.
I wrote a memo to senior management saying that for the first time since Eisenhower was president the Republicans would control the House. Lesson: Don't underestimate Newt.
TOM BLOCK Juno Beach, Fla., Jan. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Mr. Gingrich's Deceptions'' (editorial, Jan. 23):
Newt Gingrich strategically stoked the flames of bigotry in a state still smoldering with racial intolerance by calling President Obama ''the most successful food-stamp president in American history'' and questioning the black work ethic. These words served as chum for angry ultraconservatives seeking reinforcement for a hateful worldview.
Mr. Gingrich's often acrimonious oratory laden with cheap sloganeering and historical revisionism exploits our nation's blemished past and jeopardizes its future. He should be ashamed of himself, but almost certainly won't be.

HEADLINE: Free Matchmaking At a Setting In the Alps

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- The stars of the guest list for this year's annual World Economic Forum, which begins here Wednesday, are a who's who of government leaders pulling the strings of the global economy. On the list are Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany; Timothy F. Geithner, the United States secretary of the Treasury; Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank; and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
The cost of their tickets? Nothing. 
Last year, you may recall that I wrote a column detailing the extraordinary entrance fees that corporate executives pay for the opportunity to do matchmaking in the Alps. A quick refresher: It costs a minimum of $71,000 for an individual corporate invitation. An invitation for two that includes access to private events costs $301,000. An invitation for a delegation of five, $622,000. And that's before the planes, hotels and restaurant meals.
But that column did not detail that for about 900 other individuals from the world of government, academia, nonprofit groups - and, yes, members of the media - the sky-high corporate fees also are waived. The invitation comes gratis, though all their travel and lodging costs fall to those guests.
You could argue that the more than $100 million that moguls and corporations spend to send 1,600 superconnected executives here by private plane is used to subsidize those who fly on commercial airlines. (In fairness, not every mogul flies by corporate jet: George Soros, the hedge fund manager, flew commercial. He was on my flight Sunday night.) And many public officials, of course, fly on private government planes. Mr. Geithner, for example, will be flying on a military plane.
Among those who get ''comped'' are often big and small nonprofit organizations and ''social entrepreneurs'' seeking a voice in the conversation and a chance to rub elbows with potential benefactors. People like Kumi Naidoo, the executive director of Greenpeace International, and Giorgio Jackson, the 24-year-old leader of a student movement in Santiago, Chile, that nearly paralyzed the country, are on the get-in-free list.
About 200 academics, people like the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist and co-author of ''This Time is Different,'' are also offered free admission. And about 20 religious leaders, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana (who is said to be considered among the candidates to be the next pope), make the list.
It is a notable and noble effort by the World Economic Forum to take this multi-stakeholder approach and, in truth, it gives all kinds of people from all parts of the world a seat at the table, even if some say they are being co-opted by the ''elite.'' (By the way, since when did elite become a pejorative term?)
Critics contend that all of the nonbusiness leaders and high-minded conversations - this year's theme is ''The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models'' - are a cover for the paying invitees to mingle in the halls and make deals. To some extent, that is true. There is no question that Davos is a matchmaking haven for chief executives. I know one executive who conducts more than 20 meetings a day with people from all over the globe that he said would otherwise take him three months of red-eye flights to do.
There is another, perhaps cynical, unspoken draw for the C.E.O. set paying six figures to frolic in the snow. The 40 heads of state and 90 ministers who come to the conference free of charge are, of course, the headliners, but they are also doing the real deal making behind the scenes with each other - and with industry.
For government officials, Davos has the same allure that it does for business: a series of quick-hit meetings with their counterparts. It gives executives the chance to jockey for position on the other side of the table with a government leader who could have an infrastructure project that needs financing, deals that can be worth millions if not billions of dollars. Or executives will spend weeks before arriving trying to get a 15-minute meeting with Mrs. Merkel or Ms. Lagarde in the hope of influencing the dialogue over the euro.
That may help explain why the World Economic Forum brought in $157 million in revenue last year from its members and strategic corporate partners.
In case you're curious, it spent virtually all of it: $156 million. How was it spent? The organization employs 337 full-time employees and 369 ''full-time equivalents'' annually that it says cost a total of about $69 million. The conferences it convenes - besides the meeting in Davos, it organizes another big event in China and four other regional events - cost about $60 million more for space, elaborate signs and furniture, meals, event planning and security. (The security costs in Davos alone are estimated to be about $8 million, which are borne by the World Economic Forum and the Swiss government.) The organization says it spent another $26 million on office costs.
Adrian Monck, head of communications for the World Economic Forum, said that because there was such a cross-section of paying invitees from all kinds of industries, nobody could skew the selection of people invited to attend free. ''The funding diversity means no one is 'paying' for the people we choose to come - that's our 'editorial integrity,' '' he said in an e-mail.
Money may always raise questions about events like Davos. But in the end, the event is, as Mr. Monck wrote on his blog, an effort to convene a global conversation and a reflection that ''that every view must be integrated, that one cannot simply abrogate one's membership in a community. It is an old idea.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Race Moves to Florida, Facing Political Implications of a Housing Crisis

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
ORMOND BEACH, Fla.-- When Mitt Romney swept into the contentious battleground state of Florida on Sunday, the first local issue he raised was the nation's mortgage foreclosure crisis, which is arguably at its worst here, from this city on the northern coast to the ghost-town developments in what used to be farmland south of Miami.
He offered no new policy prescriptions to help people whose homes are worth less than they owe, and suggested that the best remedy was a stronger economy. But in contrast to earlier statements he and other Republican candidates have made about letting the market correct itself by first hitting bottom, Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, instead offered a reassuring if vague message: ''People in Florida have seen home values go down,'' he said, striking an empathetic tone. ''It's time to turn that around.''
Among those cheering for Mr. Romney was Eric Brandon, 41, a nurse who paid close to half a million dollars for his two-story, four-bedroom home in Palm Coast, Fla., in 2005. Now it is worth only about $130,000, he said. And he felt that Mr. Romney, as a successful businessman, was best poised to confront the problem. 
''As long as people have jobs, they will be able to buy houses,'' he said ''The economy is my issue, and I know Romney is strong on that.''
The Republican presidential campaign is now moving into a state consumed by the housing crisis, perhaps the most enduring legacy of the economic downturn, and the primary battle is the first serious test of how it plays out as a political issue in the race. For Republicans, it is an especially tricky topic, forcing them to balance their free-market instincts against intense demand among homeowners for more to be done.
The candidates have not offered detailed plans of how to respond to the crisis, although Mr. Romney has opposed giving help to homeowners facing the loss of their homes, while Mr. Gingrich has faulted banks for being too quick to foreclose.
But seeing an opening to win over Florida voters on an issue that hits home, Mr. Romney on Monday attackedNewt Gingrich's ties to the giant mortgage lender Freddie Mac, saying Mr. Gingrich had profited while homeowners suffered.
In interviews across Florida over the last several days, likely Republican primary voters echoed sentiments similar to Mr. Brandon's, indicating that in a state where one in every 360 housing units is in foreclosure, and where the economy is lagging behind much of the rest of the nation, Mr. Romney's business background could serve him well because of perceptions that he might have a better sense of how the economy works than his Republican rivals.
But his past statements about allowing market forces to address the problem continue to be a challenge for Mr. Romney. Since arriving in Florida on Sunday, Mr. Romney has been slightly moderating his tone on foreclosures, telling people in Tampa Bay on Monday that ''the idea that somehow this is going to cure itself all by itself is unreal'' and, ''There's going to have to be a much more concerted effort to work with the lending institutions and help them take action.''
That is a shift in emphasis from an interview in October with the editorial board of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he said, ''Don't try and stop the foreclosure process,'' adding, ''let it run its course and hit the bottom.''
Mr. Gingrich has criticized banks as profiting from foreclosures, and has said he would like to repeal policies stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, which he says are keeping small banks from making loans. He wants to change the rules to encourage banks to do more short sales of so-called underwater properties.
Some of the anger over the foreclosure crisis is directed at President Obama, who many say has not done enough to address the issue.
In parts of Florida such as Homestead and Florida City, the anger driving some of the Republican vote is visible on the street. For several hours Saturday, Carols Castellano Triana, the owner of a painting business, held a hand-painted sign saying, ''Vote Republican'' at the busy intersection of Palm Avenue and Dixie Highway in Florida City, an area that has been ravaged by the housing implosion.
Mr. Triana is a renter with aspirations of owning a home. He is an undecided voter, but said he would most likely vote for Mr. Romney.
''I'm going to stand here every weekend until Obama's gone,'' said Mr. Triana, sweating in the blistering sun. ''My sign was going to be more nasty, but my family said, 'Somebody's going to shoot you.' ''
He continued, ''I can't explain the housing crisis, but I know that if the economy was better, everything would be better.''
In the condominium development where she lives in Homestead, Fla., south of Miami, Patricia Newlan said that 10 of 87 units are in foreclosure, which has driven up maintenance fees for everyone else and caused other problems. ''Honestly, I'm not sure what Romney intends to do specifically on that issue, but I'm leaning toward him,'' she said. ''He comes across as a smart businessman.''
John Briggs, a nuclear plant worker who lives in Islamorada, Fla., agreed, saying: ''I would like to hear what his plan is, but he's had an impressive career. I have more faith in him than the others to turn the economy around.''
Chris Vellanti, who lives in Tampa, is a real estate investor still recovering from the loss of three of his five properties to foreclosure in 2009. ''I'm going to vote for Romney by default,'' he said. ''I'm a product of my environment, being born and raised by staunch Republicans. I'm a believer in laissez-faire. And I'll take any Republican over Obama.''
Mr. Vellanti continued: ''My brother is a Realtor, and I don't think he's sold a house in a year. I blame the recession on the Democrats in Congress that wanted everyone to own a home, even if they couldn't afford it.''
Analysts expect downward pressure on home prices and foreclosures to hamper the Florida real estate market for at least the next two years.
''The fact is that there's no easy answer, no magic bullet that some candidate is going to think of,'' said Brad Hunter, a chief economist for Metrostudy, a firm that analyzes housing and development across the country. ''A candidate talking to Floridians is going to be asked, 'What are you going to do to help us?' And there's no easy answer.''
For the moment, Mr. Romney seems to be relying on optimism.
''It will get better,'' he said at a round-table discussion on Monday morning in Tampa, speaking to a woman at risk of losing her home. ''It won't always be like this. This is a detour.''

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. Counterweight to Obama, but So Far Just in Speech Response

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In tapping Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana to deliver Tuesday's Republican response to the State of the Union address, Congressional leaders wanted a sober figure, noted for his seriousness on fiscal matters and unencumbered by the presidential nomination fight roiling the party.
But the sight of Mr. Daniels on national television is sure to raise wistful ''if onlys'' in a Republican establishment that had put the governor at the top of its wish list for a White House run. 
Aides to Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, say their choice was not meant to elicit another round of hand-wringing over the contentious Republican presidential field. The House got its pick last year with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, then the new chairman of the House Budget Committee. There were not many senators who were not locked in re-election fights or mentioned as possible vice presidential nominees. And too many prominent governors had already picked sides in the presidential fight.
''Mitch Daniels is a successful two-term governor with an extraordinary record of fiscal responsibility and job creation,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''He provides a great contrast to President Obama's policies.''
But in Washington and elsewhere, the hand-wringing has begun nonetheless, driven not only by the spotlight on Mr. Daniels but also by the tumultuous rise of former Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a figure well known to Republicans on Capitol Hill -- and the failure so far of Mitt Romney to unite the party.
''At this point it's sort of water over the dam,'' said Pat Kiely, president of the Indiana Manufacturers Association and a friend of Mr. Daniels. His decision to sit it out is ''one that will always be in the back of the mind of the governor who thinks after watching the debates and the first three primaries that he could have been a contender.''
A new online petition drive was launched Saturday night by the Web site runmitchrun.com. William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and one of Mr. Daniels's most vocal cheerleaders, posted a picture of the motorcycle-riding governor on his blog this weekend under the headline, ''A Candidate to Be Drafted Later?''
Some Republicans see a scenario where Mr. Gingrich triumphs in the Florida primary, igniting an effort to lure someone like Mr. Daniels or former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida into the race as a foil to the former speaker.
It seems unlikely, given that none of those frequently mentioned as an establishment white knight have exhibited any interest in jumping in. Plus, ballot rules would limit their participation in future primaries. Still, the conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin posted an open letter to Mr. Daniels and nine other party stalwarts, begging: ''One of you can run yourself. Or you can instead collectively get behind a not-Gingrich candidate. But really, if you are to have a Republican Party to lead one day in the future, you can't very well do nothing.''
Al Hubbard, a former director of President George W. Bush's National Economic Council and a confidant of Mr. Daniels's, said there's ''no question there continues to be'' regrets over Mr. Daniels's decision not to run.
''I am supporting Romney, but obviously my first choice was Mitch Daniels, and I'm disappointed he didn't run,'' said Mr. Hubbard, an Indiana businessman.
Jane Jankowski, the governor's spokeswoman, again sought to put the speculation and hopes to rest. ''If I've heard him answer it one time I've heard it a thousand times. He believes there are other ways he can contribute,'' she said, including the address he will deliver Tuesday.
Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell asked him just before Christmas to give the State of the Union response, always a difficult assignment after the pomp of the presidential speech.
''Certainly no one would volunteer for this assignment,'' Ms. Jankowski said.
The notion that Mr. Daniels could have been -- and might still be -- a unifying standard bearer lingers more in Washington Republican circles than the Tea Party-saturated Republican electorate at large, said Dave Funk, co-chairman of the Republican Party in Polk County, Iowa. Mr. Daniels is a strong voice on fiscal discipline, but he also stirred opposition by calling for a truce on social issues within the party.
Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina party chairman, said: ''The Republican base has sobered up and said: 'I'm not going to do what Washington says or what the editorial pages say. I'm going to vote for the guy who's got my back.' ''
But fear within the Republican establishment is rising again. ''All of us want to see a coalescing behind a nominee so we can go into a debate with the incumbent president,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader.
Confidants of Mr. Daniels share that concern, but they say Indiana is not about to bail out a splintered Republican Party. They say Mr. Daniels is likely to deliver a shorter, perhaps more sober version of a speech he gave to the American Conservative Union's Conservation Political Action Conference last year when he spoke of a ''new Red Menace,'' the ''debts our nation has amassed for itself over decades of indulgence.''
But unlike that speech, Tuesday's speech will not be a trial balloon for a presidential campaign, Mr. Hubbard said. The only reason Mr. Daniels qualified to give it was his status as a noncombatant.
''I wish he were disqualified for the fact that he's running for president,'' he said, ''but he's not disqualified.''

HEADLINE: The Gusts of Gingrich

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Not long ago, a veteran Republican strategist told me that a politician could succeed with his zipper down, but not with his words unbridled.
He was talking about Newt Gingrich, and was saying that Gingrich's philandering and three marriages weren't going to be his real problem, given how many men in government had been forgiven for messy sexual pasts.
His greater liabilities were his wildly mixed messages, gross overstatements and insistence on inserting himself -- like some mouthy Gump doppelganger with a doctorate -- into every key moment of the late 20th century. Gingrich was supposed to bloviate his way into oblivion. 
Instead he bloviated his way to a 12-point victory in South Carolina and a credible shot at the Republican nomination. Grandiosity, it turns out, is good.
In fact he has doubled down on it. Quadrupled down, really. Although under fire since his previous surge two months ago for all his self-aggrandizing exaggerations, he hasn't grown careful or bashful or anything of the sort. Neither has the team around him.
In late December, when it was announced that he had failed to qualify for the Virginia primary, a campaign official compared the blow to Pearl Harbor.
''Newt and I agreed that the analogy is December 1941,'' wrote the official, Michael Krull, on the candidate's Facebook page. I wonder which grim historical milestones they considered and rejected before finding consensus on that one.
In Monday night's debate, Gingrich characterized the end of his Congressional career after the 1998 midterms as wholly volitional, making his exit sound like a self-sacrificing blaze of glory rather than the acrimonious firestorm it was.
With Gingrich, the distance between reality and rhetoric isn't shrinking but growing, and the incongruities mount. He has lately fallen in love with his rants against ''the elites,'' and casts himself as their most determined foe, but I can't for the life of me figure out a definition of elite that doesn't include him.
Are the elites those hyper-educated intellectuals who use big words? Gingrich has a Ph.D. in history from a prestigious private university, Tulane, and when it suits him, he plays Cerebellum in Chief with nonpareil diction and derision.
Are the elites rich people with fancy ZIP codes? He and his third wife, Callista, made more than $3.1 million in 2010 and have an estimated net worth in excess of $6.5 million. Since 2000 they have lived in the posh enclave of McLean, Va., not Appalachia, and have personally stimulated the economy with expenditures at Tiffany, not Zales.
He lashes out against secularists and trumpets his and Callista's Roman Catholicism, though the two of them lived for six years in explicit defiance of its tenets.
Mitt Romney's reinventions pale beside Gingrich's. At one moment, in one passage of oratory, Gingrich is the only stick-to-his-guns conservative running. At another moment, in another passage, he's a seasoned practitioner of compromise, as proved by the Clinton years.
He's also a longtime Washington insider who's the only reform-minded outsider equipped to change the capital's ways. How does that work?
In contesting his second wife's claim on ABC's ''Nightline'' that he had requested an open marriage, he accused the news media of a special anti-Republican zeal, conveniently forgetting how that same media -- with his gleeful encouragement -- pounced on the moral failings of President Clinton, a Democrat.
He rails that the media can't be trusted, then readily cites any dispatch that cuts in his favor as unassailable truth. He did this on Monday on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' invoking a New York Times article from 2008 as part of his defense against Romney's charge that he has lobbied lawmakers.
He had initially been slated to appear on ABC on Sunday, on ''This Week,'' but canceled after the network's ''Nightline'' report. He did competing networks' Sunday shows instead.
By Monday, though, he was ready to heed the siren call of George Stephanopoulos, his pique with ABC as transitory as his ire at CNN's John King last week was inflated. It's all one hyperbolic -- and, in its way, brilliant -- performance.
For a Republican electorate looking for heat, he delivers gust upon gust of hot air. Romney manages only a tepid breeze.
''I have emotion and passion,'' Romney told the anchor Chris Wallace on ''Fox News Sunday,'' in a voice that communicated neither. Twice more he mentioned passion, as if willing it into his bones.
Wallace played a clip of Gingrich's South Carolina victory speech, noting how fiercely angry at the state of the country Gingrich seemed.
Romney said that he himself was ''very upset.''
Most Democrats are elated. Gingrich seems to them a weaker opponent for President Obama than Romney would be. They're rooting for him.
But unbridled words have an unexpected currency right now. And one ill-timed, major economic relapse could give the general-election advantage to any Republican nominee, including Gingrich, whose bombast would then get the loudest microphone in the world.

HEADLINE: A Loophole Poses Risks to Investors in Chinese Companies

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI - Jack Ma, the chairman of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, surprised investors last May when he acknowledged that he had transferred the assets of the company's online payment platform to a private company that he controlled.
Executives at Yahoo, which owns around 40 percent of the privately held Alibaba Group, complained that they had not been properly informed of the move, and that the Alibaba board did not approve the transfer.
While the dispute was later resolved, it raised questions about the risks of investing in Chinese companies using a little-known regulatory loophole. Legal analysts scrambled to explain that investments in China's Internet industry, among others, had hidden risks, and that government scrutiny of the loophole was increasing.
''There's still a lot of uncertainty,'' Steven Xiang, the Shanghai-based managing partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the American law firm, said. ''No regulatory changes have occurred yet. But investors need to consider their risk appetite.'' 
For years, big Internet companies in China, like Alibaba and Baidu, have raised billions of dollars by effectively skirting Chinese regulations that ban foreign investors from acquiring stakes in companies operating in restricted industries, like energy, telecommunications and the Internet.
Using a complex investment vehicle known as the variable interest entity - or V.I.E. - Chinese companies have been able to accept money from foreign investors through offshore entities they set up.
In the case of Alibaba, Mr. Ma controls a Chinese company that transfers its economic returns and governance structure to an offshore entity in the Cayman Islands. That vehicle, in turn, is contractually tied to the Alibaba Group and the Hong Kong-listed Alibaba.com, which it operates.
Sina.com was one of the first to use this complex arrangement. But virtually every major Chinese Internet company has adopted a similar structure.
Worries about United States-listed Chinese companies using this regulatory loophole are often confused with efforts by much smaller Chinese companies to list in the United States through so-called backdoor listings, or by acquiring the shell of an American company and merging Chinese assets into it. Companies using that method came under attack last year because of accounting scandals.
There is no relationship between the two. But last year, investors grew nervous about Chinese stocks, and short-sellers tried to capitalize on the concerns to pummel the share prices of United States-listed Chinese companies.
Chinese companies using the V.I.E. structure are generally much larger and include many of the most profitable young companies in China.
Private companies often chose this route because they had difficulty raising capital in China, where state-run banks tend to favor government-owned companies.
That is perhaps one reason Chinese regulators long ago gave tacit approval to such arrangements. As a result, about 108 of 225 Chinese companies listed on Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange use the V.I.E. structure, according to a study done by Fredrik Oqvist, an independent analyst in Beijing.
But in recent years, the Chinese government has grown increasingly uneasy with the arrangement. Several regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce and the central bank, have questioned the viability of the complex structure in public statements.
Last October, some Western law firms cautioned clients that the China Securities Regulatory Commission had written an internal memo raising doubts about the V.I.E., noting that ''foreign parties with unknown motives own significant stakes in major Chinese Internet enterprises.''
Legal experts, though, doubt Chinese regulators will abolish the practice or even force big Chinese companies to unwind their structures any time soon.
''That'd be like taking a knife to about 80 U.S.-listed companies that have used this structure over the past 12 years,'' said Lawrence Sussman, managing partner in the Beijing office of O'Melveny & Myers, the United States law firm. ''This structure is unlikely to go away.''
But many legal analysts say the risks are real.
''We've developed a structure that's fraught with risk,'' said Paul Gillis, a visiting professor of accounting at Peking University in Beijing. ''And until recently, I don't think investors realized the risks. The Alibaba case is the one that set some of this off.''
Alibaba said it had no choice but to transfer the assets of its online payment platform, Alipay, to a private company controlled by Mr. Ma after Beijing regulators tightened controls over online payment systems and threatened to make the operations of Alipay illegal. That could have posed dangers to Alibaba's fast-growing e-commerce unit, Taobao.
An Alibaba Group spokesman, John Spelich, said that the disagreement with Yahoo was resolved and that worries about the V.I.E. structure were exaggerated.
The V.I.E. structure ''is a longstanding, well-recognized and legally compliant model, and there is no indication that it is about to change with regard to responsible companies that play by the rules,'' he said in a statement. ''As far as I am concerned, last year's entire V.I.E. controversy was nothing but a tempest in a teapot that benefited the shorts and excited the traditional critics of China and open international trade and investment.''
But some critics saw Alibaba's move as a sign that Mr. Ma, the company's chairman, could move a valuable piece of the Alibaba Group off the books to hide its value from one of its biggest shareholders, Yahoo.
At the time of the move, Alibaba and Yahoo had been at odds over Yahoo's stake in the company. The Alibaba Group remains one of Yahoo's most valuable assets, and Alibaba has been pressing Yahoo to give up that stake and sell it back to Chinese investors.
The dispute was resolved in July, when Mr. Ma agreed to certain conditions. If Alipay goes public with a stock offering, Alipay will pay the Alibaba Group - which is partly owned by Yahoo and Softbank of Japan - at least $2 billion but no more than $6 billion, plus certain licensing fees.
If Yahoo disposes of its stake ahead of an Alipay stock offering, its stake in Alibaba will most likely be adjusted to reflect Alipay's value before an offering, analysts say. A sign of confidence in the deal came when last September, when an investment group that included Silver Lake Partners and DST Global agreed to pay about $1.6 billion to acquire a stake in the Alibaba Group, valuing the company at about $32 billion.
Still, the controversy over Alipay leaves open many questions, analysts say. Chief among them is who really controls Alibaba and other Chinese companies that use the V.I.E. structure - the global investors who financed the companies, or the Chinese who control the local operation.
Steven M. Dickinson, a lawyer who has worked in China for years at the United States law firm Harris & Moure, said global investors were ignoring risks. While the Chinese government may not soon move to unravel the deals, it could do so at any time, he says. And if it is to their advantage, the local Chinese owners could also dismantle the structure without approval.
''It's prohibited for foreigners to own an Internet company of any kind in China - not discouraged, but prohibited,'' Mr. Dickinson said. ''Every lawyer agrees that if this goes to court in China, those contracts are void; they're illegal.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Pledge: We Can Bash Each Other. They Can't.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
9:45 p.m. Updated BOSTON - Senator Scott P. Brown and Elizabeth Warren, his likely Democratic opponent, agreed Monday on a plan to try to stop outside groups from running attack ads in their high-profile, high-stakes race. But while they labored over a mutually acceptable agreement, the hardest part - trying to enforce it - comes now.
The agreement requires each side to donate to a charity of the other's choosing whenever a third-party ad is aired supporting them or attacking their opponent. Both parties will also sign letters to outside groups and to television station managers, calling on them to stop running ads in the race. 
But Brett Kappel, an election lawyer at the firm Arent Fox, said there was ''zero'' chance that all such groups would comply, no matter how much pressure Mr. Brown and Ms. Warren exert.
''There just isn't much they can do legally to put a stop to it,'' Mr. Kappel said in an e-mail, adding that ''people who want to affect the outcome of this race will do what they want, regardless of what the candidates would prefer.''
Mr. Kappel also predicted that television stations, which reap the financial benefits of outside advertising, would not go along with the plan. ''Even if they didn't have an economic incentive,'' he said, ''they wouldn't want to be accused of being a censor for one or both campaigns.''
The agreement came after more than a week of tense correspondence between the two candidates over the issue, including a meeting between campaign aides on Friday that failed to produce a final plan. Mr. Brown, who is seeking his first full term after winning a special election for the seat in 2010, was the first to propose a ban on third-party advertising, saying that third-party ads ''spend millions of dollars from anonymous donors portraying their opposition unfairly and misleading voters.''
Ms. Warren quickly agreed to call for an end to such ads, but the two sides haggled over how to put teeth in their agreement. On Friday, Ms. Warren said Mr. Brown's proposal had ''loopholes that Karl Rove could drive a tank through.'' Mr. Rove, the Republican strategist, helped found a ''super PAC,'' American Crossroads, whose affiliate, Crossroads GPS, has already spent more than $1 million on ads attacking Ms. Warren.
At the same time, two outside groups -- the League of Women Voters and the League of Conservation Voters - have spent about $2 million on ads attacking Mr. Brown's environmental record.
On Monday, Navin Nayak, senior vice president of campaigns for the League of Conservation Voters, said his group would try to comply with the plan. ''While we cannot take direction from any candidate on our independent activities,'' Mr. Nayak said in a statement, ''we are inclined to respect the People's Pledge agreed to by Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown.''
The League of Women Voters was more noncommittal, with its national president, Elisabeth MacNamara, saying in a statement that the ads it ran about Mr. Brown's environmental record in April 2011 were ''not in support or opposition of any candidate but in support of the Clean Air Act.''
''The only votes we are interested in influencing are the votes in Congress,'' Ms. MacNamara said.
Steven Law, president and CEO of American Crossroads, said that because the agreement still allowed union phone banks, direct mail advertising and get-out-the-vote operations, the agreement had ''loopholes the Teamsters could drive a truck though, the longshoremen could steer a ship through, the machinists could fit a plane through, and government unions could drive forklifts of paperwork through.''
Another independent group, which is called Rethink Brown and aims, according to its Web site, to ''encourage Massachusetts voters to make up their own minds about U.S. Senator Scott Brown's actual record and potentially 'rethink' their initial opinions about him,'' said it would suspend its advertising in the race, ''provided that other third parties do the same.'' The group said in a statement that it would get out its message through the internet and the news media instead.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Occupy Protesters Build Igloos in Switzerland to Protest Economic Summit

BYLINE: SARAH MASLIN NIR


HIGHLIGHT: Occupy movement protesters planned an igloo village near the Congress Center building, where nearly 3,000 representatives from more than 100 countries are expected. 

 BODY:
The eviction of Occupy Wall Street from Zuccotti Park in November left protesters without the physical birthplace of the movement around which to rally, and put something of a chill on the endeavor. In Switzerland, protesters of the World Economic Forum have made the movement even chillier.
In preparation for the economic summit of world leaders, which begins on Wednesday in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland -- where daytime temperatures have hovered around 23 degrees Fahrenheit and dipped to around 10 degrees at night with a dusting of snow -- protesters are carving out igloos from the packed powder. 
The plan to build a small igloo village near the Congress Center building, where nearly 3,000 representatives from more than 100 countries are expected, launched on Saturday. Calling for others to join them, the "Occupy WEF" group states the goals of constructing the igloo village on its Web site:
Every year, self-proclaimed «global leaders» allegedly committed to improving the state of the world meet up for the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss mountains to propagate their own businesses and network amongst the so-called global economic elite.
This year, we will not let them exclude us, the 99%! We say: occupy WEF!
The Associated Press put out a video of the protesters at work on their frigid shelters. In it, they use shovels and saws to carve out thick blocks of white snow, which they shape and fit together into igloos about half the size of a compact car: 
As well as the igloos in Davos, some Mongolian-style tents, called yurts, were erected, according to Occupy WEF'sTwitter feed. Each igloo sleeps about two people, according to Reuters. The protesters expect to house about 50 people in them as well as establish field kitchens and some heated tents.
On their Web site, there's also a map that shows how to get to the igloo encampment (what looks to be a parking lot) from the local transport link:

For those who wish to attend, the Web site How Stuff Works has illustrated step-by-step instructions on how to build an igloo. 
And while some toiled in the snow, Bloomberg reports that in the nearby ski resort town of Klosters the annual snow polo tournament carried on in high style.

HEADLINE: At Davos, a Big Issue Is the Have-Lots vs. the Have-Nots

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: The growing income inequality between the ultrarich and the middle class is now debated in arenas where the primacy of laissez-faire capitalism was once taken for granted. 

 BODY:
8:12 p.m. | Updated 
DAVOS, Switzerland - A year ago at the World Economic Forum here, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, lashed out at what he saw as unfair criticism of the world's financial wizards.
"I just think this constant refrain, 'bankers, bankers, bankers' - it's just a really unproductive and unfair way of treating people," he said. "People should just stop doing that."
 After several years of financial crisis, during which the word banker had become a catchall epithet for the undeserving rich, the global economy appeared to be on the mend. Perhaps the bankers, and the other millionaires and billionaires, could wear their pinstripes with pride again and get back to business as usual.
Yet even as Mr. Dimon was speaking, a new wave of anger was welling up, one that, over the last year, would shake up old assumptions about the ultrarich, the middle class and the growing gulf that separates them.
Today, the gap between the haves and the have-nots is no longer just a rallying cry to incite anticapitalist advocates. It has become a mainstream issue, debated openly in arenas where the primacy of laissez-faire capitalism used to be taken for granted and where talk of inequality used to be derided as class warfare.
In the United States, the issue surfaced when protesters proclaimed they were the "99 percent" of the population who were paying for the sins of the wealthy "1 percent," taking their grievances directly to the epicenter of capitalism. The Occupy Wall Street protests, which began in New York, spread to other cities around the United States and across the world.
In Spain, thousands of "indignados" converged on Madrid and other cities to vent their frustration over mass unemployment and government austerity measures. In the Arab world, a wave of unrest that toppled governments began with a protest over a lack of economic opportunities in Tunisia.
And now, as the Republican Party chooses a nominee for the United States presidential election, rivals of one candidate, Mitt Romney, are rounding on him over his wealth and his background in the private equity business.
Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, in a recent report, named the growing income divide as one of the biggest risks facing the world in the years to come.
"In developed economies, such as those of Western Europe, North America and Japan, the social contract that has in recent decades been taken for granted is in danger of being destroyed," the report said, warning of the threat of a "dystopian future for much of humanity."
In the past, the conventional wisdom among those attending the World Economic Forum - at least among the corporate executives who pay their way, rather than the officials from government, academia and nonprofit groups who are invited - was that a wide level of inequality was an acceptable price of progress. Economic envy might even be desirable, the thinking went, if it fueled the desire that drives entrepreneurship and innovation. A rising tide of economic growth would then lift all the boats: the supertankers of the rich, to be sure, but also the dinghies of the poor.
Few Davos men or women would have questioned the views of Arthur M. Okun, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who argued in a 1975 book, "Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff," that countries faced a choice between equality and economic growth; level, Scandinavian-style societies were doomed to fall behind.
"We can't have our cake of market efficiency and share it equally," he wrote.
Over the last year, however, with economies - at least in many Western countries - struggling to recover, a growing number of voices have risen to question this logic. Some inequality is inevitable, of course. But not only is too much inequality bad for society, they say, it may be bad for growth, too.
In a study published last year, Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry, of the International Monetary Fund, analyzed the long-term economic performance of countries, then fired a broadside at Mr. Okun's conclusions, saying those with more even divisions of the spoils often grew faster.
"A rising tide lifts all boats, and our analysis indicates that helping raise the smallest boats may help keep the tide rising for all craft, big and small," they wrote.
The rapid growth of Asian economies in the last few decades has contributed to this change in perceptions, because countries like Vietnam have developed differently from their counterparts in the West, said Hans Rosling, a Swedish doctor who co-founded the Gapminder Foundation, which analyzes public health statistics.
"In the past, economic growth came first, then you got education, health and two-child families," he said. "Now it is the reverse. If you have education, health and two-child families, then you get economic growth."
Beyond the chants of the "99 percent" crowd, there is considerable evidence that inequality is on the rise in many places.
According to a report published last December by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the association of free market democracies, the share of after-tax household income that went to the top 1 percent of earners in the United States more than doubled in less than three decades, to 17 percent in 2007 from 8 percent in 1979.
Across the 34 countries that make up the organization's membership, the average income of the richest 10 percent of the population is nine times that of the poorest 10 percent. Even in countries like Denmark, Germany and Sweden, which have traditionally been more egalitarian than the United States or Britain, this ratio has risen to six to one now from five to one in the 1980s.
What is especially worrying to policy makers is the correlation between inequalities in income and wealth, and other criteria like education and health. The rich eat better and smoke less. They are better educated. They live healthier and longer lives.
One recent study, by the London Health Observatory, showed a widening gap in male life expectancy between rich and poor parts of London. In the well-to-do area of Queen's Gate, for example, it was 88; in Tottenham Green, near where riots that spread across large parts of London began last summer, male life expectancy was 71.
Such divides are not limited to the West. According to Gapminder, the average income in Shanghai, for example, is about 10 times the level in Guizhou, a less developed Chinese province. The difference in the infant mortality rate is even greater, with such deaths occurring less than one-twelfth as often in Shanghai.
To some extent, such differences have always existed between rich and poor. What is new, analysts say, is the extent to which they have risen in individual societies and the extent to which they are being passed from one generation to the next.
Some studies have shown declines in social mobility in the United States - where the idea that anyone could rise from humble roots was always a big part of the American dream - and in Britain, thwarting efforts to dismantle traditional class barriers.
"There's a deep sense that, hang on a minute, why is this not working for us anymore?" said Michael Marmot, a University College London professor who is chairman of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organization. "If there's one thing we should all believe in, it is that every generation should have a fair chance, and that's not happening."
Analysts have put forth several theories to explain the rise in inequality and waning social mobility. Some blame globalization, which has made it easier to outsource jobs to low-income locations and has fostered the creation of a class of high-flying, high-earning, stateless executives - Davos men and women, among them - who compete in an expanded, global job pool.
Others say changes in the social fabric have played a big role. A rise in single-parent families keeps some households locked in poverty, they say, while a phenomenon called assortative mating - in which men and women increasingly look for partners from similar social classes, rather than marrying above or below their station - has tightened the ranks of the wealthy.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study contends that neither globalization nor changes in family structure are the main culprits. It identifies rapid technological change and the deregulation of job markets as the main drivers.
How should policy makers respond? The O.E.C.D. says job creation is crucial, with investments in education. What may be more controversial, the group says tax and welfare policies should be reviewed, especially in situations where the part of the tax burden borne by high-income earners has declined in recent years.
Some wealthy people have gone further. Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire who founded the investment company Berkshire Hathaway, called last summer for higher taxes on the rich, saying it was time to stop "coddling" the wealthy. In Europe, prominent chief executives in France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere have issued a similar call.
Others say that this self-flagellation is misguided. Raising taxes on high earners or restricting their pay will do nothing to increase economic growth or to create jobs, said Ben Verwaayen, chief executive of Alcatel-Lucent, the French telecom company.
To stimulate sluggish Western economies, he said, policy makers must make the tough fiscal choices needed to bring budget deficits into line, increasing business confidence. And in Europe, he said, restrictive employment rules should be loosened to encourage companies to hire.
"If you are standing outside the job market today and you think inequality is the problem, you have an ugly surprise coming," Mr. Verwaayen said. "If you want to kick the cat, kick the cat. If it makes you feel better, fine. But if the pie is not growing, we're not going to create jobs."
Maurice Levy, chief executive of the advertising company Publicis Groupe, based in Paris, also said that measures to promote growth were crucial. But Mr. Levy, one of the signatories of an open letter to the French government calling for higher taxes on the wealthy, said it was only fair, when governments were cutting welfare spending to bring budget deficits into line, that the rich should share the burden.
"When you have this situation of fear, and little hope of getting out of the dark, there is also anger," he said. "People see that there is a minority of people who are well off. This anger should be taken into account by the people who are, if not their target, their preoccupation."

HEADLINE: Amid Attacks on Private Equity, Efforts to Study Its Value

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Evidence of the private equity industry's ability to create value is surprisingly uncertain, the Deal Professor says, but some university researchers found that acquisitions did benefit some companies. 

 BODY:
Controversy swirls around private equity as attacks on Mitt Romney and the entire industry mount. Amid the name-calling, little in the way of evidence has been cited. So let's take a look at some of the best research on this issue.
Does private equity "strip and flip" companies, leaving them for bankrupt? A paperlast year by Edith Hotchkiss at Boston College, David C. Smith at the University of Virginia and Per Stromberg at the Stockholm School of Economics gives a qualified no.
The authors examined a sample of private equity firms from 1997 through 2010. They found that companies bought by private equity firms did not default on their debt any more than other firms in a control group with similar debt levels.
Private equity-owned companies that defaulted were less likely to be liquidated and remained in bankruptcy for a shorter time than the companies in the control group. Some 11 percent of private equity-owned companies that declared bankruptcy were liquidated, compared with 16 percent for those without private equity backing.
Private equity ownership not only helped keep companies from filing for bankruptcy, but these companies were better able to survive financial distress. The authors speculate that this is a result of private equity's deep pockets and its ability to obtain more financing to aid distressed companies.
The study has an important caveat: The point of comparison was confined to companies with similar levels of debt. Private equity firms often borrow large sums to buy companies, placing significantly more debt on them than they would have otherwise. The authors did not look at companies with lower levels of debt.
But in a separate paper, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Mr. Stromberg estimated that private equity-owned firms had a default rate of 1.2 percent a year from 1980 to 2002. That compares with Moody's Investors Service's reported default rate of 1.6 percent for all corporate bond issuers in the United States in the same time period.
Private equity-owned companies may have a lower general default rate because of the better debt terms that sophisticated private equity firms can negotiate. For example, Moody's has found that an outsize number of companies owned by private equity firms avoided default during the financial crisis because they had so-called covenant-lite debt, which had fewer terms that could be violated.
Beyond default rates, evidence of the private equity industry's ability to create value is still surprisingly uncertain, given that the industry has more than 30 years of history. One of the reasons is that private equity firms do not generally publicly disclose the performance of their buyouts.
A new paper, however, finds evidence that private equity firms do add value. Adam C. Kolasinski and Jarrad Harford of the University of Washington examined 788 large private equity buyouts in the United States. They found that private equity-owned companies invested more efficiently than other companies, a fact the authors attributed to private equity firms' greater access to capital. The authors also found that the payment of large dividends to private equity firms, a common practice, did not create future financial distress.
Other recent papers looked mostly at Europe, where private company data is required to be made available and so performance of private equity companies can be accurately measured. These European papers also found that private equity firms improved operating performance in the non-American companies they owned.
All told, the evidence on net value creation has yet to be firmly established. The large and consistent returns of firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Blackstone Group show that money is being made, but not because private equity ownership creates better companies. At best, the evidence shows there may be value created, but it is not definitive.
Even if private equity firms do increase company performance, there is still the question of how.
One explanation may be better monitoring and supervision of management. Boards of private equity-owned companieshave been found to be smaller and meet more frequently. One draft study of European companies, by Viral Acharya of New York University and Conor Kehoe of McKinsey & Company , found that about two-thirds of chief executives of private equity-owned companies were replaced in the first four years of ownership. And private equity-owned companies have been found to better align the compensation of management with good performance than public companies, which are often accused of overpaying executives.
While it appears that private equity may benefit some companies, this does not mean they always add value to them. Instead, private equity firms may make their riches by taking advantage of other debt holders, benefiting from tax arbitrage or firing employees. Evidence from the 1980s shows that private equity often took advantage of other debt holders.
As for taxes, private equity clearly benefits from the tax deduction that debt offers. Although the evidence is mixed, academics still argue that this tax benefit in part gives private equity its riches. And others have argued that private equity makes the bulk of its money by leveraging companies, thereby pumping up equity returns.
As for employees, again the evidence is uncertain. But the most important paper on this issue was made public in 2008, and revised late last year. The authors - Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago, John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland, Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School and Ron S. Jarmin and Javier Miranda of the Census Bureau - found that after a private equity acquisition, a company's work force shrank by more than 6 percent on average. Private equity-owned companies, however, appear to be more creative in building new businesses and adding jobs, which offsets that loss. As a result, the net job loss for the average private equity acquisition turns out to be only about 1 percent greater than at other companies. This study has been criticized for not examining what the growth of companies would have been had they remained independent.
The evidence shows that private equity is a minimal job destroyer, and there are some indications that value is created. Private equity firms do not live up to their 1980s reputation as vulture capitalists stripping companies and leaving them for dead. To be sure, questions remain about whether that value comes at the expense of tax arbitrage or is merely a trick of financial engineering and leverage.
This does not mean that private equity firms deserve all of their wealth. It may be that they are overcharging for their services. Andrew Metrick of the Yale School of Management and Ayako Yasuda of the University of California, Davis, found that private equity firms made about two-thirds of their money not from their 20 percent share of the profits but from the fees they charged to operate the companies. Another study by professors at Yale and Maastricht University that was reported by The Financial Times on Tuesday found that 70 percent of private equity's earnings from 2001 to 2010 were paid to the firms themselves, not their investors.
There are also questions raised by Victor Fleischer of the University of Colorado Law School, among others, concerning whether private equity deserves a 15 percent capital gains tax treatment for its profits because this is really disguised income.
There is still more research to be done, research that the private equity industry could make easier if it provided more information. And none of these papers look at individual firms like Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's former firm. It may be that in individual cases, private equity firms do take advantage of companies. And even if value is created, it is small solace for those who lose their jobs in the wake of a private equity acquisition. Still, a look at the research shows that private equity is far from the evil some are calling it.

HEADLINE: Focusing on the Hidden History

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Born of the fervor of the 1970s, En Foco has gone from a community-based arts group to a national advocate for a dizzyingly diverse group of photographers. An exhibition at Sarah Lawrence College showcases that work. 

 BODY:
Perched somewhere above a "We Buy Gold" joint and a Latin restaurant on Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx, a darkroom turned storage closet was once a repository for an almost overlooked visual history. It was an unlikely spot for an equally unlikely - and unrivaled - collection that now comprises 700 photographs by Latino, African-American and Asian photographers and other artists of color.
Such were the origins of the permanent collection of En Foco, which started as a Latino photographers' group in 1974, when notions of community, art and ethnic pride fueled a movement that stood in defiance to the slights of the mainstream art world. Many of those groups have gone, victims of the vagaries of financing or the fickleness of curators, who might think the country is in a post-racial era.
Yet among its supporters, En Foco - where I worked after graduating from college in 1979 - continues to exist, though it long ago moved itself and its archives to offices at the Bronx Council on the Arts. It retains its mission to foster cultural diversity, encouraging up-and-coming photographers and challenging those who curate shows and publish books.
"It has a sense of history that is really great," said Deborah Willis, chairwoman of the department of photography and imaging at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. "It's not a post-racial world. I'm amazed when I attend exhibits, and I wonder: 'Where are the points of view of others? Where are the other voices?' This organization is important for curators, so many of whom don't have the time to seek out and look for new names."
An exhibition spanning several decades of work published in the group's Nueva Luz magazine opens Tuesday at Sarah Lawrence College. Next month, a selection of Jaime Permuth's work on the repair shops and scrapyards of Willets Point, in Queens, opens at the Pregones Theater in the Bronx. And in May, Ajira in Newark will host a show culled from the permanent collection.
Miriam Romais, the group's executive director since 2005, now hopes to bolster the collection through a federal grant, which will enable her to send it to other venues across the country. She is $15,000 shy of matching the $60,000 offered by the National Endowment of the Arts - not an easy task, given the competition for nonprofit financing.
"We got the grant around 2008, then the economy tanked," she said. "But we're keeping at it and not giving up. Like everything we do, you make it happen because you know the means will come."
A similar ethos guided the group in its early days, when its members - Puerto Rican photographers whose roots were in New York - embraced the idea of bringing art to the community. Under the eventual leadership of Charles Biasiny-Rivera, they banded together, offering encouragement to each other and a challenge to the outside.
In some ways, they were doing what others were exploring elsewhere in the city.
"There were these pockets of people who looked for ways to be sure the arts were delivered to their own community as well as the larger community," said Professor Willis, who fondly remembers similar efforts in Harlem. "We were all searching for ways to tell our stories, and these venues were available."
As the group grew, it took on other activities: exhibitions at banks and libraries, classes in public schools and evening classes for adults (inside a plastic-walled darkroom equipped with enlargers by Leitz and Bessler and a workhorse of an Omega D3). By the mid-1980s, it entered a new phase with the decision to publish Nueva Luz, which would feature three photographers and a critical essay in each issue.
"At the time there were all these magazines like Interview that looked like flags. Big things," said Frank Gimpaya, a photographer who came on board to handle graphic design duties. En Foco had other ideas, he said: "Let's do it an image a page, none of this art direction splitting it up."
In the pre-Internet era, the publication showcased the work of photographers who went on to wider acceptance and success. And its growing schedule of exhibitions brought attention to photographers who by now were not just Latinos. Among those who have shown or been published are Dawoud Bey, Carrie Mae Weems, Larry McNeil, Lola Flash and Sama Alshaibi. (Click here to download the latest issue of the magazine.)
Mr. Bey, who now teaches in Chicago, says En Foco exists alongside the mainstream institutions because it is as important. He said that it - and like-minded curators - highlight work long before the mainstream.
"I can't say the mainstream has a problem acknowledging photographers of color," Mr. Bey said in an e-mail message. "The mainstream has problems acknowledging work of substance by a whole lot of people. Part of it is continuing institutional ignorance. And another part of it has to do with the narrowness of discourse within the art world at any given moment, a narrowness which excludes a large range of work."
That's where the permanent collection comes in. Started almost as an afterthought when artists who had been in various En Foco shows donated prints, it has now become a resource with few equals in the United States, said Elizabeth Ferrer, who curated the traveling exhibition based on it. She sees it as a history that has been hidden from traditional accounts.
She singles out as an example the work of Luis Carlos Bernal, whose 1970s photos were brought to the attention of people on the East Coast when he participated in En Foco's "La Familia" show at El Museo del Barrio.
"Luis Carlos Bernal was really self-consciously the first Chicano photographer," said Ms. Ferrer, the director of contemporary art at BRIC Arts in Brooklyn. "What he said very emphatically was, 'I'm making this work for the people I photograph.' For the first time it was not an outsider, exploitative or exotic view of culture. It was a completely intimate and insider view."
A lot of the work En Foco championed in its early years had that documentary bent, exemplified by the images of Phil Dante, George Malave and Frank X. Mendez. Ms. Ferrer said there was a shift in the 1980s, when the work embraced not just color but also staged and constructed images, which would become commentaries on identity and the medium. More recently, she said, there has been a return to more documentary digital work.
Jaime Permuth is one who has embraced that tradition. In recent years, Mr. Permuth, who is originally from Guatemala and now works at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, photographed the immigrants who toil in a grimy stretch of Willets Point, among the scrapyards in the shadow of Citi Field. In some ways, he could relate to them.
"Having grown up in Guatemala in a small Jewish community, I always felt a double identity," he said. "In Israel, I'm part of the diaspora that does not speak Hebrew. In the U.S., I come here and have to start over again."
Which is why he connected with En Foco when he arrived in New York in 1991.
"En Foco was an obligatory stop for a Latino photographer in New York," he said. "It was the place where you did not feel so anonymous. You come here already feeling disconnected. You want a group of people who understand you, support you and you can identify with."

HEADLINE: Without Money in Place, 'Rebecca' Postpones Broadway Opening Until Next Season

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: "Rebecca," one of the Broadway season's most expensive musicals, has postponed its opening after producers couldn't raise all the money to capitalize the show. 

 BODY:
The producers of the Broadway-bound musical "Rebecca," which had been scheduledto begin performances on March 27, said on Tuesday that they were postponing the show until the 2012-13 season because they ran out of time to raise the production's $12 million capitalization. The musical, which had been set to begin rehearsals on Feb. 6, would have been one of the most expensive of the 2011-12 theater season, but the producers were widely known around Broadway to be struggling to raise the final 20 percent of the show's budget.
In a statement, one of the lead producers, Ben Sprecher, blamed their inability to recruit investors on "this very negative economy climate" and said, "raising money for Broadway has become even more difficult and laborious than it has historically been." 
"We are very close to meeting our financial goal, but we just ran short of time to complete capitalization with rehearsals slated to begin in two weeks," Mr. Sprecher continued. "We feel that 'Rebecca' is too special of a musical to short change in any way. It is our responsibility to the creators of this show, to our cast, our partners, our investors and our vendors that the complete financing is in place before rehearsals begin."
Raising money for Broadway shows has been a mixed proposition lately. A $12 million revival of "Funny Girl" fell apartlast fall when several investors pulled their money from that production, questioning its capacity to be profitable. Yet plenty of shows are expected to have their money in place for this season, including the other new musicals "Once," "Newsies," "Leap of Faith," "Ghost," and "Nice Work If You Can Get It." Some of these are coming to Broadway at half the cost of "Rebecca," while straight plays cost even less, usually around $3 million. 
Broadway producers often announce show performance dates, theaters, and actors to capitalize the show has been raised, to build buzz or convey commitment to potential investors in hopes that they will write checks.
"Rebecca" had secured a prime Broadway theater, the Broadhurst, on West 44th St. just off Times Square. There was no immediate word if another show would open at the Broadhurst by April 26, which is as the cutoff date for Broadway shows to be eligible for Tony Award nominations and awards.
"Rebecca," based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier (which was also adapted for film in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock), centers on the new wife of a wealthy Englishman, Maxim de Winter, and their spooky life on his estate, Manderley, which may be haunted by his dead first wife. Joan Fontaine played the second Mrs. de Winter in the film; on Broadway, the actress Sierra Boggess was to have played the character. The directors of the Broadway production were to be Michael Blakemore (a Tony winner for "Kiss Me, Kate") and Francesca Zambello ("The Little Mermaid"). Christopher Hampton ("Les Liaisons Dangereuses") wrote an adaptation of the musical's original book by Michael Kunze; the two men are also credited for the lyrics, with music by Sylvester Levay.

HEADLINE: Too Much Restraint? Or Not Enough?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: "European politicians have begun to insist quite publicly that austerity can no longer be the sole answer" to the region's economic pain, writes Liz Alderman. Even the staunchest supporters of financial rectitude are saying that you may have to spend some money to make some money. What do you say? 

 BODY:
''Austerity doesn't save. It sinks.'' So reads a somber mural on a concrete wall in Oporto, Portugal, depicting a nose-diving submarine. 
Portugal has enacted deep cuts to right its sinking ship, but the economic pain keeps coming - not only there but also in other austerity-zone countries. Now, "even some traditionalists within the policy-making fraternity are starting to worry that such slogans might be right," reports Liz Alderman. "Whether austerity will help revive economies over the long term is the subject of an intensifying debate, especially as much of Europe heads into what looks like its second recession in three years."
As part of the IHT's special Davos coverage, Liz writes that one of the big themes of the meetings this year will be an argument that is never quite settled: stimulus vs. austerity.
''It is clear that austerity alone is a recipe for stagnation and decline,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and professor at Columbia University in New York. ''The likelihood that things would work out well is extraordinarily small.''
The concern is that economies already in a slowdown will be weakened further by large cuts in national spending and by tax increases that governments are embracing to satisfy lenders and to placate the financial markets.
''You could say that if there's no austerity, growth might be higher,'' said Stefan Schneider, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ''But then again, no austerity would probably escalate the bond crisis in Europe, and then you would wind up with total chaos.''
Europe is not turning on the money tap - not much anyway - but even the staunchest supporters of financial rectitude are giving in to the need to spend at least some money to make some money. 
What do you say? Is it time to restrain restraint? Was austerity a doomed policy from the beginning? Or, on the contrary, is Europe still resisting making the changes that will bring long-term stability, not to mention solvency? And if you are a European, what would you be willing to give up to balance your country's books?

HEADLINE: Might Davos Be a Layover for Chinese 'Migratory Birds'?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs attending the World Economic Forum this week might well be conducting their due diligence before emigrating. A survey of 980 Chinese millionaires revealed that 60 percent had already left China or were considering it. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Chinese business executives have become increasingly prominent at the World Economic Forum in recent years, arriving with larger entourages and throwing splashier parties - as befits their enhanced economic standing. 
Some of the Chinese tycoons attending Davos this week - despite the conflict with the Lunar New Year celebrations back home - might well be conducting their due diligence before emigrating. A recent survey of 980 Chinese millionaires found that 46 percent of them were considering leaving China and another 14 percent had already emigrated or were completing the paperwork for relocating.
The survey by the Bank of China and the Hurun Report said 40 percent of the would-be émigrés - they're known as "migratory birds" in China - would aim for the United States, followed by Canada (37 percent), Singapore (14 percent), Europe (11 percent), Hong Kong (5 percent) and Britain (2 percent).
The leading reasons for taking flight: better educational opportunities for their children, advanced medical treatment, worsening pollution back home (especially urban air quality) and food safety concerns.
But many potential émigrés, not surprisingly, are working on a Plan B in case China's economic growth begins to slow, widespread social unrest takes hold or the political winds begin to blow against them.
"You get rich working with the government. If you don't work with the government, you may get nothing and you may lose everything," said Oliver Hua, a market researcher for Western companies in China, quoted in a National Public Radio report last week. You can listen to the story . 
"Many people have questions about the uncertainty surrounding China's economy, so they start looking for a second or third option," Leo Yang, the manager of a firm that helps wealthy Chinese applicants get residence visas, told NPR.
Mr. Yang said perhaps 10 percent of his potential customers were looking to stash ill-gotten money abroad - illegally. "Washing - we call it washing money," he said. 
Most Chinese investors quickly buy residential property when they emigrate, primarily as assets they can pass on to their families. Citizens can own houses and apartments in China - but not the land they sit on. That belongs to the state. 
A report by NTDTV quoted an investor from Shanghai who also was concerned about signals from Beijing about a curb on further privatizations.
"Does it mean another robbery of private assets?'' said the man, identified only as Mr Hu. "People think so. They're scared and want to run away.''
The United States has a ready-made program - the visas are known as EB-5s - for nervous Chinese and other foreign entrepreneurs: Investing $1 million in a commercial enterprise in the United States gets you a green card that ensures permanent residence. Or you can put $500,000 into a rural locale or an area with high unemployment. 
Any investment must create or preserve 10 full-time jobs for American workers within two years. The number of applicants to the investor visa program has nearly quadrupled in the past two years.
"Demand has grown so fast that the Obama administration, which is championing the program, is seeking to streamline the application process,'' according to a story by my colleagues Patrick McGeehan and Kirk Semple. of the program showed that its rules can appear somewhat elastic; critics of the program say it amounts to visa-selling by the United States government.
Of more than 3,800 EB-5 applicants last year, 2,696 were Chinese mainlanders. They received 934 of the visas, by far the most of any nationality. South Korea, Britain, Taiwan and India rounded out the top 5.
Canada has a similar investor visa program, although with an annual cap of just 700 visas, it has already closed for the fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Council Panel Upholds a Historic Skyscraper District in Brooklyn

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: The proposed five-block, 21-building district along Court Street in downtown Brooklyn had run into forceful opposition since its designation in mid-September. 

 BODY:
A historic district composed largely of early office towers in downtown Brooklyn was approved in its entirety Tuesday by the City Council's landmarks subcommittee, all but guaranteeing that the entire Council will ratify it in turn.
The vote, by the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Siting and Maritime Uses, was considered critical because the proposed five-block, 21-building district along Court Street had run into forceful opposition since its designation in mid-September by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. [The 57-page designation report, as a PDF file.]
Councilmen Brad Lander, who heads the subcommittee, and Stephen Levin, who represents the district, issued a joint statement. "After close consideration," they said, "we believe that this new historic district will strengthen the character of Downtown Brooklyn, allowing for new development and growth, like the new retail space planned for the Municipal Building, while preserving the graceful, historic, early-generation skyscrapers that make it Brooklyn's civic center."
The co-op board at 75 Livingston Street, arguably the most distinctive tower in the district, objected to the prospect of added scrutiny and review by the city, saying it had already invested more than $6 million and taken great care of the property, formerly the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce Building.
The Real Estate Board of New York raised the specter of a regulatory regime that would make it difficult for owners of even the most undistinguished buildings in the district to make alterations required to attract or keep tenants. "Landmarking will send costs skyrocketing for local residents and business owners," the board said in a mailing to the neighborhood. "In these economic times, when every dollar counts, landmarking threatens to send Court Street back to the 'bad old days' of empty storefronts and dirty streets."
But Mr. Lander and Mr. Levin said in their statement that new guidelines being proposed by the commission "will allow many more new and relocating stores - in Downtown Brooklyn and around the city - to obtain a quick, staff-level approval for exterior work (much of which currently requires a more extensive review and vote by the full commission)." They also called on the commission to "show maximum appropriate flexibility" in their dealings with the co-operators at 75 Livingston Street.
The vote in the subcommittee was 4-to-0, with 2 abstentions.

HEADLINE: Facebook's Sandberg Gently Warns Europe About Privacy Rules

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: As a struggling Europe considers a sweeping new privacy law, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, calls for a friendly regulatory environment that promotes innovation. 

 BODY:
Concerned about privacy? Maybe you should be concernedabout the economy instead. That was the subtext of a keynote speech by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, at a technology conference in the heart of Europe on Tuesday.
Ms. Sandberg's remarks at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich came as the European Commission prepares to release a draft of a strict privacy regulation that stands to affect companies like Facebook. The law would apply across the 27 countries of the European Union and restrict the way Internet companies can gather, use and retain the volumes of personal data that their users post online.
Ms. Sandberg's remarks offered a glimpse into the argument that global technology companies doing business in Europe are expected to raise against the looming data protection regulation: Internet companies create jobs and spur growth, and governments struggling with economic crises should not stand in their way.
"In a world where increasingly these countries, like all of ours, have challenges, this is a really unique bright spot for our economies," she said, referring to Internet businesses. "In Europe, in the United States, throughout the world, we need to make sure we are investing -- we are investing in technology, we are investing in basic education so that people can take advantage of these tools. We want to make sure we have the right regulatory environment -- a regulatory environment that promotes innovation and economic growth."
Facebook has not publicly said what it makes of the new would-be European privacy regulation, except to say that it hopes it will not stifle economic growth.
Ms. Sandberg sprinkled her 25-minute speech with examples of European companies that use the Facebook platform and how Facebook has helped European businesses, including Burberry, the luxury brand, reach customers.
She announced an offer of Facebook advertising credits worth 100 euros (about $130) for 50,000 small businesses. And she released the results of a report commissioned by Facebook that tallied the economic benefits of the social network. The report, prepared by the accounting firm Deloitte, estimated that Facebook, which has a global work force of about 3,000, indirectly helped create 232,000 jobs in Europe in 2011 and enabled more than $32 billion in revenues. Deloitte measured the company's "broad economic impact" by looking at a broad menu of things, including how many businesses had created Facebook pages to raise brand awareness, the applications developed for Facebook and Facebook's contribution to bolstering demand for devices and broadband connections.
"So the Internet and social media, it's not just posts and pictures and fun things with your friends," Ms. Sandberg offered. "But this is really serious stuff. This is about growth. This is about jobs."
That message is likely to be repeated at Ms. Sandberg's next stop: Davos, Switzerland, where she will be one of the leaders of the World Economic Forum, which starts Wednesday. Its theme this year is the transformation of the global economy.

HEADLINE: Mohegan Sun's Owners Seek to Restructure Debt

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, which owns the Mohegan Sun resorts in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, said it would begin a bond exchange and an effort to cut $200 million from its bank credit facility. 

 BODY:
The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, which owns the Mohegan Sun resorts in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, announced a series of moves on Tuesday aimed at refinancing the heavy debt load of the casino operations.
The tribal authority said it would offer to exchange $598 million worth of bonds for new notes that would carry the same principal balance. But the new debt will bear fewer restrictions on the authority's operations.
The authority also said it was seeking to cut about $200 million from its existing bank credit facility, reducing its loan debt to about $475 million.
The announcement is the latest effort by a casino operator to grapple with the reduced customer spending that has continued to haunt the industry. In particular, efforts to expand casino empires ran aground during the economic turmoil that began in 2008.
The Mohegans are not the only tribe seeking to restructure casino debt. In 2009, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation began efforts to reorganize the obligations of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.
Mohegan Sun has been on analysts' watch lists for some time. Last year, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the tribal authority's credit rating well into junk territory, citing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt maturing this year.
A Moody's analyst told investors last week that the authority still faced a "wall of debt" that included $21 million in interest payments due Feb. 21 and $250 million in loans coming due on April 1, according to The Associated Press.
The Mohegan tribal authority is being advised by the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Last month, the authority disclosed that it had also hired the Blackstone Group and Credit Suisse as financial advisers.

HEADLINE: Adding Up Those Coffees at Work

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Despite the weak economy, consumers are still splurging on the little things, a new survey finds. 

 BODY:
While a weak economy may have driven consumers to cut back, we know that they are still indulging on the little things.
 As we've been told over and over, those indulgences add up. According to a new survey, half of all American workers buy coffee regularly during work hours, spending more than $20 a week on java, or about $1,000 a year. (Workers 18 to 34 years old spend about twice as much, on average, as workers over 45.) Two-thirds of workers buy lunch instead of bringing something from home, and spend an average of $37 a week. That translates into nearly $2,000 a year - the price of a new piece of furniture or a vacation.
 The survey, which Braun Research conducted for Accounting Principals, a staffing firm that is a unit of the Adecco Group, has a margin of sampling error of 3.1 percent.
 Many workers simply do not budget for lunch or coffee, said Jodi Chavez, a senior vice president of Accounting Principals.
"They budget in new furniture or their commute, but not a coffee here or there," Ms. Chavez said. "So over the course of a week or month people don't realize what this expense is."

Ms. Chavez said that a "$3 cup of coffee is a little way to reward yourself and it's a nice little pick-me-up and a guilty pleasure," and added: "People tend to have an easier time dismissing those small expenses as a means to reward themselves. It's a little easier to hide the evidence of a cup of coffee than a big shoebox in the closet."
 Then again, it's not so easy to hide the credit card balance. When those polled were asked what kinds of financial changes they planned this year, 43 percent responded that they would "pay down my credit card debt or other outstanding bills." Just over a third said they would bring lunch instead of buying it. They were not asked about coffee.
As for me, I've brought in a new thermos and bought a box of teabags on the way into work today.

HEADLINE: Looking Past the Skepticism on Fate of the Euro

BYLINE: BRIAN CHILDS


HIGHLIGHT: A decade after the euro's birth as a full-fledged currency, the anniversary has been more a sickbed vigil than a celebration. Inconvenient fact seldom impedes the euro-skeptic narrative, argues Brian Childs in Another View column. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- A decade after the euro's birth as a full-fledged currency, the anniversary has been more a sickbed vigil than a celebration.
''At 10, euro fading as the great unifier,'' read a front-page headline in The International Herald Tribune on Dec. 31.
''Euro ends year as world's worst performing major currency,'' noted The Financial Times, which also featured a spoof on Aristophanes: ''The Euro Clouds,'' presented as a tragedy.
 The Clouds is a comedy, not a tragedy. But inconvenient fact seldom impedes the euro-skeptic narrative.
Over the years, the euro has been blamed for every economic ill under the sun, including inflation (forget about soaring crude oil, food and raw material prices) and high unemployment in countries like Spain and Ireland (forget that Spain, with an economy reliant on seasonal agriculture and tourism, was historically a country with unusually large numbers of jobless, while Ireland, before joining the European Union, was trapped in poverty and endured centuries of economic emigration).
Now, the euro crisis - or euro zone crisis, or euro zone sovereign debt crisis; the terms are used interchangeably - is blamed for spreading global investor angst.
Time for a fact check: The euro ended 2011 just below $1.30 and at 83.5 pence, up 38 percent against the dollar and up 30 percent against the pound compared with exchange rates of 94 cents and 64 pence a decade earlier.
True, it was down from just under $1.34 at the end of 2010, after trading as high as $1.49 in May. And against the pound it dropped more than 7 pence by year-end, or 8 percent, from a midyear 16-month high of almost 91 pence. It has since eased further, to just over $1.29, while holding steady against the pound as of the end of last week.
Still, there is a routine market reason for this. Unlike the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, whether rightly or not, started to tighten interest rates in April as the European economy pulled out of the 2009 global economic freeze. That gave the European Central Bank room to begin easing again in November, as the recovery faded.
Investors, and exchange rates, have simply followed the money.
Past results, as investment fund managers warn, are no guarantee of future performance, and the euro's failure either to collapse or to disintegrate is no proof of future health. Yet, oddly, the markets show little sign of the lack of confidence that analysts regularly discern in them. March contracts for the euro on the International Monetary Market in Chicago were priced at the end of last week at $1.2925 and 83.785 pence. A year further out, the March 2013 contracts are indicatively priced are $1.2974 and 83.835 pence.
The current skeptical narrative paints the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis as the shared currency's critical flaw, leading to inevitable disintegration under the weight of unsustainable interest rates in the most vulnerable countries, mostly on Europe's Mediterranean rim.
Fact: The International Monetary Fund estimates United States gross public debt in 2011 at 100 percent of gross domestic product - excluding off-the-balance-sheet liabilities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae - compared with 89 percent in the euro zone.
Fact: The Unites States public sector deficit stands at 10 percent of G.D.P. compared with 4 percent in the euro zone. I.M.F. projections show the United States public debt rising to 120 percent of G.D.P in 2016. They show euro zone public debt, on a comparable basis, peaking at 90 percent in 2013.
Interest rates on 10-year government bonds, as of the end of last week, were 2.025 percent in the United States and 2.111 percent in Britain. As of Friday, the average yield for all 10-year euro zone government bonds was 4.25 percent, according to the European Central Bank. But that rate hid a gaping split between 10-year German debt at 1.924 percent - and a 2.7 percent average for all the area's triple-A-rated 10-year government debt - and Greek rates at more than 28 percent.
The skeptical narrative sees Greece leaving the euro to seek salvation through competitive devaluation, so starting a contagion process leading to the collapse of the currency.
How Greece would benefit from adding a worthless currency and maybe hyperinflation to its woes is seldom explained: the history of competitive devaluations, whether in Europe before the euro, Latin America in the 1980s or the world in the 1930s, is not especially encouraging.
And even if Athens were forced to abandon the euro, why Greece's departure would bring down the whole currency is also open to question.
The euro has never experienced such a secession. But Britain, homeland of euro-skepticism, has. The pound survived the secession of Ireland, and even the disintegration in the 1970s of the sterling area, the once-imperial portion of the British Commonwealth that used the pound. It remains to be seen, perhaps, how well it may weather the departure of Scotland, which could probably afford to secede, and may one day do so, to join the euro zone.
For sure, Greece has a crisis, but its fiscal dysfunction puts it far out on a limb of its own. Contagion theorists see a Greek solvency crisis spreading to Italy, ignoring the reality that Italy runs a primary fiscal surplus, with its budget deficit entirely due to its interest payments on existing debt.
Conventional wisdom among market analysts puts interest rates on recent Italian government debt issuance on the wrong side of a 7 percent threshold said to signify the boundary of sustainability for sovereign debt.
The empirical evidence or theoretical reasoning behind this talismanic figure tends not to be explained, nor has it been shown how it fits with the variations in debt volumes, yield curves and maturity profiles from country to country. For historical perspective, it may be worth remembering that from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, yields on 10-year British government bonds almost never fell below 7 percent.
Crisis talk may serve the occasional interest of governments seeking traction for unpopular policies or difficult negotiations, and it certainly serves the interest of investors, by pushing up yields on government securities and creating opportunities for speculative gains on purchases of deeply discounted debt.
Markets proverbially run on a balance of fear and greed, and the 7 percent threshold may be a useful marker of market sentiment - the current inflection point at which fear takes over. Still, that seems a poor guide to long-term policy management.
Noninvestors may consider this: The euro ''crisis'' has dragged on through three years now, and through several rescue deals, starting with the nationalization of Anglo Irish Bank in January 2009, seemingly impervious to every attempted solution.
But nothing that rumbles on for three years is a crisis. Dictionary definitions of ''crisis'': a turning point in an acute emergency; a paroxysmal disorder; a decisive moment.
This is not just playing with words. Crises call for drastic solutions - the sort of medicine that cures the disease at risk of killing the patient. Europeans, the patients in this untested treatment, should beware of doctored economics and financial charlatans selling snake oil.

HEADLINE: Boston University, Where Academic Rigor Is de Rigueur

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: A survey by Boston University shows that students are more concerned with academics when searching for college than almost anything else. 

 BODY:
There is an assumption, including among more than a few incredulous parents, that high school seniors often choose their colleges based less on academic offerings than on softer factors like campus amenities (think climbing walls and walk-in, dorm-room closets), the ratio of men to women in the class and even the institution's tolerance for keg parties.
But, according to a study conducted by Boston University and reported in The Boston Globe, those parents (and other observers) would be wrong in that presumption.
The study, which surveyed over 1,000 prospective students, their parents, guidance counselors and Boston University freshmen, indicated that students were most concerned about the university's academic rigor.
"They wanted to understand who was teaching their classes, what expertise the faculty would bring to the classes, they want to understand why it's beneficial to have small class sizes, they want to hear student success stories, how a faculty member connected them to an internship in Boston," said Kelly A. Walter, assistant vice president and executive director of admissions at Boston University. "These students need to know that they're surrounded by bright, talented, inquisitive classmates and that their faculty members are distinguished and high caliber."
Ms. Walter said the study, which was completed over a year ago, had already informed some changes in the university's outreach to students. Rather than focusing on cushy residence halls and athletic facilities new campus literature tells students of the opportunities the university will afford them and the challenges awaiting them there.
"We've literally turned our message upside down," Ms. Walter said. "Whether it's our Web site, in our brochures we mail our students, it's clear that academics are our number one priority."
She added that the school had updated its Web site, become more engaged on social networking sites and printed a new viewbook, which says "I dare you" on the cover, last spring.
"It was really about coming out of the shadows and distinguishing our message from other private universities," she said.
Stephen P. Burgay, Boston University's vice president of marketing and communications, thought the focus on academics was because of the precarious economy.
"First, students want to be in the strongest possible position to compete for jobs and/or graduate schools, and that equates with academic challenge and achievement," Mr. Burgay wrote in an e-mail. "Second, given the very high cost of college, students are a lot more aware of getting a 'return on investment' and that, too, equates with academic and the reputation of the institution from which you graduate."
Ms. Walter said she had not heard of any other schools conducting a survey like Boston University's, but she thought it was invaluable to better understand what students seek in higher education.
"The competition for the best students is keener than ever," Ms. Walter said. "We have limited opportunities to make an impression. All of us live in this world of information overload, and we are competing for their undivided attention. That's why it's so important to make sure that what they are hearing and what they are reading from us speaks to them."

HEADLINE: Gates to Pitch His Charity Work at Davos

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: Bill Gates said he would bring cassava to Davos to underline a pitch for his foundation's efforts to eradicate hunger in places where food is scarce and crops are often blighted. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - Some people come to the World Economic Forum expecting caviar. Bill Gates said he would bring cassava.
"I don't know what Swiss customs will say about it," said Mr. Gates, chairman of Microsoft and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. "I'll put it in a nice plastic bag or something."
Assuming he makes it past the border guards, Mr. Gates is bringing the tubers - some of them healthy, others rotten - to Davos to underline a pitch for his foundation's efforts to eradicate hunger in places where food is scarce and crops are often blighted.
Since 2009, Mr. Gates has published an annual letter that details his foundation's work and sets priorities for the coming year. This time, the letter, which was set to be published Tuesday in Seattle, highlights the need for innovation in agriculture to improve nutrition in poor countries.
The foundation, the world's largest philanthropic organization, donates about $300 million a year to agriculture projects, a little more than one-tenth of its overall annual commitments. About half of the organization's money goes to health care, including efforts to fight diseases like AIDS, polio and malaria, and the rest is dedicated to education and other initiatives.
Last year, Mr. Gates's letter focused on the foundation's efforts to develop and disseminate vaccines. A milestone in the battle against deadly diseases was reached this month when the Gates Foundation and other groups announced that last year, for the first time, India had not recorded a single case of polio.
Mr. Gates said he had decided to emphasize agriculture this year because he felt it was not getting the necessary attention. At the same time, he added, the need for food is easily understood by the public because it is "so primary."
"We get a strong response on health issues," he said by telephone. "But when we show a farmer getting better sweet potatoes that are more nutritious, the response is even stronger."
The letter describes the plight of a farmer in Tanzania whose staple cassava crop has been infected by two diseases that have attacked the leaves of the trees as well as the roots, which are the edible crop. Cassava can be used to make a variety of foods, including tapioca.
"The billion people who wake up every day trying to figure out if they have enough food to eat won't be at Davos," said Mr. Gates. He added that the foundation's goal was to cut this number, calculated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in half by the end of the decade.
Mr. Gates is a longtime visitor to the forum, where the foundation and Microsoft typically have a strong presence.
Mr. Gates is not alone in paying more attention to the issue of hunger. Food has been a top item on the agenda at a series of meetings of international leaders in recent years. In L'Aquila, Italy, representatives of the Group of 8 major economies pledged in 2009 to spend more than $20 billion on the problem over three years.
Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said last year that recent increases in food prices had been an "aggravating factor" in the unrest that swept across the Arab world last year.
Yet Mr. Gates said he was worried about threats to aid in the current economic climate. A growing list of other concerns, like the crisis in the euro zone and the threat of conflict in Iran, could overshadow more basic issues, like the need to put food on the table.
As of last year, according to a Group of 8 report, only about one-fifth of the total pledges made in Italy in 2009 had actually been fulfilled. Similarly, Mr. Gates said he was concerned that financing commitments to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria were running behind the pledged amounts.
"The uncertainty level for aid is pretty scary right now," Mr. Gates said. "It's a real concern."

HEADLINE: Courtroom Window Opens on a Battle Between 2 Financiers

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Donald Drapkin, a millionaire, is suing Ronald O. Perelman, a billionaire who was once a best friend, for millions of dollars he claims he was owed after he left Mr. Perelman's company. 

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, Ronald O. Perelman and Donald Drapkin were the best of friends, a relationship cemented as the two financiers bought and sold companies like Revlon and Marvel Comics.
On Tuesday in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, court lawyers for Mr. Drapkin accused his now former friend of being a "nitpicking" boss who reneged on a promise to pay Mr. Drapkin the millions of dollars Mr. Drapkin says he is owed under a 2007 separation agreement, signed when Mr. Drapkin left MacAndrews & Forbes, Mr. Perelman's holding company.
"The company was scrounging around for any excuse not to pay Mr. Drapkin," Elkan Abramowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Drapkin, told the eight jurors hearing the case. "Do these nitpicking breaches really give the company the right to terminate contracts worth $16 million?"
The trial is to determine whether Mr. Perelman is required to honor Mr. Drapkin's agreement.
While the two men are battling over roughly $16 million, this is a fight largely about ego, with each man willing to spend potentially millions of dollars in legal fees to prove he is right. Mr. Perelman's net worth is estimated at more than $12 billion, and while Mr. Drapkin's net worth is not known, in court he said he never bothered to add up what he made during his time at MacAndrew & Forbes, estimating it was more than $200 million. Mr. Drapkin now runs a hedge fund in New York.
Mr. Perelman was not in court on Tuesday, but his name was invoked multiple times, and he is likely to testify later this week.
Mr. Drapkin did see some of his former colleagues, including Barry F. Schwartz, who is executive vice chairman and chief administrative officer of MacAndrews & Forbes. The two, who had worked together for years, sat near each other at the trial but did not appear to speak. On the stand, Mr. Drapkin, who was argumentative and often refused to directly answer many questions on cross-examination, commented that Mr. Schwartz once "promoted himself" to a new post at the company after the death of a colleague. Mr. Perelman's lawyer quickly objected to the comment.
At one point the judge overseeing the trial, Paul G. Gardephe, asked the parties to stop talking over each other.
"Try to leave the comments out," he warned MacAndrews & Forbes's lawyer, Matthew Menchel, who grew increasingly agitated during his questioning of Mr. Drapkin. "You know what a laptop is, don't you?" Mr. Menchel barked at Mr. Drapkin.
The trial centers on two issues: whether Mr. Drapkin failed to turn over documents required under his separation agreement and whether he tried to induce a key MacAndrews & Forbes executive to leave the company. Mr. Perelman says his old friend did both these things, leaving him no choice but to stop honoring the separation agreement.
Mr. Drapkin's lawyer argued in court that the separation agreement requires his client to hand over all corporate documents "not otherwise available to the company" and that Mr. Drapkin never had documents that weren't otherwise available to MacAndrews & Forbes.
Mr. Drapkin, however, remained in possession of hundreds of corporate documents that needed to be deleted in accordance with the separation agreement, MacAndrews & Forbes argued.
The proceedings followed a colorful jury selection process. The judge peppered the prospective jurors with question about their professions and their interests, as the pool was whittled down to eight, which included an unemployed actor, a nurse who is a fan of Rachael Ray and a 59-year-old woman getting her associate degree in criminal justice.
As the judge sought to determine whether the prospective jurors could be impartial in the trial, the love life of Mr. Perelman - who has been married five times, once to the actress Ellen Barkin - provided a minor stumbling block.
"Is this the Ronald Perelman who was married to Ellen Barkin?" one juror asked the judge, eliciting laughter in the courtroom. "I have met him a few times through Ellen when they were together."
Judge Gardephe asked whether that would prevent the juror from being impartial. "Yes, probably," the juror responded, laughing. He was immediately excused from the jury pool.

HEADLINE: What's Your Response to Obama's Third State of the Union Address?

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Students: What do you think about the president's election-year State of the Union address and the Republican rebuttal? 

 BODY:
10:55 p.m. | Updated 
Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution stipulates that the president shall "from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient." This language forms the basis for the annual State of the Union address. 
John H. Cushman and Helene Cooper reported on the president's third State of the Union address:
Mr. Obama asserted that government should work to better balance the scale between the rich and the rest of America - changing the tax code and other policies if Congress would go along, and making the most of his executive powers if Congress would not. People earning more than a million dollars a year should pay an effective tax rate of at least 30 percent and should not receive tax deductions for housing, health care, retirement and child care, he declared.
"We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by," Mr. Obama said, "or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."
By putting a significant accent on taxes, where his differences with Congressional Republicans have always been pronounced, Mr. Obama renewed the pressure on them to extend once again a temporary payroll tax break for most working Americans - and also amplified the attention that has been focused all week on the wealth of Mitt Romney, one of his leading challengers, who has disclosed that he pays less than 15 percent on income of more than $20 million a year.
In the Republican reply, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana will respond that "no feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others." 
Students: Tell us your thoughts about Mr. Obama's third State of the Union address - and Mr. Daniels's response. What is your response? What wasn't addressed that you would have liked to hear? Did you have any favorite lines from the president's speech or the governor's rebuttal?

HEADLINE: Buffett vs. Mankiw on Taxes

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor and adviser to Mitt Romney, argues that Warren Buffett's tax rate is higher than Mr. Buffett's says it is. 

 BODY:
Byinviting Debbie Bosanek, Warren Buffett's secretary, to sit in the first lady's box at the State of the Union address, President Obama has signaled that he intends to talk about the tax rate on some investments. Mr. Obama and Mr. Buffett both argue that many investment managers pay too little tax, because the tax code treats their pay as an investment return -- and thus taxes it at a much lower rate than ordinary income. Mr. Buffett has famously said that, as a result, his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does.
The tax rate on many investment gains is 15 percent, while the top tax rate on ordinary income is 35 percent.
This gap goes a long way toward explaining why Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, pays a lower tax rate than many affluent Americans.
N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist and former adviser to President George W. Bush who is now advising Mr. Romney, has questioned the notion that Mr. Buffett actually pays a higher tax rate than his secretary. Writing in The New York Times in 2007, Mr. Mankiw, who is a contributor to The Economic View column in The Times's Sunday Business section, argued:
Another piece of the puzzle is that Mr. Buffett's tax burden is larger than it first appears, because he is a major shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway.
When the [Congressional Budget Office] studies the tax burden, it includes all federal taxes, including individual income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate income taxes. In its analysis, payroll taxes are borne by workers, and corporate taxes by the owners of capital. For the richest 1 percent of the population, 9.3 percentage points of their 31.1 percent tax rate comes from the taxes that corporations have paid on their behalf. The corporate tax would undoubtedly loom large if the C.B.O. were to calculate Mr. Buffett's effective tax rate.
Mr. Mankiw's main point is that Mr. Buffett's true tax rate is higher than he says, because he is effectively paying corporate taxes, through his ownership stake in companies.

We invited the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group in Washington, to respond to Mr. Mankiw's argument. Chuck Marr, the center's director of federal tax policy, wrote in an e-mail message:
Professor Mankiw identifies the best source of information on this subject: the Congressional Budget Office. Let's take a closer look, though, at the story that the latest numbers tell. They show a country in the midst of a stunning increase in inequality, with incomes at the top rising more than ten times as fast as the incomes of middle-class Americans. At the same time, taxes have been cut dramatically for the richest people in the country - one reason why deficits have gone up in recent years. The 29.5 percent average tax rate faced by the top 1 percent used to be 37 percent in 1979.
The result is that the share of after-tax income flowing to the top 1 percent has surged from 7.5 percent in 1979 to 17 percent. This represents a shift upward of hundreds of billions of dollars each year. With huge budget deficits on the horizon and working and middle-class families struggling, it is time to reverse course and return the tax burden at the top to more reasonable levels.
Look for more discussion of this issue on both and the center's blog. And The Times's Caucus blog will be following the State of the Union address all night.

HEADLINE: State of the Union Wish List

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: What the editorial board would like President Obama to say tonight. 

 BODY:
Despite what some paranoid people on the Internet seem to think, the New York Times editorial board does not write the president's speeches (and his speechwriters don't draft our editorials). But with some regularity we discuss what we Barack Obama would say. And, of course, we always have a lot of opinions about what he said - and no, they are not always positive..
So ahead of the State of the Union, I asked editorial board members Carol Giacomo (foreign affairs), Bob Semple (the environment) and Teresa Tritch (the economy) to help me come up with a list of issues we wish the president would address tonight. Some of the items on the list, readers will notice, are quite open-ended, while others are more prescriptive. One note: we include issues because we think they are important, without regard to whether it's politically smart for the president to bring them up. That's his problem.
Here they are, by category.
Foreign Policy
1) With tensions rising over Iran, how does Mr. Obama plan to manage the crisis - which could define this election year for him and perhaps even his presidency - and move to negotiations from dramatically tougher oil-related sanctions, imposed by the United States and separately by the European Union?
2) One year into the Arab Spring, what has Mr. Obama learned from the many diverse movements that overthrew autocratic rulers?

3) How does he plan to position the United States to best deal with the rise of Islamist forces and promote workable democracies, including in Iraq where the departure of American troops has been followed by a rise in violence?
4) Does he have any plans for advancing stalled Israel-Palestinian peace efforts, a crucial building block for regional stability?
5) More generally, what is his vision for leading the United States internationally, not just in 2012 but in a prospective second term?
Energy and the Environment
1) Mr. Obama should renew his commitment to clean energy incentives, both to protect the environment and to create jobs.
2) He could ask Congress to repeal some $4 billion in annual tax breaks and subsidies for the oil and gas drillers that the industry, rolling in record profits, simply does not need.
3) The fossil fuels industry doesn't need help, but the wind and solar people do. Mr. Obama needs to make the case that with government help, American entrepreneurs can create hundreds of thousands of clean energy job without incurring the usual environmental risks. Failure to do so, he should add, will effectively cede a growing global market in clean energy technologies to the Europeans and the Chinese.
The Economy
1) The president should call for extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits
2) Another urgent need is to get some money to states and localities, especially for teachers, but also for other public workers
3) And yet another need: Money for public works projects that can employ people now, while making improvements that will help future productivity.
4) The president has called for letting high end Bush tax cuts expire and ending the private equity loophole. He could advance those positions by explaining that even if high end Bush tax cuts expire, the top 1/10th of one percent or so is still paying the same (or less?) than everyone else in the top one percent or two percent, even though the gulf between the 99th percentile and the 99.9 percentile is huge.
5) Obama has talked about "revenue neutral" corporate tax reform. It would be nice for him to give up on that: Corporations need to pay more, not less.
6) How to rebuild American manufacturing?Among other things, this would mean an end to mindlessly repeating "Government doesn't choose winners (and losers.)" Of course it does. Oil and gas subsidies? Write offs for mortgage interest, property taxes and capital gains on a home sale? A top rate of 15% for most private equity earnings, as well as tax breaks for debt financing? Bailing out the banks with no strings attached? Whoever seeded the idea that we don't choose winners is likely to be someone who is winning big right now and doesn't want those bennies to go elsewhere.
7) Obama is expected to call for tax breaks for in-sourcing -that is, for returning manufacturing jobs to America. Not sure what he means by that. It will sound good-bring our jobs home!-but if the in-sourced jobs don't even pay a living wage, why subsidize them with a new tax credit? That race to the bottom is exactly what was warned against in the rush to globalization. And the response was that the low wage stuff would go away and we would retain all the high "value added" stuff. Didn't work that way.
Misc.
1) Foreclosures. The president should say that a broad federal investigation is needed on which to premise fines/settlements to be used to pay for mortgage relief. (He probably won't be so clear on this point, because half of the White House is terrified that he will be eaten alive if he suggests foreclosure relief by those who say that troubled borrowers are just getting what they deserve.)
And now, readers, please add your own wish-list topics or policy proposals to the comments section. I'll do a follow-up with some of your questions later today.

HEADLINE: The State of the Union Address: And So It Begins

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama makes clear that he's ready to fight for his job. 

 BODY:
If anyone had any lingering doubts about whether President Obama is ready to fight for his job, the State of the Union address tonight should have dispelled them. I'm not the biggest fan of the president's speeches. They can be awfully long, his delivery rather low-key, and his talking points often follow a slow-windup-then-slower-let-down pattern. If he had treated us to that drill tonight, a lot of voters would have switched to a screening of "The Shawshank Redemption" or maybe reruns of "The Big Bang Theory."
But Mr. Obama was in full-throated campaign mode by the second page of his prepared text. "Let's remember how we got here," Mr. Obama said of the struggling economy, talking about how jobs were going overseas before the recession, how working people saw their paychecks stuck while costs rose, along with the salaries of bankers and hedge fund operators.
"In 2008," he said, "the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior."
"It was wrong," the president said. "It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag."

It was startling, frankly. I haven't seen the president this combative since before his inauguration.
Mr. Obama has had his share of missteps and setbacks. Maybe more than his share, since the Republicans in Congress have devoted themselves entirely to making sure that he gets as few victories as possible - even if that means slowing the economic recovery, or perhaps specifically in order to slow the recovery. Faced with a hypothetical choice between four more years of a Democratic president, or four more years of recession, they seem to prefer the latter.
He even ended his speech by reminding everyone that he - not President George W. Bush - killed Osama bin Laden. "One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden," he said. "On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the situation room, when I sat next to Bob Gates - a man who was George Bush's defense secretary and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president."
Subtle? No.
And I don't know if it will work. Mr. Obama's approval ratings are low - higher only than those of Congress. But at least he is making it clear that he will fight, hard.
We'll soon see how serious he is. Mr. Obama outlined a lot of important and ambitious policy goals tonight. Many of them will take Congressional approval. He may not get it. In fact he probably won't. But he said he was prepared to fight obstructionism. We will either see that happen, or we will not. That will be the real test.

HEADLINE: China's Coming Standstill

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: With a change in political leadership beginning this year and lasting into next, analysts expect few of China's major problems to be tackled. In fact, more than ever, Beijing's goal will be to maintain stability. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - This year, as China faces its first leadership change in a decade, it's stability, stupid.
Maintaining a dynamic economy is, of course, a key aim of the Chinese Communist Party. But politics are tense, so painful adjustments that may increase unemployment, inflation or threaten social calm, while seen as crucial over the longer run, are unlikely for now.
As Beijing increasingly flexes its muscles in the geopolitical arena, China is about to undergo a crucial political transition - only the fourth since Mao Zedong seized power in 1949. The changes are expected to begin at the 18th Party Congress in the autumn, whose exact date is still a secret.
Scores of top leaders in the party, government, army and legislature, including President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, will retire and be replaced by a younger generation in a process that will continue into 2013.
As a result, analysts inside and outside China say the leadership wants stability, or ''wending'' (pronounced ''wen-ding'') above all, even if that means dialing down some of the important changes contained in the 12th Five Year Plan, adopted last year.
These include the mammoth task of adjusting away from an old model relying on cheap labor and export-led growth, toward more ''sustainable'' growth built on increasing domestic innovation and consumption and on upgrading strategic industries. China also is racing to develop new energy industries and improve environmental protection.
But while the government considers these last two essential to overcoming China's biggest obstacles, implementing them is harder.
''The five year plan is relevant to a certain extent; it is important,'' said Cheng Li, director of research at the Brookings Institution's John. L. Thornton China Center.
''But compared to the leadership transition,'' Mr. Li said by telephone from the center's headquarters in Washington, ''the plan becomes so totally trivial, because any major personnel changes will completely change the policies or agenda.''
The divide between rich and poor in China is substantial, and many people believe state-owned industries have become too powerful. But some say big changes that might upset an already fragile social balance will be put on the back burner until after the political transition has been completed.
''This year will be very boring; it will be all about stabilizing prices, growth and employment,'' said He Fan, deputy director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Mr. He added that he was more optimistic than many outside economists about the prospects for Chinese growth over the near term, but he expected fresh problems to emerge in 2013 or 2014, when the new leaders were in place.
The outlines of the looming political changes are clear, if the detail is not. ''The mood in Beijing is not as optimistic as the last time,'' Mr. Li said, when Jiang Zemin, then the Communist Party leader and president, handed power to President Hu starting in 2002.
While rumors are swirling about who will be the next prime minister, either the long-tapped Li Keqiang or Wang Qishan, both of whom are now deputy prime ministers, no one is seriously challenging the president-in-waiting, Xi Jinping, Mr. Li said.
A heavy focus on politics this year means that tackling imbalances in the economy and inequalities in society, symbolized most potently by exuberant spending on luxuries like premium liquor, gambling in Macao and purchases at duty-free shops across the globe, will be pushed into the future.
''This year we'll get decent growth because it is a leadership transition year and no one wants bad numbers, but it'll be interesting to see if it's the economic reformers' 7 percent, or the old guard's 8 to 9 percent,'' said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.
''For me the main question is, At what point will they begin the rebalancing and adjustment process?'' Mr. Pettis said. ''This means bringing investment levels down slowly, raising interest rates, raising the value of the currency and raising wages.''
Sheng Hong, director of the Unirule Institute of Economics, a private research group in Beijing, said that postponing needed changes would only make them harder to deal with. ''I don't hold much hope for the 18th Party Congress,'' Mr. Sheng said. ''I'm afraid I don't have many hopes it will bring big changes.''
Yet while there may be serious bumps along the road, Mr. Sheng said the fundamentals of long-term growth are still firmly in place.
''Every year about 20 million people move to the cities and there's a lot of industrialization and urbanization to come,'' he said. ''We need very large investment to cater for that. Farmers' incomes rise when they get to the cities and their lives change. This isn't over yet.''
Sociologists estimate that China crossed a historic watershed in 2011, with just over 50 percent of Chinese people now living in the cities.
But far more worrying was the skewed nature of the economy.
The Chinese are the most avid duty-free shoppers in the world, according to Global Blue, a tax-refund shopping company based in Switzerland, spending $2.15 billion in the first 11 months of 2011, a 56 percent increase over the period the previous year, said Marie Bergfelt of Global Blue. The sum does not include duty-free shopping in Hong Kong, which is the biggest destination for Chinese shoppers, she said.
High import duties on many foreign brands in China's protected domestic market are a central reason for the explosive growth, Mr. He said.
Meanwhile, gambling in Macao has soared, with the former Portuguese enclave recording $33.5 billion in revenue last year, five times that of Las Vegas.
Mr Sheng singled out privileges given to state-owned enterprises as a major imbalance in China's economy. Of 46 Chinese companies on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2010, 40 were state-owned.
Their profits rest on ''numerous preferential policies and an unfair business environment,'' according to a research report by Mr. Sheng's institute, titled ''The Nature, Performance and Reform of State-owned Enterprises.''
State-owned companies pay very little rent for land and get inexpensive bank loans, Mr. Sheng said, adding that the rates were several percentage points below those of the market.
The companies should have paid 3.93 trillion renminbi, or $622 billion, in rent for industrial land from 2001 to 2009, a sum that would account for 67.2 percent of total nominal profit, the institute's research report said. If commercial and service use land were included, the sum would be higher - an additional 1.21 trillion renminbi.
The savings from 2001 to 2008 were equal to 47 percent of profit for state companies, the report said.
''Their privileges amount to more than 1 trillion renminbi per year,'' Mr. Sheng said, adding that the money would normally flow to the finance ministry and could be put to better use elsewhere.
Of course, state-owned enterprises are a pillar of China. They are major employers and politically reliable. No one expects them to change soon.
Yet as China looks ahead, past this year's political tensions and into the second decade of the 21st century, there are other problems that some warn cannot continue - principally, very high levels of government-led investment that appear to be getting out of sync with the underlying needs of the fast-growing Chinese economy.
''Currently, investment is far ahead of the economy's needs and this is a serious problem,'' said Mr. Pettis, with subways, highways and other facilities sprouting everywhere. ''They need a radical change of direction, which means abandoning the investment growth model. But this year, at most, they may just slow it a little bit.''
The Chinese economy, Mr. Pettis warned, is repeating mistakes made elsewhere. ''China's economic growth model is actually not unique,'' he said. ''This is a fairly old model used many times before, and it always works to generate real growth until investment begins to be misallocated on a large scale, which has happened every time.''
Even Mr. He, more sanguine, agrees.
''Generally speaking, in 2012 investment will still be very strong,'' he said. But the next five year plan will have to dial back on such high investment levels. ''Everything will already be built,'' Mr. He. said. ''Cities will have subway systems and airports - everything it took the West a hundred years to build. The boon of the demographic profile will be gone. China will be an aging society.''
That suggests China should be paying much more attention to developing a robust service sector, especially in areas like health and elderly care, which have traditionally been left to families, rather than a government responsibility or a business activity. 
''But they're not doing it,'' Mr. He said. ''I don't know why. Perhaps because of vested interest groups.''
As a result, he concluded, ''I'm optimistic in the short term, pessimistic in the long term.''

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: Digital Privacy Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Fireworks early but not often in the Republican debate and Twitter comes to telenovelas. 

 BODY:
The Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., could be summed up like this: different audience, different debate. The invective was as high as in recent debates in South Carolina, with a newly aggressive Mitt Romney saying that Newt Gingrich, as a consultant to the mortgage giant Freddie Mac, had been an "influence peddler." But without the raucous audiences of South Carolina, the event seemed more sedate, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg write.

        
Dr. Miriam Adelson will be contributing $5 million to the super PAC that is supporting Newt Gingrich, Nicholas Confessore reported, in time for the advertising war in Florida. Her donation, combined with the earlier $5 million donation by her husband, the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, shows how the wealth of a single couple can level the playing field for Mr. Gingrich, "a candidate who ended September more than $1 million in debt," he writes.
The European Parliament will consider a proposal that would significantly shift the balance on data protection and online privacy toward consumers, Somini Sengupta reports, forcing companies like Amazon.com and Facebook to obtain explicit consent about the use of personal data and allowing a consumer to delete that data. The one silver lining for the companies, should the proposal become law (and take effect in 2014), is that would create a uniform code for all 27 countries in the Europe Union, where there is now a cacophony of different laws and regulations, she writes.

        
The United States Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the police "violated the Constitution when they placed a Global Positioning System tracking device on a suspect's car and monitored its movements for 28 days," Adam Liptak wrote. The ruling, conveyed as a set of overlapping opinions, indicates that the court will apply broad privacy principles -- based on the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches -- into the digital age, he writes.
The independent film executive Bingham Ray died on Monday in Provo, Utah, after a series of strokes while attending the Sundance Film Festival. With October Films, which he co-founded, Mr. Ray "helped create a business model in which art-house movies grew into a powerful economic and cultural force," Brooks Barnes writes. He was 57.
A new telenovela on Telemundo, "Relaciones Peligrosas," is integrating Twitter and social networking into the storytelling, The Hollywood Reporter writes. Sixteen characters will have Twitter handles managed by the network's social media team, which will send messages during both the East and West Coast broadcasts of the show. "The content of the tweets will relate directly to on-air events as they were prepared by the writing team of the novella," according to The Hollywood Reporter.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Tricky Terrain

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The Republican presidential campaign is now moving into a state consumed by the housing crisis, and the primary battle is the first serious test of how it plays out as a political issue in the race, Susan Saulny reports. It is an especially tricky topic for Republicans, forcing them to balance their free-market instincts against intense demand among homeowners for more to be done.

        
Top congressional Republicans tapped Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana to deliver Tuesday's Republican response to the State of the Union address, setting off another round of hand-wringing over the contentious Republican presidential field, Jonathan Weisman reports. Some Republicans see a possible outcome in which Mr. Gingrich triumphs in the Florida primary, igniting an effort to find an alternative and lure someone like Mr. Daniels into the race as a foil to the former speaker.

        
Encouraging economic news as well as divisive infighting among Republicans have caused a cautious confidence to take root in the White House and at President Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters, Jackie Calmeswrites. On the presidential campaign trail and in Congress, Republicans have turned on one another with a ferocity that distresses party leaders and soothes their Democratic counterparts.

        
Thirty-two members so far have announced they have no intention of running again for their House seats in 2012, a considerable number at this point in the election cycle, Carl Hulse writes. The total is almost certain to increase as the deadline for the race draws near, with redistricting, age and ambition for higher office pushing some into retirement.

        
After the president criticized the Citizens United ruling at last year's State of the Union address, some of the Supreme Court justices have spoken out against the event, calling it "a political pep rally" and "a juvenile spectacle." Adam Liptak reports on a recent study that shows how those statements are consistent with a steady decline in the attendance of Supreme Court justices at the State of the Union address.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: The State of the Union

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: During the president's address tonight, The New York Times has streamed the speech live, and offered up live updates, tweets, fact checking and analysis of the best moments, highlights and low lights. 

 BODY:
President Obama made his way down the aisle of the House Chamber at 9 Eastern time tonight, shaking hands and accepting kind words from Republican and Democratic lawmakers before delivering his third State of the Union address. It was alsoan opening of sorts for a re-election campaign amid some glimmerings of optimism in the economy but stiff headwinds from a weary public.
Michelle Obama, the first lady, may have set the tone for the address by seating in her box Debbie Bosanek, the secretary of Warren Buffett, the billionaire financier. Ms. Bosanek's boss has held her up as a symbolof what he sees as the unfairness of the tax code in the United States. Ms. Bosanek pays a higher percentage of her income in taxes than her boss doss. Her invitation to the speech signals a combative stance by a president eager to draw distinctions between Congressional Republicans and himself while putting his presidency on the side of the middle class.
In addition, we have been offering live updates, tweets, fact checking and analysis of the best moments, highlights and low lights in real time. We'll also took suggestions from readers for statements that deserve a closer look. You can still submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #asknyt or on the dashboard.

10:29 P.M. | Mr. Daniels Begins
The Republican response has started. Follow along with his prepared remarks.
- 
10:25 P.M. | Wrapping Up From Washington
For more than an hour, President Obama laid out a litany of new policies, old themes, and populist ideals that will form the core of his final policy push and his campaign. There were no "You Lie" moments, no bad behavior.
But President Obama and the Republicans basically looked past each other on taxes, and Republicans wanted more on the budget deficit, which barely got a notice.
We're just waiting for Governor Daniels to deliver the Republicans' rebuttal.
- 
10:17 P.M. | Two Views of the World 
As President Obama's address circles back to foreign policy, the disconnect between his assessment of the world he has helped create and the one his Republican presidential rivals see could not be more different.
Mitt Romney has portrayed Mr. Obama as a weak-kneed apologist. Newt Gingrich has blasted his handling of allies and enemies alike. Both have said President Obama has diminished American influence and emboldened the nation's rivals. Nowhere is that criticism sharper than his handling of Iran.
Mr. Obama sees an entirely different universe.
"Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent," he said.
And he had a message for the men who want his job.
"Anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about," he said with an edge to his voice. "That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years."
- 
10:14 P.M. | The Hand of Alan Krueger?
It seems reasonable to guess that Alan B. Krueger - a Princeton economics professor now serving as the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers - played a significant role in tonight's speech. President Obama has cited a notable amount of economic research.
He mentioned a study about the value of teachers, a study first reported by Annie Lowrey of The Times. Mr. Obama also argued that students should be barred from dropping out of school too early, which jibes with this study by Philip Oreopoulos.
Mr. Oreopoulos found: "Students compelled to stay in school experience substantial gains to lifetime wealth, health, and other labor market activities for all three countries, and these results hold up against a wide array of specification checks. I estimate dropping out one year later increases present value income by more than 10 times forgone earnings and more than 2 times the maximum lifetime annual wage."
- 
10:12 P.M. | Fact Check: The Arab Spring
The administration's response to the political uprisings last year known as the Arab Spring was, by design, episodic. Each country experiencing upheaval, officials said, required unique American responses - from military intervention in Libya to sanctions against Syria, from supportive diplomacy in Egypt and Bahrain to near silence when it came to Saudi Arabia.
President Obama acknowledged that the upheaval continues and "how this incredible transformation ends remains uncertain," but he sought to define broad goals.
"We will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well," he said. "We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty."
Administration officials have defended their diverse approaches as pragmatic, but others have criticized what they see as inconsistency or, worse, hypocrisy.
 In Egypt, the administration initially wavered when protesters first demanded the resignation of the country's president since 1981, Hosni Mubarak, but then called for him to leave power. Since then the United States has promised economic and political support both to newly free political parties and to the military council that took control after Mr. Mubarak's ouster.
Egypt has progressed unevenly in its democratic transition. It held parliamentary elections described as largely fair, and this week seated a new, democratically elected Parliament for the first time. In some quarters in Washington, the electoral success of Islamic parties, led by the Muslim Brotherhood's new Freedom and Justice Party, has raised fears of an Egypt hostile to the United States and Israel, but the administration has opted to engage with the party's leaders and say they are committed to an inclusive, democratic society.
At the same time, the military leaders of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces have retained power and clashed with the United States at times, raiding the offices of four American-finance advocacy groups and then rebuffing demands to return seized equipment and allow the groups to reopen. The new Parliament and the military council have not yet resolved fundamental questions over dividing political power.
In Libya, the United States joined NATO and several Arab nations in mounting a six-month air campaign against the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, long one of America's most reviled enemies.
The operation, authorized by the United Nations Security Council, began in March ostensibly to protect civilians from a bloody crackdown. It ground down pro-Qaddafi forces and cleared the way for rebel forces to seize control of the country's capital in August. The Obama administration deliberately let its main allies - particularly France and Britain - lead the military campaign, but it provided much of the initial aerial bombardments and continued to fly essential refueling and intelligence missions throughout the conflict. Neither the United States nor its allies suffered combat casualties, and Colonel Qaddafi was captured and killed in November.
 Syria has proved far more vexing, in part because of the precedent of Libya. A crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad, which began in March, has killed far more protesters than Colonel Qaddafi's did, but the administration moved much more slowly to demand his overthrow. President Obama did so only in August, along with European leaders, and imposed American sanctions on its senior political and military leaders.
"I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity can't be denied," Mr. Obama said.
 Meantime, the violence has only worsened, with armed protesters now fighting the government, threatening to plunge the country into a sectarian-tinged civil war.
The administration has strongly supported the Arab League's efforts to send monitors and offer a political resolution that includes Mr. Assad's resignation, but international efforts to act at the United Nations Security Council have stalled because of opposition from Russia, which says the United States and its allies exceeded the council's legal mandate in Libya.
- 
10:11 P.M. | Fact Check: Ending the Iraq War
Ending the war in Iraq was one of President Obama's core campaign pledges - indeed, it was the one that arguably propelled him to victory over his primary Democratic challenger, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And by mid-December the last American troops left, except for a small contingent attached to the embassy in Baghdad, meeting the deadline negotiated by his predecessor, George W. Bush, and the Iraqi government three years before.
And yet Mr. Obama devoted only passing sentences to one of last year's foreign-policy accomplishments, saying merely that ending the war in Iraq "has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies" - that is, elsewhere.
He did not mention that since the withdrawal, violence and political instability have swept Iraq. Some experts argue that the absence of an American military presence has diminished the administration's ability to influence the government of Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki. Iran's government has emerged as a counterweight to the United States in Iraq, though the extent of its influence can be exaggerated.
Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, appears determined to weaken his political opposition, made up largely of Sunnis. A day after the American withdrawal, his government charged one of the country's vice presidents, Tariq al-Hashimi, with organizing death squads; Mr. Hashimi denied the charges and fled to the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the north.
Even with 50,000 American troops in the country last year, Mr. Maliki's government carried out worrisome attacks, harassed journalists and tortured detainees, according to a report last Sunday by Human Rights Watch. "Despite U.S. government assurances that it helped create a stable democracy, the reality is that it left behind a budding police state," the organization's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement.
The turmoil and political tensions threaten to undermine the careful balance of power that has held since parliamentary elections in 2010. An eruption of violence could undermine the president's claims of success, if not outright victory.
- 
10:10 P.M. | The Executive Branch
Finally a line for Republicans to cheer: "The executive branch also needs to change," Mr. Obama said. "Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote."
Come to think of it, Democrats probably cheered too.
- 
10:07 P.M. | Fact Check: Insider Trading by Congress
In the speech, President Obama is proposing a bill to ban insider trading by members of Congress. Is that really a problem? Researchers disagree.
Eric Lichtblau of The Times wrote last month:
Perhaps the most tantalizing but hotly debated factor in the rising wealth of Congress is lawmakers' performance in the stock markets - and the question of whether they are using their access to confidential information to enrich themselves.
In a study completed this year, [Alan] Ziobrowski at Georgia State and his colleagues found that House members saw the stocks they owned outperform the market by 6 percent a year. Their research from several years ago found that senators did even better, at 12 percent above average. The researchers attributed the performance to a "significant information advantage" that lawmakers hold by virtue of their positions and the fact that they are not bound by insider-trading law.
However, a separate study last year by researchers at Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the portfolios of lawmakers actually performed somewhat worse than those of average investors. It found that members did do better when investing in companies in their home districts or associated with campaign donors - suggesting that they benefited from their political connections - but still not as well as the average investor.
- 
10:05 P.M. | Two Sides of Regulation Story
Ah, the bait and switch.
President Obama got Republicans to their feet when he told a story that sounded as if it was taken straight from their playbook. He said his administration got rid of a regulation that forced dairy farmers to spend money proving that they could contain a milk spill, because somehow milk had been classified as an oil. 
"I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder," he said to the approving cheers of Republican lawmakers who relish stories of government bureaucrats run amok.
But then he turned the tables before they could take their seats.
"But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the gulf two years ago," he said. "I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean."
- 
10:04 P.M. | Silence From One Side of the Chamber
The State of the Union address has been a polite affair, but when President Obama turned to the meat of his argument - "fairness" - the Republican side of the house went cold.
"When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference - like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know it's not right," he said.
The camera panned to Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana. He didn't look happy.
- 
9:58 P.M. | Fact Check: Payroll Tax Cut 
To the surprise of neither the Republican nor the Democratic lawmakers in the audience, President Obama proposed extending the payroll tax cut for the rest of the year.
Here's the background. In 2011, Congress unexpectedly slashed the payroll tax - a levy on wages that helps fund Social Security - to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent of a worker's paycheck. That saved the average American household $934 in 2011, the Tax Policy Center calculated.
It is impossible to gauge the exact effect of the tax cut on the larger economy, but most analysts credit it with lifting consumer spending and helping households cope with the sluggish economy and high gas prices last year. 
The Obama administration proposed not only keeping the temporary tax cut for 2012, but expanding it, arguing that the economy is still too weak for middle-class Americans to be paying higher taxes. Economists say it could take half a percentage point to two percentage points off gross domestic product growth in 2012 - but only if both the payroll tax cut and extra weeks of unemployment insurance for workers out of a job for more than six months expire.
They argue that dollar for dollar, the payroll tax cut does not jolt growth as well as those extra weeks of jobless benefits. Many forecasters say that letting the payroll tax cut expire would have only a slight negative impact on overall growth - nothing that would put the economy back on the brink of recession, all things being equal.
In late December, Congress passed a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut. Earlier Tuesday, members of a new bipartisan House-Senate committee met for the first time to try to negotiate a final version of a yearlong cut.

9:56 P.M. | Hear That, Mitt Romney?
Mitt Romney took a real risk when he went to Nevada, the foreclosure capital of the country, and told a Las Vegas newspaper editorial board that the housing market needed time to bottom out and shake out homeowners who can't afford their mortgages.
Democrats have pounced, but President Obama has held his tongue. In his State of the Union message, he didn't use the name of his possible rival for the White House, but he did seem to have him in mind when he renewed his call for housing assistance.
"While government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief," he said.

9:54 P.M. | Making College Affordable
The president has put college affordability - and making student debt loads more manageable - high on his agenda over the last year. His speech emphasized the soaring student debt load.
 At a time when student debt exceeds credit card debt, he said, Congress needs to address a looming student debt challenge by taking action to stop the interest rate on student loans from doubling. Without Congressional action, the interest rate on new subsidized Stafford loans will double July 1, to 6.8 percent from from 3.4 percent. For borrowers who take out the maximum $23,000 in subsidized Stafford loans, interest payments will be $5,200 higher over a 10-year repayment period.
In recent months, Mr. Obama has used the bully pulpit to push colleges and universities to new urgency in controlling costs, convening a private meeting with several college presidents in early December to explore ways to contain costs.
Tonight he added a threat. If higher-education officials can't stop tuition from going up, he warned, their taxpayer financing will go down. But it is unclear how that would happen, since it is generally up to the states, not the federal government, to decide how much financing they will provide for higher education.

9:53 P.M. | Fact Check: G.M. Is the World's Largest Automaker
The Times reported last week that General Motors regained the top spot in global automaking.
After three years of settling for second place, General Motors reclaimed its title as the world's largest automaker in 2011, a year when its sales grew in every region of the globe while Toyota sales were hampered by major natural disasters.
G.M. said Thursday that it sold 9,025,942 vehicles last year, 7.6 percent more than in 2010. Its closest competitor was Volkswagen, whose sales grew 14 percent to 8.156 million, with Toyota falling to third place.
Toyota has not released final sales results for the year, but last month it estimated that sales totaled 7.9 million vehicles, a 6 percent drop.
The industry's sales crown means little beyond bragging rights. But G.M.'s ability to climb back on top, only two years removed from its government rescue and bankruptcy, is certain to bolster morale within the company and strengthen the Obama administration's argument that its bailout of the industry was worthwhile. G.M. was the world's largest automaker for more than 70 years before Toyota surpassed it in 2008.

9:51 P.M. | Cracking Down on Financial Crime 
Four years after the mortgage crisis began, one of the truisms that linger in the public's mind is that few people went to jail for their part in the mortgage mess. That is not completely accurate, but in an election year, President Obama wants to both seize on and change that impression.
Mr. Obama said tonight that he would establish a financial investigations crime unit to prosecute large cases of fraud. And he asked Congress to pass laws toughening the penalties for securities fraud and making it easier for regulators to dole out extra punishment to repeat offenders - Wall Street firms that have settled multiple fraud cases in recent years.
There are plenty of them. A New York Times analysis of enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the last 15 years found at least 51 instances in which large financial companies were charged with violating an antifraud law that the company had vowed in a previous settlement never to violate.
Mr. Obama said measures were needed to make sure that Wall Street firms did not see those settlements as little more than the cost of doing business. That statement echoed an opinion issued in November by Jed S. Rakoff, a federal district judge in Manhattan, who rejected a proposed $285 million settlement between the S.E.C. and Citigroup in a case of fraud charges related to the mortgage crisis.
Judge Rakoff said the S.E.C.'s policy of allowing companies to "neither admit nor deny" the S.E.C.'s charges gave him no way to judge what had really happened, and therefore whether the proposed punishment was fair and adequate.
In his examination of the case, Judge Rakoff also asked the S.E.C. why it seemed to rarely hold the companies to their promises to never again violate the securities laws. Mary Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., has also called on Congress to raise the maximum penalties that the commission can assess, and to add penalties for repeat offenders.
And on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama jumped on that increasingly crowded bandwagon.
- 
9:51 P.M. | Fact Check: Helping Homeowners
The White House plans to propose legislation that could allow a few million homeowners to reduce their monthly mortgage payments by refinancing into loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.
 President Obama described the proposal in broad terms Tuesday night as part of his State of the Union address..
"I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates," said Mr. Obama, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. "No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. "
The new program will target people whose mortgage debts exceed the value of their homes, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details have not yet been finalized. The official estimated that two million to three million homeowners could benefit.
The official estimated the cost of the program at $10 billion.
The proposal would join an existing program that offers refinancing to borrowers whose loans are held by the government-owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This new program would target borrowers whose loans are held by other companies.
It is the latest in a long series of largely unsuccessful efforts by the administration to boost the housing market. Like most of its predecessors, it is not focused on borrowers who are facing foreclosure, but on those who have been able to keep making the payments on their homes.
Many such borrowers have already refinanced, taking advantage of the lowest interest rates ever available for mortgage loans. But millions more have been unable to do so, because their financial profiles are no longer strong enough to qualify, or because their mortgage debts exceed the value of their homes. 
The F.H.A. guarantees loans made by private companies, allowing the companies to offer lower interest rates. It historically focused on lower-income borrowers but its role has expanded dramatically since the collapse of the housing market began in 2006, and it now guarantees about 30 percent of new loans.
The proposal requires legislation because current law restricts the ability of the F.H.A. to refinance loans that exceed the value of the borrower's home. Such loans are considered more risky, because borrowers have no equity to lose if they stop making payments. If the F.H.A. loses money on such loans, taxpayers could be on the hook. The agency covers losses from fees on the loans that it guarantees, but its reserves are already on the verge of exhaustion.
To limit the risk to taxpayers, the administration will propose that any costs be covered with part of the proceeds from a fee on the banking industry that is required by law to recoup the cost of the 2008 bailout.
- 
9:49 P.M. | Solyndra
He didn't use the dread word Solyndra, but make no mistake, President Obama has just defended the half-billion-dollar federal loan that went bust along with the California solar company Solyndra.
"Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail," he said. "But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough."
- 
9:49 P.M. | Reaching for a Big Line
In the early moments of his address, President Obama reached for an echo of the speech that launched him in national politics, at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, when he said "There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America."
His phrasing tonight was: "What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them."
It is hard to deliver memorable lines in this setting. State of the Union addresses are associated less with poetry and goose bumps than laundry lists of issues and proposals, a formula that every recent president has followed.
Mr. Obama gave it a shot when it came to his core argument about economic fairness, even if his words sounded a bit like a truck commercial: "It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts and no cop-outs. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody."
- 
9:47 P.M. | Clean Energy 
Congress will not give President Obama what he wants to combat climate change. But he is commander in chief, so the military doesn't get to say no.
"I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes," he said. "And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year."

9:46 P.M. | Snapshot of the First Lady's Booth
One of the cameras just lavished its attention on Laurene Powell Jobs - the widow of Apple's Steve Jobs - who is sitting in Michelle Obama's box, as the president spoke of unleashing innovative talent.
- 
9:45 P.M. | Fact Check: Where the Energy Is
As the president segued to his discussion of energy policy, he offered a tantalizing piece of news.
He mentioned that he had already opened millions of new acres onshore and offshore to oil and gas development, which is true, with a significant slowdown after the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico.
He then said, "Tonight, I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources," a potentially huge expansion of offshore activity. An administration official declined to explain exactly what that meant, except to say that the Interior Department would be announcing new lease sales in the coming weeks. Those sales will not include areas the administration has already ruled off-limits, including most areas off Florida and along the Atlantic Coast, the official said, so it is not clear how the president reaches his target.
Jack Girard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said that if Mr. Obama is serious about opening 75 percent of potential offshore resources, "that's a positive significant development." However, Mr. Girard said, if the administration is only prepared to offer leases on areas already under development, that is merely "a word game."
"If that's what he's saying, it's just sleight of hand," Mr. Girard said.
The president also touted new discoveries of natural gas, saying they offered the possibility of reduced oil imports and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs. He cautioned, however, that drilling for natural gas must be carried out safely and endorsed potential new regulations forcing companies to disclose the contents of the fluids they use to extract the gas.
 Mr. Girard scoffed, saying that represents an entirely new layer of federal regulation. "The state regulation we have now is sufficient," he said.
In his first two addresses to Congress, Mr. Obama called for passage of sweeping legislation to address climate change, including a national cap-and-trade program to limit climate-altering emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases. Last year, however, after the Senate refused to act on the measure, Mr. Obama dropped the subject entirely. He then asked Congress to enact a clean-energy plan to sharply reduce fossil fuel use and shift to clean electricity generation. That, too, went nowhere and has little chance this year.
 Tonight, Mr. Obama acknowledged that climate legislation was a dead letter for now, and pleaded again with Congress to pass the clean-energy measure.
 "The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change," the president said. "But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean-energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted."
 Mr. Obama said he would deploy his executive powers to increase renewable-energy generation at military facilities and on public lands. The Department of Defense is already a major user of solar power and, more recently, a big customer for aviation and ship fuels made from biomass.
- 
9:43 P.M. | Demanding, Not Asking 
President Obama's State of the Union address has dispensed with "please" and replaced it with "must."
He wants states to ban students from dropping out of high school. And he says colleges that can't control their rising tuition rates will lose federal aid.
"So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury - it's an economic imperative," he said.
- 
9:40 P.M. | Fact Check: Paying for the Military
Mr. Obama's assertion that he has a defense strategy that ensures that the United States maintains the finest military in the world is hard to quibble with, since even with coming defense cuts America will still spend $500 billion each year on its military, which is almost as much as all other military budgets in the world combined.
Although the Republican presidential candidates have charged that Mr. Obama is gutting defense, in reality it was both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who agreed with Mr. Obama last summer to cut $450 billion in Pentagon spending over the next decade, or about 8 percent of the base Pentagon budget. There is a potential for an additional $500 billion in Pentagon budget cuts over a decade if Congress follows through on deeper reductions, but Mr. Obama's defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, has characterized them as ruinous.
Mr. Obama's defense strategy, which he announced earlier this month at the Pentagon, is a pivot from the grinding ground wars he inherited from the Bush administration and refocuses on what he describes as a smaller, more agile force across Asia and the Pacific. Defense analysts say the strategy is good as far as it goes, but they note that there is a certain "back to the future" quality in its echoes of the smaller but more efficient military advanced by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld before the Sept. 11 attacks. Those plans were quickly overtaken by the need to build up ground forces for two conventional wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which the Pentagon never envisioned a decade ago. 
- 
9:39 P.M. | Perfect Attendance
President Obama has hit on a surefire way to finally end the scourge of high school dropout rates. He called on states to simply ban young people from leaving high school until they're 18.
- 
9:39 P.M. | Job Training, Redux
President Obama pledged once again to untangle the thicket of federal job-training programs, do away with duplication and make the programs more effective.
"I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people have one program, one Web site, and one place to go for all the information and help they need," he said to applause. "It's time to turn our unemployment system into a re-employment system that puts people to work."
Where have you heard that before?
Well, basically every State of the Union address back to and possibly through George W. Bush, who once proposed simply doing away with all of those programs and creating savings accounts for unemployed workers to tap for education and training.
- 
9:34 P.M. | Fact Check: Doubling American Exports
Mr. Obama just returned to a bold promise he made two years ago: to double American exports in five years.
The Obama administration is indeed on track to meet its goal of doubling exports by 2015. Exports have reached about $180 billion a month, according to Commerce Department data, up from $140 billion a month two years ago. They are currently growing at an annual pace of about 16 percent - a percentage-point higher than necessary to double exports to $3.1 trillion. And growing exports have accounted for about half the nation's economic growth since the recession ended.
It is hard to say just how much the Obama administration has to do with it, though President Obama credited his policies and recently completed trade deals with giving exports a boost. Economists and trade experts note that the administration started the clock when exports hit their recession-era low. And much of the strong growth in the two years since then has come from rising commodity prices and strong demand from emerging economies - two trends the administration cannot quite take credit for.
- 
9:32 P.M. | The First Sour Face of the Night
Ah, the first sour face of the night.
When President Obama asked for tax measures designed to discourage companies from expanding overseas and encourage domestic manufacturing, the camera flashed to Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader. He sat stone-faced and sour as Democrats cheered.
- 
9:31 P.M. | Calling on Kennedy
John F. Kennedy told America: Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.
Mr. Obama has narrowed that demand and turned it on the business leaders who he believes have hoarded cash, dragged their feet on hiring and continued to move operations abroad.
"Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed," the president said.
- 
9:29 P.M. | 'Insourcing'
President Obama talked about the notion of "insourcing," which in his telling is the return of American jobs that companies had previously moved overseas. Mr. Obama began talking about the issue earlier this month, and the White House has released a report on the issue.
We asked Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth economist and a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, for his thoughts on the matter. He wrote, via e-mail:
The president's focus on jobs remains welcome, as despite the recent uptick in jobs news America remains in a deep labor-market crisis.
Many in business and policy have long referred to "insourcing" as the U.S. activity of foreign-based multinational companies. This was not the exact definition the president was using recently. This earlier definition is important, because these U.S. affiliates of global corporations have long played an important role in the U.S. economy - over 5 million jobs, and large shares of U.S. exports, capital investment, and R&D (much larger than their employment share, which is currently about 4.5 percent of all private-sector jobs).
I do worry about using the term "insourcing" to mean U.S.-based companies somehow "bringing back" to America jobs that they had "outsourced." This is because the hidden premise of such language is that when U.S.-based multinationals expand abroad, that substitutes for their U.S. operations. In some cases that surely happens, but the balance of academic research to date shows something quite different: that expansion abroad by U.S. companies tends to complement their U.S. operations.
More hiring and investment abroad has tended to boost hiring and investment back in America. Thinking of "insourcing" as jobs returning misses the complex business reality that much of the expansion abroad by U.S. companies has little if anything to do with U.S. operations - e.g., it is hiring abroad to serve fast-growth markets in emerging markets.
- 
9:28 P.M. | More on Jobs
Toward the beginning of his speech, President Obama noted that the American economy lost eight million jobs during the biggest recession in 70 years - but trumpeted the fact that businesses have created about three million jobs since the recovery began.
Indeed, the unemployment rate climbed from 7.8 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009 to 10 percent that October. Since then, it has declined, hitting 8.5 percent last month. In the past year, the economy has been adding about 120,000 to 130,000 jobs per month.
Economists say that growth is probably enough to bring down the unemployment rate, though not by much. As the population expands, the economy needs to add new positions just to keep the unemployment rate steady. How many new jobs? It is a subject for debate, but most economists say somewhere between 80,000 and 125,000 per month.
And despite all of the gains made during the recovery, the overall labor picture remains bleak. There are about 1.7 million fewer people working today than there were when President Obama took office.
- 
9:27 P.M. | The Word of the Night: Jobs
Republicans running for President Obama's job have savaged him with a simple calculation: the number of jobs that exist today is millions short of the number that existed on the day Mr. Obama was inaugurated.
But is that number fair? The economy was in free fall at that point and had been for months.
With a national audience, Mr. Obama is trying to inoculate himself from those statistics.
"In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs," he said. "And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts."
- 
9:26 P.M. | The Electoral Map
Every word in a State of the Union address is carefully chosen. So it is no accident that the president uttered these sentences and cited these cities when discussing the auto industry and the future of American manufacturing. "What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries," he said. "It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh."
 Those cities happen to be in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, respectively - battleground states representing 69 electoral votes. A few sentences later came Milwaukee, representing 10 more electoral votes in Wisconsin.
- 
9:22 P.M. | Fair Share, Same Rules
When President Obama says he envisions a country where everyone has a fair shot and plays by the same rules, Republicans and Democrats hear two different languages.
Republicans hear Karl Marx. Democrats hear F.D.R.
- 
9:20 P.M. | Fact Check: Bin Laden Not a Threat
As he trumpeted in the opening of the speech, President Obama can claim a record of aggressive pursuit of Al Qaeda and its affiliates abroad over the past year, including the killing of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's founder, in May; Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born propagandist and plotter for the terrorist network's branch in Yemen, in September; and scores of suspected militants in Pakistan.
"For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country," Mr. Obama said. "Most of Al Qaeda's top lieutenants are defeated."
Before the mission to kill Bin Laden, Mr. Obama made a high-risk decision to send a Navy Seal team deep into Pakistani territory without alerting Pakistani officials, a bold move that later drew praise even from some Republicans.
While President George W. Bush oversaw the beginning of the Central Intelligence Agency's use of missiles fired from drone aircraft to kill suspected terrorists, Mr. Obama has expanded their use beyond Pakistan to Yemen and Somalia and made them a routine tool of counterterrorism. The relentless strikes in Pakistan's tribal area have, by most accounts, hugely weakened Al Qaeda.
The administration's campaign has not been without costs and mistakes. It has fueled public anger against the United States in Pakistan and provoked critics who question whether government officials should be able to kill purported enemies, including American citizens, without trial or judicial review. In Yemen, one strike killed a popular local leader, sparking a furious backlash and leading to a lengthy suspension of strikes there.
As a striking reminder of the Bin Laden operation - and Mr. Obama's preference for small-scale, targeted strikes - sitting with the first lady was Adm. William McRaven, commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, who helped design the successful strike plan.
- 
9:18 P.M. | Fact Check: Taliban's Momentum Has Been Broken
President Obama's assertion that the Taliban's momentum has been broken is a careful parsing of the state of the war in Afghanistan, where claims of American progress are disputed within his own administration.
Although the Taliban have been pushed back from their strongholds in southern Afghanistan and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said this month that the level of violence in the country is down for the first time in five years, American intelligence agencies have a bleaker view than the more positive statements from the Pentagon. In a classified assessment delivered to the White House last month, the Central Intelligence Agency and 15 other American intelligence agencies concluded that the war was at a stalemate and that military progress had been undermined by Afghan corruption, a weak central government and fighters infiltrating across the border from Pakistan.
The assessment, which was described by an American government official, has been disputed as flawed by the top American military commanders responsible for Afghanistan as well as by the American ambassador in Kabul, Ryan C. Crocker. But even the military, typically more upbeat than the intelligence agencies, worries that the country could plunge into civil war once American troops leave.
For now, the White House is pushing to make good on Mr. Obama's promise to pull 23,000 American troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next summer, which would still leave 67,000 behind. The plan is to have all American troops out by the end of 2014, but American military commanders are already suggesting that some could remain in the country beyond that date, possibly for years.
In an interview late last year, the senior American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John R. Allen, said negotiations with the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai would "almost certainly" include "a discussion with Afghanistan of what a post-2014 force will look like.'' Mr. Crocker also said last month that the United States was open to keeping armed forces in Afghanistan if the Afghan government asked for them.

9:16 P.M. | National Security Achievements
In recent years, it has been customary for the State of the Union address to begin on domestic policy and end on foreign affairs.
Not this year.

At 9:05, with pomp and conviction, the House sergeant at arms bellowed the arrival of the president of the United States. Mr. Obama entered to applause, hugs, kisses and good wishes from Democrats and Republicans alike. Representative Kay Granger, a conservative Texas Republican, grabbed a hug. Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, in the customary front row spot he grabs hours before, was there to reach out a hand. Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, chose a prominent spot in the camera line.
And the president went out of his way to give Representative Giffords a long, warm hug.
- 
9:06 P.M. | The Supreme Court Justices
Five Supreme Court justices just entered the chamber, a drop from last year, when six justices came. They took their seats up front and wore judicial robes, as usual.
Attendance by the justices has trended downward in recent decades, but almost no one paid attention to how many of them turned up for the address until two years ago, when Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. mouthed a dissent ("not true," he seemed to say) after President Obama criticized the Citizens United campaign finance decision. Justice Alito did not return in 2011.
He was not present this year, either. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan were in attendance. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who came last year, is absent tonight. She is scheduled to attend a judicial conference in Guam that starts Wednesday.
Protocol requires the justices to avoid partisan displays at the address, and some say they dislike having to make snap decisions about whether a statement from the president is uncontroversial enough to warrant judicial applause.
Two months from now, the justices will have a chance to speak, at arguments over the constitutionality of Mr. Obama's signature legislative achievement, the health care overhaul law.

8:55 P.M. | First Attack Ad of the Night?
Even before Mr. Obama reached the Capitol (his motorcade is en route), his television audience was treated to a blast of cold water.
The American Future Fund, an Iowa-based conservative group founded in 2007, ran an attack advertisement on CNN accusing the president of failing to turn around the economy and breaking his promises. Titled "The Real State of the Union," the ad slammed the president's policies, especially his administration's loan guarantees for the now-bankrupt solar company Solyndra.
"It's like a fairy tale the president is reading to the American people year after year," said the group's founder, Nick Ryan, a former aide to Jim Nussle, a former congressman and budget director for President George W. Bush. "Only this story doesn't have a happy ending."

8:54 P.M. | On the Floor
As Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, headed into the House chamber with Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, about 25 minutes before the address was scheduled to begin, she told reporters with a smile that they had just met with Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who she said was on her way over to attend her last State of the Union speech as a member of Congress.
Ms. Giffords announced just a few days ago that she would be leaving to focus on her recovery. Almost a year ago, she was nearly killed by a gunman at a meet-and-greet in Arizona.

8:44 P.M. | Daniels and His Hallmark Conservative Talk
Taking a look at the excerpts from Governor Daniels' speech, it looks like the governor will be using some of muscular conservative talk that is his hallmark.
"The extremism that stifles the development of homegrown energy, or cancels a perfectly safe pipeline that would employ tens of thousands, or jacks up consumer utility bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature, is a pro-poverty policy," Mr. Daniels will say, according to excerpts of his remarks.
To make his case, Mr. Daniels can point to his record of cutting spending in Indiana, where the state finances are in better shape than in some neighboring states. On the other hand, he was also the budget director under President George W. Bush, when the deficit increased sharply.
- 
8:37 P.M. | The Republican Response
Is Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana trying to have it both ways?
He will deliver the Republican response to Mr. Obama's address, and excerpts of the speech already released show a curious juxtaposition. On the one hand, he will fervently protest what he sees as unwarranted partisanship on the part of the president. On the other, he will accuse the president of extremism.
"It is not fair and it's not true for the president to attack Republicans in Congress as obstacles," Mr. Daniels plans to say, according to those excerpts. "They and they alone have passed bills to reduce borrowing, reform entitlements and encourage new job creation, only to be shot down nearly time and again by the president and his Democratic Senate allies."
Then he dismisses the administration's policies as "extremism." He singles out a decision by the State Department this month to deny a permit needed to build an oil pipeline from Canadian tar shale land to the Gulf of Mexico. The administration said the State Department had no choice because Congress had rushed the decision and given the company proposing the pipeline no time to come up with alternative routes around an environmentally sensitive aquifer in Nebraska.
Mr. Daniels sees something else at work.
"The extremism that stifles the development of home-grown energy, or cancels a perfectly safe pipeline that would employ tens of thousands, or jacks up consumer utility bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature, is a pro-poverty policy," he plans to say.
Pro-poverty policies aside, Governor Daniels will lay the blame for partisanship squarely at Mr. Obama's feet.
"No feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others," Mr. Daniels plans to say. "As in previous moments of national danger, we Americans are all in the same boat. If we drift, quarreling and paralyzed, over a Niagara of debt, we will all suffer."

8:30 P.M. | More on the 'Buffett Rule' 
Does President Obama have a valid argument? N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor and adviser to Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential hopeful, has questioned whether Mr. Buffett's secretary - Ms. Bosanek - really pays a higher tax rate than Mr. Buffett does, as Mr. Buffett claims. Mr. Mankiw argues that Mr. Buffett effectively pays a significant amount of corporate taxes, through his ownership stake in companies.
A post on our sister blog Economix has more details on the debate, including an excerpt of a 2007 article by Mr. Mankiw and a response today from Chuck Marr of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Like so many first dates, some of last year's Congressional matchups appear to have ended in tears.
And while several members of Congress are indeed going to sit with someone from the opposing party - a practice that caught on at last year's State of the Union as a way of showing unity after Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, was shot at a constituent event - the ritual won't be as popular this year.
Ms. Giffords, who said this week that she would resign to focus on her recovery from the shooting, will tonight sit between two fellow members of the Arizona delegation, Representative Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Representative Raull Grijalva, a Democrat, who left an open seat between them at last year's speech to mark the congresswoman's absence.
Several other members have said they will sit with members of the rival party. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, is to sit with Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat from Colorado. Representative Tim Johnson, Republican of Illinois, is to sit with Representative Russ Carnahan, Democrat of Missouri.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, posted on her Twitter account: "I will be sitting again next to my friend and fellow Marylander Rep. Roscoe Bartlett," a Republican from Maryland.
But unlike last year, when members sought out seat mates from the other party in droves, extreme partisan bickering and the start of the presidential election season have combined to dampen the ardor.
"Nobody asked me this time, frankly," said Representative Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. "No one loves me."
Representative Thaddeus McCotter, a Republican of Michigan, summed up his feelings about the so-called date night over Twitter. "Regarding a 2nd SOTU Rep-Dem 'date night,' I note the 1st SOTU bipartisan 'date night' preceded a year of epic partisan rancor."
Want to see who sat with whom? No Labels, a group that advocates for bipartisanship, posted a list of the cross-party pairings. It estimates that 120 lawmakers are in confirmed matchups.

8:18 P.M. | Who Is Debbie Bosanek?
One of the people sitting in Michelle Obama's box will be Debbie Bosanek, secretary to the billionaire Warren E. Buffett.
When her name was announced this afternoon, the media (us included) immediately started speculating that the president would most certainly discuss the topic of tax rates.
Ms. Bosanek became instantly famous when President Obama coined the term the "Buffett Rule" in September, citing Mr. Buffett's oft-repeated claim that he pays a smaller percentage of his income to the federal government than his secretary does.
She has served in the position for nearly 20 years, and Mr. Buffett described her as "invaluable" in one of his famed investor letters. Ms. Bosanek and her colleagues field reporters' calls to Berkshire Hathaway's Omaha offices. They also take care of declining or accepting requests for speeches or appearances, queries from prospective investors and questions about the firm's famous annual meeting.
Among journalists, Ms. Bosanek is infamous for not answering questions just as well as she answers them, doling out myriad, polite "no comments." Indeed, during one news conference, she reportedly wore a t-shirt saying: "Hi, I'm Debbie B. Warren is not available, and I have no comment."
Berkshire Hathaway and Ms. Bosanek have never made public details about her compensation.
- 
8:16 P.M. | Stay Tuned
In approximately 45 minutes, President Obama will deliver the third State of the Union address of his presidency, trying to finesse the need to lay out a positive agenda for the final year of his term and draw sharp distinctions between his policies and those of his Republican opponents.
NYTimes.com will keep you informed of any of the twists, highlights and low moments.

HEADLINE: Poll: Partisan Split Over Tax Policies

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: A majority of Republicans approve of current tax policy that taxes capital gains at a lower rate than income from work, while Democrats and independents are more likely to want tax rates to be the same for both. 

 BODY:
It may come as no surprise, but Americans are deeply split along party lines when it comes to federal tax policy.
A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday found that a majority of Republicans approve of the current tax policy, while most Democrats and independents disapprove of taxing income from capital gains at a lower rate than earned income. 
The survey was taken in the last several days as Mitt Romney faced intensifying criticism from his rivals to release his tax returns, resulting in his decision to disclose his 2010 information and his anticipated 2011 payments.
Just before the South Carolina primary last week, Mr. Romney announced that his effective federal tax rate was closer to 15 percent - the rate levied on dividends and capital gains. A review by The New York Times of the returns released Tuesday showed that his tax rate for 2010 was closer to 14 percent but is expected to be more than 15 percent for 2011. 
While Mr. Romney's tax rate appears considerably higher than the average rate paid by middle-income households, it is at a lower rate than many other affluent people because most of his income comes from investments. 
In the survey, about half of all Americans agreed with the statement that capital gains and dividends should be taxed the same as income earned from work, because the policy increases the federal deficit and is unfair to people who don't have money to invest. 
Thirty-six percent of Americans said they approved of the current policy because it encourages investment, which helps the economy and ultimately increases tax revenues. 
But there's a partisan divide, with just more than half of Republicans approving of the lower tax rate on capital gains, but about two-thirds of Democrats saying capital gains and dividends should be taxed at the same rate as income from work. More than half of independents - an important swing group in the presidential election -- also say the tax rates should be similar.
And most Americans say that what they themselves pay in taxes is about right, but that people with high incomes pay too little in taxes.
A little more than half say the tax rate they pay is about right, while about 4 in 10 say they pay more than their fair share. Seven in 10 Democrats say wealthy Americans pay less than their fair share in taxes, while Republicans are divided. 
Nearly 4 in 10 Republicans say that the rich pay less than their fair share, and about the same number say the amount wealthy people pay is about right. Nearly 2 in 10 Republicans say the rich pay more than their fair share.
And 58 percent of independents also say the rich are not contributing their fair share to the nation's coffers. 
(A comparison of the candidates' tax returns is available in this Times graphic.) 
The Times/CBS News poll was conducted Jan. 20 to 23 among 1,185 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: The Buffett Rule Isn't About Mitt Romney. Or Is It?

BYLINE: JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Debbie Bosanek, Warren Buffett's secretary, will be the human face on a policy point during the State of the Union tonight. 

 BODY:
There are two words that President Obama is unlikely to utter when he talks about tax fairness during the State of the Union address: "Mitt Romney."
He is likely, instead, to introduce Debbie Bosanek to the House chamber and the millions of people watching the speech on television.
Ms. Bosanek, who is Warren Buffett's secretary, will be joining Michelle Obama in the first lady's box seats during the speech, Stephanie Cutter, deputy manager of the Obama 2012 campaign, said in a Twitter message. That's where presidents typically put their poster children in order to put a human face on a policy point. 
As everyone knows, when Mr. Obama talks about the need to change the tax system so that the wealthiest taxpayers pay more, he likes to cite the anomaly in which Mr. Buffett, a billionaire investor, may pay a lower effective tax rate than his secretary; or, since Mr. Obama himself is no pauper, he even says that "people like me" ought to shoulder a bigger burden.
So it's not the Romney Rule, but the Buffett Rule, that David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said would roll across the president's Teleprompter: "We're going to outline that specifically tonight, what that would mean, so that we make sure everybody in this economy is doing their fair share," he said.
Asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "Good Morning America" whether it was wrong that Mitt Romney pays only 15 percent or so of his income in taxes, Mr. Plouffe allowed that Mr. Romney had tried to follow the rules as they exist today.
"The point is, we need to change our tax system," he said. "We need to make sure that middle-class workers are not paying more in effective tax rates than people who are making forty, fifty, a hundred million dollars a year."
So at least in theory it's not about Mr. Romney - who, as it happens, has made about $21 million a year recently.
It is about the yawning divisions between the parties over taxes, and both Mr. Obama and his opposition see it that way.
"It sounds like we're going to see a rerun of what we've heard over the last three years: more spending, higher taxes, and more regulations," said the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, who will be sitting behind Mr. Obama during the speech.
"We all know that there's a reason we have low rates on capital gains," he said when asked about Mr. Romney's tax rate. "That's because it spurs new investment in our economy and allows capital to move more quickly."
An earlier version of this blog post, in one instance, misspelled Warren Buffett's surname as Buffet.

HEADLINE: Joining Mrs. Obama Will Be ...

BYLINE: JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.


HIGHLIGHT: A General Motors plant manager, the mayor of San Antonio and an elementary school teacher are among the guests invited to watch the State of the Union address with Michelle Obama. 

 BODY:
The guests joining Michelle Obama in her box seats overlooking the House chamber for the president's State of the Union speech on Tuesday night include Jill Biden, the vice president's wife; Valerie Jarrett, the president's senior adviser; and a panoply of ordinary and extraordinary people chosen as archetypes of the policies, priorities and accomplishments Mr. Obama will seek to emphasize.
Along with Warren Buffett's secretary, who is said to pay a higher tax rate than her billionaire boss, there will be an Army sergeant who has been deployed again and again to Iraq and Afghanistan; a Navy commander's wife who works with military families; and a gay Air Force colonel who lives openly with her partner after the demise of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy -- and who is off to Afghanistan in the spring as an intelligence officer.
Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple visionary Steve Jobs, was also invited to join Mrs. Obama, as was Capt. Mark Kelly, the husband of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt almost exactly a year ago
There is a mayor whose city-owned utility is installing one of the nation's largest solar electric plants; the founder of a solar-energy electronics firm; a laid-off furniture worker who retrained and landed a job making blades for wind power turbines; and the head of a furniture company who is reviving a family business here after its operations had been shifted to China.
There's the manager of a General Motors plant making small cars; the founder of a social photo-sharing service with 15 million users; a Florida couple who refinanced their home; and a law school graduate working as a waitress and husbanding her payroll tax cut as she saves up to take the Virginia bar exam.
The entire list and the descriptions as provided by the White House are below:
Sgt. Ashleigh Berg,
Malibu, Calif.
Sgt. Ashleigh Berg is from Malibu, Calif., and joined the United States Army in July of 2004. Sergeant Berg has been stationed in South Korea and Germany, and has served two tours of duty in Iraq.

Amber Morris
Virginia Beach, Va.
Amber Morris, a Virginia Beach resident, responded to the White House's call in December asking Americans "What does 40 mean to you?" saying, "Forty dollars a pay check means that I'll be able to pay my bills, but most months it'll be a tight squeeze. It means that I'll have no spending money, which means I can't do my part in encouraging my local economy. Forty dollars a paycheck may not seem a lot, but it could mean a steady job for me and my co-workers or unemployment." Ms. Morris graduated from Northeastern Law School in 2008 and found herself unable to find a job in her field. She was working for a nonprofit in Boston, but after they lost funding she found herself unemployed in 2009 and forced to move back home with her parents.

HEADLINE: Union Radio Ad Assails Romney in Spanish

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A powerful union takes on Mitt Romney over his stances on immigration. 

 BODY:
The Service Employees International Union began airing in Florida on Tuesday that seeks to turn the state's Hispanic voters against Mitt Romney by accusing him of being two-faced on immigration policy.
The ad, which is running in Tampa and Orlando, says that while Mr. Romney has run a commercial in Florida saying he shares the values of the state's Hispanic voters, he has boasted in other states that he had the endorsement of Kris Kobach, an architect of anti-immigrant laws in Arizona and Alabama.
The union's ad, called "The Two Faces of Mitt Romney," says, "Romney says he cares about our children, but he has promised to veto the Dream Act that would open the doors of opportunity for young Hispanics." That legislation would grant legal status to some illegal immigrants who came into the United States as children, especially those who serve in the military or graduate from college.
"Romney started running ads in Spanish in Florida with a message trying to get our votes, while in English he's running a campaign attacking immigrants," said Eliseo Medina, the union's secretary-treasurer. "To make matters worse, Romney embraces Kris Kobach. We can't let them get away with saying something in one language while attacking us in another language."
The ads are co-sponsored by Priorities USA, a Democratic "super PAC."
In a news release, the union said that while Mr. Romney professes concern for Hispanics, he backs harsh treatment of immigrants to cause them to "self-deport"; i.e., return to their homeland.
Mr. Romney has taken a relatively hard line on illegal immigration, and his campaign has been running a television spot featuring his son Craig speaking in Spanish about liberty and opportunity.
Albert Martinez, an adviser to Mr. Romney, called the union's ad "a dishonest smear from President Obama's liberal allies and a desperate attempt to distract from his abysmal record," and said, "It will do nothing to help the millions of Hispanics who have been hit especially hard as a result of the Obama economy." 
The service employees' union, with around two million members, has long been one of the unions most supportive of the president. It has also been at the forefront of organized labor's effort to persuade Congress to enact a law that establishes a path to legalization for illegal immigrants.
The service employees' union has joined the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in running anti-Romney ads in Florida even though it remains unclear whether he will be the Republican nominee.
"We want to act sooner rather than later," Mr. Medina said. "We want to make sure that the Latino community is part of the process for this presidential election."
The union said in a news release that it did not see Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum as "viable alternatives for Hispanic voters."

HEADLINE: In Battered Area, Romney Assails Gingrich on Foreclosures

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney again links Newt Gingrich's time at Freddie Mac to the foreclosure crisis. 

 BODY:
LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. -- Mitt Romney toured the epicenter of Florida's foreclosure crisis on Tuesday as he continued to try to draw attention to Newt Gingrich's work on behalf of Freddie Mac.
Standing in front of a vacant home in a neighborhood full of them, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Gingrich of defending Freddie Mac while getting paid to do it. The accusation drew anti-Gingrich boos from a crowd of about 200 people.
"He's been working as an influence peddler," Mr. Romney said. "You get paid and then you go out and say things that influence other people. We can't have influence peddlers leading our party."
Mr. Gingrich has defended his work for Freddie Mac, saying that he worked as a consultant, provided historical advice and did no lobbying work. Mr. Romney mocked that answer on Tuesday and once again demanded that Mr. Gingrich release more information about his Washington work.
He noted that Mr. Gingrich's organization was paid $1.6 million by Freddie Mac.
"He says, 'As a historian,' " Mr. Romney said. "I'm waiting to see the history that he wrote for them."
Even as Mr. Romney spoke, his campaign pressed its case that Mr. Gingrich's consulting work for Freddie Mac amounted to "influence peddling" that should offend Florida voters frustrated by the housing crisis.
In the debate Monday night, Mr. Romney lashed out at Mr. Gingrich's connections to Freddie Mac, linking the fortunes of people in towns like Lehigh Acres to the actions he took in Washington.
"I don't think we can possibly retake the White House if the person who's leading our party is the person who was working for the chief lobbyist of Freddie Mac," Mr. Romney said to Mr. Gingrich on Monday. "Freddie Mac was paying Speaker Gingrich $1.6 million at the same time Freddie Mac was costing the people of Florida millions upon millions of dollars."
Mr. Gingrich has said Mr. Romney is mischaracterizing his work and accused him of demeaning the election process.
"The fact is, I've had a very long career of trying to represent the people of Georgia and, as speaker, the people of the United States," Mr. Gingrich said. "I think it's pretty clear to say that I have never, ever gone and done any lobbying."
At the event in Lehigh Acres, a suburb of Fort Myers, Mr. Romney also took aim at President Obama.
"He just does not understand what it takes to get this economy going," said Mr. Romney, drawing attention to the president's decision not to move forward with the Keystone XL oil pipeline. "It's just one mistake after the other."
Mr. Romney also sought to tap into the frustration of many in the crowd who have suffered the immediate effects of the foreclosure crisis. He made a vague pledge to encourage banks to be more creative in helping people stay in their homes.
"The banks aren't bad people -- they are just overwhelmed right now," Mr. Romney said, echoing his "Corporations are people, too" comment of last year.
But he also suggested that government was not the answer.
"Housing has become a mess in large measure because government got in the middle of it," he said.
An earlier version of this post misspelled Fort Myers as Fort Meyers.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the State of the Union

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: In excerpts released early Tuesday evening, President Obama calls for "an economy built to last" and "responsibility from everybody." 

 BODY:
"Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
" ... The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them.
"As long as I'm president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.
"No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers and a renewal of American values.
"Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that does the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts and no cop-outs. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Republican Response

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: In excerpts of the Republican response to the State of the Union, Gov. Mitch Daniels says, "No feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us." 

 BODY:
"As Republicans, our first concern is for those waiting tonight to begin or resume the climb up life's ladder. We do not accept that ours will ever be a nation of haves and have-nots; we must always be a nation of haves and soon to haves.
"The extremism that stifles the development of home-grown energy, or cancels a perfectly safe pipeline that would employ tens of thousands, or jacks up consumer utility bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature, is a pro-poverty policy. It must be replaced by a passionate pro-growth approach that breaks all ties and calls all close ones in favor of private-sector jobs that restore opportunity for all and generate the public revenues to pay our bills.
"That means a dramatically simpler tax system of fewer loopholes and lower rates. A pause in the mindless piling on of expensive new regulations that devour dollars that otherwise could be used to hire somebody. It means maximizing on the new domestic energy technologies that are the best break our economy has gotten in years.
"It's not fair and it's not true for the president to attack Republicans in Congress as obstacles on these questions. They and they alone have passed bills to reduce borrowing, reform entitlements and encourage new job creation, only to be shot down nearly time and again by the president and his Democrat Senate allies."
"No feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others. As in previous moments of national danger, we Americans are all in the same boat. If we drift, quarreling and paralyzed, over a Niagara of debt, we will all suffer, regardless of income, race, gender or other category. If we fail to shift to a pro-jobs, pro-growth economic policy, there will never be enough public revenue to pay for our safety net, national security or whatever size government we decide to have."
"2012 must be the year we prove the doubters wrong. The year we strike out boldly not merely to avert national bankruptcy but to say to a new generation that America is still the world's premier land of opportunity. Republicans will speak for those who believe in the dignity and capacity of the individual citizen; who believe that government is meant to serve the people rather than supervise them; who trust Americans enough to tell them the plain truth about the fix we are in; and to lay before them a specific, credible program of change big enough to meet the emergency we are facing."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Weaves State of the Union Into Obama Attack


HIGHLIGHT: "On the day the president is going to speak about the state of the union, I thought I might suggest a few things that would improve the state of the union," Newt Gingrich said in Florida. 

 BODY:
NAPLES, Fla. -- Newt Gingrich wove references to President Obama's state of the union address into his usual stump critique of the president on Tuesday, telling crowds numbering in the thousands in Sarasota and Naples, Fla., that defeating Mr. Obama represented "the most important election of our life time."
"On the day the president is going to speak about the state of the union, I thought I might suggest a few things that would improve the state of the union," he said. "You always have to wonder, when Obama speaks, which country he thinks he's talking to.''
He then segued to a familiar line of attack, calling Mr. Obama "a Saul Alinsky radical" whose policies have hampered the economy. He went down a checklist of what he considers the president's failures: the price of gasoline, the failure to drill aggressively for offshore oil and gas, and regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
"He doesn't seem to operate on the same planet you and I do,'' Mr. Gingrich said. "He's on Planet Obama somewhere out there.'' 
"This is the fourth year of his presidency,'' he added. "He needs to get over it."
In a fund-raising appeal e-mailed to supporters, Mr. Gingrich struck a triumphal note after his victory in the South Carolina primary and surge in Florida and national polls. "There is no longer any doubt that we can win the GOP nomination,'' he said. "The other candidates are good men whom I deeply respect, but it is time for conservatives to come together and unite behind one authentic, Reagan conservative who can win."
Mr. Obama, he said, is "a radical, secular socialist who wants to reinvent America in the image of the faded, decrepit republics of Western Europe."

HEADLINE: The Tax Deduction Mitt Romney Did Not Take

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: As a self-employed public speaker and corporate director, Mr. Romney could have taken a full deduction for his health insurance premiums. Why didn't he? 

 BODY:
The release of Mitt Romney's tax returns for 2010, all 500 pages of them, shines a bright light into the strategies wealthy people use to reduce their tax burden - Mr. Romney managed to reduce his effective tax rate on $21 million of income to just 13.9 percent.
But, oddly, there was one strategy that Mr. Romney did not use - a full deduction for health insurance premiums that is available to most self-employed people. It is on Line 29 of the Internal Revenue Service's Form 1040 income tax return. On Mr. Romney's return, the line appears blank.
Mr. Romney did have self-employment income, which made him, for the purposes of the I.R.S., a sole proprietor. Sole proprietors report their income on the I.R.S.'s Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business. In 2010, Mr. Romney actually filed two Schedule C's: one for his speaker's fees and the other for his service as a director of Marriott International. His speaker fees amounted to $528,871 in 2010, but commissions and advertising costs reduced that income to $480,115. All told, his self-employment income came to $593,996.*
In addition, the tax return shows the Romneys' "self-employed health insurance premiums" came to $14,176. In the 35 percent tax bracket, deducting the health insurance premiums would have saved the couple almost $5,000 in taxes.
So why didn't the Romneys take the deduction, when they managed to reduce their taxes in so many other ways? Mr. Romney's tax preparer, Daniel Feheley of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, did not return messages seeking comment. But Keith Hall, the national tax adviser to the National Association for the Self-Employed, pointed to a restriction on the deduction. "It is very vague but it basically states that the health policy you have must be established under the small business," Mr. Hall said. "There's a reasonable chance that his health insurance is a policy that he's had for many years - could be coverage that he had while at another company, or otherwise unrelated to his self-employment. If that's true, he'd be precluded from taking that deduction on Page 1 on his 1040."
Further, Mr. Hall said, it may not have made financial sense to shift his insurance to take advantage of the deduction. "He may have an old group policy, and depending on what medical conditions he or his family have, to try and convert it may cost more than the savings he'd get from the deduction." Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998.
Yet Mr. Romney lives in Massachusetts, and as governor of that state, he signed legislation reforming its health care market. Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who served as an adviser to the Romney administration - and who has studied the self-employment tax deduction - said in an interview that he could not think of a reason Mr. Romney would not take the deduction. "There must be some arcana in the law that his accountant said that this is not worth messing around for $5,000," Mr. Gruber said.
But, he added, it could not be because of the Romneys' health status. "The Massachusetts law solves that," Mr. Gruber said. "During the annual open enrollment period, you can change to a policy that covers pre-existing conditions and not be discriminated based on price."
The health care law signed by President Obama in 2010, which Mr. Romney has vowed to repeal, is slated to extend that protection across the country in 2014.
*On Saturday, The Agenda reported how Mr. Romney learned to his surprise that self-employed people pay what is essentially both the employer and the employee's share of their payroll tax obligation. "I'll take a look at that," he told a small businessman who "bird-dogged" him in New Hampshire. But it turns out that he needs to look no further than his own tax return. Mr. Romney paid self-employment tax on this income - both halves of it. The total came to $29,151.

HEADLINE: Romney Attacks Obama's Address as Nothing More Than 'Tall Tales'

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech his campaign called a "pre-buttal" to Mr. Obama's address Tuesday night, Mitt Romney lambasted the president's handling of the economy. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday charged that President Obama's State of the Union speech will be nothing more than "partisan plans for his re-election campaign," and "tall tales about America."
In a speech his campaign called a "pre-buttal" to Mr. Obama's address Tuesday night, Mr. Romney lambasted the president's handling of the economy, saying that he did not fix the economy, tackle the housing crisis or get Americans back to work.
"Three years ago, we measured Candidate Obama by his hopeful promises and slogans," Mr. Romney said, according to prepared remarks. "Today, President Obama has amassed an actual record of debt, decline and disappointment."
Mr. Romney offered his speech even as his campaign formally bowed to mounting pressure to release his 2010 and 2011 tax returns. Mr. Romney is battling a surge of support for Newt Gingrich in the wake of Mr. Gingrich's double-digit victory in South Carolina. 
But Mr. Romney did not mention Mr. Gingrich once during the speech, which was given at a gypsum factory outside of Tampa. Instead, he returned to his sharp critique of Mr. Obama's administration.
Mr. Romney's speech amounted to a litany of complaints about three years of Mr. Obama's tenure. He argues - as he has for months - that Mr. Obama's policies made the economic situation in the country worse.
"Instead of solving the housing crisis and getting Americans back to work, President Obama has been building a European-style welfare state," Mr. Romney said.
Speaking with a teleprompter, Mr. Romney cast the choice in November as a fundamental one that is about "saving the soul of America" and a choice between "two very different destinies."
In a memo sent to reporters before Mr. Romney's speech, officials at the Democratic National Committee predicted that he would deliver remarks "aimed at distorting the President's record and vision."
"You'll hear plenty from Mitt Romney as he continues to say anything to get elected," the memorandum from the D.N.C. said. A spokesman for Mr. Obama's campaign declined to comment shortly after Mr. Romney delivered his remarks.
Mr. Romney plans to hold a housing-focused event Tuesday afternoon before heading to Miami for events on Wednesday. On Thursday, he will participate in another nationally-televised debate.

HEADLINE: Big Down Payments Could Bar Creditworthy Borrowers From Market, Study Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A study says requiring a 20 percent or 10 percent down payment would price too many creditworthy borrowers out of the housing market. 

 BODY:
Requiring a minimum down payment of 20 percent, or even 10 percent, on home loans would push many creditworthy borrowers into higher-cost loans or out of the mortgage market entirely, a new study says.
Possible down-payment requirements are part of a debate in Congressand among a cluster of federal regulatory agencies, as they develop new rules for mortgage lenders following the housing crash.
As part of the reforms mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial law, the agencies (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation., the Federal Reserve, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, among others) have proposed criteria for what constitutes a reasonably safe, high-quality mortgage--a "qualified residential mortgage," or Q.R.M., in regulatory lingo.
Lenders issuing such mortgages will be able to sell them to private investors and avoid retaining any of the risk associated with a default of the loan on their own books. Loans that don't meet the standards will be considered riskier, so the lender will have to retain 5 percent ownership. The goal is to encourage banks to thoroughly vet a borrower's ability to repay the loan.
The agencies have proposed, among other requirements, that mortgages must have a down payment of 20 percent to meet the definition. This has raised concerns among lenders, builders and housing advocates that such a requirement will unnecessarily hobble a healthy part of the housing market.
(Loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which can be obtained with small down payments, are exempt from the "qualified residential mortgage" mandates. Loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage companies that are the biggest players in the secondary mortgage market, are exempt. But the concern is that the new definition of a "safe" mortgage eventually will become the standard, applicable to loans backed by Fannie and Freddie too, said Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending.)
To see what impact tougher rules for down payments and other criteria might have on borrowers, the University of North Carolina's Center for Community Capital, Wayne State University and the Center for Responsible Lending examined home purchase loans issued before the housing bubble burst. In part, researchers examined mortgages issued from 2004-8 that were in good standing as of last February.
The researchers found that imposing a 10 percent down payment requirement would eliminate 38 percent of creditworthy borrowers from the traditional mortgage market and that at a 20 percent down payment threshold, 61 percent would be excluded. The report also found that such down payment requirements disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos.
The added benefit of reduced foreclosures, the study found, did not "necessarily outweigh the costs of reducing borrowers' access" to mortgages.
Simply restricting access to the riskiest type of loans that caused big problems during the housing mess, like interest-only loans or those issued with no income documentation, would reduce defaults while making loans available to a broader pool of creditworthy borrowers, the study found.
"While higher down payments do result in fewer defaults, the payoff is small relative to the number of creditworthy households who could be shut out of the market, the study shows," said a statementfrom the Center for Responsible Lending.
Do you think a mandatory 10 percent or 20 percent down payment is reasonable, even if it bars otherwise creditworthy borrowers from qualifying for a home loan?

HEADLINE: For Newcomers in Silicon Valley, the Dream of Entrepreneurship Still Lives

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Atha Fong, 22, has trouble explaining to her mother exactly what she does as a product manager at iSkoot.
''Basically, her understanding is that I work with engineers to make mobile phone applications, but more than that, not really,'' she said.
Her more than $70,000 salary, stock options and personal investment portfolio, though, go a long way to alleviate any parental concerns.
Ivan Lee, 25, turned down a lucrative offer from Microsoft to start his own company, developing location-based games that he hopes will eventually dominate the industry. Bansi Shah, 23, picked up her undergraduate diploma, then took a job at Lattice Engines, a small San Mateo startup, where she makes ''near the top'' of the company's $80,000 to $130,000 range for an entry level product manager, plus equity.
These are the latest high-tech migrants to Silicon Valley, in their 20s and fresh out of college, drawn by a surge in start-ups and investment money that in the last year and a half has created more jobs than companies can fill, and eager to help shape the technology that infuses their lives. 
Their peers in other parts of the country -- indeed, in many other parts of the state -- may be struggling to find jobs, their independence stunted by financial hardship. But these recent college graduates are, at least for the moment, snugly protected from any hint of the recession.
''We've always had this gravitational pull,'' said Julie Hanna, a serial entrepreneur who sits on the boards of a number of successful companies, ''and then on top of that, we have the economic contrast, because the rest of the country looks like a desert and here money is flowing freely.''
Boom and bust cycles are endemic to Silicon Valley, where many older denizens have vivid memories of the giddy highs of the 1990s and the desperate lows that followed, when the dotcom bubble burst.
But buoyed by the frenzy of entrepreneurship around them, many young newcomers exhibit an optimism and confidence no economist could dampen. To some who have watched successive generations land here, this latest crop seems brash and entitled, with short attention spans and a video-game approach to life. Others see in them a social conscience and maturity that set them apart from the high-tech gold diggers of the 1990s.
Still emerging from their student years, most have yet to translate their earnings into material tokens of success. In San Francisco's expensive housing market, they tend to rent rather than own, often sharing quarters. They drive Hondas and Fords and maybe a Mini Cooper or two. In the tradition of start-ups here, they dress in jeans and other casual attire, augmented by the occasional pair of Bonobos.
At bars in the Mission District or trendy restaurants in the Marina District, they chatter about software upgrades and angel investors and new applications that could change the world -- or at least the way people use their iPhones. They go hiking rather than clubbing, look with a hint of impatience at their less social-media-savvy elders, are picky about their sushi and unhappy with iceberg lettuce.
The temples of the valley -- Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zynga -- loom large in their conversation. Some have already founded companies; nearly all have toyed with the idea.
''It's always at the back of my mind,'' said Danny Schauffer, who landed a job at Facebook after college and now works on the company's platform operations team.
Many started fending off job offers even before graduation, besieged by recruiters desperate to fill slots at established companies and start-ups, which at the last count numbered about 23,000, according to Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture, a company that analyzes Silicon Valley trends.
Computer engineers, in high demand but short supply, can command six-figure salaries right out of college, augmented by signing bonuses and equity or stock options. Eric Roberts, a professor of computer science at Stanford, said he knew of at least one $160,000 offer ''and I imagine there are larger numbers that I just don't know about.''
But technical skills are not essential. The rise of social media, with its more human face, has drawn graduates in history, psychology or music, and a slowly growing number of women and minorities.
Morin Oluwole, 27, grew up in Nigeria, moved to California in high school and graduated from Stanford with a bachelor's degree in biology and Spanish, a master's in sociology and a strong interest in fashion. Now she works in strategic partnership development at Facebook, helping fashion designers ''engage online.''
''What I've done is to turn my personal interests into what I do for a living,'' she said.
Ms. Oluwole's salary and benefits, she said, allow her ''to live more of a wider-range lifestyle,'' to travel and go hiking in Argentina and travel to other cities for events.
''You just have more disposable income to have an idea and actually act on that idea,'' she said.
Though many new graduates are content to draw high salaries working for others, entrepreneurship is still the elixir of the valley, but failure has a lower cost: anyone with an idea and a few hundred dollars can raise the money to take a spin on the start-up wheel.
''I might be losing two years of salary, but no risk, no reward,'' said Mr. Lee, who still receives regular queries from recruiters at Facebook and Google but pays himself $2,000 a month and shares a house with co-workers at Loki Studios, the company he founded.
''It's a nice dream to have: If I didn't have to answer to anybody, if I could run my own company,'' he said. ''Everyone has a friend who was at a start-up and made their own fortune, and everybody is curious if they could do it, too.''
Still, making billions of dollars is not what propels him, Mr. Lee said. ''The long hours, the stress, the roller coaster -- if that's your primary reason, you're going to burn out so quickly,'' he said.
Randy Komisar, a venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur, says the cavalier attitude of some young entrepreneurs worries him, and he wonders if they have the grit and resilience to cope if boom turns to bust.
''I think there's something as too much self-esteem,'' Mr. Komisar said. ''Everybody is doing their app, and everybody is doing a start-up, and everybody has raised a million dollars.''
Most, he said, ''have no clue how to connect the dots'' to create a sturdy, long-term product.
''My guess is that at some point the music stops and we find out that there's not just one less chair but hundreds of thousands of less chairs, and we'll have thousands of kids who haven't learned anything because they're all expecting to learn from each other,'' he said.
Professor Roberts, who has watched enrollment in computer science courses shoot up in the last year -- a class that last spring had 70 students now has 200 -- is less concerned. The newest crop of Silicon Valley hopefuls, he said, are ''interested in making enough money, but the crazy multiple millions of dollars that no one can spend, that I don't think is driving as much of the equation as it used to be. Increasingly, there are people who want to work on technology because they see that as a way to help people in the world who just aren't benefiting from that technology.''
In fact, as a group of former and current Facebook employees, including Ms. Oluwole and Mr. Schauffer, dined on ahi tacos and rock shrimp tempura at Umami in Cow Hollow on a recent evening, it was Bill Gates who was singled out as a role model, his bank account a definite plus but his philanthropy more important.
''Hitting the lottery is secondary to making a change,'' Mr. Schauffer said.

HEADLINE: Firebombings At Synagogues In New Jersey Lead to Arrest

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) -- A man who the authorities said was driven by hatred of Jews was charged Tuesday with firebombing two Bergen County synagogues.
The man, Anthony Graziano, 19, of Lodi, was arrested in the Jan. 11 attack on a Rutherford synagogue and the Jan. 3 firebombing of a Paramus synagogue. He was being held in $5 million bail. 
The charges include nine counts of attempted murder, bias intimidation, arson and aggravated arson.
''We have no doubt that the arson and attempted murder in Rutherford were a direct result of Mr. Graziano's hatred of people of the Jewish faith,'' the county prosecutor, John Molinelli, said.
The authorities said Mr. Graziano, who is unemployed, was a 2010 high school graduate and a loner who lacked access to a car but searched the Internet for nearby synagogues. He rode his bike to the two sites and, at the Rutherford synagogue, threw Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices, officials said. He is thought to have acted alone.
His father, also named Anthony Graziano, told The Record newspaper that he saw his son infrequently but that his son had never said anything to suggest he had any animosity toward Jews. He called his son ''a great kid'' but said ''he's confused.''
A man who answered the door at the defendant's home in Lodi told The Associated Press that the young man's mother was too distraught to speak and had known nothing of his activities.
In the Rutherford attack, according to the police, the Molotov cocktails were thrown at Congregation Beth El early on Jan. 11, igniting a fire in the second-floor bedroom of Rabbi Nosson Schuman, who lives with his family above the synagogue. They were all sleeping at the time. Mr. Molinelli said Mr. Graziano knew people were in the residence when he threw the bombs.
Once the ingredients of the bombs used in the Rutherford attack were identified -- low-grade motor oil, duct tape, hairspray and empty bottles of raspberry Crush soda -- investigators searched for stores that sold all those items. They came up with a Walmart in nearby Saddle Brook and were able to find surveillance video showing a man buying those items on Jan. 9.
Last week, they released still photos and video and received tips that led them to Mr. Graziano late Monday at the residence where he lives with his mother and siblings.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Trims Estimates for Global Growth on 'Sharply Escalating' Risks in Europe

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that global growth prospects had dimmed as the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone entered a ''perilous new phase.''
Releasing quarterly updates of three reports on the outlooks for the economy, debt and global financial stability, the fund cut its estimates of global growth this year to 3.25 percent, from the 4 percent it forecast in September, on ''sharply escalated'' risks emanating from Europe.
In light of that market uncertainty and sluggish growth, the fund is seeking to raise up to $500 billion in additional lending capacity. It is also calling on the European Union to expand its bailout fund to at least $1 trillion from its current capacity of 440 billion euros, or about $570 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations. 
Jose Vinals, director of the I.M.F.'s monetary and capital markets department, told reporters that the fund sought to build a ''global firewall'' -- both to help ease the euro crisis and to ensure that no bystanders to it find themselves locked out of the global financing markets.
In a speech in Berlin on Monday, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, said: ''The longer we wait, the worse it will get. The only solution is to move forward together.'' She called on the world to help bolster the I.M.F.'s resources and on Europe to bolster its own. ''The world must find the political will to do what it knows must be done.''
The I.M.F. cited continued high financing costs for European countries and weakness in European banks as two risks that had the capability to intensify each other and lead to ''sizable contractions'' in economic activity.
Other risks include investor fear over the debts of big countries like the United States and Japan, a ''hard landing'' in emerging economies and spiraling oil prices as the European bloc and the United States confront Iran.
The fund cut its growth forecasts for every region in the world, as well as for trade and commodity prices. The fund now estimates that Europe will experience a mild 0.1 percent contraction -- down from a September forecast of 1.4 percent growth -- with a sharper contraction of 0.5 percent among the 17 countries that use the euro currency and deeper recessions in Italy and Spain. It also cut its estimate of global trade volumes.
The I.M.F. did not change its growth forecast for the United States, however. Speaking with reporters, Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, said that the ''good and bad news'' about the American economy were ''more or less canceling each other'' out:
But the fund made a stark warning about the safety of the American financial system. The fund said that ''potential spillovers'' from the euro area crisis might ''include direct exposures of U.S. banks to euro-area banks, or the sale of U.S. assets by European banks.''
In recent months, American regulators and policy makers have played down such risks, pointing to sharply reduced exposure to Europe among money-market funds and investment banks.
The I.M.F. also warned that the United States might turn to austerity budgeting too soon, imperiling its own recovery. Carlo Cottarelli, the director of the fiscal affairs department, cited such premature fiscal tightening as a ''concrete risk.'' He noted that the steep, automatic budget cuts put into place by Congress last year would lead to the biggest hit to spending in four decades. He called for a more ''gradual decline in the deficit.''
The same advice applies to the rest of the world, the fund said. Mr. Cottarelli warned that ''both too little and too much adjustment will be bad for growth.'' The main risk is that too many countries will cut their budgets too deeply, too soon, sapping demand from the global economy.
Mr. Vinals, the director of the I.M.F.'s monetary and capital markets department, acknowledged that bond yields had declined in Europe in recent weeks. But he warned it ''should not be taken for granted, as some sovereign debt markets remain under stress and bank funding markets are on life support by the European Central Bank.''
Banks should continue to deleverage, the fund said, adding that they should do so by raising funds, rather than reducing credit and thus hampering economic activity.

HEADLINE: Anxiety Mounts Over Maturing Real Estate Loans

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Borrowers and lenders are starting to grapple with the billions of dollars in commercial real estate loans made during the boom year of 2007 that are coming due this year, in a greatly contracted economy.
Experts have warned of a rash of recapitalizations, refinancings and building sales. In New York City alone, nearly $70 billion worth of commercial mortgages that were bundled together and issued as collateral for bonds are maturing this year. Of those, $26 billion, or 37.4 percent, are five-year loans that were originated during the height of the real estate bubble, when underwriting standards were loosest, according to data from the research firm Trepp LLC.
These include loans on prominent properties, including the Manhattan Mall, with $232 million maturing, and the Jumeirah Essex House, with a $180 million loan, according to Trepp.
''These loans are going to have the hardest time being refinanced since they were underwritten when property values and revenues were far higher,'' said Thomas A. Fink, a managing director at Trepp. ''We are going to see a wave of loans maturing this year, then again in 2014 and 2017, when the 7- and 10-year deals underwritten during the bubble mature.'' 
Most large commercial mortgage loans are typically not self-amortizing -- that is, they require a balloon payment upon maturity.
While the number of loans maturing is expected to spike this year -- $40.7 billion worth of securitized commercial mortgage loans matured last year and $49.5 billion worth is expected to mature in 2013 -- the universe of lenders has shrunk. European banks, reeling from the debt crisis, have mostly stopped underwriting loans in the United States, while the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities remains relatively small, at roughly $30 billion in new issuance expected this year. And while insurance companies have increased their appetite for commercial mortgage loans, they are very conservative in their lending standards and selective in their deals.
''This means there may not be enough money available to refinance all of the debt that is coming due,'' said Lawrence J. Longua, a clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.
In a typical situation, a building that was worth $100 million in 2007 was financed with 80 percent debt, or $80 million. Now the loan -- which was interest-only, meaning no principal was paid -- is maturing. The borrower owes $80 million, but the value of the property has also dropped, to $80 million. This means that the ratio of the loan to the value of the property is 100 percent. Lenders have little appetite in this market environment for highly leveraged loans, so in one increasingly common outcome, the borrower will recapitalize the property by finding an equity partner to inject new capital into the deal, thereby lowering the overall amount of debt on the property.
Other possible resolutions include the lender extending the maturity date of the loan in the hopes that the property's value will rise, or pursuing a foreclosure. It is also becoming more common for banks and other lenders to sell their loans to third-party investors who may negotiate with the borrower.
One factor that may drive more deal activity this year is that banks, special servicers and other lenders are eager to find solutions to troubled loans now, rather than postpone a resolution in the hope the market will improve down the road, said Scott Rechler, the chief executive and chairman of RXR Realty, which has recapitalized several properties in the last year, including the recent acquisition of 620 Avenue of the Americas.
''The first half of 2011 was very strong, with a lot of deal-making,'' Mr. Rechler said, ''but then several incidents, including the European debt crisis and the downgrading of the U.S. debt, made the market seem frothy. This was actually somewhat healthy because it put things back into perspective.''
As a result of these market jitters, he said, ''lenders who had been waiting in the hopes that the market would improve, realized that things were still unstable and so they are more ready to resolve their loans now than in the past. Maybe not in the first quarter of this year, but by the second and third quarter I see a lot of things in the pipeline.''
Already, the number of recapitalizations has ballooned. There was $13.3 billion worth of recapitalizations nationwide in 2011, according to the research firm Real Capital Analytics, the most since the firm began tracking the number in 2001.
Another factor driving deal flow is the efforts by European banks to offload some of their American loan portfolios. In December, for example, Blackstone bought a $300 million portfolio of commercial loans backed by American properties from Eurohypo, the troubled real estate arm of Commerzbank in Germany. Other sellers include Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish. American banks have also been shedding loans: In September, Bank of America sold nearly $1 billion worth of loans to several investors at a discount.
The sale of these loans can help spur deals because investors who buy these loans at a discount have more room to negotiate a payoff with the borrower, said Andrew A. Lance, a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. A loan that has an outstanding balance of $100 million, for example, may sell to an investor for $80 million, enabling the investor to settle the loan with the borrower for any price between $80 million and $100 million, resulting in a profit for the investor and a discount for the borrower. While under this situation the original lender loses out, in the case of several European banks, regulators are ordering them to increase capital and shrink their balance sheets.
Dune Real Estate Partners participated in such a deal last year when it acquired the loan on the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street from Anglo Irish, recently completing a recapitalization of the property. Dan Neidich, the chief executive of Dune Real Estate Partners, said: ''There are so many players now who aren't the natural owners of real estate -- like banks and special services -- that never intended to own equity and who want to exit those positions. It opens opportunities for people like ourselves, who are in the business of taking equity risk, and bringing capital into the market to restructure deals.''
But not all borrowers will find themselves in trouble. There are many New York landlords who can simply pay down the loans without much struggle, market experts say. Vornado Realty Trust, for example, refinanced a $430 million loan at 350 Park Avenue in January with $300 million in debt and $132 million in cash. It is currently in the market to refinance the $232 million loan maturing on the Manhattan Mall, at Broadway and 33rd Street.
Still, even those borrowers who can pay down the loans themselves will have to contend with the softened market. ''The key issue that cuts across all property types and all kinds of loans,'' said Dennis W. Russo, a partner and co-chairman of the real estate practice at the law firm Herrick, Feinstein, ''is that property values -- the value of the collateral that secures the debt -- are down. Combine that with the fact that lenders are conservative right now, and the bottom line is that in many scenarios, borrowers are going to have to find additional capital.''

HEADLINE: Average Is Over

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
In an essay, entitled ''Making It in America,'' in the latest issue of The Atlantic, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has only two employees today, ''a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.''
Davidson's article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and sagging middle-class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also because of the quantum advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers. 
In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to. It can't when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra -- their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment. Average is over.
Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. As they say, if horses could have voted, there never would have been cars. But there's been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, ''In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs -- about 6 million in total -- disappeared.''
And you ain't seen nothin' yet. Last April, Annie Lowrey of Slate wrote about a start-up called ''E la Carte'' that is out to shrink the need for waiters and waitresses: The company ''has produced a kind of souped-up iPad that lets you order and pay right at your table. The brainchild of a bunch of M.I.T. engineers, the nifty invention, known as the Presto, might be found at a restaurant near you soon. ... You select what you want to eat and add items to a cart. Depending on the restaurant's preferences, the console could show you nutritional information, ingredients lists and photographs. You can make special requests, like 'dressing on the side' or 'quintuple bacon.' When you're done, the order zings over to the kitchen, and the Presto tells you how long it will take for your items to come out. ... Bored with your companions? Play games on the machine. When you're through with your meal, you pay on the console, splitting the bill item by item if you wish and paying however you want. And you can have your receipt e-mailed to you. ... Each console goes for $100 per month. If a restaurant serves meals eight hours a day, seven days a week, it works out to 42 cents per hour per table -- making the Presto cheaper than even the very cheapest waiter.''
What the iPad won't do in an above average way a Chinese worker will. Consider this paragraph from Sunday's terrific article in The Times by Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher about why Apple does so much of its manufacturing in China: ''Apple had redesigned the iPhone's screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly-line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the [Chinese] plant near midnight. A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. 'The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,' the executive said. 'There's no American plant that can match that.' ''
And automation is not just coming to manufacturing, explains Curtis Carlson, the chief executive of SRI International, a Silicon Valley idea lab that invented the Apple iPhone program known as Siri, the digital personal assistant. ''Siri is the beginning of a huge transformation in how we interact with banks, insurance companies, retail stores, health care providers, information retrieval services and product services.''
There will always be change -- new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average. Here are the latest unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Americans over 25 years old: those with less than a high school degree, 13.8 percent; those with a high school degree and no college, 8.7 percent; those with some college or associate degree, 7.7 percent; and those with bachelor's degree or higher, 4.1 percent.
In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to buttress employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I. Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to post-high school education.

HEADLINE: Impasse Over Greece Sends S.&P. Down

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed on Tuesday as European finance ministers and Greek bondholders were at a stalemate over how to resolve that nation's debt crisis.
''It's all about the negotiations of Greek debt,'' Mike Ryan, the New York-based chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas, said in a telephone interview. ''There's concern that, if it spills over, it undermines some of the progress being made. I'm still not convinced that they solved all of their problems. The next question is how deep of an impact that will have on earnings.''
Global stocks slumped as European finance ministers pushed bondholders to provide greater debt relief for Greece, spurring concern that the nation might fail to make a March 20 bond payment. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for the global economy. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,314.65, after rising 2.1 percent in the previous five days.
The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 33.07 points, or 0.26 percent, to 12,675.75. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.47 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,786.64.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 2/32, to 99 14/32. The yield was unchanged at 2.06 percent.
Travelers retreated 3.8 percent, or $2.29, to $58. The insurer said fourth-quarter profit fell on lower investment income and a smaller reserve benefit, capping the company's least profitable year since 2004.
Shares of McDonald's slid 2.2 percent, or $2.20, to $98.75, after the company said that foreign-currency fluctuations would cut 2012 profit.
McDonald's, which gets about 60 percent of its revenue outside the United States, said profit might be trimmed as the European debt crisis sank the region's currency. Foreign-exchange fluctuations may cut 2012 profit by as much as 18 cents a share and first-quarter earnings by as much as 3 cents, its chief financial officer, Peter J. Bensen, said in a conference call.
The telecommunications sector had the biggest loss in the S.& P. 500 among 10 groups, slumping 1.3 percent.
Verizon Communications dropped 1.6 percent, or 61 cents, to $37.79, after it reported a fourth-quarter loss stemming from a pension charge and having higher subsidy costs for rising iPhone sales.
In a conference call, Verizon gave a 2012 earnings-forecast range whose bottom trailed analysts' estimates.
Its rival AT&T declined 1 percent, or 31 cents, to $30.09.
Shares of Peabody Energy retreated 1.73 percent, or 65 cents, to $36.86. Sales from Australian mines fell to 6.2 million tons from 6.7 million tons while geological issues reduced output at North Goonyella in Australia, Peabody said.
The company is also moving a longwall, a type of coal face at an underground mine, at the Twentymile pit in Colorado, which will interrupt production there.
Shares of Coach, the retailer of handbags and other goods, jumped 5.81 percent, or $3.73. to $67.97. The company reported a 15 percent increase in quarterly profit that topped analysts' estimates, driven by holiday sales in North America.
Apple surged more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. The technology company reported that its profit for the holiday quarter more than doubled.
The holiday purchases of the new iPhone helped the company steer clear of the consumer spending slump that has hurt rival technology companies.
David Joy, the Boston-based chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, said in a telephone interview, ''The market is not terribly disappointed by what appear to be soft earnings compared to where we've been.
''There's a creeping sense of optimism that things are going to improve. That lessens the fear that along with softness in Europe we'll have a global recession.''

HEADLINE: Regulating the Banks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera's Jan. 17 column, ''Keep It Simple,'' is correct that the Dodd-Frank law is far too complex, offering confusing and often contradictory standards and regulatory proposals. But Dodd-Frank, like most regulation, is reactive and not proactive. 
Instead of waiting until something happens to act, Congress should create simple legislation to prevent the underlying causes of the 2008 financial crisis from realigning in such a way to bring down the economy (think of Glass-Steagall). Dodd-Frank does nothing to prevent the ''too big to fail'' banks from growing bigger and failing. It simply allows for an orderly liquidation once an institution fails.
The best way to prevent another crisis is not to allow the banks to get bigger and more systemically important, and then wind them down tidily after failure. The best way to prevent another crisis is to prevent them from getting too big in the first place.
AARON NESSEL Evanston, Ill., Jan. 18, 2012

HEADLINE: Director Quits After Changes At Global Fund

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
The executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria resigned Tuesday, culminating two months of struggle over the future direction of the fund.
Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, a French AIDS specialist who helped set up the fund 10 years ago and had overseen it for the last five years, said he was leaving because the fund's board announced in November that it would appoint a general manager to oversee day-to-day operations and a new transition plan. That effectively reduced Dr. Kazatchkine's role to that of chief fund-raiser and public advocate. 
''He felt there wasn't room at the top for two people and the best thing he should do is step aside,'' a fund spokesman, Jon Liden, said.
On Tuesday, the board named as general manager a retired bank executive, Gabriel Jaramillo. A Brazilian citizen educated in California, Mr. Jaramillo was on a panel that recently looked at the fund's auditing controls, found them flawed and proposed a reorganization plan. He said his goals would be ''to achieve maximum efficiency, accountability and concrete results that save lives.''
The fund has had a hard time raising money in the last two years because of the global recession and corruption scandals. Although only a fraction of the fund's grants appeared to have been stolen and the thefts were uncovered by its own inspector general, they took place in several countries. Some countries threatened to stop contributing unless reforms were made.
In late 2010, after saying it needed a minimum of $13 billion, the fund was able to raise only $11.7 billion. In November, it said it would continue existing grants but make no new ones.
In his annual letter to the world, drafted before Dr. Kazatchkine resigned and released on Tuesday evening, Bill Gates, founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, noted the fund's troubles. ''Given the places where the Global Fund works,'' he said, ''it was not surprising that some of the money was diverted for corrupt purposes.''

HEADLINE: Our Options for Dealing With Iran

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Bomb-Bomb-Bomb, Bomb-Bomb-Iran?'' (column, Jan. 23), Bill Keller mocks my proposal for a preventive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but the alternative policy options are even less attractive.
In Mr. Keller's own words, ''it's hard to imagine'' the current diplomatic approach succeeding, and the associated sanctions might still provoke war with Iran, while simply acquiescing to a nuclear-armed Iran is ''awful to contemplate,'' ''scary'' and could result in ''Armageddon.'' 
Mr. Keller is wrong to claim that I aspire to be a ''Strangelovian superhawk'' or that my former Pentagon colleagues are ''appalled'' by my analysis. Rather, other strategists and I are doing our best to wrestle with the most vexing national security challenge facing the country.
It is easy for critics to point out the downsides to the various options for dealing with Iran's nuclear program. Developing workable alternatives is much harder.
MATTHEW KROENIG Nuclear Security Fellow Council on Foreign Relations Washington, Jan. 24, 2012
To the Editor:
In Bill Keller's summary of the risks of military strikes on Iran, he and others miss the full implications of Israel's statement that all options are on the table. If Jerusalem really believes that a nuclear-armed Tehran poses an existential threat -- and cannot be contained by a conventional military attack, sanctions, deterrence or regime change -- there remains one option to end the threat that people fear to talk about: Israel's use of nuclear weapons.
Far-fetched? Thinking the unthinkable remains embedded in the planning of all nuclear-armed nations. For an Israel that grew out of the Holocaust and beat back adversaries seeking its destruction without the bomb, the unthinkable option becomes more plausible when a nuclear-arming Iran repeatedly calls for the Jewish state's extinction. I hope that the mullahs will realize that nuclear weapons ill serve their survival.
BENNETT RAMBERG Los Angeles, Jan. 23, 2012
The writer served in the State Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs under President George H. W. Bush and is the author of ''Destruction of Nuclear Energy Facilities in War.''
To the Editor:
Bill Keller nicely explains the various options regarding a potentially nuclear-armed Iran. Although he portrays Ron Paul's position as ''the let-Iran-be-Iran extreme,'' there is nothing extreme about it. In fact, Mr. Paul's policy is the only one that will avoid war.
The United States' and European Union's harsh economic sanctions will force Iran either to accept a humbling defeat without a shot being fired or to close the Strait of Hormuz, an important oil route, which would surely bring war.
The West has two excellent options that avoid both scenarios: an explicit policy of nuclear retaliation should Iran use its nuclear arsenal on either the United States or our allies, and/or a missile defense system to protect our forces and allies. Deterrence proved effective in the cold war, as well as in relation to North Korea now. There is every reason to expect it to be just as effective with Iran.
PATRICK BARRON West Chester, Pa., Jan. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
It simply astonishes me that all but one of the Republican presidential hopefuls, obviously pandering to what they think their base wants, is willing to take this nation to war with Iran -- yet another war that they will not raise their taxes to pay for and that their children will not fight.

HEADLINE: Producers Postpone 'Rebecca' on Broadway

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The producers of the Broadway-bound musical ''Rebecca,'' which had been scheduled to begin performances on March 27, said on Tuesday that they were postponing the show until the 2012-13 season because they ran out of time to raise the production's $12 million capitalization. The musical, which had been set to begin rehearsals on Feb. 6, would have been one of the most expensive of the 2011-12 theater season, but the producers were widely known around Broadway to be struggling to raise the final 20 percent of the show's budget.
In a statement, one of the lead producers, Ben Sprecher, blamed their inability to recruit investors on the poor economic climate and said, ''raising money for Broadway has become even more difficult and laborious than it has historically been.'' 
''We are very close to meeting our financial goal, but we just ran short of time to complete capitalization with rehearsals slated to begin in two weeks,'' Mr. Sprecher continued. ''We feel that 'Rebecca' is too special of a musical to short change in any way. It is our responsibility to the creators of this show, to our cast, our partners, our investors and our vendors that the complete financing is in place before rehearsals begin.''
Raising money for Broadway shows has been a mixed proposition lately. A $12 million revival of ''Funny Girl'' fell apart last fall when several investors pulled their money from that production, questioning its capacity to be profitable. Yet plenty of shows are expected to have their money in place for this season, including the other new musicals ''Once,'' ''Newsies,'' ''Leap of Faith,'' ''Ghost,'' and ''Nice Work If You Can Get It.'' Some of these are coming to Broadway at half the cost of ''Rebecca,'' while straight plays cost even less, usually around $3 million.
Broadway producers often announce show performance dates, theaters, and actors before all of the money to capitalize the show has been raised, to build buzz or convey commitment to potential investors in hopes that they will write checks.
''Rebecca'' had secured a prime Broadway theater, the Broadhurst, on West 44th St. just off Times Square. There was no immediate word if another show would open at the Broadhurst by April 26, which is as the cutoff date for Broadway shows to be eligible for Tony Award nominations and awards.
''Rebecca,'' based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier (which was also adapted for film in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock), centers on the new wife of a wealthy Englishman, Maxim de Winter, and their spooky life on his estate, Manderley, which may be haunted by his dead first wife. Joan Fontaine played the second Mrs. de Winter in the film; on Broadway, the actress Sierra Boggess was to have played the character. The directors of the Broadway production were to be Michael Blakemore (a Tony winner for ''Kiss Me, Kate'') and Francesca Zambello (''The Little Mermaid''). Christopher Hampton (''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'') wrote an adaptation of the musical's original book by Michael Kunze; the two men are also credited for the lyrics, with music by Sylvester Levay.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rise in Oil Imports Drives a Rare Trade Deficit in Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan reported its first annual trade deficit in 31 years last year, government data showed Wednesday, as fuel imports surged in the wake of its nuclear disaster at Fukushima.
The nation's exports also fell slightly as a result of last year's devastating tsunami, tepid global demand and a punishingly strong yen -- though a surprisingly strong post-disaster rebound by its exporters has kept the fall to a minimum.
Instead, much of Japan's 2.49 trillion yen ($32 billion) deficit in 2011 came as a result of a 33 percent increase in petroleum and other imports from the Middle East after the Fukushima nuclear crisis led to the idling of reactors across the country. 
Japan now runs a trade deficit of more than 10 trillion yen ($129 billion) with the Middle East, in particular the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran. Japan's dependence on the region for oil has come into sharp relief in recent weeks as pressure mounts from the United States to curb oil imports from Iran after a standoff over its nuclear program.
Japan's trade deficit with its largest trading partner, China, widened after Tokyo's exports to that country fell by 3 percent while imports rose 10 percent on a surge in purchases of machinery and other industrial goods for the post-tsunami reconstruction.
The widening deficit also underscores the standing of China as Asia's manufacturing powerhouse, a role once played by Japan.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States remained high, however, with the island nation selling almost twice as much to the United States -- mostly cars and machinery -- as it buys from it. Japan's exports to the United States fell more than 3 percent in 2011, while imports stayed flat.
Overall, Japan's exports fell 2.7 percent for the year to 65.5 trillion yen ($842 billion) after the strong post-tsunami rebound among its exporters, who raced to fix ravaged factories and severed supply chains -- while its imports rose 12 percent to 68 trillion yen ($874 billion). The fall in Japan's exports in 2011 was far smaller than in 2009, when exports, battered by the global financial crisis, fell a startling 33 percent. But the nation's imports plunged at a similar rate that year, allowing Japan to eke out a slight trade surplus.
Still, Japan's negative trade balance comes at a time when the nation's aging population and recent sluggish economic growth is also driving down its savings rate. Some analysts fear that the country could eventually struggle to finance its public debt, which has ballooned to more than twice the size of its economy.
And that trade deficit could continue to widen. Heightened public fears over nuclear safety after the multiple fuel meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March have made it difficult for operators across the country to keep their reactors running.
Only four of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors are still running, and these are scheduled to be stopped for maintenance in months, forcing Japan to fire up old thermal power stations to meet the shortfall. Imports rose 8.1 percent in December from a year earlier, again thanks to rising fuel needs.
The government has pushed for the quick restart of nuclear reactors that pass safety checks. But many experts say that Japan could do more to increase its output of solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy.
Meanwhile, Japan's exports continue to suffer from weakening global demand and a strong yen, which helps makes its cars and electronics more expensive, and therefore less competitive, overseas. The strong yen also erodes the value of Japanese exporters' overseas earnings when repatriated back home.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Profit Rises 11%, But Investors Fret Over 2012

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation posted strong December sales and fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, but the results failed to allay fears that exchange rates and increased spending would weaken profits in 2012. 
Those worries sent shares of the company down $2.20, or 2 percent, to $98.75 a share.
Foreign exchange raised McDonald's earnings by 19 cents a share in 2011 and will work against the company by roughly the same amount in 2012, analysts said.
That impact will be keenly felt in Europe, which is McDonald's top market for sales, they said, as the euro weakens against the United States dollar as a result of debt worries in the region.
Matthew DiFrisco, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, added other items to the list of concerns.
Those included higher taxes and interest expense as well as increased spending on things like restaurant renovations, building new units, compensation and technology upgrades.
''You've got this little creep of things working against them,'' Mr. DiFrisco said.
McDonald's is a top sponsor of the 2012 Olympics in London and has told investors that dilution from its China expansion, which was more of a factor than analysts expected in the latest quarter, would ease in 2012.
McDonald's reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.38 billion, or $1.33 a share, up almost 11 percent from $1.24 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 10 percent, to $6.82 billion from $6.21 billion.
Sales at stores open at least a year rose 9.6 percent in December, with a 9.8 percent increase in the United States and a 10.8 percent rise in Europe.
Analysts on average forecast a 5.9 percent increase over all, with a 5.4 percent increase in the United States and a 6.4 percent increase in Europe, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The results, which were helped by new menu items, restaurant makeovers, longer operating hours and effective marketing, defied a global economic slowdown and helped McDonald's continue to outpace rivals like Wendy's and Burger King.

HEADLINE: Public College, Private Dorm

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
With state budgets tight and demand for a college education at a high point, public universities across the country are increasingly turning to the private sector to build and finance on-campus dormitories.
Even before the recession, states found that companies that specialize in student housing could build residence halls more rapidly and cheaply than universities could. They can ease the burden of being a landlord. And perhaps most important, these partnerships free capital for facilities like classrooms and laboratories.
But as bad economic times make these arrangements even more appealing, the new efforts raise questions about how private ownership of dorms will affect student life and costs in years to come.
Public universities that have entered into or are considering such partnerships include the University of California, Irvine; Arizona State; Portland State; the University of Kentucky; and Montclair State in New Jersey, which in the fall opened the Heights, a two-tower complex with 2,000 beds and a 24,000-square-foot food court that officials say is the largest residence hall complex in the state. 
Private colleges and universities have been slower to embrace the concept as they have traditionally financed their student housing with endowments, philanthropy and student fees. Private colleges are less attractive to private developers because they tend to be smaller, so their housing needs are less extensive.
Although proponents of private partnerships point to lower costs for construction and operation, those savings are not necessarily passed on to students. A room at the Heights, for example, costs about $1,000 more a semester than a room in Montclair State's other dorms.
''These things are often sold as savings, but they don't often result in savings,'' said Edward P. St. John, an education professor at the University of Michigan and an editor of ''Privatization and Public Universities,'' published in 2006.
Montclair State officials point to additional amenities available at the Heights and its mint condition as reasons for the premium price tag. A committee of university officials and employees of Capstone Development Partners, the builder, will determine the cost each year.
Capstone developed the Heights, enlisting the Provident Resources Group, a nonprofit organization, to finance the $211 million project with tax-exempt bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Capstone will manage it for the next 40 years or until the bonds are paid off and the title reverts to the university. The university will retain authority over student conduct within.
Montclair State previously financed its capital projects with tax-exempt municipal bonds. But after a decade of ambitious construction projects, the university had a lot of debt. The New Jersey Economic Stimulus Act of 2009 gave it the authority to enter into a partnership with a private firm.
''We needed to provide housing for our students, and we needed to find a way to do it,'' said Susan A. Cole, the president of Montclair State.
Private developers have long had an interest in student housing. As student populations surged in the decades after World War II, universities quickly built out their own campuses, and builders responded with inexpensive, bare-bones low-rise and garden apartments.
In the recent real estate boom, luxury apartments sprang up near campuses around the country, enticing students with amenities like gyms and spas. Now, with dorms aging and money tight, universities are inviting private developers to build on the quads.
''It doesn't matter how large an institution you are,'' said William C. Bayless Jr., the chief executive of American Campus Communities, a student housing real estate investment trust. ''You should look at the most cost-effective way to develop student housing to save your capital dollars for other projects.''
Portland State University in Oregon is building a 16-story residence hall in a public-private partnership with American Campus Communities. When the $90 million mixed-use building, called University Pointe, opens in August, it will be the first privately developed student housing project in the university's history. American Campus Communities will own and manage University Pointe for up to 85 years before it reverts to the university.
''This is a watershed moment for us,'' said Monica Rimai, the vice president for finance and administration at Portland State. ''What are the implications for our status as a public institution?''
The long-term impacts for institutions are not yet fully known. Increasingly, private companies are investing their own money in these deals, an option that is attractive to universities that lack capital and want to avoid debt financing altogether. These agreements often include greater control over the properties and lengthy land leases, in which the university leases the land to the private company.
Over the course of a century, the quality of the housing could deteriorate. The shareholders of a REIT may press for greater returns, perhaps leading to cost cuts and rate increases that affect the quality of student life.
''If you're a school and suddenly you have a private developer come on campus and they mess up and don't perform, that's a huge risk for the school,'' said Alexander D. Goldfarb, a senior REIT analyst at Sandler O'Neill and Partners.
Boise State University in Idaho recently called off a private equity deal with American Campus Communities to build a 900-bed dorm, partly because of worries about signing an 85-year deal.
James Maguire, the university architect at Boise State, said: ''The board began to say, 'Who knows what the university may need to use its land for in that kind of a time frame?' It limits your options in the future.'' Ultimately, the university decided to finance a smaller, 350-bed dorm on its own with municipal bonds.
Montclair State's problem was that the university, with more than 18,000 undergraduate and graduate students, about 4,300 of whom live on campus, simply could not provide enough housing. A year ago, students lived in triple rooms, student lounges and hotels in nearby Clifton along the busy Route 3 highway. With few affordable rentals in this suburban area, many students commuted.
''We couldn't tell our students from South Jersey to commute,'' Dr. Cole said. ''They're closer to Maryland and Delaware and they could get housing there.''
The Heights complex, perched on a quarry site on Montclair State's Spanish colonial-style campus, is light and airy with large student lounges, quiet study rooms and a basement clubhouse. Rooms are spacious with private baths. Many have views of the New York skyline.
''A lot of people will consider living on campus because of it,'' said Arriel Miles, 21, a senior who lives at the Heights.
Ms. Miles, now a resident assistant, commuted 35 minutes from Rahway her first two years. She said if the Heights had been an option, she might have pressed her mother to let her live on campus sooner.
Now, in what could be one of the largest private campus housing transactions to date, the University of Kentucky is considering handing over all of its student housing, 5,100 beds, to Education Realty Trust, a REIT. As part of the deal, Education Realty would demolish most of the existing buildings to make way for 9,000 new beds in what amounts to $500 million in new construction.
''This is their core business,'' Angela S. Martin, the treasurer of the University of Kentucky, said of Education Realty Trust. ''They can build it cheaper. They can build it faster and they can operate it leaner than we can. This is not the university's core business.''

HEADLINE: A Way to Make People Buy Homes Again

BYLINE: By JAMES A. WILCOX


HIGHLIGHT: James A. Wilcox, an economist, is a professor of business in the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
MANY potential homebuyers who can afford to buy are instead waiting, worried that home prices will continue to decline.
In its most recent quarterly survey, Fannie Mae reported a continuing decline in the fraction of renters and homeowners who think buying a home is a safe investment.
But there is a way to buy a home with less risk to one's hard-earned cash: a down-payment protection plan. 
Down-payment protection would provide a sensible and affordable way to restore confidence. It would complement the proposals President Obama made in his State of the Union address Tuesday for increasing mortgage refinancings at today's low interest rates.
When combined with other economic woes, is it any wonder that so many potential buyers, especially younger adults, are renting, or living with relatives? By one recent estimate, the nation has about two million fewer households than under more normal conditions. Some of these potential buyers hesitate to take the risk of buying, even though their jobs and credit history may qualify them for mortgages. While near-record numbers of houses all over the country are empty, the sidelines are crowded with this huge ''shadow demand.''
Activating that demand for houses, condos and apartments would help the sales of related goods and services, which would in turn help reduce unemployment.
Here's how down-payment protection could work. Homebuyers could purchase protection from the government for a one-time fee, say 1 percent of the house purchase price, or $2,000 on a house selling for $200,000. The fee could vary with the risk of house price declines in each area. The plan would be open to all buyers.
At the end of three years, the government would automatically mail checks to protected homeowners if average house prices in their area were lower than when they purchased their homes. (No decline, no check -- just like auto insurance.)
Or, the payment might be applied to the mortgage to reduce the balance due. Declines would be based on the government's house-price indexes for nearly 400 areas in the country. Either way, without selling their homes, at the end of the third year homebuyers would be quickly and fully compensated for any loss of equity, up to the amount of their down payment.
Down-payment protection would encourage lenders to ease currently tight credit conditions. The Federal Reserve has documented that banks' lending standards have become tighter. Maybe they've tightened them too much. Because lenders' risks tend to rise as house prices fall, the protection could also be used to encourage lenders to ease their mortgage terms a bit. In that scenario, the buyer of the house could pay for the down-payment protection and then assign it to the lender in return for easier mortgage terms, like agreeing to lower rates, fees or down payments.
That, too, would advance the goal of allowing more borrowers to qualify and buy houses.
Only the federal government can readily offer a down-payment protection program that is large enough to raise actual and expected future house prices, which would in turn lower how much the buyer would have to pay. In addition, unlike private providers of protection, the government reaps substantial extra revenue when its policies raise national income. Even if the taxpayers provide some subsidy, to the extent that the economy does better, they would get some benefit.
Depending on the fees and revenue gains, based on a scenario of two million participating home buyers, the expected net cost to taxpayers would be a few billion dollars annually, far less than some of the housing programs that have already been tried.
And, if it demonstrated the viability of the protection, the government could pass the baton to the private sector.
Having the government offer not just mortgage insurance to protect lenders, but also down-payment protection for homebuyers, could increase demand. A stronger housing sector in turn improves business for those who provide related services and products, which would create more jobs.

HEADLINE: In a Plan to Close a Customs Post, Seeing Harm for Beer, Bananas and a Port Itself

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The journey of a banana from Ecuador to Brooklyn is a precisely timed affair, from the moment it is sliced off a stalk and then packed onto a ship for a seven-day refrigerated cruise to the Red Hook Container Terminal. From there, the banana has one week to make it from container to distributor to grocery store.
Now that journey is about to get a bit longer. 
Customs officials intend to shut down their inspection station at the Red Hook terminal; the closing would force companies to unload thousands of containers a year and deliver the cargo by truck to another terminal equipped with a customs inspection station, either in New Jersey or on Staten Island.
Port operators and shippers say the extra trip over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge would raise banana prices by a couple of cents a pound and squeeze a little more time from the bananas' short ripe life. Bananas are not the only issue: the Red Hook Container Terminal also accepts 15 percent of all beer heading into the region, which means prices could rise about 75 cents on every 12-pack.
''Basically you're just taking beer on a ride to Staten Island, and right back from where it came from,'' said Greg Brayman, vice president of Phoenix Beverages, which receives 90 40-foot containers of beer like Heineken and Red Stripe each week at Red Hook. ''It's a huge deal.''
Even more endangered than beer and bananas, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, is Brooklyn's vulnerable port system, which receives 110,000 containers each year and remains an important regional economic driver.
Mr. Nadler, who has long supported an expansion of Brooklyn's ports, said that two-thirds of the population in New York City and its suburbs lives east of the Hudson River. But residents often depend on goods to be driven by truck from New Jersey. He estimated that with the closing of customs at Red Hook, companies would spend more than $2 million on trucking a year and add 3,700 trucks to local roads and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge -- extra costs that could imperil the expansion of shipping in Brooklyn entirely.
''It's a tremendous incentive for these shipping companies to say, 'Why bother with Red Hook?' '' Mr. Nadler said. ''It's imperative to the economy that we have a port on both sides of the river.''
Officials from Customs and Border Protection said they spent more than a year considering whether to close operations at Red Hook. In a letter to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey dated Dec. 5, a customs official, Adele Fasano, stressed that the amount of cargo was ''a relatively small percentage of the international cargo entering the Port of New York/Newark.'' The Red Hook Container Terminal handles about 1 percent of the containers coming into the Port of New York and New Jersey, or about 110,000 containers, each year. The other container ports combined process about three million containers each year.
Of the 59,323 containers that arrived at Red Hook in 2011, only 3,739 were unpacked and inspected by Customs and Border Protection, according to the Port Authority. Customs uses a range of programs and tips to decide what containers are the most necessary to inspect. Anthony Bucci, a customs spokesman, said officials concluded that consolidating operations would ''provide more expeditious processing of containers requiring examination.''
But the prospect of sending uninspected goods that arrive in Brooklyn over local roads alarmed some elected officials, like Representative Michael G. Grimm, who held a news conference on Friday at the Brooklyn port to share his concerns.
''Over my dead body are they going to be sending trucks through my district,'' Mr. Grimm, a Republican, said. ''It would be a security nightmare.''
A customs spokeswoman emphasized that the containers would still go through security measures in Brooklyn, adding that containers would still go through some checks. If a situation warranted it, customs officers could still have containers unpacked to examine specific goods in Red Hook.
''Every container that enters the country will continue to be inspected utilizing C.B.P.'s layered enforcement strategy,'' said Jenny Burke, a customs spokeswoman. ''Any changes to the Red Hook terminal will be executed in a way that does not impact security.''
Companies sending goods through the terminal did not have much warning of customs' departure. Gary Whyte, director of Northeast operations and maritime security with Ecuadorian Line, a shipping agent that has a contractual obligation with the port to bring as much as three million pounds of bananas into the Red Hook terminal every Sunday, said a customs official called him in December. He was told that customs operations would close at Red Hook on Jan. 9 and that he should choose a new centralized examination station to work with.
Mr. Whyte chose two stations in New Jersey that would also help with his agricultural inspections, and estimated that the move would cost him $400 more per container of bananas. (A container typically holds about 38,400 pounds of bananas.)
Mr. Whyte said it would be hard to pass the extra costs onto customers. ''Right now it's tough to compete,'' he said.
So far, the move has not happened. On Jan. 6, three days before the scheduled closing, customs officials agreed to talk with elected officials, including Mr. Nadler, Senator Charles E. Schumer and representatives from the offices of the mayor, the governor and the Port Authority. By that evening, Michael J. Yeager, an assistant commissioner with the Office of Congressional Affairs at Customs and Border Protection, sent an e-mail to elected officials saying customs would remain in Red Hook for 90 more days ''to review the concerns presented, and determine the best approach.''
''We are pleased that C.B.P. officials responded to our concerns about the impacts of the decision,'' said Steve Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman. ''The long-term viability of the port at Red Hook and the 700 direct jobs they create in Brooklyn are on the line.''
As the new deadline approaches, Mr. Nadler is trying to organize a meeting with other elected officials on Monday to devise a way for customs to remain in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Partial Step

 BODY:
Egypt's military junta showed some political sense on Tuesday when it announced the easing of a longtime state of emergency law, a hated symbol of authoritarian rule under President Hosni Mubarak -- and now. The generals clearly hope to placate activists who had planned new protests for Wednesday, the anniversary of the revolt that led to Mr. Mubarak's ouster. 
Whether they intend to significantly change their behavior is another matter. Instead of just repealing the 1981 law, as it should have, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi announced that the military government would limit its use of extrajudicial arrests and detentions to ''thuggery.''
That's a broad loophole for generals who have used the malleable ''thuggery'' charge before as an all-purpose way to go after anyone they chose. More than 800 Egyptians were killed in the past year as the military used excessive force to break up demonstrations and torture detainees. And more than 12,000 civilians were referred to military tribunals, according to Human Rights Watch.
There is positive news. The military allowed elections to proceed and, on Monday, Egypt's first freely elected Parliament in six decades held its opening session. Islamists dominate the new legislature, but the main party, the Muslim Brotherhood, seems to be acting responsibly.
The generals, however, have refused to cede power until the end of June, after a new constitution is ratified and a president elected. And they insist on negotiating certain issues -- including what the constitution will say on civilian oversight of the military -- solely with the Brotherhood.
We are also alarmed by the junta's raids and continued interrogations of foreign-financed groups, including the United States-based National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute and Freedom House. So, rightly, are some members of Congress.
Egypt faces many challenges, including a serious economic crisis. If the junta does not do a better job of supporting a democratic transition, the Obama administration will have a hard time certifying that Egypt meets new Congressional conditions for $2 billion in annual American aid, most of which goes to the army.

 BODY:
8 P.M. (HBO2) IN TAHRIR SQUARE: 18 DAYS OF EGYPT'S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION (2012) A year ago on Wednesday, the filmmakers Jon Alpert and Matthew O'Neill were in Cairo, capturing the sights and sounds of a protest, above, that ultimately ended the 30-year regime of President Hosni Mubarak and helped ignite change in the Arab world. Their colleague Sharif Abdel Kouddous, an Egyptian-American journalist, led cameramen into Tahrir Square and provided accounts of the turmoil, in which nearly 850 people were killed. ''Everyone is proud to be Egyptian today,'' Mr. Kouddous said in an American news broadcast on Feb. 11, when it was announced that Mr. Mubarak would resign. ''Everyone who fights for democracy and fights for freedom is Egyptian today, and stands with us.'' 
8 A.M. (IFC) DOUBT (2008) Meryl Streep -- who just earned her 17th Oscar nomination for her role as Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady'' -- plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Roman Catholic school in the Bronx who comes to believe that her supervisor, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest in one of their charges in John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his stage play. Amy Adams is a younger nun who fuels the suspicions. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said, ''Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, 'Doubt' essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach.''

Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council, representing the 39th District in Brooklyn, discusses early childhood education, affordable housing and community involvement in government. In ''City Talk,'' at 9:30, Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, talks about how the views of Albert Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers from 1964 to 1984 and of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997, affect educational standards today.

''A lot of times, rather than helping people with horse problems, I'm helping horses with people problems,'' he says. Manohla Dargis, who chose the film as a Critics' Pick for The Times, wrote: '' 'Buck' is an imperfect documentary. It leaves nagging questions unanswered, including the fate of Mr. Brannaman's brother, and the movie's beauty shots at times threaten to embalm nature instead of exalting it. Yet in some sense it was beauty that saved Mr. Brannaman, that of his conscience and that of horses, which, having been tied to humans long ago, became companions, workers and for some, as this lovely movie shows, saviors.''
9 P.M. (13) MYSTERY OF A MASTERPIECE In October 2009, a portrait of a young woman in Renaissance dress known as ''La Bella Principessa'' made the news when art experts declared it a previously undiscovered masterwork by Leonardo da Vinci. With that, the chalk-and-ink work, which had sold several years earlier for around $20,000, was thought by some to be worth more than $100 million. Others declared it a fraud. ''Nova'' and National Geographic investigate the artwork's authenticity.

HEADLINE: Two Sides Far Apart on Payroll Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Presidential politics and a push by both sides to include pet measures could turn negotiations over the extension of President Obama's payroll tax cut into the next partisan donnybrook on Capitol Hill, lawmakers made clear on Tuesday.
Meeting for the first time, members of a new bipartisan, House-Senate committee negotiating a final version of a yearlong payroll tax cut agreed that a deal had to be struck before the end of February, when a short-term extension that passed in December will expire. 
Expiration of the 2011 two-percentage-point cut to the payroll tax would raise taxes on around 160 million workers, and 3 million could lose their jobless benefits if unemployment insurance is not renewed as part of the deal. Congress, already at historic lows in popularity, will take another hit if consensus cannot be reached.
''People are struggling,'' said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and a member of the conference committee. ''People are wondering what the hell is going on in Washington.''
But negotiators are far apart in how to cover the $160 billion it would cost to maintain the cut, extend expiring unemployment benefits and avoid deep cuts in fees to doctors treating Medicare patients.
They also differ on what other measures should be added to the legislation, which may be the last major bill that moves through Congress in an election year. Republicans said they wanted to include ''job creation'' measures, including one blocking environmental regulations for commercial boilers and another forcing the construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which the Obama administration has blocked.
Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, a freshman on the Republican negotiating team, bristled when Democrats called such measures extraneous.
''To the hard-working American people, those are job creators,'' she said.
Democrats, picking up a theme pressed by the president, emphasized tax ''fairness'' and demanded that tax cuts for workers be paid for in part with tax increases on the affluent. Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, seized on Tuesday's release of Mitt Romney's 2010 and 2011 tax returns and pressed to change rules that allow private equity managers to have some of their income taxed at the 15 percent rate meant for capital gains.
Mr. Romney's returns showed that he received $13 million in so-called carried interest those two years through his affiliation with Bain Capital, a major private equity firm he co-founded.
''The fact that one of the leading Republican presidential candidates benefited to such a significant extent from this egregious loophole only further illustrates the need to address this issue once and for all,'' Mr. Levin said.
Republican leaders have made it clear they would like the payroll tax cut to be dealt with quickly. The House Republican majority took a political hit last month when the House initially refused to pass the two-month extension that cleared the Senate with broad bipartisan support. Amid a din of criticism even from Republicans, House leaders relented and supported the temporary measure on the condition that a formal conference committee convene to reach a deal on a full year extension.
Now that the committee has met, it could fall to Republican and Democratic leaders to force their rank-and-file members to relent on provisions blocking consensus. That process will begin Feb. 1 when, said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, negotiators will reconvene to take up one of the thorniest issues: whether new conditions should be placed on unemployment benefits.
The House's version of the payroll tax bill would demand that unemployed workers without a high school diploma show they are working toward one before they qualify for additional jobless benefits. It would also allow states to require drug tests for unemployment recipients. Senior Republican House aides have signaled those measures may be among the first to fall in the search for a compromise.
But Democrats are not likely to compromise so quickly. Aides said Tuesday that Democrats wanted a one-year deal but would be content to hold out well into February, making Republicans squirm while they pressed for tax increases on the rich, which polls show are popular.
Such proposals have ''already been rejected by the Senate and simply cannot pass the House,'' said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and a conference negotiator.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Romney Plays Down Immigration

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. -- When Mitt Romney pulled in for a campaign rally here recently, he pointedly left his tough stance against illegal immigration far behind in South Carolina, where he had trumpeted the issue repeatedly.
It was a tactical decision devised to avoid irritating Florida's coveted 450,000 Hispanic Republican voters, a group that is overwhelmingly Cuban-American, as he headed into next Tuesday's presidential primary here, political analysts say.
But Mr. Romney, who takes a hard line on illegal immigration, was also banking on the likelihood that the Hispanic voters -- a pivotal bloc in a pivotal state -- care more about jobs and the distressed economy than green cards and the Dream Act, a proposal to give legal status to some illegal immigrants who came into the United States as children.
In this, Mr. Romney is right. Unlike many Mexicans and other Hispanics in California and the Southwest, Cuban-Americans do not view immigration as a defining issue in the election. That is because for decades Cubans arriving in the United States have been automatically granted United States residency after their first year here, a holdover from the cold war. 
Puerto Ricans, who make up the second-largest group of Hispanics in Florida, are already citizens and are also less concerned about immigration.
''The economy is what's most important to Hispanics here, unemployment,'' Sergio Lostal, 59, an unemployed Cuban-American and Romney supporter who arrived in the United States in 1984, said at the rally. ''That's the fundamental issue.''
Florida's unemployment rate is 9.9 percent, compared with 8.5 percent nationally; the jobless rate for Hispanics nationally and in Florida is even higher.
In polls taken before the South Carolina primary, Mr. Romney held a lead in Florida as large as 22 percent over Newt Gingrich and another contender, Rick Santorum. But Mr. Gingrich's strong victory over Mr. Romney in South Carolina is shaking up some Hispanic Romney supporters, who are taking another look at Mr. Gingrich.
And while Hispanic voters here have not seized on immigration as an issue, Mr. Gingrich's more temperate view on illegal immigration has certainly not hurt him. Mr. Gingrich said in a debate on Monday that he would support half of the Dream Act -- the part that would grant citizenship to young illegal immigrants who serve in the military, but not those who complete college. Mr. Romney said he agreed with that position. But Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum had said they would veto the Dream Act as written, a position that could dampen enthusiasm among Latinos in a general election.
Mr. Gingrich also has proposed allowing many illegal immigrants who have been in the United States a long time the opportunity to stay here as residents. Mr. Romney, like Mr. Santorum, has taken an aggressive stance against legalizing any illegal immigrants who do not deport themselves and apply for green cards from their home country.
Like the candidates, Florida has long been conflicted over illegal immigration in general; in its last session, the State Senate declined to pass a bill that would have required businesses to verify the immigration status of workers.
But Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney have much in common when it comes to Cuba. Both are making a point of talking tough on Cuba and the Castro brothers, saying they would roll back family travel to the island, among other things.
Rosa Pestana, 67, a Cuban-American voter who attended the Romney rally nearly two weeks ago, was planning to vote for Mr. Romney at the time. After Mr. Gingrich, a candidate she said is intelligent and experienced, won the South Carolina primary, she was torn. Now she is holding back until after Thursday's debate to decide who to vote for, adding that she will most likely choose whoever is the front-runner.
But, Ms. Pestana, who owns an assisted living center, said she viewed Mr. Gingrich's position on immigration -- an issue she considers secondary -- as more realistic. Her son recently tried to hire American citizens for his roofing company, she said, and found no takers. ''Who will fix our roofs and pick our tomatoes?'' Ms. Pestana asked.
Ms. Pestana's friend, Elaine Fandino, who had also seesawed between the candidates after South Carolina, said she would vote for Mr. Romney after he ''took out the claws'' in Monday's debate. ''He is the one,'' she said.
Mr. Romney's campaign is well organized, and has spent several million dollars on advertising in the state, including one television spot featuring his son Craig, speaking in Spanish about liberty and opportunity. Mr. Romney was also expected to benefit from Florida's absentee votes, which could break records.
Not to be outdone, Mr. Gingrich, who was in Miami recently raising money, made the requisite pilgrimage to Versailles, a Cuban restaurant in Little Havana, to sip a cafecito and denounce Fidel and Raul Castro. Mr. Santorum has ratcheted up his own campaign in the state in the past two weeks.
Florida has 1.5 million Hispanic voters (13.4 percent of the state's total electorate), and 32 percent of them are Cuban-Americans, who largely vote Republican and mostly live in South Florida. Today, a majority of Hispanics are Democrats. The state's booming Puerto Rican population, whose members are generally less partisan than their New York peers but still tend to vote Democratic, are the second-largest group of Latino voters in Florida, making up 28 percent of the Hispanic voters.
Other large Hispanic groups in the state -- Colombians, Nicaraguans, Peruvians -- are swing voters who make up a small but growing slice of the electorate.
Because the vast majority of Cuban-Americans in Florida are citizens who reliably turn out to vote, candidates passionately court them.
Cuban-American voters often take their cues from South Florida's two most powerful Republicans in Congress, Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who are backing Mr. Romney despite his stance on immigration. Senator Marco Rubio, the prized endorsement among Hispanic Republicans, has said he would not take sides in the primary.
Mr. Diaz-Balart said that he disagreed in general with Mr. Romney and the Republican Party on immigration, but that President Obama had failed to fulfill his campaign promise to provide a path for longtime illegal immigrants to remain here legally.
''President Obama's record on immigration is dismal,'' he said. But, he added, immigration is an afterthought in this election for most Hispanics here. ''The reality is, until you get the economy going, it becomes a secondary issue,'' Mr. Diaz-Balart said. ''People don't want to talk about people who are here illegally when people who are here legally don't have jobs.''
There was not always such an outpouring of support for Mr. Romney among Hispanics in Florida. In 2008, he came in last among Hispanic voters in the primary, which Senator John McCain of Arizona won.
In the end, Mr. Obama won 57 percent of the Hispanic vote in the state (a majority of Cuban-Americans cast their ballots for Mr. McCain). But in 2010, Latinos in Florida tilted back to Republicans, helping to elect Mr. Rubio, a Cuban-American, and Gov. Rick Scott, who benefited from Mr. Rubio's presence on the party's ticket.
''Florida Hispanics have always tended to lean toward the establishment candidate,'' said Dario Moreno, a professor of political science at Florida International University.
An aggressive stance on immigration could prove a problem down the road among swing voters if a candidate were perceived to be disparaging Hispanics. Already, some Dream Act supporters are planning to demonstrate at Mr. Romney's events. Puerto Ricans, who live mostly in the Orlando area and are a crucial swing vote, frown upon attacks that could be perceived as ethnic bias. Latin Americans in Dade County have a vested interest in the immigration debate, and even Cuban-Americans, who are no longer in lockstep with the Republican Party, could react negatively to polarizing language on the issue.
''They are very sensitive to messages that can be perceived as anti-Hispanic and very sensitive to the immigrant experience,'' Professor Moreno said of Cuban-Americans and Puerto Ricans.
Mr. Gingrich is doing what he can to play up his differences with Mr. Romney on immigration. Democrats, too, are eager to capitalize on the immigration debate. They are already running radio ads in Florida calling Mr. Romney two-faced on the issue. The Republican National Committee, though, recently named a national Hispanic outreach coordinator to go head-to-head with her Democratic counterpart in a bid to win over Latinos.
Like Mr. Romney, Republican officials are hoping that worries about the economy will trump concerns about immigration.
''Immigration is an issue that always dictates in the Latino community, and the debate plays an important role in the conversation,'' said Bettina Inclan, the Republicans' Hispanic outreach coordinator, who grew up in Miami. ''But the reality is that this election is going to be about the economy.''

HEADLINE: President Obama's State of the Union Address

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of President Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, as released by the White House:
THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:
Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.
We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. (Applause.) For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. (Applause.) For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. (Applause.) Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. 
These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.
Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. (Applause.) Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. (Applause.) My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.
The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) What's at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them.
Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up.
In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.
It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.
Those are the facts. But so are these: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. (Applause.)
Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again. (Applause.)
The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. (Applause.)
No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last - an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.
Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.
On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number-one automaker. (Applause.) Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.
We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back. (Applause.)
What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring every job back that's left our shore. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. (Applause.) Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity. (Applause.)
So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. (Applause.)
We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let's change it.
First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. (Applause.) That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. (Applause.)
Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. (Applause.) From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America. (Applause.)
Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers. (Applause.)
So my message is simple. It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away. (Applause.)
We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we're on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. (Applause.) And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago. (Applause.)
I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration - and it's made a difference. (Applause.) Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China. (Applause.) There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you - America will always win. (Applause.)
I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that - openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work. It's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.
Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.
I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. (Applause.) My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers - places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.
And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need. It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. (Applause.)
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.
For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time that's happened in a generation.
But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.
At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference.
Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. (Applause.) And in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn. That's a bargain worth making. (Applause.)
We also know that when students don't walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18. (Applause.)
When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. (Applause.)
Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years. (Applause.)
Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down.
Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. (Applause.) Higher education can't be a luxury - it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.
That doesn't make sense.
I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. (Applause.)
But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away. (Applause.)
You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) It means we should support everyone who's willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. (Applause.) Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. (Applause.)
Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. (Applause.) Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right -- eight years. Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years. (Applause.)
But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. (Applause.) A strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.
We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years. (Applause.) And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. (Applause.) Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. (Applause.) And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. (Applause.)
Now, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.
When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ''I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.''
Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. (Applause.) I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.
We've subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. (Applause.) It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits. Create these jobs. (Applause.)
We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well, tonight, I will. I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history - with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. (Applause.)
Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. (Applause.)
Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.
During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.
In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home. (Applause.)
There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones who were hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.
And that's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates. (Applause.) No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust. (Applause.)
Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. (Applause.) Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.
There's no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. (Applause.) I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. (Laughter and applause.)
Now, I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. (Applause.) Absolutely. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. (Applause.) I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men. (Applause.)
And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college.
So if you are a big bank or financial institution, you're no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a ''living will'' that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail - because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again. (Applause.) And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them. (Applause.)
We'll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
And tonight, I'm asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. (Applause.) This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.
Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.
Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. (Applause.) People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay. Let's get it done. (Applause.)
When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.
The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.
But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. (Applause.)
Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule. If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. (Applause.) You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief.
Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.
We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know that's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last. (Applause.)
Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.
Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?
The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco?
I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year.
Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow. (Applause.) Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.
Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything - even routine business - passed through the Senate. (Applause.) Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. (Applause.) For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days. (Applause.)
The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. (Applause.) That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. (Applause.)
Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas.
I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. (Applause.) That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program.
On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.
The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there's nothing the United States of America can't achieve. (Applause.) That's the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.
Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America. (Applause.)
From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America. (Applause.)
As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators - a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied. (Applause.)
How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it's ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings - men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.
And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent.
Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. (Applause.)
But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.
The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. (Applause.)
We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.
Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. (Applause.)
That's not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing. No, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs - and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way. (Applause.)
That's why, working with our military leaders, I've proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats. (Applause.)
Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. (Applause.) As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've served us. That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned - which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. (Applause.) And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation.
With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we're providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her. (Applause.)
Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind.
One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush's defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for president.
All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's somebody behind you, watching your back.
So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes. No one built this country on their own. This nation is great because we built it together. This nation is great because we worked as a team. This nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

HEADLINE: Americans Divided Over Tax Policy

BYLINE: By ALLISON KOPICKI

 BODY:
It may come as no surprise, but Americans are deeply split along party lines when it comes to federal tax policy.
A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday found that a majority of Republicans approve of the current tax policy, while most Democrats and independents disapprove of taxing income from capital gains at a lower rate than earned income. 
The survey was taken in the last several days as Mitt Romney faced intensifying criticism from his rivals to release his tax returns, resulting in his decision to disclose his 2010 information and his anticipated 2011 payments.
Just before the South Carolina primary last week, Mr. Romney announced that his effective federal tax rate was closer to 15 percent - the rate levied on dividends and capital gains. A review by The New York Times of the returns released Tuesday showed that his tax rate for 2010 was closer to 14 percent but is expected to be more than 15 percent for 2011.
While Mr. Romney's tax rate appears considerably higher than the average rate paid by middle-income households, it is at a lower rate than many other affluent people because most of his income comes from investments.
In the survey, about half of all Americans agreed with the statement that capital gains and dividends should be taxed the same as income earned from work, because the policy increases the federal deficit and is unfair to people who don't have money to invest.
Thirty-six percent of Americans said they approved of the current policy because it encourages investment, which helps the economy and ultimately increases tax revenues.
But there's a partisan divide, with just more than half of Republicans approving of the lower tax rate on capital gains, but about two-thirds of Democrats saying capital gains and dividends should be taxed at the same rate as income from work. More than half of independents - an important swing group in the presidential election -- also say the tax rates should be similar. And most Americans say that what they themselves pay in taxes is about right, but that people with high incomes pay too little in taxes.
A little more than half say the tax rate they pay is about right, while about 4 in 10 say they pay more than their fair share. Seven in 10 Democrats say wealthy Americans pay less than their fair share in taxes, while Republicans are divided.
Nearly 4 in 10 Republicans say that the rich pay less than their fair share, and about the same number say the amount wealthy people pay is about right. Nearly 2 in 10 Republicans say the rich pay more than their fair share.
And 58 percent of independents also say the rich are not contributing their fair share to the nation's coffers.
(A comparison of the candidates' tax returns is available in this Times graphic.)
The Times/CBS News poll was conducted Jan. 20 to 23 among 1,185 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: With Private Equity Under Attack, Academia Tries to Quantify Its Value

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Controversy swirls around private equity as attacks on Mitt Romney and the entire industry mount. Amid the name-calling, little in the way of evidence has been cited. So let's take a look at some of the best research on this issue.
Does private equity ''strip and flip'' companies, leaving them for bankrupt? A paper last year by Edith Hotchkiss at Boston College, David C. Smith at the University of Virginia and Per Stromberg at the Stockholm School of Economics gives a qualified no.
The authors examined a sample of private equity firms from 1997 through 2010. They found that companies bought by private equity firms did not default on their debt any more than other firms in a control group with similar debt levels.
Private equity-owned companies that defaulted were less likely to be liquidated and remained in bankruptcy for a shorter time than the companies in the control group. Some 11 percent of private equity-owned companies that declared bankruptcy were liquidated, compared with 16 percent for those without private equity backing. 
Private equity ownership not only helped keep companies from filing for bankruptcy, but these companies were better able to survive financial distress. The authors speculate that this is a result of private equity's deep pockets and its ability to obtain more financing to aid distressed companies.
The study has an important caveat: The point of comparison was confined to companies with similar levels of debt. Private equity firms often borrow large sums to buy companies, placing significantly more debt on them than they would have otherwise. The authors did not look at companies with lower levels of debt.
But in a separate paper, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Mr. Stromberg estimated that private equity-owned firms had a default rate of 1.2 percent a year from 1980 to 2002. That compares with Moody's Investors Service's reported default rate of 1.6 percent for all corporate bond issuers in the United States in the same time period.
Private equity-owned companies may have a lower general default rate because of the better debt terms that sophisticated private equity firms can negotiate. For example, Moody's has found that an outsize number of companies owned by private equity firms avoided default during the financial crisis because they had so-called covenant-lite debt, which had fewer terms that could be violated.
Beyond default rates, evidence of the private equity industry's ability to create value is still surprisingly uncertain, given that the industry has more than 30 years of history. One of the reasons is that private equity firms do not generally publicly disclose the performance of their buyouts.
A new paper, however, finds evidence that private equity firms do add value. Adam C. Kolasinski and Jarrad Harford of the University of Washington examined 788 large private equity buyouts in the United States. They found that private equity-owned companies invested more efficiently than other companies, a fact the authors attributed to private equity firms' greater access to capital. The authors also found that the payment of large dividends to private equity firms, a common practice, did not create future financial distress.
Other recent papers looked mostly at Europe, where private company data is required to be made available and so performance of private equity companies can be accurately measured. These European papers also found that private equity firms improved operating performance in the non-American companies they owned.
All told, the evidence on net value creation has yet to be firmly established. The large and consistent returns of firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Blackstone Group show that money is being made, but not because private equity ownership creates better companies. At best, the evidence shows there may be value created, but it is not definitive.
Even if private equity firms do increase company performance, there is still the question of how.
One explanation may be better monitoring and supervision of management. Boards of private equity-owned companies have been found to be smaller and meet more frequently. One draft study of European companies, by Viral Acharya of New York University and Conor Kehoe of McKinsey & Company , found that about two-thirds of chief executives of private equity-owned companies were replaced in the first four years of ownership. And private equity-owned companies have been found to better align the compensation of management with good performance than public companies, which are often accused of overpaying executives.
While it appears that private equity may benefit some companies, this does not mean they always add value to them. Instead, private equity firms may make their riches by taking advantage of other debt holders, benefiting from tax arbitrage or firing employees. Evidence from the 1980s shows that private equity often took advantage of other debt holders.
As for taxes, private equity clearly benefits from the tax deduction that debt offers. Although the evidence is mixed, academics still argue that this tax benefit in part gives private equity its riches. And others have argued that private equity makes the bulk of its money by leveraging companies, thereby pumping up equity returns.
As for employees, again the evidence is uncertain. But the most important paper on this issue was made public in 2008, and revised late last year. The authors - Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago, John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland, Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School and Ron S. Jarmin and Javier Miranda of the Census Bureau - found that after a private equity acquisition, a company's work force shrank by more than 6 percent on average. Private equity-owned companies, however, appear to be more creative in building new businesses and adding jobs, which offsets that loss. As a result, the net job loss for the average private equity acquisition turns out to be only about 1 percent greater than at other companies. This study has been criticized for not examining what the growth of companies would have been had they remained independent.
The evidence shows that private equity is a minimal job destroyer, and there are some indications that value is created. Private equity firms do not live up to their 1980s reputation as vulture capitalists stripping companies and leaving them for dead. To be sure, questions remain about whether that value comes at the expense of tax arbitrage or is merely a trick of financial engineering and leverage.
This does not mean that private equity firms deserve all of their wealth. It may be that they are overcharging for their services. Andrew Metrick of the Yale School of Management and Ayako Yasuda of the University of California, Davis, found that private equity firms made about two-thirds of their money not from their 20 percent share of the profits but from the fees they charged to operate the companies. Another study by professors at Yale and Maastricht University that was reported by The Financial Times on Tuesday found that 70 percent of private equity's earnings from 2001 to 2010 were paid to the firms themselves, not their investors.
There are also questions raised by Victor Fleischer of the University of Colorado Law School, among others, concerning whether private equity deserves a 15 percent capital gains tax treatment for its profits because this is really disguised income.
There is still more research to be done, research that the private equity industry could make easier if it provided more information. And none of these papers look at individual firms like Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's former firm. It may be that in individual cases, private equity firms do take advantage of companies. And even if value is created, it is small solace for those who lose their jobs in the wake of a private equity acquisition. Still, a look at the research shows that private equity is far from the evil some are calling it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: At Davos, a Big Issue Is the Have-Lots vs. the Have-Nots

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
8:12 p.m. Updated
DAVOS, Switzerland - A year ago at the World Economic Forum here, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, lashed out at what he saw as unfair criticism of the world's financial wizards.
''I just think this constant refrain, 'bankers, bankers, bankers' - it's just a really unproductive and unfair way of treating people,'' he said. ''People should just stop doing that.''
After several years of financial crisis, during which the word banker had become a catchall epithet for the undeserving rich, the global economy appeared to be on the mend. Perhaps the bankers, and the other millionaires and billionaires, could wear their pinstripes with pride again and get back to business as usual.
Yet even as Mr. Dimon was speaking, a new wave of anger was welling up, one that, over the last year, would shake up old assumptions about the ultrarich, the middle class and the growing gulf that separates them. 
Today, the gap between the haves and the have-nots is no longer just a rallying cry to incite anticapitalist advocates. It has become a mainstream issue, debated openly in arenas where the primacy of laissez-faire capitalism used to be taken for granted and where talk of inequality used to be derided as class warfare.
In the United States, the issue surfaced when protesters proclaimed they were the ''99 percent'' of the population who were paying for the sins of the wealthy ''1 percent,'' taking their grievances directly to the epicenter of capitalism. The Occupy Wall Street protests, which began in New York, spread to other cities around the United States and across the world.
In Spain, thousands of ''indignados'' converged on Madrid and other cities to vent their frustration over mass unemployment and government austerity measures. In the Arab world, a wave of unrest that toppled governments began with a protest over a lack of economic opportunities in Tunisia.
And now, as the Republican Party chooses a nominee for the United States presidential election, rivals of one candidate, Mitt Romney, are rounding on him over his wealth and his background in the private equity business.
Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, in a recent report, named the growing income divide as one of the biggest risks facing the world in the years to come.
''In developed economies, such as those of Western Europe, North America and Japan, the social contract that has in recent decades been taken for granted is in danger of being destroyed,'' the report said, warning of the threat of a ''dystopian future for much of humanity.''
In the past, the conventional wisdom among those attending the World Economic Forum - at least among the corporate executives who pay their way, rather than the officials from government, academia and nonprofit groups who are invited - was that a wide level of inequality was an acceptable price of progress. Economic envy might even be desirable, the thinking went, if it fueled the desire that drives entrepreneurship and innovation. A rising tide of economic growth would then lift all the boats: the supertankers of the rich, to be sure, but also the dinghies of the poor.
Few Davos men or women would have questioned the views of Arthur M. Okun, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who argued in a 1975 book, ''Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff,'' that countries faced a choice between equality and economic growth; level, Scandinavian-style societies were doomed to fall behind.
''We can't have our cake of market efficiency and share it equally,'' he wrote.
Over the last year, however, with economies - at least in many Western countries - struggling to recover, a growing number of voices have risen to question this logic. Some inequality is inevitable, of course. But not only is too much inequality bad for society, they say, it may be bad for growth, too.
In a study published last year, Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry, of the International Monetary Fund, analyzed the long-term economic performance of countries, then fired a broadside at Mr. Okun's conclusions, saying those with more even divisions of the spoils often grew faster.
''A rising tide lifts all boats, and our analysis indicates that helping raise the smallest boats may help keep the tide rising for all craft, big and small,'' they wrote.
The rapid growth of Asian economies in the last few decades has contributed to this change in perceptions, because countries like Vietnam have developed differently from their counterparts in the West, said Hans Rosling, a Swedish doctor who co-founded the Gapminder Foundation, which analyzes public health statistics.
''In the past, economic growth came first, then you got education, health and two-child families,'' he said. ''Now it is the reverse. If you have education, health and two-child families, then you get economic growth.''
Beyond the chants of the ''99 percent'' crowd, there is considerable evidence that inequality is on the rise in many places.
According to a report published last December by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the association of free market democracies, the share of after-tax household income that went to the top 1 percent of earners in the United States more than doubled in less than three decades, to 17 percent in 2007 from 8 percent in 1979.
Across the 34 countries that make up the organization's membership, the average income of the richest 10 percent of the population is nine times that of the poorest 10 percent. Even in countries like Denmark, Germany and Sweden, which have traditionally been more egalitarian than the United States or Britain, this ratio has risen to six to one now from five to one in the 1980s.
What is especially worrying to policy makers is the correlation between inequalities in income and wealth, and other criteria like education and health. The rich eat better and smoke less. They are better educated. They live healthier and longer lives.
One recent study, by the London Health Observatory, showed a widening gap in male life expectancy between rich and poor parts of London. In the well-to-do area of Queen's Gate, for example, it was 88; in Tottenham Green, near where riots that spread across large parts of London began last summer, male life expectancy was 71.
Such divides are not limited to the West. According to Gapminder, the average income in Shanghai, for example, is about 10 times the level in Guizhou, a less developed Chinese province. The difference in the infant mortality rate is even greater, with such deaths occurring less than one-twelfth as often in Shanghai.
To some extent, such differences have always existed between rich and poor. What is new, analysts say, is the extent to which they have risen in individual societies and the extent to which they are being passed from one generation to the next.
Some studies have shown declines in social mobility in the United States - where the idea that anyone could rise from humble roots was always a big part of the American dream - and in Britain, thwarting efforts to dismantle traditional class barriers.
''There's a deep sense that, hang on a minute, why is this not working for us anymore?'' said Michael Marmot, a University College London professor who is chairman of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organization. ''If there's one thing we should all believe in, it is that every generation should have a fair chance, and that's not happening.''
Analysts have put forth several theories to explain the rise in inequality and waning social mobility. Some blame globalization, which has made it easier to outsource jobs to low-income locations and has fostered the creation of a class of high-flying, high-earning, stateless executives - Davos men and women, among them - who compete in an expanded, global job pool.
Others say changes in the social fabric have played a big role. A rise in single-parent families keeps some households locked in poverty, they say, while a phenomenon called assortative mating - in which men and women increasingly look for partners from similar social classes, rather than marrying above or below their station - has tightened the ranks of the wealthy.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study contends that neither globalization nor changes in family structure are the main culprits. It identifies rapid technological change and the deregulation of job markets as the main drivers.
How should policy makers respond? The O.E.C.D. says job creation is crucial, with investments in education. What may be more controversial, the group says tax and welfare policies should be reviewed, especially in situations where the part of the tax burden borne by high-income earners has declined in recent years.
Some wealthy people have gone further. Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire who founded the investment company Berkshire Hathaway, called last summer for higher taxes on the rich, saying it was time to stop ''coddling'' the wealthy. In Europe, prominent chief executives in France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere have issued a similar call.
Others say that this self-flagellation is misguided. Raising taxes on high earners or restricting their pay will do nothing to increase economic growth or to create jobs, said Ben Verwaayen, chief executive of Alcatel-Lucent, the French telecom company.
To stimulate sluggish Western economies, he said, policy makers must make the tough fiscal choices needed to bring budget deficits into line, increasing business confidence. And in Europe, he said, restrictive employment rules should be loosened to encourage companies to hire.
''If you are standing outside the job market today and you think inequality is the problem, you have an ugly surprise coming,'' Mr. Verwaayen said. ''If you want to kick the cat, kick the cat. If it makes you feel better, fine. But if the pie is not growing, we're not going to create jobs.''
Maurice Levy, chief executive of the advertising company Publicis Groupe, based in Paris, also said that measures to promote growth were crucial. But Mr. Levy, one of the signatories of an open letter to the French government calling for higher taxes on the wealthy, said it was only fair, when governments were cutting welfare spending to bring budget deficits into line, that the rich should share the burden.
''When you have this situation of fear, and little hope of getting out of the dark, there is also anger,'' he said. ''People see that there is a minority of people who are well off. This anger should be taken into account by the people who are, if not their target, their preoccupation.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Tax Proposal Is Brought Out Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, stymied for three years on his promise to end tax incentives that move jobs overseas, went back to the well on Tuesday night with tax proposals that he said would promote domestic corporate growth.
Ever since his 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama has vowed to change tax measures that he says lure American companies to invest and expand overseas. It was a huge applause line on the campaign trail, but for three years the proposals have gone nowhere in the face of stiff, often angry opposition from corporations -- especially high-tech firms -- that say the proposals would kill their economic competitiveness.
The proposals tied to his State of the Union address on Tuesday night would simplify those earlier measures while adding carrots to the sticks of higher taxes on overseas profits. Mr. Obama proposed creating an international minimum tax that companies with overseas profits would have to pay. An administration official said the White House would not specify that rate. Instead it will be a principle enshrined in a broader corporate tax package that will be released next month with the president's budget plan for the 2013 fiscal year. 
In that way, it is a business analogue to his ''Buffett Rule,'' which stipulates that wealthy taxpayers should not pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than middle-class households but does not prescribe how that tenet would be achieved.
''My message is simple: It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I'll sign them right away,'' he said.
Currently, companies with overseas operations can park their foreign profits offshore indefinitely and tax free. Those profits face the 35 percent United States corporate tax rate only if and when they are brought into the country. Mr. Obama's first budget, and every budget since, has tried to curb the value of what is known as deferral. For instance, companies would not be able to deduct from their taxes the interest on loans from overseas expansions.
The thinking has been that if tax breaks are more generous at home, companies would keep more operations domestic. But all Mr. Obama has to show for those proposals are some of the earliest public fights between his White House and the business community.
To the stick of an international minimum tax, Mr. Obama would add a carrot, a lower tax rate for domestic manufacturers and additional tax breaks for high-tech manufacturing. He would also offer a new tax credit to help finance the construction of facilities at shuttered military bases or in regions hit hardest by companies moving overseas. And he would deny tax deductions for moving expenses when businesses shift facilities abroad, while creating a new tax credit for moving production back home.
Jared Bernstein, a former Obama White House economist, said the proposals sounded like a strategic retreat.
''The rhetoric sounds like something designed to perhaps go down easier than the measures that had been in the budgets before, such as ending deferrals,'' Mr. Bernstein said in an interview.
The administration official said that was not so. The earlier proposals will be repeated in the coming budget but will be supplemented, the official said.
The business and trade proposals of the address seemed at least attuned to the presidential race if they were not directly inspired by them. Rick Santorum has also proposed sharp reductions in tax rates for domestic manufacturers as he campaigns for the Republican nomination. And Mitt Romney has made unfair trade practices on the part of China a centerpiece of his economic policy prescriptions.
On that, too, Mr. Obama followed suit, proposing a new trade enforcement unit charged with investigating unfair trade practices. He pointedly singled out China.
''There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders,'' the president said. ''And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia.''
But Mr. Obama also circled back to unfinished business that has weighed down his political prospects.
For at least the third time, he proposed a plan to get the housing market going. He promised an effort to help ''responsible'' homeowners refinance their mortgages at record low rates. ''No more red tape, no more runaround from the banks,'' he promised, holding out the hope that beleaguered homeowners would save about $3,000 a year.
On smaller matters, Mr. Obama was remarkably prescriptive. He said states should be allowed to simply make it illegal for students to leave high school until they are 18, a command solution to the dropout problem. And he threatened to withhold federal assistance from universities that do not control their rising tuition costs.
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana hit on that prescriptive theme in the Republican response when he said Mr. Obama ''seems to sincerely believe we can build a middle class out of government jobs paid for with borrowed dollars.''
''In fact, it works the other way: a government as big and bossy as this one is maintained on the backs of the middle class, and those who hope to join it,'' Mr. Daniels said.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls For Action On Fraud

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama called on Congress Tuesday to toughen laws against securities fraud and to strengthen the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to punish Wall Street firms that repeatedly violate antifraud statutes.
In his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama also said he would ask the attorney general to establish a special financial crimes unit to prosecute cases of large-scale financial fraud.
It is not clear how that effort would differ from the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, a cross-agency group that Mr. Obama established in November 2009. Its mission, as the White House put it then, was to ''hold accountable those who helped bring about the last financial crisis and to prevent another crisis from happening.'' 
The two initiatives represent an attempt to give financial regulators a greater ability to police the financial markets. In addition, the proposals seek to acknowledge the continuing frustration among many Americans -- exemplified by the Occupy Wall Street movement -- that few financial executives have been prosecuted for their actions leading up to the crisis.
Given the election-year pressures and the continuing gridlock on Capitol Hill, neither measure is certain to win approval in this session of Congress.
The issue of how to deal with Wall Street firms that repeatedly violate securities laws has come into focus in recent months as the S.E.C. has stepped up its efforts to bring cases related to the financial crisis. Many of those cases involve financial companies that have violated the same laws many times before.
A New York Times analysis of S.E.C. enforcement actions over the last 15 years, published in November, found at least 51 cases in which the S.E.C. concluded that Wall Street firms had broken antifraud laws that, as part of settlements of earlier fraud cases, they had pledged never to breach. The 51 cases spanned 19 firms, including nearly all of the biggest financial companies -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Company and Bank of America among them.
Mr. Obama first outlined his plans to crack down on repeat offenders in an economic speech in December in Osawatomie, Kan. ''Too often, we've seen Wall Street firms violating major antifraud laws because the penalties are too weak and there's no price for being a repeat offender,'' Mr. Obama said. ''No more. I'll be calling for legislation that makes those penalties count so that firms don't see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.''
Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., similarly called on Congress in November to raise the maximum penalties the commission could assess for securities laws violations, and to allow it to assess greater fines for repeat violations of antifraud statutes.
Currently, the S.E.C. can try to bring contempt charges only if a company has broken previous vows not to violate the law. In a letter to members of the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Schapiro said that enhancing the S.E.C.'s ability to crack down on repeat offenders would ''substantially enhance the effectiveness of the commission's enforcement program by addressing existing limitations that have resulted in criticism regarding the adequacy of commission actions against those who violate the securities laws.''
The S.E.C. has also been criticized recently for its practice of allowing companies to settle allegations of securities fraud while neither admitting nor denying the charges. That is a standard practice used for years by the S.E.C. as well as other regulatory agencies, but it has come under increasing scrutiny since the financial crisis.
Most recently, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected a proposed $285 million settlement in a case between the S.E.C. and Citigroup over a complex mortgage security that it marketed in 2007, as the housing market was beginning to crumble.
In his opinion, Judge Rakoff said the settlement's ''neither admit nor deny'' terms left him with no conclusive evidence with which to determine whether the proposed punishment was just.
Judge Rakoff said such settlements, which often involve penalties of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, were frequently viewed by the settling companies ''as a cost of doing business imposed by having to maintain a working relationship with a regulatory agency, rather than as any indication of where the real truth lies.''
In the State of the Union address, Mr. Obama said that banks and financial companies should be held accountable for their actions and should face the same type of consequences as anyone else who has been charged with breaking the law.

HEADLINE: Advertising: Union Seeks to Turn Hispanics Against Romney

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Service Employees International Union began airing a Spanish-language radio spot in Florida on Tuesday that seeks to turn the state's Hispanic voters against Mitt Romney by accusing him of being two-faced on immigration policy. 
The ad, which is running in Tampa and Orlando, says that while Mr. Romney has run a commercial in Florida saying he shares the values of the state's Hispanic voters, he has boasted in other states that he had the endorsement of Kris Kobach, an architect of anti-immigrant laws in Arizona and Alabama.
The union's ad, called ''The Two Faces of Mitt Romney,'' says, ''Romney says he cares about our children, but he has promised to veto the Dream Act that would open the doors of opportunity for young Hispanics.'' That legislation would grant legal status to some illegal immigrants who came into the United States as children, especially those who serve in the military or graduate from college.
''Romney started running ads in Spanish in Florida with a message trying to get our votes, while in English he's running a campaign attacking immigrants,'' said Eliseo Medina, the union's secretary-treasurer. ''To make matters worse, Romney embraces Kris Kobach. We can't let them get away with saying something in one language while attacking us in another language.''
The ads are co-sponsored by Priorities USA, a Democratic ''super PAC.''
In a news release, the union said that while Mr. Romney professes concern for Hispanics, he backs harsh treatment of immigrants to cause them to ''self-deport''; i.e., return to their homeland.
Mr. Romney has taken a relatively hard line on illegal immigration, and his campaign has been running a television spot featuring his son Craig speaking in Spanish about liberty and opportunity.
Albert Martinez, an adviser to Mr. Romney, called the union's ad ''a dishonest smear from President Obama's liberal allies and a desperate attempt to distract from his abysmal record,'' and said, ''It will do nothing to help the millions of Hispanics who have been hit especially hard as a result of the Obama economy.''
The service employees' union, with around two million members, has long been one of the unions most supportive of the president. It has also been at the forefront of organized labor's effort to persuade Congress to enact a law that establishes a path to legalization for illegal immigrants. The service employees' union has joined the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in running anti-Romney ads in Florida even though it remains unclear whether he will be the Republican nominee.
''We want to act sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Medina said. ''We want to make sure that the Latino community is part of the process for this presidential election.''
The union said in a news release that it did not see Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum as ''viable alternatives for Hispanic voters.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: President To Offer Way For Easing Home Debt

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House plans to propose legislation that could allow a few million homeowners to reduce monthly mortgage payments by refinancing their current loans into new ones guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.
The program would broaden the availability of government-backed mortgages to include many borrowers whose loans are held by private companies and who have been unable to persuade those lenders to reduce their interest rates. Existing federal programs focus mostly on borrowers whose loans are owned by the government.
The new plan would require Congressional approval, a difficult hurdle for any legislation in the current polarized environment. Still, some Republicans have expressed support for expanding the availability of refinancing, and White House officials insisted that the plan was not an act of theater. 
''I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. ''No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks.''
Administration officials said they would release the full proposal in the near future.
The new program will be directed at people whose mortgage debts exceed the value of their homes, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details have not yet been finalized. The official estimated that the program could benefit two million to three million homeowners who have loans that are not guaranteed by the government, and that the program's cost would not exceed $10 billion.
The proposal is the latest in a long series of largely unsuccessful efforts by the administration to bolster the housing market. Like most of its predecessors, the plan is focused not on borrowers facing foreclosure but on those who have been able to keep making the payments on their homes. Reducing housing payments for those borrowers will allow them to spend more money on other things. It also could help to stabilize housing prices by encouraging them to stay in their homes.
In October, the administration announced that it would increase eligibility for an existing refinancing program for homeowners whose loans were held by the government-owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those changes did not require Congressional approval, but many Republicans expressed opposition.
''The right course is to let markets work,'' the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said at the time. Mr. Romney has since suggested he would be open to working with lenders to stabilize the housing market.
This new program would extend a similar refinancing opportunity to borrowers whose loans are held by private companies.
Many such borrowers already have refinanced, taking advantage of interest rates below 4 percent, among the lowest ever available for mortgage loans. But millions more have been unable to do so, because their financial profiles are no longer strong enough to qualify or because their mortgage debts exceed the value of their homes.
The F.H.A. is a government program that guarantees loans made by private companies, allowing the companies to offer lower interest rates. The program historically focused on lower-income borrowers, but its role has expanded dramatically since the collapse of the housing market began in 2006, and it now guarantees about 30 percent of new loans.
The proposal requires legislation because current law restricts the ability of the F.H.A. to refinance loans that exceed the value of the borrower's home. Such loans are considered riskier because borrowers have no equity to lose if they stop payments. If the F.H.A. loses money on such loans, taxpayers could be on the hook. The program covers losses from fees on the loans it guarantees, but its reserves already are on the verge of exhaustion.
To limit the risk to taxpayers, the administration will propose that any costs should be covered with part of the proceeds from a fee on the banking industry. That, too, is waiting for Congressional approval.

HEADLINE: Sanctions Against Iran Grow Tighter, but What's the Next Step?

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration and its European allies toughened economic sanctions against Iran on Monday -- blocking its access to the world financial system and undermining its critical oil and gas industry -- officials on both sides of the Atlantic acknowledge that their last-ditch effort has only a limited chance of persuading Tehran to abandon what the West fears is its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
That leaves open this critical question: And then what?
While the United States and Israel have not taken military options off the table, pursuing them is unpalatable, at least for now. Several American and European officials say privately that the most attainable outcome for the West could be for Iran to maintain the knowledge and technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon while stopping short of doing so. That would allow it to assert its sovereignty and save face after years of diplomatic tensions. 
While that might seem to be a big concession on the part of the United States, Iran would first have to make even bigger ones: demonstrate that it could be trusted and drop its veil of secrecy so that inspectors could verify that its nuclear work was peaceful, steps Iran has resisted.
In other words, Iran would have to become a country like Japan, which has the capability to become an atomic power virtually overnight, if need be, but has rejected taking the final steps to possessing nuclear weapons. ''If you're asking whether we would be satisfied with Iran becoming Japan, then the answer is a qualified yes,'' a senior European diplomat said. ''But it would have to be verifiable, and we are a long ways away from trusting the regime.''
Today's Iran is nothing like Japan, which has a deep aversion to nuclear weapons dating to the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And settling for an Iranian state that could quickly produce a nuclear weapon would be hard for the United States to embrace because of Israel's deep antipathy toward Iran and Western and other nations' fears of setting off a regional arms race.
On Monday, the 27 countries of the European Union agreed to ban Iranian oil imports in an embargo that will cover crude oil, petroleum and petrochemical products. Separately, the United States Treasury announced sanctions against Iran's third-largest bank, Bank Tejarat, saying in a statement that the United States was striking at ''one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system.''
The discussion of what to do about Iran is coming in a political arena in which Iran's nuclear program has become the top foreign policy concern on the Republican presidential campaign trail, with the candidates criticizing President Obama as not being tough enough on Iran.
So far, Iran has deliberately not taken certain technical steps toward building a nuclear weapon, even while it continues to enrich uranium, a senior American official said. He said that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was using a cost-benefit analysis, adding that the American view was that the ayatollah had not made a final decision about whether to build a weapon.
That means the United States and Europe must be careful to calibrate the impact of sanctions, officials on both sides of the Atlantic said. If sanctions bite too hard, they could cause the Iranian public to rally around the government. A senior intelligence official briefed Mr. Obama on Jan. 9 about new polls in Iran that reflect strong public support for the country's nuclear program.
In debates at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon, administration officials say they have gamed out several possibilities, including an alarming one: that tougher sanctions and increased global isolation might compel Iran to decide that the only way to get the West off its back is to speed up its program and become a nuclear power. That could leave the West with no choice but to back off, lest it provoke a nuclear confrontation.
Ray Takeyh, a former Obama administration official and an Iran expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, pointed to North Korea and Pakistan as guideposts for Iran's possible strategy in pressing ahead with a uranium enrichment program. Both are nuclear states whose stability the West is committed to keeping because of concerns that their nuclear arsenals might fall into the hands of rogue elements.
While Western diplomats point to the Japan model, there is another one -- the Libya model -- that could serve as a cautionary example for the Iranian government. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader who abandoned his nuclear ambitions to gain favor with the West, was left without a nuclear card to play when regime change was pushed upon him.
''Look at it this way,'' said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert and former State Department official in the Obama administration. ''These latest sanctions are weakening the regime, but they're also putting pressure on the regime, which is arriving to the point where the Iranians have no motivation other than to get their nuclear capabilities faster.''
Still, for all the tough talk, American and European officials said the ever-changing events in Iran and in the region, including the move toward democracy in the Middle East, could give negotiations and diplomacy a chance.
American and European officials say that if Iran is still more than a year away from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, as many experts believe, the sanctions are their only real option, not because they necessarily believe that they will work, but because the other alternatives -- a military strike, or doing nothing as Iran acquires a weapon -- are unacceptable.
''If there were an alternative to the sanctions, that would be one thing,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, the former under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration who was an architect of the sanctions policy that began in 2006. ''But is there? No. If you don't have a military answer right now, you're far better off continuing this strategy and trying to see if while doing all this, you can open up the path to negotiations.''
What could also shove Iran to the negotiating table are the kind of covert programs that have slowed its development of a nuclear program. This month an Iranian nuclear scientist, one of at least five who have been killed since 2007, died in a drive-by bombing, which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attributed to ''the evil hands of arrogance and Zionist agents.''
But Mr. Takeyh warned that at some point soon -- maybe in a year, maybe two -- tightening the noose in the hope that Iran decides to negotiate could give way to a military strike or a nuclear Iran, or both. ''At some point,'' he said, ''the song stops playing and you're in a different, and more dangerous, place.''

HEADLINE: Critiques for Capitalists in Obama's Speech, With One in Particular in His Sights

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama did not mention Mitt Romney on Tuesday evening, but he didn't need to. Mr. Romney, whom the president's aides still view as his most likely opponent in the fall, was the unspoken adversary in Mr. Obama's call for a more equitable society -- the natural foil for his proposals to level the playing field for middle-class Americans, from taxes to trade policy.
When Mr. Obama talked about levying a millionaires' tax, he might have been referring to Mr. Romney's newly released tax return, which disclosed he paid a tax rate of 13.9 percent on income of more than $20 million in 2010. 
When he referred to his administration's bailout of the auto industry, noting that ''some even said we should let it die,'' he could have been talking about Mr. Romney's argument that the carmakers should have been allowed to fail. And when he said he would oppose ''any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place,'' he could have been referring to Mr. Romney's call for a rollback of regulations on Wall Street.
Nine months before he faces the voters, Mr. Obama seized what is likely to be one of his most prominent platforms of the year to draw a bright line between himself and Mr. Romney -- and, in the process, try to appeal to those frustrated by the deepening economic divide.
Gone was the soaring language of his last State of the Union address, when the president spoke of winning the future -- a challenge he likened to ''our generation's Sputnik moment.'' With the tents of the Occupy protesters catching snow in American cities, he was tapping into a national sense of grievance.
''When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich,'' Mr. Obama said, answering Mr. Romney's charge that the president engages in the ''bitter politics of envy.'' ''It's because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference.''
It is a theme he has struck repeatedly as his campaign has geared up, and nowhere more forcefully than last month in Osawatomie, Kan., where he invoked the spirit of Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican aristocrat who nevertheless broke up monopolies and campaigned for a progressive income tax.
Mr. Obama's appeal on Tuesday, studded as it was with the policy proposals that fill these addresses, did not match that populist fury. But in the august setting of the Capitol, squaring off against an often-hostile Congress, the president rolled out an election-year message that offers voters a stark choice between his vision and what he paints as the Darwinian approach of Mr. Romney and other Republicans.
To some extent, Mr. Obama was also aiming his words at Florida, where Mr. Romney and the rest of the Republican field are competing in a primary next week over the right to challenge the president.
Every word in a State of the Union address is carefully chosen. So it was no accident that when the president discussed the auto industry and the future of American manufacturing, he said: ''What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.''
Those cities happen to be in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- battleground states totaling 69 electoral votes.
But much of the president's message was clearly intended to push back at his Republican rivals and their critiques of his record.
Lest anyone forget Mr. Romney's background at Bain Capital as an avid buyer and seller of companies, Mr. Obama offered a paean to permanence -- to companies built on a sturdy foundation of manufacturing and skilled workers. These businesses, he said, are the basis of a competitive economy.
Mr. Obama also seemed to have Mr. Romney in mind when he announced new housing assistance and declared that ''responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.'' Last year, Mr. Romney went to Nevada, the state hardest hit by foreclosures, and told a Las Vegas newspaper that the housing market needed to bottom out.
Mr. Obama also said he would oppose efforts to repeal financial regulations, and he drew a direct link between the policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush, and the economic mess that has consumed his own presidency.
In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has had a useful surrogate in Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who has accused Mr. Romney of destroying jobs while at Bain and pressured him to release his tax returns.
But Mr. Gingrich, whose victory in the South Carolina primary has turned him into a real competitor, did not escape a few jabs Tuesday night. Mr. Obama called for new rules to reduce the influence of lobbyists. Left unsaid was Mr. Gingrich's disclosure on Monday that he had been paid $1.6 million to advise the mortgage giant Freddie Mac.
Mr. Romney was not silent on Mr. Obama's big day, earlier laying out his own case for leadership in a speech at a shuttered factory in Tampa, Fla. He argued that his 25 years in business had given him the skills to turn around the economy. The president, Mr. Romney said, ''puts his faith in government; we put our faith in the American people.''
''Ours is the party of free enterprise, free markets and consumer choice,'' he said. ''The Republican Party stands for personal responsibility and equal opportunity. We don't demonize prosperity; we celebrate success.''
Mr. Obama countered that he had turned things around, pointing to the revived auto industry, a recovering economy and three million private-sector jobs. And he flatly rejected the contention of Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and other Republicans that he is presiding over a country in decline.
''Anyone who tells you otherwise,'' the president said, ''anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about.''

HEADLINE: The State of the Union in 2012

 BODY:
A year ago, after the last State of the Union address, we applauded President Obama for challenging the Republicans' blame-government, slash-and-burn rhetoric. He explained why Washington must do more to help put millions of struggling people back to work and why any credible plan to wrestle down the deficit must include the wealthy paying a fairer share of taxes.
After a rough start to 2011, economic numbers have improved, and Mr. Obama has pushed Congress to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits and outlined an ambitious jobs agenda. But the country's problems are profound. There are 13.1 million unemployed, and the risk of stagnation is real. Republican candidates are pounding on the wrong, but seductive, notion that the real problem is government spending -- especially on the ''others,'' the poor and minorities. Congressional Republicans have barely wavered in their obstructionism. 
Mr. Obama has become steadily more assertive, but he will have to push even harder. The State of the Union address was a chance to do that, and he did not squander it.
He sounded many of the same themes as last year, but his tone was sharper and he was far more willing to apportion blame, particularly singling out the financial industry for its excesses and politicians who are still determined to defend tax cuts for the rich and undo desperately needed financial regulations. ''We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,'' he said, ''or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.''
Mr. Obama's talk of ''an economy built to last'' was a bit too folksy, but he is right that the country can't rely on some invisible hand to develop a strategy to compete in the 21st century. Washington must do a lot more to create good jobs, to encourage new industries, to build the infrastructure to support a vibrant economy and to address climate change and promote energy independence.
The president's calls to deny tax breaks to companies that outsource and provide a tax credit to companies that bring jobs back home are good ones. The real challenge will be to ensure that those repatriated jobs are good-paying jobs. The president called for better job training and education, but a skills gap isn't the main problem. Employers aren't going to do a lot more hiring until consumers buy more products. Demand is unlikely to recover until Congress agrees to more federal spending, including aid to states for hiring.
Mr. Obama's idea to use half of the savings from winding down the wars for public-works projects is laudable and could put hundreds of thousands back to work. Republicans are sure to insist that the money be used for deficit reduction, setting up another battle to simply do the obviously right thing. Mr. Obama has pushed banks and Congress to make it easier for borrowers who are current in their payments to refinance. On Tuesday night, he called -- finally -- for a full investigation of the lending abuses that inflated the bubble and led to the crash. That is the best hope for getting meaningful redress for borrowers.
In addition to his longstanding call to let the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire, Mr. Obama called for a ''Buffett rule'' to ensure that millionaires pay an effective rate of at least 30 percent, ensuring that they never pay less than the middle class. ''You can call this class warfare all you want,'' he said. ''But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.'' We agree.
Over the last year, Americans have become more aware of the deep inequities in the economy and of the government's responsibility to act. Mr. Obama deserves some of the credit for that, but it has a lot more to do with the unrelenting tough times and the efforts of Occupy Wall Street and other protests. What Americans want now is strong political leadership.

HEADLINE: Obama Sets Goal Of Economy Built For The Long Run

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; John M. Broder contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama pledged on Tuesday night to use government power to balance the scale between America's rich and the rest of the public, trying to present an election-year choice between continued leadership toward an economy ''built to last'' and what he called irresponsible policies of the past that caused an economic collapse.
Declaring that ''we've come too far to turn back now,'' the president used his final State of the Union address before he faces the voters to showcase the extent to which he will try to contrast his core economic principles with those of his Republican rivals in a time of deep economic uncertainty. While many Americans remain disappointed with the state of the economy and the president's handling of it, Mr. Obama nonetheless tried to bring into relief the difference between where the country was when he took over and where it is now. 
''The state of our union is getting stronger,'' he declared in time-honored tradition. ''In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs.'' He pointed to renewed hiring by American manufacturers and -- borrowing the ''built to last'' phrase from the auto industry he helped save -- he sketched out, albeit vaguely, what he called a blueprint for economic growth in which the wealthy play by the same rules as ordinary Americans.
Republicans challenged Mr. Obama's assessment of the economy, and asserted that his policies had made the situation worse. But with their own poll numbers diving, Congressional Republicans were subdued in their response to the speech, careful not to boo or seem disrespectful. And the president disputed their claim that he was practicing the politics of division.
''You can call this class warfare all you want,'' Mr. Obama said of his call to create a more even economic playing field. ''Most Americans would call that common sense.'' He characterized the choice as one between whether ''a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by'' or his own vision -- ''where everyone gets a fair shot.''
In returning to his 2008 campaign motif of these being ''not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values,'' Mr. Obama presented a somewhat modest list of initiatives he could enact through executive authority coupled with more ambitious proposals unlikely to advance in Congress. It was an address meant to show a president still interested in governing and a leader putting the interests of the American middle class at the top of his agenda.
Many of his proposals centered on changes to the tax code, including limiting deductions for companies that move jobs overseas, rewarding companies that return jobs to the United States and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.
Taking aim at financial institutions that engaged in risky lending practices that many believe tipped the country into financial crisis, Mr. Obama said he was asking Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and state attorneys general to expand investigations into abusive lending. The new unit, he said, ''will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.''
Mr. Obama also proposed a new trade enforcement unit that would add to the number of government investigators pursuing unfair trade practices and that would be responsible for filing lawsuits against foreign countries, namely China. He called for new legislation to make it easier for Americans to refinance their homes if their interest rates are above market rates. And he proposed a bound-to-be-contentious way to allocate any savings from ending the war in Iraq and winding down the war in Afghanistan: by using half of the war savings on infrastructure projects and the other half to reduce the deficit.
''We will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profits,'' Mr. Obama said. Though his advisers have vowed a campaign against Congress, he expressed a willingness to ''work with anyone in this chamber'' and said he would ''oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.''
In an emotional moment, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in the Tucson shooting last year, returned for the speech before her imminent resignation from the House to concentrate on her recovery. Although the president is often criticized for his aloofness, he embraced Ms. Giffords for a long 10 seconds, rocking and almost seeming to be dancing with her.
Mr. Obama again proposed changes to the tax code so the wealthy pay more, a position he has indicated he will continue to press in this election year against Republican opposition. He called for Congress to put into place his ''Buffett Rule'' -- named after the Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren E. Buffett -- whereby people making more than $1 million a year would pay a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent in income taxes.
To illustrate his point, he provocatively used Mr. Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, as one of his props, seating Ms. Bosanek -- whose effective tax rate is higher than Mr. Buffett's, he has said -- in the chamber with the first lady, Michelle Obama.
Mr. Obama's income tax proposal on Tuesday night was particularly charged, coming as it did less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, released tax returns showing that he and his wife, Ann, had an effective federal income tax rate in 2010 of 13.9 percent and an income ranking among the top one-10th of 1 percent of all taxpayers in 2010.
Mr. Obama would like the new tax to replace the alternative minimum tax, which was created decades ago to make sure that the richest taxpayers with plentiful deductions and credits did not avoid income taxes, but which now affects millions of Americans who are considered upper middle class.
An upbeat Mr. Obama delivered his remarks standing in the chamber of the House of Representatives, an arena ruled by his political adversaries, given the Republican majority that the president and fellow Democrats have criticized as blocking much of the White House agenda.
But in the official Republican response to the address, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said it had been Congressional Republicans who had acted to improve the economy, only to be thwarted by the president.
''The president did not cause the economic and fiscal crisis that continue in America tonight,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''But he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse.''
While he was addressing Congress and assembled dignitaries, Mr. Obama was trying to reach the far greater national television audience of American voters, and his speech, while deep in policy initiatives, served in many ways as a prime-time kickoff of his re-election campaign.
In fact, most of the first lady's guests on Tuesday night came from states that figure heavily in Mr. Obama's re-election plans. Included were North Carolina, from where Mr. Obama selected both a worker and an employer, to demonstrate the benefits of public-private partnerships, and Florida, from where he chose a homeowner who was able to keep her house thanks to Mr. Obama's housing refinance program.
Mr. Obama said a major part of his agenda would be the expansion of domestic energy supplies, both from traditional fuels like oil and natural gas and from cleaner sources like wind and the sun. He singled out the rapid growth of domestic natural gas production through the technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which the government says has unlocked a 100-year supply that now makes the United States the Saudi Arabia of natural gas.
Reflecting the heavy emphasis on the economy in an election year, the president's speech was relatively short on national security, where most political observers and indeed his own aides believe his performance has been much stronger than on the economy. In fact, Mr. Obama ended his speech with the American assault last year that finally, after 10 years, killed Osama bin Laden, and talked of that fateful day last May when he monitored the attack from the White House.
He called on the country to emulate the unity of the Navy Seal team that conducted the raid. ''When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you,'' the president said, ''or the mission fails.''

HEADLINE: A Courtroom Window Opens on a $16 Million Battle of 2 Financiers

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, Ronald O. Perelman and Donald Drapkin were the best of friends, a relationship cemented as the two financiers bought and sold companies like Revlon and Marvel Comics.
On Tuesday in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, court lawyers for Mr. Drapkin accused his now former friend of being a ''nitpicking'' boss who reneged on a promise to pay Mr. Drapkin the millions of dollars Mr. Drapkin says he is owed under a 2007 separation agreement, signed when Mr. Drapkin left MacAndrews & Forbes, Mr. Perelman's holding company.
''The company was scrounging around for any excuse not to pay Mr. Drapkin,'' Elkan Abramowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Drapkin, told the eight jurors hearing the case. ''Do these nitpicking breaches really give the company the right to terminate contracts worth $16 million?'' 
The trial is to determine whether Mr. Perelman is required to honor Mr. Drapkin's agreement.
While the two men are battling over roughly $16 million, this is a fight largely about ego, with each man willing to spend potentially millions of dollars in legal fees to prove he is right. Mr. Perelman's net worth is estimated at more than $12 billion, and while Mr. Drapkin's net worth is not known, in court he said he never bothered to add up what he made during his time at MacAndrew & Forbes, estimating it was more than $200 million. Mr. Drapkin now runs a hedge fund in New York.
Mr. Perelman was not in court on Tuesday, but his name was invoked multiple times, and he is likely to testify later this week.
Mr. Drapkin did see some of his former colleagues, including Barry F. Schwartz, who is executive vice chairman and chief administrative officer of MacAndrews & Forbes. The two, who had worked together for years, sat near each other at the trial but did not appear to speak. On the stand, Mr. Drapkin, who was argumentative and often refused to directly answer many questions on cross-examination, commented that Mr. Schwartz once ''promoted himself'' to a new post at the company after the death of a colleague. Mr. Perelman's lawyer quickly objected to the comment.
At one point the judge overseeing the trial, Paul G. Gardephe, asked the parties to stop talking over each other.
''Try to leave the comments out,'' he warned MacAndrews & Forbes's lawyer, Matthew Menchel, who grew increasingly agitated during his questioning of Mr. Drapkin. ''You know what a laptop is, don't you?'' Mr. Menchel barked at Mr. Drapkin.
The trial centers on two issues: whether Mr. Drapkin failed to turn over documents required under his separation agreement and whether he tried to induce a key MacAndrews & Forbes executive to leave the company. Mr. Perelman says his old friend did both these things, leaving him no choice but to stop honoring the separation agreement.
Mr. Drapkin's lawyer argued in court that the separation agreement requires his client to hand over all corporate documents ''not otherwise available to the company'' and that Mr. Drapkin never had documents that weren't otherwise available to MacAndrews & Forbes.
Mr. Drapkin, however, remained in possession of hundreds of corporate documents that needed to be deleted in accordance with the separation agreement, MacAndrews & Forbes argued.
The proceedings followed a colorful jury selection process. The judge peppered the prospective jurors with question about their professions and their interests, as the pool was whittled down to eight, which included an unemployed actor, a nurse who is a fan of Rachael Ray and a 59-year-old woman getting her associate degree in criminal justice.
As the judge sought to determine whether the prospective jurors could be impartial in the trial, the love life of Mr. Perelman - who has been married five times, once to the actress Ellen Barkin - provided a minor stumbling block.
''Is this the Ronald Perelman who was married to Ellen Barkin?'' one juror asked the judge, eliciting laughter in the courtroom. ''I have met him a few times through Ellen when they were together.''
Judge Gardephe asked whether that would prevent the juror from being impartial. ''Yes, probably,'' the juror responded, laughing. He was immediately excused from the jury pool.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Top 10 Super Bowl Story Lines, and Reasons to Sigh

BYLINE: ANDY BENOIT


HIGHLIGHT: Not every Super Bowl storyline is unimportant or misguided. Many, in fact, are significant and meaningful. But not on the seventh or eighth time around. 

 BODY:
Here are the Top 10 Super Bowl XLVI story lines that you may or may not get sick of in the next two weeks.
10. Playing the underdog 
Justin Tuck immediately claimed the underdog card for the Giants by talking about how no one was giving them a chance and how they are eager to keep proving doubters wrong. Isn't it amazing how every year so many multimillionaire athletes who are on conference champion teams and have spent their entire lives being alpha males can somehow convince themselves that they are disrespected underdogs?
What Tuck fails to mention is that the Giants earned their underdog status by losing seven games during the regular season. People didn't just wake up one day and decide not to believe in the Giants. They woke up one day and realized that the Giants had lost four straight midseason games and their playoff participation hinged on a Week 17 win against Dallas.
P.S. Is anyone really even doubting the Giants? Weren't they considered this year's "hot playoff team that nobody wanted to face"? They're only 3-point underdogs. Really, they're more like "underpuppies." It would be nice to see Las Vegas just once make a pick-em line for a Super Bowl; players would suddenly have to drop the underdog card and get creative in conjuring flimsy bits of inspiration.
9. Gronk's ankle
A star player's ankle injury has become standard Super Bowl fodder. Last year, all the talk was about whether Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey would be able to play on a high ankle sprain (he wasn't). The year before, it was Dwight Freeney and his ankle sprain (Freeney played but not at full strength).
This year, it's Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. The second-year Pro Bowler injured his ankle in the A.F.C. title game. He did us all a favor by coming back into that game and thus quelling the inevitable flood of questions about his availability. But thanks to the good ol' walking boot reports, those questions will still stream in.
Here's what we can assume: Gronk will play and won't be 100 percent, but his performance will not be significantly affected.
8. Tebow
He's not playing but that doesn't mean we won't hear about him.
7. Tom Coughlin
There will be those talking about how he has lightened up and now relates better to his players - even though this story line actually played out four years ago leading up to Super Bowl XLII. Then there will be those who take the back route to what is really the same story by focusing on how Coughlin might seem cantankerous and short-fused but, in actuality, is a fun-loving guy (this can also be a Bill Belichick story, by the way).
It's amazing that the "he's actually a fun-loving guy" stories are as enjoyable as they are. They always focus on how the curmudgeon is not actually curmudgeonly when he's around close friends and family. But if you think about it, 999 people out of 1,000 are not curmudgeonly around close friends and family - at least not a hard-core football-coach- sort of curmudgeonly. What would be more interesting is if someone one day wrote about a head coach who seems like a bare-knuckled jerk on the job and, upon closer inspection, is indeed a bare-knuckled jerk all the time.
The other story that might come up is Coughlin retiring after the Super Bowl. Coughlin, 65, has already said that he won't retire, but given that he's the oldest head coach in the league, that won't stop all reporters from speculating. Everyone likes a "will he ride off into the sunset?" story. Of course, not as much as they like a 
6. Rags to riches story
This year's winner: Victor Cruz. He was undrafted out of UMass in 2010 and suddenly erupted as a top-10 N.F.L. receiver this season. With his Cam Newton-esque smile and catchy salsa dance, he's the most obvious choice for a Super Bowl breakthrough media darling since Ray Buchanan. The great thing about Cruz is, unlike Buchanan (and countless others), he does not go out of his way to be the media darling. In this sense, he's an anti-wide receiver.
Cruz won't capture the spotlight strictly as a human interest story, either. Given the nature of this matchup, his performance may well decide which side hoists the Lombardi Trophy. The Patriots don't have anyone who can cover him or Hakeem Nicks. Can the Giants fully capitalize on this? Can the media cover this story from at least 10 different angles?
5. The nonfootball stories
Some 115 million people will watch this game. The N.F.L. is ragingly popular, but it does not have 115 million fans. If the N.F.C. title game ratings are an indication, the league has about 60 million fans. So how will the other 55 million be entertained? With talk about commercials, fun facts (like the number of pounds of potato chips Americans will consume on Super Bowl Sunday, or the number of toilet flushes there are nationwide just before the start of the third quarter, etc.) and halftime shows.
Because the halftime show talk will revolve around this year's performer, the mercurial Madonna, it will also include rehashed discussions and lame jokes about wardrobe malfunctions (thanks a lot, Janet Jackson). That's almost worse than all the talk about commercials. Every Super Bowl party includes that handful of people who try to coax the rest of the room into joining them in their astonishment about the price of this year's ads. ?! Those familiar with the basic economics of advertising CAN believe.
Sticking with the Super Bowl party idea, keep an eye on how much attention your fellow partygoers pay to the commercials. You'll come away thinking that if you ever buy a Super Bowl ad, you would insist that it be aired in the first quarter. In the first quarter, everyone is dialed in on the TV and excited to see the ads. But as the game wears on, conversations unfold, coolers need refilling and many viewers subconsciously start to realize that Super Bowl commercials are still commercials, which means 99 percent of them fade into the background. By the third quarter - and especially the fourth quarter, if it's a good game - people aren't paying nearly as close attention to the ads. Of course, if a football analyst notices this, you can bet that every advertising agency does, too. So you figure those ad agencies know exactly what they are getting when they purchase Super Bowl air time.
Anyway, that's more than enough on Super Bowl commercials. Moving on.
4. Giants pass rush
Let's make this short and simple: we know Osi Umenyiora is fast, we know Justin Tuck is strong, we know Mathias Kiwanuka is a former first-round pick and we know that Jason Pierre-Paul is a beast/freak/monster/whatever-else-you'd-call-an-unblockable-end. We also know that Tom Brady does not like pass-rush pressure (little secret: no quarterback does). With this in mind, there's no reason for any "expert" to conclude their "analysis" by saying the key for the Giants will be getting pressure on Tom Brady. The discussion needs to advance from there to how the Giants can generate pressure and use it to their advantage (it's not just about sacking Brady - it's also about using pressure designs to force incompletions and turnovers). The conversation also needs to be about what New England can do tactically to mitigate that pass rush. Simply saying "New England's key to victory is to protect Brady" is almost like saying "New England's key to victory is scoring more points than New York."
*No. 4 bonus: the no-name lines
With so much focus on the Giants defensive line, someone will want to spotlight the rest of the trenches. Every offensive line likes to play the "no name" shtick. You know how it goes - rough and tough offensive linemen, blue-collar, lunch pail guys, old-fashioned attitudes. To accentuate this, the linemen will be blase about the media coverage. 
The Patriots defensive line will also be ripe for this story line - especially with the obvious "everyone talks about the Giants D-linemen, but these little known Patriot D-linemen are out to prove that they're good, too" story line. This will include plenty of the underdog/proving doubters wrong card, which will be annoying. In fact, I pledge to do all I can in the future to get Kyle Love, Brandon Deaderick, Mark Anderson, Ron Brace or Gerard Warren Associated Press All-Pro votes if any of them answers a "do you feel your D-line isn't getting the respect it deserves?" question with something along the lines of "not really because aside from Vince Wilfork, no one on our D-line is all that good."
3. Belichick/Brady legacy
They're appearing in a record fifth Super Bowl together. If they win, we ask, are we looking at the greatest head coach/quarterback duo ever? How about just the greatest head coach ever? Or just the greatest quarterback ever? Both? It might be difficult to get sick of this topic - it's actually very interesting. But the poor folks who DO get sick of it - and there will be plenty, especially with some people being naturally inclined to reject any Patriots topic - will REALLY be sick of it.
2. Is Eli now the best Manning?
Same goes for this topic: it's fascinating and one that Manning-haters - and perhaps even simple "non-Manning fans" - will quickly grow tired of. Given the current Peyton drama and the fact that this game is being played in Indianapolis, no one will be sicker of Manning-related questions by week's end than Eli. The trunk of this topic's tree is Eli's legacy. Peyton comparisons are the heaviest branch.
Other branches include Eli's preseason statement about being in that elite Tom Brady quarterback class (a far less interesting topic now that no one in their right mind would argue against Eli here), Eli's maturation as a leader (funny that all the analysis on Eli's body language has disappeared even though his body language has not actually changed), the obligatory human interest story of "hey, don't forget that the third Manning brother, Cooper, might not be an N.F.L. quarterback, but he's a really successful businessman!" and, finally, the assortment of little brother stories in which father Archie is quoted a lot.
1. Patriots seeking revenge in a Super Bowl rematch
This Super Bowl rematch story has already gotten old, which is why Belichick has already programmed his men to play it down. And rightfully so. The Patriots are indeed a totally different team this time around. Their offense is no longer vertical, it's horizontal. Their defense is no longer a 3-4, it's a 4-3 (for the most part). And as you've probably heard by now, just eight members of this Patriots squad were on that 18-1 squad.
No need to elaborate on this topic further - the rest of the world is already doing that. We'll end by taking this opportunity to say that while you might tolerate recycling variations of this story, do not tolerate anyone saying that the Patriots will be out for revenge and, thus, will be extra motivated. It's the Super Bowl - everyone is already motivated.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Scramble to Unload Greek Debt

BYLINE: LANDON THOMAS JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Hedge funds that bought an estimated $5.2 billion of beaten-down Greek bonds in the last month are now finding it difficult to find buyers for their positions. 

 BODY:
8:29 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON - So much for that big fat Greek payday.
Hedge funds that loaded up on Greek bonds in the last month - betting on a quick gain - are now scrambling to sell those holdings, fearful that European policy makers will force them to take a deep and binding haircut on the debt.
But walking away from the trade may not be that easy. While the money managers had little problem snapping up the bonds from European banks eager to sell, the pool of potential buyers is drying up.
Hedge funds have few options. Although talks between Greece and its bondholders have stalled, European officials are pressing for a deal by the end of this month. Under the proposed debt restructuring plan, hedge funds and other private sector creditors would have to incur losses of 50 percent or more - whether or not the bondholders agreed.
"I think it's going to be take it or leave it. And if you do not participate you will get massively beaten up," said one hedge fund holder of Greek debt, alluding to the unpleasant prospect that if he did not take the deal - and the steep loss in value, or haircut - he would end up with nearly worthless Greek bonds and with virtually no legal protection.
The situation represents a significant shift in how Europe has approached the issue. Last year, when the idea of a Greek debt default seemed a remote possibility, the private sector agreed to a "voluntary" 21 percent loss on its bonds. The fear was that forcing mandatory losses would lead to a disorderly default and scare investors off European debt altogether.
But as Greece's economic problems have worsened and the need for debt relief has become more acute, Europe, particularly Germany, has come around to the realization that the private sector must take a deeper loss. In a sign of the new direction, the region's leaders have begun discussions with the European Central Bank on an arcane debt swap that would strip 55 billion euros ($72 billion) of Greek bonds from the central bank's portfolio, thus removing the possibility that the central bank might share losses with the private sector in a debt restructuring deal.
Now, the smart money isn't looking so smart. Starting in December, the counterintuitive, go-long Greece bet was one of the more popular pitches made to hedge funds in New York and London. Investment banks - Merrill Lynch was particularly aggressive in recommending the trade, investors say - argued that even though Greece was nearly bankrupt, those who bought the paper maturing in March could double their money when Greece received the next installment of its bailout, due that same month.
The theory was that the bulk of that money would be paid to bondholders to keep Greece solvent, just as was the case with past payments from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Greece might well restructure its debt, the bankers said, but added it was likely to happen later and would not affect the March payout.
The pitch worked. In the last month or so, hedge funds purchased an estimated 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of beaten-down Greek bonds that mature on March 20.
But the bonds have gone from bad to worse. "There was a lot of volume going in, but not a lot going out," said one broker, speaking on condition of anonymity. The broker said prices for March 2012 bonds had slipped to about 35 cents on the dollar, from approximately 40 cents to 45 cents.
Brokers estimate that of the 14.5 billion euros worth of these bonds outstanding, the largest holder is the European Central Bank, which bought the securities in 2010 at a price of about 70 cents in an early, ultimately futile, attempt to lift Greece's failing bond market. The brokers say that 4 billion to 5 billion euros of bonds are owned by hedge funds at an average cost of about 40 cents to 45 cents on the dollar, with some of the larger positions being held by funds in the United States that have large London offices.
"It was a very binary trade," said one hedge fund executive who listened to the pitch but passed. "If you got paid, you double your money in a month. But you may also look like an idiot."

HEADLINE: Who Receives Government Assistance?

BYLINE: CASEY MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The share of Americans receiving benefits from Medicaid, unemployment insurance or food stamps correlates largely with education levels, but participation among all groups increased between 2007 and 2010, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 Thanks to the recession, and changes in program rules, a large fraction of households receive government assistance, especially those headed by people without a four-year college degree.
 The three largest government safety net programs serving nonelderly households are Medicaid, unemployment insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Together they paid out more than $600 billion in benefits during 2010 on behalf of program participants.
 A large number of households received these benefits. Using the results of the Census Bureau's annual demographic survey, I classified nonelderly households by the educational attainment of the household head (I omitted the small number of households headed by people younger than age 25, because their educations might still be in progress), and calculated the fraction of them that received Medicaid, unemployment insurance and/or SNAP sometime during the years 2007 and 2010.
 A few households headed by people with a four-year college degree or more received at least one of these three forms of government assistance, but their recipiency rates were much less than the rates among less educated households. Less than 10 percent of households headed by someone with a doctorate or professional degree (like an M.D. or law degree) received government assistance. 
Over a third of households with heads whose formal education was limited to a high school diploma - the most common type of household - received at least one of these types of assistance in 2010. A majority of households with heads who stopped their schooling before graduating from high school received government assistance in 2010.
 All of the groups saw the likelihood of government assistance increase between 2007 and 2010. Some of this increase, especially with the Medicaid program, can be attributed to the recession because Medicaid eligibility rules hardly changed during that time. At the same time, a number of people, especially in the less educated categories, saw their incomes fall below the poverty line, which makes Medicaid eligibility much more likely.
 But changes in the rules for taking part in unemployment insurance and SNAP changed significantly during this time, and explain a large part of the changes between 2007 and 2010 shown in the chart.
 We can hope that an economic expansion will take incomes back to where they were before the recession began, and beyond. But government assistance will not return to prerecession levels until participation rules do, and that return depends on political factors as much as economic ones.

HEADLINE: Fears Lurk in a Post-Transition Afghanistan

BYLINE: GRAHAM BOWLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Even in Mihtarlam, one place where the United States-led forces have transferred authority to Afghans, locals still don't think their safety is assured. 

 BODY:
Over the mountains from frigid Kabul, Mihtarlam is one place where American-led forces have transferred authority to the Afghans.
Out here in post-transition Afghanistan, among the orange groves, fear lurks. American soldiers are still in position, but the Afghan Army is taking the lead. And Afghan officials - from the provincial governor to the mayor to the police -- assert confidently that security is under control.
But not everyone is convinced -- and some are really nervous.
"They say the security is going well, but that is not the reality," said a judge in the provincial court whose name is being whithhled because he has received Taliban death threats.
He added, "Whenever I am working on a case and send someone to jail, I am concerned that the family of the criminal will do something to me." 
The judge is a precise, quiet man with a trimmed beard, who was dressed one recent morning in a brown jacket over a neat white tunic.
Like most people in Afghanistan, he said he was anxious about what would happen when the Americans and their allies leave. What will remain of the economy, the security, the civil society constructed so delicately since the Taliban's ouster?
"I have been threatened by the Taliban on my cellphone," he said. "They are telling me to quit this job otherwise we will kill you."
Along with a handful of other civil leaders in Mihtarlam, the capital of Laghman Province, the judge had been invited out to meet visitors from the media to show just what the transition has achieved.
But he is not completely on-message.
"There was a judge three months ago, he was killed by the Taliban," he said.
The judge has done well in the relative stability of the past 10 years since the Taliban was pushed out. He graduated from Nangarhar University seven years ago, trained in Kabul and went to Wardak Province as a judge before returning to Laghman.
He has five sons and one daughter - and hopes that his sons, at least, will become engineers.
"The biggest thing in my life is that I was assigned to my job and now get a good salary," he said. "I get a house downtown near the courthouse.
"Our courthouse building is ripped down," he said. "Four to five judges work in the same room. They promise us they will build us a new courthouse, but it is not built yet."
But it is the tenuous nature of the security that worries him most.
As he stands outside one of the government buildings, behind him across a plain rear the snowy peaks of mountains. Somewhere beyond is Nuristan and then the Pakistan border - from where, many say, the insurgents stream into the province.
"I am careful going to my house," he said. "I am concerned that the Taliban will kidnap my kids.
"I don't stray from the center of town. Other judges have the same problem as me. They are concerned for their kids. Even the prosecutors are concerned.
"The Taliban are calling people who work with the government. The Taliban told me, 'You are the main person in the court, you are participating in the meetings with the coalition forces.'
"When they called me I went to the N.D.S.," he said referring to the National Directorate of Security, the intelligence agency. "I gave them the cellphone number and the time of the call, but they were not able to find the person. The Taliban called me four times. I changed my SIM card. The last time they called was four months ago."
NATO troops will remain in "Enduring Presence Locations" across the province, but most are leaving. They are pretty clear-eyed about the security situation and the incidence of roadside bombs, the Taliban's weapon of choice. It is safe in a narrow ring around the base and the town, "but if you go north of here you are asking for I.E.D.s, trust me," complained one soldier.
A big focus now is on economic development and trying to make sure that the economy can stand alone when the international forces leave.
The United States has poured $5 million into the province over the last two years, eradicating poppy farming and trying to make commercial agriculture work.
Now, the spending is being reduced, gradually.
"We do irrigation, canals, fish farms, poultry farms," said Eric Grant, an American agriculture expert. "We don't just drop everything. We leave slowly."
But the local Provincial Reconstruction Team, civilians and military personnel who are building roads and schools and helping local government become more effective, is already down to 57 people from 107. When the next team revolves in, there will be about 65 to 68 people, but they will be the last. When they leave, no one will replace them.
In the heart of Mihtarlam, behind the tall walls of the governor's compound, inside a curtained summerhouse, Governor Mohammad Iqbal Azizi says his local police and army can cope.
"Everything is improving," he said as he ran a string of wooden beads through his fingers. "Today, the Afghan security forces are very much confident to maintain the security of Mihtarlam."
Above his grandly turbaned head, a canopy in the colors of the Afghan flag - green, black, red -- billowed from the ceiling. He ate raisins from a silver tray.
The governor maintained the people of Laghman Province would not tolerate the Taliban's return. "The enemy is seriously marginalized. People are fighting against them in this province," he said. He even stated that the people recently killed two insurgents. 
Outside in the bazaar, opinion was divided about what would happen next in Afghanistan.
"When I see the big trucks and guns, we believe the security is good," said Ningyalia, a money-changer. "If they go, God knows what then. We may face problems in the future."
But Mirwas, 35, who was selling fabric, was more confident.
"After 10 years, life is going well in our country," he said. "We want our own Afghan people to bring peace. The international force should leave."

HEADLINE: At Davos, Discussions of a Global Data Deluge

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: The discussion of data and privacy is moving from technology conferences to nontech meetings too. A number of sessions at this year's annual World Economic Forum all outline these discussions. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - Each year, a new theme reverberates through technology conferences around the world. A few years ago it was predictions of the coming wave of social media, location-based services and mobile, long before they became mainstream.
Today's topic de jour: data. Lots of data.
What makes the data discussion different than in previous years is that it is being discussed in high-profile nontechnology meetings too. This is clearly evident at this year's annual World Economic Forum.
Meetings here this week include: "From data to decisions: How are new approaches to data intelligence transforming decision-making?" "Data deluge and citizen science." "Incidents from digital crime to massive incidents of data theft are increasing significantly, with major political, social and economic implications." "How is big data being used to uncover individual and collective human dynamics?"
The discussions are not confined to technology attendees either. Chancellors, bankers and educators meeting at the conference are being asked to discuss what the forum calls a growing data deluge and how to manage it.
A 2012 report released by the World Economic Forum, titled, "Big Data, Big Impact: New Possibilities for International Development," outlines some of the possibilities data can bring around the globe to business and education. It also warns of its potential privacy implications.
The report says data is a new economic asset class, which touches all aspects of society, regardless of income or location.
"Big data represents one of these seismic economic shifts that happens every 10 years," said Zach Bogue, co-founder of a stealth data investment fund called Data Collective, who was attending Davos. "In some sense, this data has always existed, but until now the bandwidth, storage capability and compute power haven't existed to harness it."
Yet as there is talk of data, the discussion of privacy is not far behind.
Earlier this week in Munich, Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, repeatedly talked about data in respect to privacy. Ms. Reding said there were 27 laws that apply to data in Europe, most of which date back more than a decade and don't properly protect consumers today.
Ms. Reding outlined new regulations that were presented in Brussels on Wednesday and were designed to implement one sweeping data protection regulation that would apply to all of Europe.
The new regulations are part of the discussion at Davos as these new rules would drastically affect the way companies operate and collect data. For example, one component of this legislation will require companies to communicate to users why they are collecting this data and how long it is being stored on company servers.
Although the proposed data law being presented by Ms. Reding will apply to companies in Europe, it will clearly affect technology companies around the globe too, including Facebook, Twitter and Google in the United States.
At the World Economic Forum, the discussion is also focusing on one of the toughest regulation challenges in regards to data collection: How to manage a balancing act between governments overseeing data collection and its actions stifling innovation. More importantly, regulators hope to figure out a global solution to data collection.
As the World Economic Forum reports says: "Concerted action is needed by governments, development organizations and companies to ensure that this data helps the individuals and communities who create it."

HEADLINE: Oil Supply as a Strategic Risk

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: In an opinion piece in the journal Nature, two professors argue that given the constraints on supply, smart governments ought to be pushing hard to move their citizens into more efficient cars, onto public transit and so forth. 

 BODY:
Concerns about the climate have not inspired a lot of action lately on global energy policy. Now two professors are arguing that supply concerns and rising oil prices ought to be enough to get governments moving, even if the climate does not.
In an opinion piece released on Wednesday by the journal Nature, James Murray of the University of Washington and David King of the University of Oxford point out that global oil production appeared to hit a cap of about 75 million barrels a day in 2005. Since then, they note, small supply bumps have caused big price gyrations, yet even when prices spike above $100 a barrel, supply appears incapable of rising to meet the demand.
The professors make only a glancing mention of the term "peak oil," a widely touted and widely attacked concept, but their argument resembles some of the less feverish versions of the peak oil case. 
They essentially argue that oil supply now represents a large strategic risk to global economic growth, and that smart governments ought to be developing comprehensive plans and pushing hard to move their citizens into more efficient cars, onto public transit and so forth - a greener energy path that would also be good for the climate.

The professors also call for some steps that might not go over well at a Greenpeace meeting, like a stronger push for nuclear power. 
Variations of the oil-peaked-in-2005 argument have been made by others, but rarely in the pages of Nature, the world's most august scientific journal. I would expect this one to get a lot of attention, and probably a lot of criticism because of its high profile. One gap I see is that the professors fault the United States government for inaction but never mention some of the things it doing, like imposing tougher regulations on the fuel efficiency of cars. Dr. Murray said in an e-mail that the authors were limited by space constraints.
The required energy transformation "will take decades, so we must begin as soon as possible," the professors write. "Emphasizing the short-term economic imperative from oil prices must be enough to push governments into action now."

HEADLINE: An Indian Student's Guide to the SAT and ACT Admissions Exams

BYLINE: ROBIN MAMLET and CHRISTINE VANDEVELDE


HIGHLIGHT: Robin Mamlet, a former dean of admissions at Stanford University in California, and Christine VanDeVelde, a journalist, explain the alphabet of tests standing between applicants and their entry to American colleges. 

 BODY:
Standardized tests are important when applying to American colleges and universities, but do not play the same decisive role in admission as they do in India. Admission to American institutions of higher education is not based solely on a student's performance on a single set of exams. The results of several standardized tests - the ACT or SAT, and SAT subject tests - are only a part of the evaluation of all students applying to American colleges, one element in a wide array of requirements, including letters of recommendation, essays, school reports and extracurricular activities.
"The key for most international applicants is less about test scores than about differentiating themselves in the applicant pool through the other parts of the application," Jennifer Rickard, chief enrollment officer at Bryn Mawr College, a top liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, told us.
That does not mean that the colleges have lower expectations overall with regard to test results. "While there is no line above which a student is automatically admitted, that doesn't mean that a noncompetitive score is O.K.," said Katharine Harrington, vice president for admissions and planning at the University of Southern California. "The fact is that for highly selective American institutions, a strong showing in standardized tests, a strong curriculum and good grades are all necessary but not sufficient conditions for admission."
As has been discussed in previous posts on The Choice on India Ink, American colleges evaluate students in the entire context of their personality, background and schooling. "That means, for example, they may expect higher test scores from Indian students who attend very selective international schools and whose home language is likely English, than they expect from a student attending an Indian public school, whose home language is not English and who might be the first in his family to attend college," said Jim Montoya, vice president for higher education at the College Board, which oversees the SAT.
On average, students from India tend to have standardized test scores on par with students from the United States. Indian students can see where they fit into a school's academic profile by comparing their scores with the most recently available information on the college's enrolled freshman class, usually found on a college's Web site or in reference sources like "The Fiske Guide to Colleges."
There is a caveat for students seeking financial aid, however. "If a student is applying to schools that are 'need aware' '' -- which means they may take into account a student's need for financial assistance in deciding whether to admit them -- "the bar may be set a little bit higher," said Jarrid Whitney, executive director of admissions and financial aid at the California Institute of Technology. "If they're going to offer a student financial aid, need-aware schools are going to look for a very small slice of the international pool that is academically incredibly superb."
Indian students applying to American schools also need to understand that testing requirements are different from college to college. Some colleges will require the SAT or ACT, but no SAT subject tests. Others will require additional SAT subject tests or specific ones for majors like engineering. It's extremely important that students check the Web site of every college they're applying to in order to understand requirements. Also note that colleges and universities that say they are test-optional -- meaning no admissions exams are obligatory -- may in fact require testing for international students. (A good place to begin to explore that list is at fairtest.org.)
Our advice: Students should sit for the full gamut of tests - taking either the SAT or ACT and subject tests - to have the greatest number of options available when applying. For the SAT or ACT, students should test about a year before they will apply - earlier if they're going to apply under an early decision or early acceptance program. For the SAT subject tests, a separate set of exams that measure a student's knowledge in a particular area, like English or math, take the test as close as possible to when the relevant class completes so the subject matter is fresh.
What is the best way to prepare? The best preparation is challenging yourself intellectually and academically by engaging in rigorous coursework and reading sophisticated texts critically. 
Amin Gonzalez, associate director of admissions at Yale University adds, "Since there is an emphasis placed on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and economic education throughout much of India, students should pay particular attention to developing their language and writing abilities. Doing so will not only allow them to improve their performance on an unfamiliar standardized test, but also ensure a smoother transition into liberal arts programs."
The SAT, ACT and SAT subject tests are not global exams, so familiarize yourself with the formats, the cultural context of the questions, and the process of taking the exam itself. Take practice tests to become acquainted with the format of both tests and see which suits you best, then concentrate on preparing for that test.
American colleges also often need to determine whether a student is prepared to succeed at college-level instruction in English. So they may require English proficiency testing, particularly if English is not your first language or instruction at your school has not been in English. The college will recommend a testing service, like the Test of English as a Foreign Language (Toefl) or the International English Language Testing System (Ielts). While there is no cutoff score for the SAT, ACT and subject tests, most colleges will have a minimum Toefl or Ielts score.
Testing information and practice tests for the ACT, SAT and SAT subject tests are available at no cost on the Web sites of the ACT and the College Board. In addition, the advising centers of the United States-India Educational Foundation (Usief) EducationUSA, located in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai, provide test prep resources, including classes, and some administer the SAT and other tests.

HEADLINE: Deep Crisis of Confidence Afflicts Democracies, Elsewhere Unease

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: An economic and political crisis in democracies has shaken faith and made even some members of the establishment warn that change must come - even as the Arab Spring and unrest in China and Russia prove a thirst for freedom. 

 BODY:
Protesters in Moscow and Cairo fill public squares to demand representative government. Yet, on the streets of Madrid and New York - or of Athens, which gave us the very word for democracy - discontent is almost as rampant.
The only consistent messages seem to be that leaders around the world are failing to deliver on their citizens' expectations and that Facebook and Twitter allow crowds to coalesce in an instant to let them know it. This is not a comforting picture for the 40 heads of state or government who are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, be they elected leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany or authoritarians like Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of Ethiopia.
''I think that what we have learned in the last few years since the financial crisis and since the Arab Spring is that brittle states with limited political and economic capital are particularly susceptible to the combination of severe economic downturn and the communications revolution,'' said Ian Bremner, president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in New York.
''Those brittle states come in different flavors,'' said Mr. Bremner, who moderated a panel in Davos on Wednesday on the state of democracy. ''Some are authoritarian, some of them are democratic.''
From the perspective of human progress, the picture is muddled. In raw statistical terms, democracy lost ground last year, according to the annual tally by Freedom House, an advocacy group in Washington. In a report issued last week, Freedom House counted 12 countries where democracy had made gains and 26 where the level of freedom had declined.
At the same time, Arch Puddington, the vice president for research at Freedom House, figures that it was still a good year for democracy because of the Arab Spring revolts in Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern countries.
''Our view is that the events of 2011 are more positive than negative,'' Mr. Puddington said. ''We see the Arab uprising as constituting the kind of transformational event not unlike in 1989 and 1991 when the Soviet Union unraveled. It is a part of the world that has been immune to the spread of freedom. Now things are in play.''
But no one can predict with confidence what kind of societies will emerge from the turmoil. The superiority of U.S. and European democracy no longer seems as clear-cut as it did a decade ago. Political views in the United States are polarized, and public confidence in Congress is at a low point. The euro zone debt crisis drags on as European leaders quarrel endlessly about how to solve it. 
The most powerful leader in Europe may be Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who was appointed by elected officials but cannot be fired and is independent of political control. So it is telling that in a city full of banks, the Frankfurt version of the Occupy movement chose the E.C.B. lawn as a place to set up its tents. Participants said they were protesting the central bank's lack of democratic accountability. Meanwhile, Greece and Italy are led by unelected technocrats whose selections were strongly influenced by Germany.
People seem tired and disillusioned, no matter where they live. Even pillars of the establishment are shaken. Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, whose annual gathering in Davos is financed largely by corporations, sounded recently as if he were ready to pitch his tent in Zuccotti Park, the hub of the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York.
''Capitalism, in its current form, no longer fits the world around us,'' Mr. Schwab said in a statement last week. ''We have failed to learn the lessons from the financial crisis of 2009.''
In many parts of the world, the correlation between democracy and economic growth no longer seems solid. Some of the most dynamic economies in the world are in places like China or Vietnam, which imprison protesters and where leaders are chosen by a clique.
''There has been an assumption that democratic governance and rapid growth go hand in hand,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group based in New York. ''The existence of China challenges that idea.''
But it is hard to point to any country that has successfully transplanted the Chinese system. ''People have been talking about the China model for years,'' Mr. Puddington of Freedom House said. ''No one has come close to emulating the Chinese form of government.''
Leaders in China and Russia are not feeling comfortable, either. They are facing dissent within their own borders and watching developments in the Middle East with acute unease. 
It is not as easy for them to argue, as they did in the past, that revolts in countries like Libya have been fomented by outsiders. They are frightened by the power of social networking to defeat censorship.
''This was a part of the world that seemed so secure - if they could go, anyone could,'' said Thomas Carothers, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research organization in Washington, referring to the Arab world. ''That has got to be scary if you are a dictatorial regime. You wake up one morning and look out the window and there are all these people in your central square.''
Mr. Carothers spoke by telephone from Budapest, where he was teaching at a university. Hungary, in fact, is an example of how fragile democracy can be, even in the middle of Europe. A symbol of resistance to Soviet dominance after its 1956 revolt, Hungary was one of the first former communist countries to join the European Union.
Now Prime Minister Viktor Orban faces accusations that he has used his overwhelming majority in Parliament to mute criticism in the news media, weaken rival centers of power like the courts and the central bank and perpetuate his party's dominance by rewriting the Constitution.
The European Union began formal legal proceedings last week against Hungary. Mr. Orban, who needs aid from the Union and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting on the national debt, has promised concessions. But he also seems to have been emboldened by the weaknesses in the Union that have been exposed by the sovereign debt crisis. Nationalistic parties in countries like Finland, France and the Netherlands have also tried to exploit the debt crisis for political ends.
''Europe risks being handicapped if it doesn't deal decisively with this challenge to democracy,'' said Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch.
Democratic freedoms have also been eroding in countries as diverse as South Africa, Turkey and Ukraine. Still, people who track the uneven advance of democracy warn against too much pessimism. The fundamental idea of representative government remains powerful, and no compelling alternative model has emerged. 
''The two reservoirs of democracy, the U.S. and Europe, are not performing very well economically and, in some ways, in governance, and that hurts,'' Mr. Carothers said. But ''there are still lots of people in Russia and Burma who would like to give democracy a chance.''

HEADLINE: Merrill Lynch Fined $1 Million for Bonus Clawbacks

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sanctioned Merrill Lynch for requiring former brokers to settle disputes over "retention bonuses" in New York State court instead of an authority arbitration panel. 

 BODY:
The big bonuses doled out at Merrill Lynch during the height of the financial crisis have once again reared their ugly head.
Merrill Lynch agreed on Wednesday to pay regulators $1 million to settle accusations that it thwarted rules for clawing back the compensation. The bonuses were tied to the firm's merger with Bank of America, which came in early 2009.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, sanctioned the firm for requiring former highly paid brokers to settle disputes over "retention bonuses" in New York State court. Under the authority's rules, brokerage firms are supposed to allow employees access to arbitration panels, rather than state courts, which are less-friendly turf for employees. 
"Merrill Lynch specifically designed this bonus program to bypass the authority's rule requiring firms to arbitrate disputes with employees, and purposefully filed expedited collection actions in New York state courts and denied those registered representatives a forum to assert counterclaims," Brad Bennett, the authority's enforcement chief, said in a statement. 
Bonuses awarded at Merrill Lynch ahead of the Bank of America deal have been the subject of much regulatory scrutiny. In 2010, Bank of America paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $150 million to settle accusations that it hid the bonuses from shareholders before the deal closed. 
But in the latest case, the former Merrill brokers make for unlikely victims. 
Merrill awarded $2.8 billion in bonuses, set up as loans that would come due if an employee departed, to more than 5,000 "high-producing" brokers to keep them happy during the tumult of the Bank of America takeover, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Soon after, several brokers fled the firm, while stiffing Merrill for the cash owed under the loan.
"It's important to remember that legal action only occurs when a former employee doesn't repay their loan as they had agreed to do," a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Bill Haldin, said in the statement. "Given that well over 90 percent of financial advisers who participated in the program are still with us, repayment problems haven't been a widespread issue." 
Merrill Lynch filed nearly 100 cases against their former brokers in New York State court, a breach of the authority's rules. New York State court, Finra noted, "greatly limits the ability of defendants to assert counterclaims in such actions."
Merrill Lynch neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to Finra's enforcement action and fine. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority also accused Merrill Lynch of drafting the bonus program in a way that obscured that the bonuses came from the firm. Instead, Merrill Lynch structured it to seem that the bonuses stemmed from "MLIFI," an affiliate not under the authority's jurisdiction.

HEADLINE: Despite Generic Rivals, Branded Drugs Still Sell Well

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Drug companies are finding lucrative foreign markets for their brand-name drugs after patents expire in the United States and unleash generic competition. 

 BODY:
Though the loss of patent protection on a brand-name prescription drug tends to lead to a sharp drop in sales for that product in the United States, such older medicines have become a booming business for the pharmaceutical industry in emerging markets.
Take Abbott Laboratories, which on Wednesday, reported that one of its fastest growing business lines last year was that of established pharmaceuticals, or "branded generics" as they are known in the industry. Sales of such products, which include branded generics outside the United States, were up nearly 20 percent to $5.4 billion last year, the company said in a news release.
Abbott and other drug makers see older brands as important in countries like India and China, where the economies are growing stronger but access to safe prescription medicines, particularly generics, remains an issue.
In addition, the patent expirations of big-name drugs like Pfizer's cholesterol pill, Lipitor, has manufacturers trying to continue to win brand equity in emerging markets, where regulations on generic substitution of brands may not be as strong. (In the United States, the introduction of a generic copy is almost automatic once a brand's patent expires, and multiple generics often flood the market, analysts say.)
"As companies like Pfizer, Sanofi and others run into a lot of patent exposure issues, they're going to be looking more aggressively at pushing into branded generic markets," Jason Gerberry, generics and specialty pharmaceutical analyst at Leerink Swann in Boston, said in an interview. 
Doctors are looking for something that is older and reliable, the companies and analysts say. In India, for example, branded generics make up "70 to 80 percent of the retail market," according to an October 2010 report by McKinsey & Company on India's emerging pharmaceutical market.
"There is comfort in brand equity that companies can bring," Mr. Gerberry said. 
Abbott's branded drugs include the antibiotic Clarithromycin, Duphaston for progesterone deficiency, Serc for vertigo and the prescription painkiller Brufen, which is a version of ibuprofen. Abbott's 2010 acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals added more than 100 branded generics that generate about $2 billion in annual sales, the company said. 
Abbott's chairman and chief executive officer, Miles D. White, last year separated branded generics into their own business unit, the "established products division," or E.P.D. 
"We've spent the better part of the last decade building E.P.D. into the global organization it is today," Mr. White told analysts Wednesday. "Most recently, we completed the integration of Piramal Healthcare Solutions in 2011, which together with our existing business, made Abbott the largest pharmaceutical company in India, one of several rapidly growing emerging markets. The success of E.P.D. is built on literally hundreds of different products sold around the globe."

HEADLINE: Chinese Readers on the 'iEconomy'

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Translated highlights from comments submitted by Chinese readers to a Times article on the challenges posed by increasingly globalized high-tech industries. 

 BODY:
On Sunday, The Times published"How the U.S. Lost Out on iPhoneWork," the first article in "The iEconomy," a new series examining the challenges posed by increasingly globalized high-tech industries.
The second part of the series, written by Charles Duhigg and David Barboza, takes a deeper look at labor conditions inside Foxconn, one of Apple's most important manufacturing partners.
The New York Times partnered with Caixin, a Chinese business magazine, to publish the article in Chinese. The goal was twofold: to share the content of the article with readers in China, and to solicit Chinese comments for translation into English that might prove illuminating for readers of the English-language article on NYTimes.com.
Below are some of the hundreds of comments about the Chinese article that were posted on Caixin's Web site and on Weibo.com, a Chinese microblogging Web site, and other Chinese social media platforms. These comments were collected and translated by Wang Qidi, Cathy Chang and Bao Beibei.
I read this story and I'm saddened. It's not only Apple that should be blamed, but also the system that tolerates its existence. Made-in-China should not be synonymous with the blood and sacrifice of young lives. -- Evita
When local governments are trying to attract new investments to their regions, they always emphasize the low-cost labor in their areas. How pathetic! -- Jiangsu
By the way, construction workers and farmers are also living a harsh life in China, shall we also boycott housing and grains? -- Zhou Zhimei
It's ridiculous that the local government is trying to promote the city's image while horrible accidents are still happening like this. If what is prohibited in the U.S. is highly protected here by the local authorities, we will never be treated with dignity. -- 
There are two stories about Apple: one is about its brilliant business performance, and the other is about the blood and sweat behind Apple miracles. I strongly recommend that all Apple fans read this. Corporations should bear social responsibilities, and customers should also understand and be responsible to the society. -- 
Without Apple, Chinese workers will be worse off. I hope China can some day soon have dozens of its own companies like Apple, who (only) work on high-end research and development and send manufacturing lines to Africa. -- Anonymous
Even though Apple should be ethically condemned, the key point is: whether the working conditions inside the factories are supervised by law. This (supervision) is the duty of judicial officers and labor unions. Now everything is driven only by G.D.P., so which government official would dare supervise those companies? They (the governments) have long reduced themselves to the servant of the giant enterprises. -- Occasional Think
If people saw what kind of life workers lived before they found a job at Foxconn, they would come to an opposite conclusion of this story: that Apple is such a philanthropist. -- Zhengchu1982
This article demonstrates multiple perspectives. The social responsibility of Apple, the moral standing of Apple's fans, the monitoring function of the government, the labor rights awareness of the workers, and the supervision power of the media All these aspects were discussed but none of them is doing what they should have done. One detail in the story caught my attention. The problem of n-hexane and industrial dust is not yet to be solved after such a long time, and we need to think about why. -- Wozhizhiyi
Apple has gained so much sales revenues from China. Do you think the company really cares about the conditions of those workers? I think they are just proud of having an Apple product. -- 
The story of Apple is just an individual case. There will be endless problems from Pear or Banana even if you revealed Apple's inside conduct. We have to solve the fundamental problems, which include labor laws, corporate social responsibility, China's industrial policies and others. -- Huang Xiaoshan
If Foxconn were to abide by the labor law, which is supposed to protect workers and keep them basically to 8 hours a day and 5 days a week, their wages will be lower. If workers establish a formal labor union, lots of workers will be disappointed and return home to rural areas. The production cost of Chinese manufacturers will increase, and those Chinese factories will lose their competitive advantage. Who would be happy if that really happened? -- 
Cheap labor is China's core competitiveness over the past 30 years, which helps Chinese products win the global market share and leads to China's rapid economic growth. Those workers created over $300 million of foreign exchange reserves and the so-called "China's Miracle" at the expense of this -- a waste of resources and heavy
pollution. -- 
If the story is simply blaming Apple and Foxconn, then it is simplifying the problem. Other companies including HTC, Lenovo, HP and Sony, and their OEM (original equipment manufacturer) companies such as Wistron, Quanta and Inventec, share the same situation. Workers of small OEM enterprises are working in even harsher environments and having more overtime. The root is that they are unable to reach a higher position in the industry chain. Also, there are no effective labor organizations in those factories and the government tends to shield huge companies because of their profits. -- Freestyle-coming
It is biased to blame Apple for everything. The government should supervise the companies and their conduct, not the other way around. It is natural for enterprises to pursue economic profits. But corporate social responsibility needs to be backed up and monitored by regulations and laws. -- ChouzhuDaddy
I'm working with an Apple supplier. We have been learning Apple's philosophy. Among all the Taiwan companies, Foxconn has always been the major company. The problems should be blamed on bad policies and regulations. Businessmen are always chasing profits. Also, companies with more employees tend to have more problems. -- 
I'm very upset after reading this. This is a universal problem, not only Apple's. Apple cannot manage its suppliers to fulfill their suppliers' social responsibilities. This is out of Apple's business control. There's no difference between those workers and the ones suffering serious mental stress. They have to work overtime until midnight as well, though they are sitting in the office. But seriously, it's very uncomfortable to sit in front of a computer all day. -- 
1) It is a pity that, we know that for Apple fans, such a story won't stop their enthusiasm. Just like people are still buying Nike and Adidas shoes, knowing that shoe manufacturing is highly environmentally hazardous; 2) if a government cannot guarantee the welfare of its own 120 million disadvantaged population and even suppresses their appeals, then how could we require an overseas company to protect the labor rights in a Chinese factory? -- Jionglegejiong
If more rigorous labor protection standards and 8-5 working time protocol are being strictly executed, we can expect a plunge of the workers' wages. If labor organizations with monopoly rights are established, those rural migrant workers who cannot find a position in the organization will be forced back to their hopeless villages. Manufacturing costs in China will increase in other ways and therefore harm its competitive advantage. Under such conditions, huge companies and advocates get to harvest their reputation and sense of achievement, but who else will get the real profit? -- YeyeGem
I told some people about the terrible working conditions in the Apple suppliers' factories, and asked how they felt. They said, "We can't do anything about it. That's what cheap labor is about...." People are getting numb to this.... That's horrible. -- 
Working conditions in smaller factories are even worse (than Foxconn). They have even longer work hours. The major reason is that suppliers are not at the top of the value chain and major brands can easily replace them. Also, workers in China do not have labor unions, and the Chinese government always protects the large companies. -- 
When the explosion happened, I was working for media in Chengdu. Domestic media were all silenced and only allowed to use the (Xinhua) official report, because that (Foxconn factory) was a key project. Compare to what The New York Times wrote, the gap really saddened my heart. -- Chen Qiye
Apple is definitely a vampire factory. But if you boycott Apple, what would those workers eat without demand (for Apple products)? By then they would even lose their job! And now the U.S. is planning to move a chunk of manufacturing back to its soil, as manufacturing costs in China are soaring. What would these surplus workers be facing? The profit margin for the entire Chinese manufacturing sector is thin, nobody enjoys high salary and good benefits; yet their work intensity is strong and working conditions are poor. This is common, not only for the manufacturers of Apple! Think first how to change the miserable status quo of a giant manufacturing country! -- Quasi-Economist
If not to buy Apple, what's the substitute - Samsung? Don't you know that Samsung's products are from its OEM factory in Tianjin? Samsung workers' income and benefits are even worse than those at Foxconn. If not to buy iPad - (do you think) I will buy Android Pad? Have you ever been to the OEM factories for Lenovo and ASUS? Quanta,
Compaq ... factories of other companies are all worse than those for Apple. Not to buy iPod - (do you think) I will buy Aigo, Meizu? Do you know that Aigo's Shenzhen factory will not pay their workers until the 19th of the second month? If you were to quit, fine, I'm sorry, your salary will be withdrawn. Foxconn never dares to do such things. First, their profit margin is higher than peers as they manufacture for Apple. Second, at least those foreign devils will regularly audit factories. Domestic brands will never care if workers live or die. I am not speaking for Foxconn. I am just speaking as an insider of this industry, and telling you some disturbing truth. -- Anonymous
If we really seek the ultimate sources and manufacturing conditions of everything we use in our daily life, we might be truly frustrated by the cruelty of the process. It is not fair to transfer the responsibility of the huge companies to the consumers, and to claim that "no purchase, no killings." -- SmilingAssassin1980

HEADLINE: Rubenstein Defends Romney's Tax Rate

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: At the World Economic Forum, David M. Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, said during a debate on the future of capitalism that the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was just following the tax laws. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- It may be small comfort to the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, but he received some moral support at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday from one of his compatriots in the private equity industry.
David M. Rubenstein, co-founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group, said Mr. Romney was just following the tax laws when he paid a rate of 13.9 percent on income of more than $21 million in 2010.
"If you change the law, we'll pay the taxes," Mr. Rubenstein said to scattered applause during a debate at Davos on the future of capitalism. He was referring to a provision of the United States tax code that allowed people in the private equity industry to treat their income as capital gains and pay a lower rate.
Yet Mr. Rubenstein and other participants in a session sponsored by Time magazine said capitalism was under fire in the developed world. China's state capitalism and its success in delivering rapid growth presents a challenge to the classic laissez-faire capitalism of Europe and America, they said.
"State capitalist societies seem to be able to do a better job creating jobs," Mr. Rubenstein said. He added that the jobs "are not the kind of high paying jobs people in the developed world want."
Raghuram G. Rajan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said he doubted that state capitalism would prove a lasting model. "It's very good for catch-up," he said. But the model fails when companies reach the point where they must be innovative to compete. "The big state corporations are miserable at that," Mr. Rajan said.
The debate in Davos seemed particularly relevant amid the controversy about Mr. Romney's tax returns, and after President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, in which he focused on income inequality. It is likely to be one of the themes at Davos, which continues until Sunday.
Mr. Rubenstein and Mr. Rajan agreed that America and Europe had a limited amount of time to build a better system, which among other things would include improved education in the United States. Mr. Rajan said America had about a decade, while Mr. Rubenstein gave it three or four years.
"If we don't do that soon, I think that we've lost the game in competing against emerging-market capitalism or state capitalism," Mr. Rubenstein said.

HIGHLIGHT: A close comparison of the World Economic Forum guest lists of 2011 and 2012 provides something of a chronicle of the scandals, disasters and corporate ousters that have taken place in the last 12 months. 

 BODY:
Earning the coveted white identification badge that grants a select few access to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is tough enough. The last year has demonstrated that it is not easy to keep it either.
Just look at Masataka Shimizu. Mr. Shimizu said last year on the private social network operated by the World Economic Forum that his company, Tokyo Electric Power, sought to provide a "stable supply of electricity and environmental protection."
That was before an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in March, damaging the company's nuclear power facility in Fukushima and unleashing a radiation threat that displaced more than 160,000 people in Japan and could pose risks to the nation's food supply.
Mr. Shimizu, who resigned as chief executive of the power company in May, is just one of many people among the global elite in Davos last year who is not likely to be seen this year in the corridors of the Davos Congress Center or at the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvedere, the prestige party location.
A close comparison of the World Economic Forum guest lists of 2011 and 2012 provides something of a chronicle of the scandals, disasters and corporate ousters that have taken place in the last 12 months.
Was it only a year ago that Prime Minister George A. Papandreou of Greece assured fellow participants that his country was on track to get its debt problems under control? Mr. Papandreou, who resigned in November as a result of his country's sovereign debt crisis, is not expected at Davos this year.
Nor is Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, which runs the British newspaper operations of News Corporation. Ms. Brooks resigned in July after accusations that, while she was editor of the British tabloid News of the World, the publication had intercepted the voice mails of celebrities and of a girl who had been abducted and murdered.
Ms. Brooks, once one of the most powerful people in Britain's news media, has denied knowing at the time about the phone hacking.
And do not expect to find Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former president of the International Monetary Fund and once a Davos mainstay, at the Swiss ski resort this year. Even though a sexual assault case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn was dismissed in New York in August, the scandal cost him a place in the inner circle of people who set global economic policy.
In one sense, the presence of so many newsmakers at Davos -- even fallen ones -- is a testament to the appeal the World Economic Forum annual meeting has for powerful people. That is why the meeting perennially draws intense interest from the news media, despite rarely producing much in the way of concrete news.
But the fate of some of these newsmakers may also feed another common criticism: that Davos provides a venue for a powerful group of people to pose, at times, as more modern and enlightened than they might actually be.
An example in that category might be Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a former World Economic Forum Young Global Leader whose reputation as a westernized reformer vaporized when he vowed on television last year that "rivers of blood" would flow in response to an uprising in Libya against his father, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
In February, the World Economic Forum, the organization in Geneva that organizes the annual meeting in Davos, stripped the younger Mr. Qaddafi of that title.
Mr. Qaddafi "was appointed as a Young Global Leader at a time when it appeared that he represented the potential for a future Libyan government that was more progressive, more concerned for human rights and more open to the possibilities of political reform," David Aikman, head of the Forum of Young Global Leaders, said in a statement at the time.
Losing his Davos privileges is the least of the younger Mr. Qaddafi's worries, of course. He did not attend the Davos forum in early 2011, and his father was overthrown and then killed in October. Mr. Qaddafi was captured by militia leaders in November and now awaits trial.
Every year, the ouster of chief executives contributes to turnover in Davos. The 2011 roster of top executives who lost their jobs, and their Davos badges, includes Leo Apotheker of Hewlett-Packard; Oswald J. Grubel of the Swiss bank UBS; and Hartmut Ostrowski of Bertelsmann, the giant German media concern.
These examples offer cautionary tales for the chief executives converging in Davos this year, though perhaps none so powerful as that offered by Rajat K. Gupta.
Last year, he was listed on the Davos roster as chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, has since been charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. He has pleaded not guilty.
He will not be in Davos this year, either.

HEADLINE: Soros Promotes Crisis Plan for Europe

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: At the World Economic Forum in Davos, the billionaire George Soros said policy makers should work on saving the rest of the euro bloc rather than focusing on Greece. 

 BODY:
The billionaire investor George Soros said on Wednesday that it was possible Greece could be pushed out of the euro zone this year.
"The odds, let's say, are in that direction," Mr. Soros said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Instead of working to keep the country as a member of the single currency, he added, European policy makers ought to focus on saving the rest of the euro bloc.
Recent action by the European Central Bank, which in December moved to provide large amounts of liquidity to the region's banks, have calmed the financial markets for now, he acknowledged. But he said these measures would not be enough to solve the festering sovereign debt problems that have driven up the borrowing costs of weaker euro zone countries. Spain and Italy, he said, remain "dangerously exposed.''
 "It leaves the weaker members of the euro zone relegated to the status of third world countries that became highly indebted in a foreign currency," he said. "Germany is acting as the task master imposing tough fiscal discipline. This will generate both economic and political tensions that could destroy the European Union."
Mr. Soros used the occasion to promote an alternative plan to deal with the euro crisis, as outlined in his new book, "Financial Turmoil in Europe and the United States." 
Under his proposal, the European Central Bank and others, including the European Financial Stability Fund, would act in concert as "lenders of last resort" to governments, a role that the central bank has steadfastly disavowed. Mr. Soros says this would allow Italy and Spain to issue treasury bills at around 1 percent.
The European economy will also need stimulus to get moving again, Mr. Soros said, adding that the cost would have to be shouldered collectively. As such, it will require the issuance of so-called euro bonds under which the debt of euro zone members would be pooled "in one guise or other."
If nothing more is done, and if policy makers continue to mostly pursue austerity measures, the euro zone will fall into a debt-deflation spiral, he said. That, in turn, could prompt widespread social disorder, he added.
"What is happening in Hungary today,'' Mr. Soros said, "is a precursor of what is in store."

HEADLINE: Obama Gives China the Business

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: HONG KONG --- President Obama repeatedly attacked Chinese trade practices in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night in Washington. But with the exception of Myanmar, where Mr. Obama said "a new beginning'' was taking shape, most of the rest of Asia got no mention at all. No Japan, no India and neither Korea. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG --- President Obama repeatedly attacked Chinese trade practices in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night in Washington. But with the exception of Myanmar, where Mr. Obama said "a new beginning'' was taking shape, most of the rest of Asia got no mention at all. No Japan, no India and neither Korea.
"I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China."
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 25, 2012
"The president's rhetoric of years past, which seemed almost to hold China up as a model to inspire greater competitiveness from the U.S., has been replaced with language that reduces China's economic strength to simply unfairness,'' said John Delury, a China expert and professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul. 
"And the President's 'promise' that so long as the playing field is level, 'America will always win,' is not going to go down well among 1.35 billion Chinese.''
There was no immediate pushback from the Chinese government on Wednesday, and the major Chinese newspapers and news agencies offered no quick ripostes. China (and much of the Asia-Pacific region) is still celebrating the long Lunar New Year holiday.
Mr. Obama had already pledged that his administration would put a new emphasis on Asia. in November, he said the region was "a top priority'' and "absolutely critical to America's economic growth.''
"No region will do more to shape our long-term economic future," Mr. Obama said, following a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
He has established an alliance with the Philippines and agreed to deploy 2,500 Marines to Australia. Washington also has moved to upgrade diplomatic relations with Myanmar, which Mr. Obama cited as "a new beginning in Burma.''
Domestic U.S. politics were clearly the subtext to Mr. Obama's China bashing. Republican candidates, especially Mitt Romney, have been battering Mr. Obama over his China policies.
"It will cost President Obama votes if he comes up short on China as a currency manipulator, or in enforcing trade laws," Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, in November. "You can't talk about jobs and the economy without talking about China."
And talk about China he did on Tuesday night. Beijing was made out to be the principal culprit in trade issues, almost predatory in its practices, and Mr. Obama proposed a new trade enforcement agency to curb the alleged abuses.
He said his administration had already brought cases against China "at twice the rate" of the previous administration, claiming the challenges in the World Trade Organization have "made a difference,'' in one instance preserving 1,000 American jobs by stopping "a surge in Chinese tires.''
In September, an appeals panel of the World Trade Organization upheld a 35 percent increase in import taxes on Chinese-made tires. 
Beijing responded to the W.T.O. ruling with new antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs on sport utility vehicles and some other passenger cars from the United States. The tariffs appeared largely symbolic, as my colleague. 
"Still, firing a trade volley at American exports of automobiles, one of the most politically sensitive industries in international trade, can only escalate trade hostilities between China and the United States,'' Keith said.
Mr. Obama also insisted that the United States would "not cede solar, wind or battery industries to China or Germany.''
The Commerce Department is investigating the possible dumping of large-scale wind towers by China and Vietnam, as well as unfair trade practices by Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. 
A report in China Daily last week said the wind-tower producers would "challenge'' the U.S. inquiry, which the newspaper said could lead to "crippling'' import duties.

HEADLINE: Romney Calls Obama 'Detached From Reality'

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: But Mitt Romney did not mention Newt Gingrich in his speech. 

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Mitt Romney called President Obama "detached from reality" on Wednesday, accusing him of saying one thing during his State of the Union speech and doing another during his presidency.
Speaking to a crowd of about 150 employees at a metals-fabrication plant in Central Florida, Mr. Romney mocked Mr. Obama as painting an overly rosy picture of economic health and of pursuing the wrong policies. 
"We've got a president who is detached from reality," Mr. Romney said. "He's detached from the people. He's detached from his own words. His actions are so different from what he says that people are surprised and shocked."
Mr. Romney's attacks on Mr. Obama are part of his campaign's effort to straddle two missions: keeping the pressure on the president, while lashing out at his chief Republican rival, Newt Gingrich.
Mr. Romney did not mention Mr. Gingrich in his morning speech, though he insisted that the country needed a president who was not a lobbyist or a member of Congress - a clear reference to Mr. Gingrich's background.
Mr. Romney's campaign is continuing to flood reporters with e-mails and Web videos about Mr. Gingrich's record. And the campaign's first negative ad - an attack on Mr. Gingrich's ethics - is running in Florida now.
During the appearance, however, Mr. Romney sought to make the case that it was Mr. Obama who did not understand the depth of the economic problems that are confronting residents of Florida.
"As I watched the president speak, I was reminded of his trip to Florida a week ago, when he spoke in Fantasyland," Mr. Romney said, referring to a trip Mr. Obama made to Disney World.
"The detachment between reality and what he says is so extraordinary," Mr. Romney said. "I think it's time to have somebody who says what he means and means what he says."

HEADLINE: The Bully Populist

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Will the president's adoption of rhetorical populism help or hurt his re-election chances? 

 BODY:
By keeping the lowest profile of his presidency, President Obama has enjoyed a relatively successful political season. Since the end of last summer's debt ceiling battle, his approval ratings have gradually ticked up, the economy has improved modestly and his potential rivals for the presidency have bloodied one another in ways that make him look more appealing by comparison.
Unfortunately, the president can't run for re-election by staying out of sight. (Although if the Republicans actually nominate Newt Gingrich, he might be sorely tempted.) Thus the significance of Tuesday night's State of the Union address, which doubled as Obama's re-entrance into the political fray.
The address made plain what has been increasingly obvious for some time. After flirting with the role of the reasonable centrist after his party's defeat in 2010, President Obama has decided to run for re-election as a full-throated liberal populist. There were rhetorical nods to deficit reduction, sensible regulatory reform and the Lincolnian idea that "government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more." But the substance of the speech could be summed up in one word: More.
More spending on education. More spending on infrastructure. More money for green energy projects. More assistance for homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages. More tax breaks for manufacturers - for high-tech manufacturers, for manufacturers who relocate to poor areas, for manufacturers who retrain workers, for manufacturers who don't outsource jobs, for manufacturers who upgrade their buildings O.K., I lost count. And all of it to be paid for, inevitably, by more taxes on the wealthy.
Some of this will be popular. Certainly the unifying theme of the address, the idea that public policy should be crafted with the strongest possible emphasis on fairness for a struggling middle class, will resonate with many millions of Americans who have lost jobs or seen wages stagnate across the last five or ten or twenty years. In a campaign against a Republican Party that too often reduces domestic policy to the quest for upper-bracket tax cuts - and a likely Republican nominee who has spent his entire life inside those brackets - it's easy to see why the White House thinks a populist message will be a winning one.
But there are perils to the president's approach. One is political: The idea of fairness is popular, but the idea of growth is generally more powerful in American elections, and a message that lays so much emphasis on the need to make sure Warren Buffett is paying the highest possible tax rate risks coming across more anti-rich than pro-prosperity.
As William Galston pointed out this week in The New Republic online, polls consistently show that the public is much more concerned about economic opportunity than inequality per se and disinclined to embrace narratives that pit the successful against the poor. In this climate, a populist re-election campaign will have to walk a fine line: As Galston puts it, the president must "address middle class anxieties, but without triggering long-standing middle class fears about redistributive measures that could deepen their plight."
The more serious peril, though, has to do with policy rather than politics. A campaign narrative premised on places this administration on a collision course not just with the Republican Party, but with budgetary arithmetic itself. The Buffett rule will not bring our outlays into line with our revenues. Raising taxes on the richest 1 percent will not cover the projected cost of Medicare and Social Security once the baby boom generation has retired. New spending on energy and education will not pay for itself. And the rhetoric of fairness is not a substitute for a long-term deficit reduction plan, a real blueprint for overhauling the entitlement system, or a comprehensive tax reform - none of which this White House will be offering, apparently, in the 2012 campaign.
Instead, Obama proposed general guidelines for reform, but not reform itself. He endorsed the idea of restructuring our public sector without presenting any details for how to do it. He promised a leaner government without specifying where he'd slide the knife. And if he runs on this platform and wins re-election, he'll have won a mandate for doing little or nothing about the challenges that are likely to define his second term.

HEADLINE: State of the Republicans

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: The drama at the core of the debates. Really. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, I have to apologize. For the last few weeks I was somewhat snarky about my having more faith than you did in the Republican voters being too sane to nominate Newt Gingrich. My confidence in their rationality was, at best, premature.
David Brooks: Actually I found your faith in Republican voters touching. Unjustified, but touching.
To me, this whole race is now about manhood. Newt won South Carolina because he's a bigger Alpha and Republicans want bellicosity, not politeness. Mitt looked soft and in the debates seemed unwilling to fight.
Of course, as one of the callers on Bill Bennett's radio show pointed out, it's an odd thing when a leading Republican candidate has the children of his first wife attacking his second wife for things she said about his third wife and this candidate is the one getting social conservative support. 
Gail: Well, Romney looked pretty bellicose in the first Florida debate Monday night. How do you feel about debates? I got the definite impression that the people of South Carolina who said they thought Gingrich had the best chance to defeat Barack Obama were basing that judgment entirely on his presumed ability to win debates.
And in his sales pitch, that's what Newt stressed: Nominate me and I'll follow Barack Obama around until he agrees to a series of three-hour debates with no moderator. Why he wouldn't want a moderator is beyond me, given how much of his success is based on attacking them.
I don't know about you, but the idea of a three-hour debate makes my head spin. I don't have anywhere near a three-hour attention span for this stuff. And many of the younger voters don't have a three-minute attention span. I wonder how the Lincoln-Douglas debates would have looked if they'd broken them up into 60 YouTube videos.
David: For Newt the only thing better than a three-hour debate is a three-hour soliloquy. In his ideal world, he'd have a six-hour debate, but with himself and all the positions he took five minutes ago.
I actually thought his performance here in Florida Monday night was surprisingly passive, whereas Mitt showed a little testosterone. I wonder if that will hurt Gingrich in the manliness sweepstakes.
Gail: In general, I'm a big fan of debates. Whenever a candidate dodges them, it's a bad sign. Do you think Texas voters should have known something was amiss when Rick Perry refused to do any gubernatorial debates last time around? But they seem to work better in general elections than in the primaries.
Unless, of course, you like to hear snide personal attacks. Which I personally find totally shocking. Totally.
David: It's odd to me the ways in which the Republican debates this year mimic the core drama of the Democratic debates last time. Newt is the fighter and Mitt is the composed transcender. Last time, Hillary was the fighter and Barack was the composed transcender. Barack was able to outlast Hillary because there are just not as many people who put the word "fight" at the center of their political wish list. That might be different after four hard years.
Gail: Also, Obama had deep organization in the obscure caucus states. Which is why I still am pretty sure Romney's going to win.
David: I actually think debates are of only moderate predictive value. Remember the way Kerry beat Bush in all three debates in the general election campaign? Obama was weakest in debates, at least compared to speeches. John McCain was much better at town meetings than debates.
This year they have mattered but in ways bad for the Republican Party. Newt and the debate audiences have whipped each other up into a pep rally fury, which believe me, will lead to a sad ending somewhere down the road.
Gail: The South Carolina voters really just seemed to be looking for somebody who would expose Barack Obama as the socialist evildoer they believe him to be. Do you think they factored in the personality issue? Really, the president generally manages to come across as pretty likable, even when he's announcing a new series of air strikes. And Newt can be pretty off-putting even when he's explaining that he loves his grandchildren.
David: I think Europe is going to be a big issue this year. This country is treading water economically (rather than drowning) because over the decades the Republicans saved us from making all the mistakes the Europeans have made. Nonetheless, the idea that Obama is a socialist is wacko.
That said, when French banks go kablooie later this year, Obama will be the one to suffer.
Gail: Does it worry you that the Republican voters now appear to be working under the assumption that what this country needs to lead it in this time of trouble is a good debater? I guess it could be worse. Nobody suggested we need a good marathoner. Or a good speller. Or a good columnist.
David: I am. Why don't we throw our hats in the ring? There's this thing called Americans Elect. They've got open slots on all 50 state ballots. They are looking for a ticket with one Democrat and one Republican. I say we go for it. I'll let you be president and I'll be vice president. Think of all the cool motorcades.

HEADLINE: The Essence of Obamanomics

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The president sees Washington as the savior of American capitalism. 

 BODY:
Even the liberal Matt Yglesias was exhausted by the president's paean to industrial policy in last night's speech, calling it "a strikingly retrograde, self-contradictory, and confused agenda of reviving American prosperity through mercantilism." He goes on:
... People lose jobs because of shifts in global trade patterns, because of new technologies, and because of macroeconomic currents beyond their control. This is the nature of a dynamic capitalist economy, and to acknowledge it and the need for government countermeasures is in no way to repudiate the considerable virtues of the system.
Instead, Obama wants to shelter American industry from competition abroad. He notes that his administration has "brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration" and promises to rejigger the tax code to reward or punish firms based on where they locate jobs.
This line of thinking swiftly stumbles into self-contradiction. After lambasting companies that "ship jobs overseas," Obama launched into a feel-good anecdote about how "Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College." Is a politician in Germany giving a speech lambasting Siemens for shipping jobs to the U.S. and complaining, as Obama did, that it's "not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized," perhaps through partnerships with community colleges? .... Later, Obama pledged to support "every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs," perhaps making him the only person in America who didn't read the story over the weekend about how Apple's products are all built in Asia.
I would only add that this vision of a benevolent government protecting American industry from the vicissitudes of the global marketplace is entirely characteristic of this presidency, which has been much less anti- than some conservatives believe, but much less pro- than its defenders are sometimes willing to allow.
I wrote about this almost two years ago now, in the context of an interview President Obama gave to BusinessWeek on the lessons of 1980s, and I think the argument I made then holds up. Like many on the right (myself included), the president regards the Reagan era as a moment when American businesses adjusted relatively successfully to a new wave of competition from abroad. But he seems to have a rather different interpretation of how and why this adjustment happened:
It's not, as conservatives would have it, that only the discipline imposed by a competitive marketplace can make bloated, sclerotic industries more innovative and efficient. Rather, the lesson [the president draws] seems to be that sometimes you need to give an inefficient industry a shove in the right direction, and that the government can be just as good at shoving as the market. In the '80s, it was Japan lighting a fire under American businesses; in the 21st century, it's going to be the Obama White House that does it.
Thus Obama's promiscuous use of the word "we" when he talks about the future of the American economy. "We" will introduce greater productivity to the health care system. "We" will transform our energy sector into a clean, green growth machine. "We" will rebuild the American auto industry, and put it on a firm footing for years to come. "We" will double American exports. And thus, too his understandable outrage at the complaint that he's been anti-business. Hasn't his White House propped up financial firms and bailed out auto manufacterers? Hasn't he worked closely with drug manufacturers and energy companies? Doesn't his health care plan keep private insurers in business? Aren't stimulus dollars flowing to firms around the country? Don't people understand that he's only trying to help?
Last night's forays into mercantilism left much the same impression - that this president sees his administration as the savior of American enterprise, which would otherwise be outcompeted, out-innovated and ultimately outsourced. And assuming that he's up against Mitt Romney, whose entire career makes him the natural embodiment of a rather different vision of what drives American prosperity, this clash of visions could make for the most interesting intellectual contrast of what promises to be a less-than-scintillating fall campaign.

HEADLINE: How Obama's Tough Talk Plays in China

BYLINE: MICHAEL WINES


HIGHLIGHT: Chinese officials know that the president must address his opponents' claims that he has failed to stand up to Beijing, but that does not mean that they like it. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - President Obama took a new swipe at China's economic policies in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, and leaders here are unlikely to be surprised. China's rulers know that Mr. Obama faces a tough re-election battle, and they know that he must address his opponents' repeated claims that he has failed to stand up to Beijing.
But that does not mean that they like it. Under Mr. Obama, America-watchers here say, the White House has swung from being too accommodating to too tough, from looking weak to putting on an unneeded show of strength. 
On Tuesday night, in addition to highlighting trade cases he had brought against China, the president went further, announcing "the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China."
China's leadership respects the president, those following Chinese-American relations here say, and appreciates the difficulties Washington faces on almost every front. But analysts say the Chinese find very little constancy in the relationship, and that unsettles them. Ratcheting up American talk toward China another notch, they say, may just reinforce that.
"President Bush gave Chinese leaders a feeling of reliability," Shi Yinhong, who directs the Center on American Relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said this week.. "If Bush changed his mind towards China, he could do things without too many turn-downs. But President Obama seems to give the Chinese a feeling that he is too disposed to change. He's giving leaders the image that he's not so reliable in playing by the rules."

Shen Dingli, who heads the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, summed up the Chinese view of Mr. Obama's diplomacy in a phrase: "kind of unstable."
Of course, Mr. Obama might say the same of Beijing. China shunned Mr. Obama's early effort to enlist it as a partner in addressing global problems, then plunged relations into a deep chill over American arms sales to Taiwan, and now has tacked toward cooperation. The White House's toughness on both economic and military matters is based in part on a new realism about what can be achieved with the current Chinese leadership.
 But the view from here is that China's efforts in the last two years to put ties on a better footing have been reciprocated with greater pressure on its trade and currency policies, a shift of still more military assets to the west Pacific, an effort to reassert influence over China's neighbors and - not least - more meddling in what China considers its most sensitive interests.
"The U.S. selling weapons to Taiwan over the last three years: two batches, which is unprecedented," Mr Shen said. "Meeting with the Dalai Lama two times in three years, which is unprecedented."
Mr. Shen said he believes the two nations have in fact cemented some important relationships, including a much-broadened annual dialogue on strategic and economic issues that sets a framework for everything else. And Mr, Obama and President Hu Jintao do share one common realization: that no matter how rocky things get, a true rupture in relations would be disastrous for both nations. Their economies are simply too intertwined to unravel, and their competing global interests too sprawling to allow a rivalry to spin out of control.
But Mr. Obama's latest tough moves leave rulers unclear about the president's true intentions, he said. And they raise the hackles of certain segments of China's elite, such as the military and its political right wing, that are hard to ignore in a leadership that governs by consensus.
Then again, Beijing may look at the alternative next November - a Republican president whose party wants still tougher China policies - and consider that, well, things aren't so bad after all.
Mitt Romney, in his response to Mr. Obama's address, was if anything tougher.
"Chinese leaders are hoping that the actions and words from Washington are meant for the political campaign within the country," Mr. Shen said, "because Obama seems to have to catch up with the Republicans."

HEADLINE: Obama Embarks on Five-State Tour

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: Echoing his State of the Union speech, President Obama visits five politically crucial states. 

 BODY:
PHOENIX-Fresh from a State of the Union speech he used to make his case for re-election, President Obama took to the road on Wednesday to build support for his economic message of fairness, calling for Congress to eliminate tax deductions for companies that move jobs overseas.
"If you're a company that wants to outsource jobs or do business around the world, that's your right," Mr. Obama told an audience at a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, conveyer-belt maker. "But you shouldn't get tax breaks for it."
Instead, the president is proposing that the Congress instead give tax breaks to companies that hire more American workers at home, or "insource"-a new term the administration has adopted of late.
"It's become more expensive to do business in places like China," Mr. Obama said. "Meanwhile, America is getting more productive." So for many companies, he said, it is starting to make more sense to bring jobs back home.
"We have to seize this opportunity," Mr. Obama said. "And it starts with changing our tax code."
Despite the White House push, the reality is this is an election year for a deeply divided Congress that has shown itself barely able to take care of routine business, so the chances of Mr. Obama's tax code proposal getting through this Congress is remote, at best.
But Mr. Obama is nonetheless borrowing a page out of his playbook from last fall, when he unveiled his jobs proposal in another address before a joint session of Congress, and then went around the country assailing the Republicans in Congress for not passing it. That tactic helped drive down approval ratings for lawmakers.
From the looks of their response, Republicans apparently plan to stick to their same playbook of last fall as well: bashing the president and his proposals.
"While it's an exciting event any time the president of the United States comes to town, Iowans don't need a president concerned about hitting the campaign trail, giving speeches and rehashed promises, just to save his own job," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. "They need one who's actually concerned about their job."
Despite the opposition's criticisms, Mr. Obama's backers say the president can credibly make the argument that even in an election year, he is out there fighting for American jobs. The White House on Wednesday rolled out a series of proposals meant to increase manufacturing jobs in the country.
Mr. Obama's proposal would require American companies to pay a minimum tax on their overseas profits, in order to stop other countries from using their low tax rates to attract American businesses. Mr. Obama is also calling for Congress to eliminate tax deductions that companies get for the cost of shutting down factories, laying off workers, and moving production overseas.
And he is proposing creating a new tax credit for moving expenses for companies that reverse the trend and move jobs back to the United States.
After Iowa, Mr. Obama was heading to Phoenix, the next stop in his three-day tour. He is also slated to go to Las Vegas, Denver and Detroit, in a trip that will manage to cover five politically crucial states.

HEADLINE: The United States of Numeracy: The Math of a Presidential Campaign

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Ten suggestions for looking at the campaign season through an arithmetical lens, using New York Times resources. 

 BODY:
A presidential race is a gift to American history and civics classes. But it's also rife with learning opportunities for math students, too. 
Here are 10 suggestions for looking at the campaign season through an arithmetical lens, using New York Times resources.
1. Track and Analyze the Primaries
Track and analyze the Republican primaries using the Republican Delegate Counter. See how the remaining candidates measure up in terms of allocated delegates and how many more they need to claim the Republican presidential nomination.
Scan the primary schedule to find the dates of coming primaries and to see how many delegates are at stake. Use primary projections from the FiveThirtyEight blog, like the one for the Florida primary, to make predictions about who will win coming contests and, ultimately, the nomination. Advanced mathematicians might create a blog modeled on Nate Silver's, developing their own projections for each state's primary. 
2. Explore Voting Patterns
How do the candidates fare among voters of varying age, race and economic status? Check out the exit polls from the Republican primaries, like the one from South Carolina, to compare and contrast the appeal of the candidates among various demographic groups. 
What issues matter most to primary voters? Do Tea Party supporters favor Newt Gingrich over Mitt Romney? Why does Ron Paul appear to do well with voters ages 18 to 29? Collect data across primaries and use it to build portfolios of the various candidates. Use your assessments to make predictions about future elections.
Compare the primary results with historical voter data from past presidential elections and Senate races. And use the "Electoral Explorer" to produce meaningful visualizations of how Americans in all categories voted in the 2008 presidential election.
3. Fact-Check the Candidates
Did Mr. Gingrich really help create 27 million jobs? Have "more people been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any other president in United States history"? Is President Obama a job destroyer? Investigate some of the quantitative claims made by the candidates in their speeches and in their ads. And track real-time fact-checking of the Republican debates.
4. Follow the Money
Use the interactive feature on campaign finance to explore the role of money in politics. Find out who has raised the most financing, and keep tabs on the candidates as the election season progresses. Investigate questions like "Is there a correlation between campaign donations and poll numbers?" and "Which candidates get the most votes per dollar spent?" 
Explore the many ways supporters can get cash into the coffers of their candidates and aligned organizations with the interactive guide to political donations. Stay on top of the "super PAC" spending on a week-to-week basis with this independent spending tracker. 
5. Map the Road to the White House
Explore the mathematics of the electoral college by creating winning paths to the White House. Start with the interactive feature on the electoral map. Explore basic questions like "Which states have the most electoral votes, and which have the fewest?" and "What is the fewest number of states a candidate could win to become president?"
Use the "Your Map" feature to assign states' electoral votes as you wish, and figure out different combinations that add up to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Using population data about the states, investigate more complex questions like "Theoretically, what is the smallest percentage of the United States population a candidate could represent in winning the necessary 270 electoral votes?"
6. Swing State Summaries
Take a deeper look at the data from so-called battleground states like Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and project how those states might go in the upcoming presidential election. 
Use interactive historical election results like those from the 2008 presidential race and 2010 Senate race to look for trends in voter preference. Compare this data with the latest polls from the FiveThirtyEight blog to see how current voter sentiment fits with historical trends, and explore the quantitative consequences for the candidates if these states swing their way, or to their opponent.
Also, investigate how the shifting U.S. state populations can change the equations of elections through the reallocation of house seats and, therefore, electoral votes. How many electoral votes has Florida gained because of population growth? How many has Michigan lost? How might these changes affect campaign strategies?
7. The Right to Vote
Laws that require registered voters to present photo identification or disqualify college-issued cards as a valid form of identification tend to disproportionately affect youth and minority voters. Using the Electoral Explorer, identify areas of the country with high minority populations and explore the impact that lower voter turnout in those areas could have on a national election.
Redistricting also affects election outcomes. Read about recent redistricting attempts in Texas and take a look at the accompanying map. Explore how redistricting could reshape the political geography of your community by using the interactive 2010 United States census map to examine local and regional demographic distributions. 
And check out the conversation about voter turnout and the concept of mandatory voting on the Room for Debate blog.
8. Become a Pollster
As the presidential election nears, take regular polls in your school or community. Are the results consistent with those of regional and national polls? Check out polls like the entrance poll from the Iowa caucus to get ideas for other questions to include in your poll, and use those answers to help interpret your polling data.
Check out Nate Silver's article about the importance of understanding how polls are conducted, and take a closer look at some of the most cited national polls. Are those polls statistically sound?
9. The Traveling Politician Problem
In one Campaign Stops blog post, William Cook, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at Georgia Tech, explores the "traveling politician" as a real-world example of the "traveling salesman" problem, a classic, unsolved mathematical challenge that essentially asks "How can one determine the most efficient way to visit a number of cities?"
Read Prof. Cook's solution to the traveling politician problem and pose and investigate your own version. Which cities in your area would a candidate visit? How many different ways could the candidate arrange to make all those stops? Which route would be the most efficient? And what's the strategy for finding the most efficient route?
10. Taxation and Representation
Take a look at the details of the Republican candidates' tax plans. What are the candidates' positions on issues like the Bush-Era tax cuts, the estate tax, the payroll tax cut and corporate taxes? What are the economic ramifications of these policies on Americans?
Consider how Mitt Romney qualifies for a lower tax rate than most middle-class taxpayers because much of his income comes from capital gains instead of wages. Take a look at the Romneys' tax returns and, perhaps using our lesson on understanding income tax forms, give the candidate an audit. 
You can do the same exercise for Newt and Callista Gingrich and the president and first lady.

HEADLINE: Romney's Tax Bill, European Style

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY and TOM REDBURN


HIGHLIGHT: Estimating how much more in taxes Mitt Romney's income would have incurred in France, Germany and Britain - the heart of what he calls "the European-style welfare state." 

 BODY:
5:46 p.m. | Updated 
PARIS - Perhaps it's no surprise that the Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich have been so vociferous in warning against what they deride as President Obama's efforts to turn the United States, as Mr. Romney put it, ''into a European-style welfare state and have government take from some to give to others.''
Because one thing is for sure: if they lived in Europe, they'd be paying more taxes. 
We spoke with tax experts in Germany, France and Britain about how much tax they would expect a citizen of their countries to pay on an income similar to Mr. Romney's. The short answer is, millions more.
None of our tax advisers, all of whom deal with wealthy clients, wanted to be identified, and they cautioned that there was no way to give more than a ballpark estimate without studying Mr. Romney's tax forms in more detail themselves. 
But for the sake of a simple comparison, let's start with France, which has a top income tax rate of 48 percent, and a capital gains tax rate of 19 percent. (All income is also subject to a 13.5 percent social security tax that helps to pay for things like pensions, unemployment insurance and health care; in the United States, by comparison, the top ordinary income rate is 35 percent and the capital gains rate is 15 percent. Only the relatively small Medicare tax is applied to all earned income, while in 2010 and 2011 Social Security tax applied to only the first $106,800 of wage and salary income.)
In Paris, the hypothetical M. Romney's effective tax rate would probably have been in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 percent, including the social security tax. While much of his income derived from capital gains, his dividends, interest and income from his private-equity holdings would mostly be taxed at ordinary income rates. At 40 percent, his bill would have been about $8.6 million. (France also gives generous tax credits for large families, but M. Romney's five children are all adults now, so that would not be of much use.)
In the United States, Mr. Romney paid $3 million in income taxes on his 2010 income of $21.6 million, for an effective rate of 13.9 percent. His Social Security and Medicare tax bills would have been trivial by comparison.
In Britain, income tax rates top out at 50 percent. But most likely, a top London tax lawyer told us, the effective rate would be significantly lower, since Mr. Romney's income from capital gains would have been taxed at 18 percent to 28 percent. 
So, he said, an educated guess would produce an effective tax rate for Mr. Romney of ''probably 30s rather than 40s.'' At 35 percent, the tax on Sir Mitt's $21.6 million would add up to about $7.6 million.
In Germany, high-earning workers pay individual income tax rates of up to 45 percent, though our adviser - a lawyer in Frankfurt with a top international firm - noted that an additional ''solidarity surcharge'' is tacked on top of that for an effective top rate of 47 percent. Mr. Romney, however, would benefit from the lower rate applied to private capital investments: 25 percent, with the solidarity surcharge bringing it up to about 26.4 percent. With most, but not all, of his income treated as capital gains, Herr Romney would probably pay about 30 percent, or $6.5 million. 
As for Mr. Gingrich, who paid 32 percent in federal income tax on his $3.14 million in income, he would face mostly ordinary income tax rates in Europe, so he would probably have to fork over about 40 percent of his income if he lived in one of the major European countries. 
Of course, many wealthy people find ways to avoid the tax collector (legally and illegally), even in the dreaded European welfare states. Just ask officials in Greece and Italy. 
In fact, Mr. Romney may even have competition: Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the L'Oreal fortune and the richest person in France, made headlines last year with reports that she paid only about 4 percent in taxes on an income of nearly 250 million euros, or $324 million. 
After the uproar, Ms. Bettencourt and some other members of the French wealthy elite took a page from Warren Buffett's book, and asked the government to raise their taxes.
An earlier version of this post misstated Liliane Bettencourt's reported annual income. It was in the hundreds of millions of euros, not hundreds of billions.

HEADLINE: Polls: Before and After South Carolina

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: A Quinnipiac poll of likely primary voters in Florida shows gains for Newt Gingrich over Mitt Romney after last Saturday's contest. 

 BODY:
Two Florida polls released on Wednesday offer a clearer snapshot of how Newt Gingrich's upset victory in South Carolina is swaying the state's likely primary voters, as Mr. Gingrich pulls even with Mitt Romney. 
A CNN/Time/ORC poll of likely voters conducted in the three days after Saturday's South Carolina contest shows Mr. Romney with 36 percent support and Mr. Gingrich with 34 percent. Rick Santorum followed with 11 percent, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas had 9 percent.
In less than two months, Mr. Romney's and Mr. Gingrich's numbers have flip-flopped more than once. In a Time/CNN poll conducted Jan. 13-17 before the South Carolina primary, 43 percent supported Mr. Romney and 18 percent went for Mr. Gingrich. A little more than a month before that, Mr. Gingrich was leading in Florida by 23 points. 
But as it's been noted throughout this volatile primary season, voters seem quick to change their minds. In this poll, a quarter said they still might change their mind before Tuesday's election. 
Another survey released on Wednesday offers an immediate "before-and-after" picture of Mr. Gingrich's victory on Saturday. The Quinnipiac University poll of Florida's likely primary voters shows that Mr. Romney's 12-point lead in the state has nearly evaporated. 
The survey, conducted from last Thursday through Monday, indicated that support for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is holding steady at 36 percent. And Mr. Gingrich's standing rose to 34 percent, up 10 points from a Quinnipiac poll in early January. 
But the numbers shift when looking at the views of voters who responded to the survey on Sunday and Monday, after Saturday's contest. In those two days, Mr. Gingrich's support rose to 40 percent, while Mr. Romney's stayed nearly the same. 
There are other interesting findings in the latest Quinnipiac poll: Over the course of the five-day poll, Mr. Romney held an advantage among voters on two very important issues: electability and who can best fix the economy. Nearly half of the voters said Mr. Romney would do the best job of dealing with the economy and is best able to defeat President Obama in the general election. 
But again, when the results are split the picture is slightly different: Among those polled after Saturday's Gingrich win, 42 percent said he had the best chance of defeating the president, drawing even with Mr. Romney on that question. 
That was a striking contrast to sentiments expressed before the South Carolina primary, when only 26 percent of Florida voters chose Mr. Gingrich as the best candidate to defeat Mr. Obama. Mr. Gingrich surprised many on Saturday night, when exit polls showed for the first time that his electability numbers were much higher than Mr. Romney's. 
Floridians were divided over what mattered most in their candidate choice, with 52 percent wanting someone who can defeat the president, and 44 percent saying someone who shares their values. About 3 in 10 voters said Mr. Romney or Mr. Santorum share their values, compared to 2 in 10 for Mr. Gingrich. 
Mr. Gingrich fared better than Mr. Romney on a range of other characteristics and issues that Florida's primary voters consider important: foreign policy, knowledge and experience, crisis handling, and being a strong leader. 
And nearly half of Florida primary votes now find Mr. Gingrich to be the most "inspiring" candidate, a likely factor in his ability to draw crowds at campaign events. Before his victory Saturday, 3 in 10 saw him that way. 
In the overall Quinnipiac poll, Mr. Santorum received 13 percent to 10 percent for Mr. Paul. 
Keep in mind that nearly 4 in 10 voters say they may still change their minds before Tuesday's election. With another debate on Thursday evening and the Florida airwaves saturated with campaign coverage and attack ads, the race remains very fluid. 
These are the first two polls since the South Carolina contest that have been released and involve live telephone interviews of a cross-section of Florida residents that include a cell phone sample. 
The Quinnipiac telephone poll of 601 likely Republican primary voters in Florida has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points for the entire survey, and of plus or minus 5 percentage points for the 347 voters surveyed in the final two days after South Carolina's results. 
The CNN/Time/ORC telephone poll was conducted from Jan. 22-24 among 369 likely Republican primary voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.

HEADLINE: A Frosty Meeting for Obama and Arizona Governor

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: As President Obama arrived in Arizona, he appeared to have an intense exchange with Gov. Jan Brewer. He was "disturbed" about her book, she said. 

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- President Obama's visit to Phoenix got off to a rough start on Wednesday afternoon when Air Force One was met by Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona - she of the book "Scorpions for Breakfast," in which she accuses the Obama administration of turning a blind eye to illegal immigration because migrants will help Mr. Obama register more Democratic votes.
Mr. Obama stepped off the plane and was greeted by Ms. Brewer, who handed him a handwritten letter in an envelope that she later said was an invitation to discuss the "Arizona comeback." The two had an intense exchange for several minutes; at one point Ms. Brewer pointed her finger at Mr. Obama.
Afterward, she told reporters that Mr. Obama "was a little disturbed about my book."
"I said to him that I have all the respect in the world for the office of the president," she said. "The book is what the book is. I asked him if he read the book. He said he read the excerpt. So."
At one point, the two seemed to be talking at the same time, seemingly over each other. Mr. Obama appeared to walk away from Ms. Brewer while she was still talking.
Asked what aspect of the book disturbed him, Ms. Brewer said: "That he didn't feel that I had treated him cordially. I said I was sorry he felt that way but I didn't get my sentence finished. Anyway, we're glad he's here. I'll regroup."
A White House official, pressed to explain the encounter, had this to say: "The governor handed the president a letter and said she was inviting him to meet with her. The president said he'd be glad to meet with her again, but did note that after their last meeting, a cordial discussion in the Oval Office, the governor inaccurately described the meeting in her book. The president looks forward to continuing taking steps to help Arizona's economy grow."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: One More Debate

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney traded jabs over immigration on Wednesday in Florida, as the Republican presidential candidates made their pitches to the state's huge bloc of Hispanic voters, Michael D. Shear and Trip Gabriel report. The candidates will meet tonight in Jacksonville, Fla., for their last debate before the primary on Tuesday. The face-off will be the 19th in the Republican contest.
Michael D. Shear takes note of the resurgence of "mean" Mitt Romney as the former governor tries to convince Republican voters in Florida that he is a better choice for the party's presidential nomination than Newt Gingrich, with whom recent polls show him to be tied.
For all Democrats' arguments about the need to raise taxes on the superrich like Mitt Romney, Congress -- in the hands of Republicans or Democrats --has not made a serious attempt in recent years to address the true reasons that Mr. Romney and others pay so little in taxes, Jonathan Weisman and Annie Lowrey report.
President Obama on Wednesday took his economic message on the road to Iowa and Arizona, ignoring the dim prospects in Washington that a divided Congress will act on his proposals, Helene Cooper reports. Over the next several days, the president is scheduled to go to Las Vegas, Denver and Detroit, in a trip that will cover politically crucial states.
Amid the political overtones of Mr. Obama's State of the Union speech was a theme that he has sounded since the earliest days of his political career, a belief that government and citizens are jointly responsible for the common good, Jackie Calmes writes.
Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived an assassination attempt last year, handed in her resignation letter on Wednesday in an emotional farewell, Robert Pear writes. Ms. Giffords resigned to focus on her recovery.
Today in Washington:
The Senate is expected to take up and reject a House-passed resolution that would deny President Obama the authority to raise the federal debt ceiling and borrow another $1.2 trillion. This is the last automatic increase allowed under the debt-ceiling deal reached in August. The next increase, expected after the November election, will require the approval of Congress.
At their issues retreat in Maryland, House Democrats on Thursday will discuss jobs and the economy, with guests such as former Gov. Edward Rendell of Pennsylvania; Commerce Secretary John Bryson; and Karen Mills, the head of the Small Business Administration.
Economic reports expected today include weekly unemployment claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by new home sales and leading indicators for December, and weekly mortgage rates.

HEADLINE: States' Drive to Collect Taxes on Internet Sales Is a Blow to Marketers

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
On a dreary day last April, Tim Storm, the founder of FatWallet, and his 54 employees formed a convoy of some 30 cars, three moving trucks and a trailer laden with two fiberglass cows (one purple, one black), and drove five miles north from their old corporate home in Rockton, Ill.. to the new FatWallet headquarters in Beloit, Wis.
The move certainly seemed to be an odd business decision: it cost $100,000, and the company left behind a $5 million, three-year-old, custom-built office building in Rockton, whose maintenance would continue to cost $30,000 a month until it finds a tenant. But Mr. Storm felt he had to do it for his business to survive.
One of the country's biggest bargain hunter Web sites, FatWallet publishes coupons and deals from about 1,000 companies that range from small shops like PennyWise.biz to retail giants like Amazon. Since 2005, the company has acted as the middleman in more than $1.2 billion in Internet sales. (It says its own revenue was $12 million in 2010.) 
But last March, Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois signed House Bill 3659, a so-called affiliate nexus tax that would require out-of-state retailers that advertise through Illinois-based Internet marketing ''affiliates'' like FatWallet to collect and remit Illinois sales tax.
Mr. Storm, 43, calculated that he had until last April 15 to move his business or risk losing as much as 40 percent of his revenue when big Internet retailers like Amazon.com and Overstock.com would cut off FatWallet to avoid the expense and irritation of handling Illinois sales tax. ''We didn't really have a choice about relocating the business,'' Mr. Storm said. ''It was relocate or become irrelevant.''
It is hardly surprising that states are taking it upon themselves to increase their sales tax income. Residents are supposed to declare and pay sales tax on goods they buy from out-of-state retailers, but few do, which deprives states of tax revenue and gives Internet retailers an advantage over physical stores. California hoped to collect some $200 million the first year after passing an affiliate nexus tax, and the large brick-and-mortar retailers that support nexus bills hope that the bills will level the playing field with Internet competitors.
But these laws have collateral damage. Caught in the crossfire of the nationwide fight -- New York and other states have also passed nexus laws -- are a large but rarely examined part of the Internet economy, affiliate marketers.
These third-party Web sites, which contract with retailers to advertise their wares, come in many forms. There are coupon clearinghouses with multimillion-dollar revenues, like FatWallet and Ebates, which some online shoppers visit religiously to track down daily bargains, and there are tiny mom-and-pop blogs that run affiliate marketing ads related to their content -- a pet blog, for example, might carry advertising for pet shops.
The advertisements the affiliates run contain embedded codes indicating which affiliate is sending traffic to the retailer, and when a click leads to a sale, the affiliate receives a commission. According to a report from Forrester Research, spending on affiliate marketing is expected to rise to $4 billion in 2014, from $1.9 billion in 2009. Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, a retail consulting firm and software company in Morrisville, N.C., said that about 5 percent of all Internet commerce runs through affiliate marketers.
The field is not without controversy. Some affiliates have been caught rigging the system by posting fake ads or buying Web ads that purport to be directly from the retailers they are advertising. And retailers often wonder if the sales they get from affiliates are sales they would have gotten even without them.
Mr. Wingo notes that his retail clients say that only about 5 percent of affiliate marketers have sites with content that adds value and increases sales. ''Many retailers are decreasing the number of affiliates,'' Mr. Wingo said. ''There's a lot of fraud. And some create channel conflict. They may buy search terms and compete with you.''
Still, that 5 percent constitutes a hardy industry, and while it is impossible to know exactly how many affiliate marketers and other businesses have been affected by the nexus laws, it is clear that the fight has had an impact.
Year-over-year revenue growth for affiliate marketing at ValueClick, the parent company of Commission Junction, one of the giant middlemen that manage transactions between hundreds of retailers and their affiliates, fell to 9 percent from 17 percent from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2011 in large part because of the California nexus law, according to Colin Sebastian, a stock analyst who covers ValueClick for Robert W. Baird & Company.
Thousands of marketers in the affected states have been cut off by Amazon and other retailers. Others, like FatWallet, have had to move.
But the big losers of this battle are small affiliates that cannot afford to move, many of them one- or two-person shops that support a family. Each time a state passes a nexus law, said Scott Allan, vice president for marketing at LinkShare, another of the companies that serve as middlemen between retailers and affiliate marketers, retailers sever relations with thousands of affiliates to avoid having to collect sales tax.
Mr. Wingo of ChannelAdvisor said, ''It shows the huge gap behind the government thinking and small-business thinking.''
When Gov. Jerry Brown of California signed nexus tax legislation into law last June, Amazon terminated its relationship with some 10,000 California affiliates. One of them was MyBargainBuddy.com, a 12-year-old affiliate-marketing-based shopping portal based in Murrieta, Calif., owned by Karen Hoxmeier, 38. As a result, more than 60 percent of the 3,000 or so retailers whose products Ms. Hoxmeier advertised decided to drop her, leaving Ms. Hoxmeier to post links only to the small group of retailers with physical stores or other operations in the state. ''My sales immediately went down by about 50 percent,'' she said.
In Colorado, Invisible Shoes, a two-year-old maker of huarache-style running sandals based in Boulder, lost out two ways in a similar sales tax battle. Because of a Colorado nexus law passed in 2010, Amazon canceled the company's affiliate account, which meant Invisible Shoes could not run affiliate advertising for the third-party products like books and creams that it sold to its shoe customers. That cost Invisible Shoes several thousand dollars a month, said Steven Sashen, its founder and chief executive. But the law's larger effect was to stifle the company's growth plans.
Mr. Sashen, who expects the company to surpass $1 million in sales this year, had created an in-store kiosk that would allow shoppers to custom-design running sandals inside client stores. That way the client stores could offer custom shoes without carrying inventory. But Mr. Sashen's accountant told him that the kiosk would constitute a nexus that could force Invisible Shoes to collect and pay sales tax in states where it had client stores.
''Given the size of our company, the accounting cost alone makes this prohibitive,'' said Mr. Sashen, 49, who shelved the kiosk plans. ''It's not collecting sales tax that's the hard part; paying taxes in the jurisdictions is an accounting nightmare.''
National legislation could save affiliate marketers and retailers like Mr. Sashen. Twenty-four states have signed on to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, a plan to simplify sales taxes. Congress is currently considering three federal bills that would give states that simplify their sales tax systems the right to make out-of-state retailers collect taxes.
While the national bills are far from becoming law, affiliate marketers are breathing a little easier, at least in California. Since September, when Governor Brown signed a compromise law that gave Internet retailers a one-year reprieve on sales tax collection, Ms. Hoxmeier's MyBargainBuddy site has bounced back to 2,500 advertisers.

HEADLINE: Fed Vows to Keep Rates Near Zero Until Late 2014

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, declaring that the economy would need help for years to come, said Wednesday it would extend by 18 months the period that it plans to hold down interest rates in an effort to spur growth.
The Fed said that it now planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, continuing the transformation of a policy that began as shock therapy in the winter of 2008 into a six-year campaign to increase spending by rewarding borrowers and punishing savers.
The economy expanded ''moderately'' in recent weeks, the Fed said in a statement released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, but jobs were still scarce, the housing sector remained deeply depressed and Europe's flirtation with crisis could undermine the nascent domestic recovery.
The Fed forecast growth of up to 2.7 percent this year, up to 3.2 percent next year and up to 4 percent in 2014, but at the end of that period, the central bank projected that the recovery would still be incomplete. Workers would still be looking for jobs, and businesses would still be looking for customers. 
''What did we learn today? Things are bad, and they're not improving at the rate that they want them to improve,'' said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC. ''That's what they concluded -- 'We've eased policy a lot, but we haven't eased it enough.' ''
The economic impact of the low-interest rate extension, however, is likely to be modest. Many businesses and consumers can't qualify for loans, a problem the Fed's efforts do not address. Moreover, long-term rates already are at record low levels and, like pushing on a spring, the going gets harder as it nears the floor. Finally, the Fed already was widely expected by investors to hold rates near zero well into 2014, limiting the benefits of a formal announcement.
''I wouldn't overstate the Fed's ability to massively change expectations through its statements,'' the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a press conference Wednesday after the announcement. ''It's important for us to say what we think and it's important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to help the economy recover from its currently underutilized condition.''
The Fed's plans for interest rates were unveiled amid a barrage of statements the central bank released Wednesday as part of its campaign to improve its transparency. And while it pleased some investors in the markets, it left others befuddled. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down in the morning, began rising steadily after the Fed released its statement at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. The Dow finished the day up 81.21 points at 12,756.96.
First came the Fed's traditional statement, released after each meeting of its policy-making committee, which said that the central bank intended to hold short-term rates near zero ''at least through late 2014.''
Ninety minutes later, the Fed published for the first time the predictions of the committee's members on when they would raise interest rates. It showed that 11 of the 17 members expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of 2014. Taken together, the documents suggested that the Fed expected to keep rates near zero until late 2014, but probably not any longer than that.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, the Fed has alternated bursts of activity with periods of rest, concluding several times that it had done enough only to find the economy still struggling to recover. The Fed announced last summer that the central bank intended to keep interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and that it would seek to reduce long-term interest rates through changes in the kinds of investment securities it holds. Since then, two meetings had passed without the introduction of any new programs.
The Fed's latest action came after a run of better-than-expected economic data, suggesting to some analysts that the pace of growth might begin to rise without any further help. The Fed also is under relentless assault from Republican presidential candidates who have said that its policies are doing little good and will eventually spur inflation.
And there is growing criticism that the Fed's policies are unfairly taking money from savers, including many seniors who planned their retirements around the interest rates that low-risk assets like bank deposits used to pay.
Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday that the Fed was aware of this, but it was acting again because it still did not believe that it has done enough. At the same time, he suggested that the Fed was not on the verge of more drastic measures, like further expanding its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.
Such purchases remain under consideration, Mr. Bernanke said, but only ''if we see that the recovery is faltering or if we see that inflation is not moving towards target.''
As part of its transparency campaign, the Fed also published Wednesday a statement of its long-term goals, formalizing its longstanding commitment to maintain inflation at about 2 percent a year. The Fed also said that it was equally committed to minimizing unemployment, but that its exact goal would vary based on economic circumstances. It said the goal now was to reduce unemployment below 6 percent.
The new forecast showed that the Fed expects to hit its inflation target over the next three years, but to fall well short of its goals for unemployment. The Fed projected that unemployment would drop no lower than 8.2 percent this year, just slightly below the current rate of 8.5 percent, and no lower than 7.4 percent by the end of next year. By the end of 2014, the Fed still expects that at least 6.7 percent of people actively interested in working would not be able to find jobs.
In light of those projections, it was unclear why so many members of the policy-making committee expected to raise interest rates by the end of 2014.
Asked why the committee would seek to raise rates in such a situation, Mr. Bernanke said that he did not imagine it would.
''We're certainly willing to look for different ways to provide further support for the economy if in fact we have this unsatisfactory situation,'' he said.
As for the forecasts, he said, ''there is no mechanical relationship between these projections'' and the committee's decisions.
Some analysts cautioned that the Fed's statements and predictions were being given too much weight.
''Here's what all Fed promises are worth: nothing, if the data tell them to do something different,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
Furthermore, Mr. Bernanke's Fed is now making projections about decisions that could be made under the leadership of someone else. Mr. Bernanke's current term ends in early 2014.
''I wouldn't feel bound by anything the previous chairman had done,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''And three years is a very, very long time.''

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales in U.S. Fell Back in December

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes fell in December after hitting the highest level in a year and a half. 
The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements fell 3.5 percent last month to a reading of 96.6 points. That's down from November's reading of 100.1 points.
But the reading is still the second highest since April 2010, the last month that buyers could qualify for a federal home-buying tax credit.
A reading of 100 is considered healthy.
''Even with a modest decline, the preceding two months of contract activity are the highest in the past four years outside of the homebuyer tax credit period,'' said Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group's chief economist.
Contract signings typically indicate where the housing market is headed. There's a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed deal. But in recent months, a growing number of buyers have cancelled contracts at the last minute.

HEADLINE: Kerrey Weighs Return To Nebraska and Senate

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Born and bred in Nebraska, Bob Kerrey was the high-profile political face of his home state as governor, senator and presidential candidate. That background made him an obvious choice for Democrats courting the best candidate to retain the seat held by Senator Ben Nelson, who is retiring.
But as Mr. Kerrey decides whether to enter the race after a decade out of office, Republicans have pre-emptively taken to the local airwaves to point out what they believe to be a glaring weakness -- Cornhusker roots or not, this is a man who calls Greenwich Village home. 
''Straight from New York City, Bob Kerrey is bringing his liberal act to Nebraska,'' declared one advertisement by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. ''After ditching our state over a decade ago, Kerrey is back, pushing an East Coast liberal agenda.''
The line of attack -- another group called him Big Apple Bob -- highlights a longstanding tension. Throughout the country, politicians, even those who spent their career wailing about the shortcomings of life outside the singular splendor of their state's borders, often leave office to find that the most compelling or lucrative career options can be found elsewhere.
More than 40 percent of former senators now live outside their home states, according to the Senate Historical Office, most in the Washington area. Such relocations are particularly jarring here in the Midwest, where leaders have long worked to stop the outflow of promising young residents and dispel the notion that opportunity is in short supply locally. Undermining that official line is the fact that the politicians pledging to stop the outflow often move out as well.
In Iowa and Indiana, two states that have wrestled with brain drain, all six living former senators live out of state, according to the Senate Historical Office. In Michigan, the only state to lose population in the last census, the governor made what she called a temporary move to California to teach after her term ended last year. And in Kansas not only did the political icon Bob Dole not return after leaving the Senate but five recent former governors left the state -- though two have returned -- either to serve in the federal government or take jobs in the private sector.
Doug Bereuter, a Republican who moved to California to take a job running the nonprofit Asia Foundation after representing Nebraska for 13 terms in Congress, said he often saw colleagues who planned on returning home tempted by opportunities elsewhere. ''You become a very valuable commodity,'' Mr. Bereuter said. ''And you're going to earn your money, if that's your interest, in very large communities like Washington or New York or San Francisco.''
Still, Mr. Bereuter, who has kept a house in Nebraska where he lives about half the year and serves on local boards, said that he believed politicians had an obligation to return to the state that elevated them into leadership.
In Nebraska, one of the most Republican states, political leaders from both parties agree that even after his long absence Mr. Kerrey represents Democrats' best hopes of keeping Mr. Nelson's Senate seat. Mr. Nelson, a moderate Democrat who faced a difficult re-election battle, announced his retirement last month.
Several prominent Republicans including the attorney general, the state treasurer and a state senator are running for the seat. Several Democrats considering the entering the race are waiting for Mr. Kerrey -- who has entertained the idea of running for office in both Nebraska and New York before -- to make a decision, which he said would come in the next few days.
One of the pressing questions for Mr. Kerrey, who moved to New York to run the New School and has since started a family, is whether Nebraska will accept such a return after a long, self-imposed separation. He last appeared on a ballot here in 1994.
Noting that he still has family and businesses in the state, Mr. Kerrey said he believes that if he runs he will be accepted because Nebraska has a well-established tradition of calling its expats home. ''People graduate and leave, and we always want them to come back,'' he said.
''It's a very Republican, very conservative state,'' he added. ''I'm going to have much bigger problems if I run in Nebraska than whether or not I've been living there for the last 11 years.''
Indeed, there is even a Web site with the explicit mission of luring back former Nebraskans. Mitch Arnold, president of a recruiting company based in Omaha that runs the Move Back to Nebraska site, said it was easier to lure job candidates who already have a Nebraska connection. ''Nebraskans will welcome him back,'' he said of Mr. Kerrey. ''They may not vote for him, but they will welcome him back.''
One inspiration may be Dan Coats, a Republican former senator from Indiana who left the state to live in Washington and openly talked about retiring to North Carolina. But he returned to Indiana, and despite efforts by Democrats to use the long absence against him, he was reelected to the Senate in 2010.
Michael Wagner, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln, said the return would be made only more difficult by the fact that Republicans enjoy a huge advantage in voter registration.
''He would have to spend some time defusing questions about being a carpetbagger and the rest of his time convincing every single independent and a couple of Republicans to vote for him too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Towers of Dreams: One Ended in Nightmare

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Hortense Davis sat beside neat stacks of new magazines in the pristine administrative office at Penn South, the 1960s high-rise housing cooperative development for low- and moderate-income workers in Chelsea. She was asked to ponder life there across 20 years.
''Perfect,'' she said after a shrug, stumped to come up with some complaint. ''Especially if, like me, you live alone and don't drive, because it's close to shops and transportation, it's secure, the grounds are beautiful in the summer.'' Ms. Davis, a 76-year-old former Brooklynite, has an apartment on the ninth floor, facing the Hudson. ''It's like a penthouse,'' she told me. ''I like to stand at my window and watch the ships.'' 
I went to Penn South this week, having seen ''The Pruitt-Igoe Myth,'' Chad Freidrichs's shattering documentary, now at the IFC Center. Pruitt-Igoe was the notorious St. Louis public-housing complex, demolished in 1972. Images of imploded Pruitt-Igoe buildings, broadcast worldwide, came to haunt the American consciousness. Critics of welfare, big government and modern architecture all used the project as a whipping boy. ''The day that modern architecture died,'' Charles Jencks, the architect and apostle of postmodernism, called the demolition.
Penn South is a cooperative in affluent, 21st-century Manhattan past which chic crowds hustle every day to and from nearby Chelsea's art galleries, apparently oblivious to it. It thrives within a dense, diverse neighborhood of the sort that makes New York special. Pruitt-Igoe, segregated de facto, isolated and impoverished, collapsed along with the industrial city around it.
But they're both classic examples of modern architecture, the kind Mr. Jencks, among countless others, left for dead: superblocks of brick and concrete high rises scattered across grassy plots, so-called towers in the park, descended from Le Corbusier's ''Radiant City.'' The words ''housing project'' instantly conjure them up.
Alienating, penitential breeding grounds for vandalism and violence: that became the tower in the park's epitaph. But Penn South, with its stolid redbrick, concrete-slab housing stock, is clearly a safe, successful place. In this case the architecture works. In St. Louis, where the architectural scheme was the same, what killed Pruitt-Igoe was not its bricks and mortar. (Minoru Yamasaki, who designed the World Trade Towers, was the architect.)
The lesson these two sites share has to do with the limits of architecture, socially and economically, never mind what some architects and planners promise or boast. The two projects, aesthetic cousins, are reminders that no typology of design, no matter how passingly fashionable or reviled, guarantees success or failure: neither West Village-style brownstones nor towers in the park nor titanium-clad confections. This is not to say architecture is helpless, only that it is never destiny and that it is always hostage to larger forces.
Pruitt-Igoe opened to great fanfare in 1954. The St. Louis Housing Authority advertised a paradise of ''bright new buildings with spacious grounds,'' indoor plumbing, electric lights, fresh plastered walls and other ''conveniences expected in the 20th century.''
Ruby Russell, one of Pruitt-Igoe's early tenants, recalls in Mr. Freidrichs's film: ''It was a very beautiful place, like a big hotel resort. I never thought I would live in that kind of a surrounding.'' Having moved from dismal slums, she marveled at the light and views from her ''poor-man's penthouse'' on the 11th floor. Then ''one day we woke up and it was all gone,'' she says.
The documentary unpacks the factors conspiring against the project -- all the things that don't apply at Penn South -- among them inadequate money set aside for maintenance and unfathomable welfare rules stipulating that no able-bodied man could live in a home where the woman received government aid. A night staff from the Welfare Department patrolled apartments searching for fathers to evict.
As disastrously, opponents of public housing blocked federal money that could have helped local authorities improve conditions. The 1949 Housing Act, which promoted urban renewal at federal government expense, paved the way for Pruitt-Igoe and simultaneously promoted the white flight that doomed it, financing new segregated towns on city outskirts that drained jobs from the inner city. There's an unspeakably sad clip in the documentary in which a soft-spoken young father breaks down before a television interviewer over his failure to find anyone willing to hire a black man, and a vintage clip of a young white suburban mother explaining in a shaky voice, ''We have our home here, and if the colored move in and run real estate prices down, it's bound to create tension.
''I think their aim is mixed marriages and becoming equal with the whites,'' she feels compelled to say.
Besieged and increasingly abandoned, Pruitt-Igoe was overtaken by drug dealers and murderers, broken pipes and shattered windows, set afire and adrift. Public authorities and cultural experts after the fact blamed the residents or the architecture, but these both were more the victims than the cause.
Like Pruitt-Igoe, Penn South was a midcentury slum-clearance project. Designed by Herman Jessor as a modern cooperative for working class families, backed by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, it called for 10 buildings spread across 20 acres between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, from 23rd Street to 29th Street. It was not public housing. Two bedroom apartments cost $3,000 when the complex opened in 1962. (Those same apartments now sell for $100,000.) President John F. Kennedy stood atop a flag-decked dais in the bright May sun to dedicate it.
Steady income from maintenance payments and retail units in commercial buildings the co-op owned guaranteed Penn South a stable income. Tax relief from the city shielded it from escalating real estate values. Residents poured money into improvements. Repeatedly they declined the right to sell their apartments at market rates, preserving the ideal of moderate-income dwellings, adding facilities for toddlers and the elderly, playgrounds, a community garden and a ceramics studio.
Few people chose to leave, aging in their apartments, and in 1986 Penn South became the country's first Naturally Occurring Retirement Community, or NORC. That's an official designation for housing that wasn't built for elderly people but is occupied by enough of them to become eligible for special grants.
It turns out that the very architectural traits that conventional wisdom said made tower-in-the-park projects like Pruitt-Igoe inhumane actually make these buildings ideal for retirees: the elevators (so long as they work) and communal spaces, the enclosed green areas where it's possible to walk safely, the openness and in-house programs. Once again architecture evolves in bottom-up ways that architects and planners can never fully predict. Today New York has dozens of NORCs, most of them towers in the park.
I stopped into the Penn South Program for Seniors the other afternoon, and Elaine Rosen, the program coordinator, showed off the book-lined common room, the basket of donated eyeglasses, and a long program sheet of concerts, lectures and free Swedish massages. ''It's a community,'' she said.
So was Pruitt-Igoe, whose fleeting, forgotten Eden the film movingly excavates in the recollection of Sylvester Brown, an early resident. He remembers the smell of pies and cakes in the hallways. Jacquelyn Williams, who moved with her 11 siblings from a shack where her mother slept beside the kitchen's potbelly stove, recalls ''friendships and bonds formed there that have lasted a lifetime.''
''I know a lot of bad things came out of Pruitt-Igoe,'' she says. ''I know they did. But I don't think they outweighed the good.''
Another early Pruitt-Igoe tenant in the film, Valerie Sills, remembers as a little girl moving into Pruitt-Igoe when it was ablaze with Christmas lights. Then she describes returning to the project as a policewoman when enraged residents dropped homemade firebombs on her car.
''There is enough blame to go around,'' she concludes. But ''I can see it,'' she insists, meaning the Pruitt-Igoe of her childhood. ''I remember dancing in the street, I remember riding my bike, I remember we raced up and down the hills. It was our home.''
Ms. Sills pauses and starts to weep. I think of Ms. Davis, staring at the Hudson from Penn South. ''When I feel bad, I don't intend to, but I dream about Pruitt-Igoe,'' Ms. Sills says.
''And I always see myself standing at the window, looking out the window.''

HEADLINE: Across the World, Leaders Brace for Discontent and Upheaval

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- Protesters in Moscow and Cairo fill public squares to demand representative government. Yet on the streets of Madrid and New York -- or of Athens, which gave us the very word for democracy -- discontent is almost as rampant.
The only consistent messages seem to be that leaders around the world are failing to deliver on their citizens' expectations and that Facebook, Twitter and other social media tools allow crowds to coalesce at will to let them know it. This is not a comforting picture for the 40 heads of state or leaders of governments who are attending the World Economic Forum here, including such disparate leaders as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany's multiparty democracy or Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of the authoritarian state of Ethiopia. 
''I think that what we have learned in the last few years since the financial crisis and since the Arab Spring is that brittle states with limited political and economic capital are particularly susceptible to the combination of severe economic downturn and the communications revolution,'' said Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in New York.
''Those brittle states come in different flavors,'' said Mr. Bremmer, who moderated a panel in Davos on Wednesday on the state of democracy. ''Some are authoritarian, some of them are democratic.''
In raw statistical terms, democracy lost ground last year, according to the annual tally by Freedom House, an advocacy group in Washington. In a report issued last week, Freedom House counted 12 countries where democracy had made gains and 26 where the level of freedom had declined.
At the same time, the Arab Spring revolts in Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern countries showed democratic progress.
''Our view is that the events of 2011 are more positive than negative,'' said Arch Puddington, the vice president for research at Freedom House. ''We see the Arab uprising as constituting the kind of transformational event not unlike in 1989 and 1991 when the Soviet Union unraveled. It is a part of the world that has been immune to the spread of freedom. Now things are in play.''
No one can predict with confidence what kind of societies will emerge from the turmoil. The superiority of American and European democracy no longer seems as clear-cut as it did a decade ago. Political views in the United States are polarized, and public confidence in Congress is at a low level. The euro zone debt crisis drags on as European leaders quarrel endlessly about how to solve it.
The most powerful leader in Europe may be Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who was appointed by elected officials but cannot be fired and is independent of political control. So it is telling that in a city full of banks, the Frankfurt version of the Occupy movement chose the central bank's lawn as a place to set up its tents. Participants said they were protesting its lack of democratic accountability. Meanwhile, Greece and Italy are led by unelected technocrats whose selections were strongly influenced by Germany.
Vast numbers of people in many countries seem tired and disillusioned. Even pillars of the establishment are shaken. Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, whose annual gathering in Davos is financed largely by corporations, recently sounded as if he were ready to pitch a tent in Zuccotti Park, the hub of the Occupy Wall Street protests until it was cleared in November.
''Capitalism, in its current form, no longer fits the world around us,'' Mr. Schwab said in a statement last week. ''We have failed to learn the lessons from the financial crisis of 2009.''
In many parts of the world, the correlation between democracy and economic growth no longer seems solid. Some of the most dynamic economies in the world are in places like China or Vietnam, which imprison protesters and where leaders are chosen by a clique.
''There has been an assumption that democratic governance and rapid growth go hand in hand,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group based in New York. ''The existence of China challenges that idea.''
Leaders in China are not feeling comfortable, either. They are facing dissent within their own borders and watching developments in the Middle East with acute unease. So are Russia's leaders.
It is not as easy for governments to argue, as they did in the past, that revolts in countries like Libya have been fomented by outsiders. They are frightened by the power of social networking to defeat censorship.
Thomas Carothers, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research organization in Washington, said strong-arm leaders everywhere were shaken when Arab Spring revolts ousted rulers. ''This was a part of the world that seemed so secure -- if they could go, anyone could,'' he said. That has got to be scary if you are a dictatorial regime. You wake up one morning and look out the window and there are all these people in your central square.''
Mr. Carothers spoke by telephone from Budapest, where he was teaching at a university. Hungary, in fact, is an example of how fragile democracy can be, even in the middle of Europe. A symbol of resistance to Soviet dominance after its 1956 revolt, Hungary was one of the first former Communist countries to join the European Union.
Now Prime Minister Viktor Orban faces accusations that he has used his majority in Parliament to mute criticism by the news media, weaken rival centers of power like the courts and the central bank and perpetuate his party's dominance by rewriting the Constitution.
The European Union began formal legal proceedings last week against Hungary. Mr. Orban, who needs aid from the union and the International Monetary Fund to avoid defaulting on the national debt, has promised concessions. But he also seems to have been emboldened by the weaknesses in the European Union exposed by the sovereign debt crisis. Nationalistic parties in countries like Finland, France and the Netherlands have also tried to exploit the debt crisis for political ends.
''Europe risks being handicapped if it doesn't deal decisively with this challenge to democracy,'' said Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch.

HEADLINE: In Hawaii, a Bid to Sell Each Island as Unique

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
HOW ''The Descendants''-- a film about life and love in Hawaii -- fared when the Academy Award nominations were announced on Tuesday was big news in the Aloha State, as evidenced by the headline on a Honolulu Web site: '' 'The Descendants' Gets 5 Oscar Nominations; 'Hugo' Leads With 11.''
But potential visitors interested in learning more about Hawaii need not head to a movie theater or wait for ''The Descendants'' to turn up on DVD or pay-per-view. Instead, they can check out Hawaii through a campaign that is now being introduced by the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, which offers a look at the state, island by island. The ads all refer to Hawaii as ''the Hawaiian Islands,'' and use that phrase as a theme. 
The campaign sells each island -- Hawaii, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai and Oahu -- one by one, rather than as a six-pack. That approach is consistent across all media: television, print, online, social media like Facebook and the bureau's Web site, gohawaii.com.
The goal is ''to develop the brand personality for each of the islands and communicate that in a way we haven't in the past,'' said Jay Talwar, senior vice president for marketing at the bureau in Honolulu.
The change is in response to ''a bit of a mess we've made for ourselves,'' he added, in terms of confusing tourists trying to distinguish among Hawaii's attractions and choose which to visit.
''Someone on an island gets a new wedding chapel and declares, 'We're the romance island,' or gets a new golf course and says, 'We're the golf island,' '' Mr. Talwar said.
''We need to create a sense of difference about each island and convey that each delivers a different experience,'' he added.
The media spending for the new campaign is estimated at around $7 million, which is ''significantly more than we've put behind a campaign for a bunch of years,'' Mr. Talwar said. ''It's usually more in the $4 million range.''
The additional spending is being spurred by an improving outlook for tourism after a downturn that began with the financial crisis in 2008.
People who like to travel ''were pounded by the waves,'' Mr. Talwar said, and ''really hunkered down; those with jobs were not taking vacations.'' So the bureau adopted a short-term tack for 2009 and 2010 with a message he described this way: ''Eventually, you're going to need a break. Come to Hawaii to recharge, rejuvenate, refresh.''
And the ad placements had ''a heavy West Coast skew,'' Mr. Talwar said, reflecting how it costs less -- and takes less time -- to visit Hawaii for someone who lives in California than in Connecticut.
Now, with metrics like the number of seats on aircraft flying to Hawaii approaching 2007 levels, the time has arrived for a longer-term perspective, Mr. Talwar said, and also to be ''more national.''
The ads offer shorthand descriptions for each island. For instance, Kauai is ''Hawaii's island of discovery,'' Maui is ''the magic isle'' and Oahu is ''the heart of Hawaii.'' Vignettes of each island's attractions are presented under a common rubric, ''Living in the moment on the island of (name of island),'' which is followed more specific information like ''The adventure continues at gohawaii.com/(name of island).''
Hawaii is, of course, not the only destination sensing an opportunity to recover from the pounding cited by Mr. Talwar. Others that are stepping up their sales pitches include Mexico, which is seeking to change perceptions about conditions that tourists find there; the Bahamas, which is running commercials that declare, ''Once you're in the Bahamas, the rest of the world fades away''; and the Paradise Coast area of Florida, including Naples and Marco Island, which began a campaign last week that carries the theme ''That's why they call it Paradise.''
To stand out amid the clamor, ''the challenge was to dive deeper and show something unexpected'' about Hawaii to potential visitors, said Tammy Uy, creative director at MVNP in Honolulu, the agency -- formerly known as Milici Valenti Ng Pack, and part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group -- that is creating the campaign.
That was complicated by the fact that ''everyone knows Hawaii, even if they haven't been here,'' she added, because they have seen it in movies like ''The Descendants'' and ''Blue Hawaii'' or television series like ''The Bachelor,'' ''Hawaii Five-O'' (the original), ''Hawaii Five-0'' (the new version), ''Hawaiian Eye'' and ''Lost.''
(Mr. Talwar conceded that ''the HD footage'' on the current version of ''Hawaii Five-0'' may help attract visitors. It is ''actually pretty tasty,'' he said, ''away from the crime scenes.'')
The commercials are running on cable networks like HGTV and Travel Channel. The print ads are appearing in magazines like Real Simple and Travel & Leisure.
Another Omnicom agency, the Los Angeles office of OMD, is handling the media services for the campaign. There is also a public relations component, under the aegis of McNeil Wilson Communications in Honolulu, part of the Anthology Marketing Group.

HEADLINE: Apple's Surge and the Fed's Advisory on Interest Rates Enliven Markets

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Profits from Apple and a promise from the Federal Reserve to maintain rock-bottom rates for at least two more years pushed stock market indexes higher on Wednesday.
Apple led the Nasdaq to a 1 percent gain as its shares surged to a record, making it the most valuable American company in terms of market capitalization. Apple finished up 6.2 percent at $446.66.
Buying picked up after the Federal Reserve said it would keep interest rates near zero through at least 2014, which was longer than many investors had anticipated. The actions were taken as a sign of the central bank's commitment to bolster the sluggish economic recovery. 
''What caught the market off guard was obviously the fact they are going to keep rates lower for longer,'' said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
The Fed also took an unusual step by setting an inflation target of 2 percent, which brings it in line with many of the world's other central banks that use an explicit benchmark to set policy.
Demand for bonds was higher. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 18/32, to 100. The yield fell to 2.0 percent, from 2.06 percent late Tuesday.
Apple was a standout in what has otherwise been a fairly lackluster earnings season. So far, 57 percent of companies reporting have beaten forecasts, while at this stage in previous earnings seasons, an average of 70 percent of businesses beat analysts' forecasts.
Apple shares touched a record high of $454.45 on results issued after Tuesday's market close that sailed past expectations. The increase pushed Apple's market capitalization above that of Exxon Mobil.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 81.21 points, or 0.64 percent, at 12,756.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.41 points, or 0.87 percent, at 1,326.06. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 31.67 points, or 1.14 percent, at 2,818.31.
In other earnings news, the video company Netflix reported results that outpaced Wall Street's expectations, sending shares up about 13 percent, to $107.40, in after-hours trading.
During the regular trading session, both United Technologies and Rockwell Automation shares fell after the companies slightly missed revenue forecasts. United Technologies shares closed down 0.13 percent at $77.65 and Rockwell dropped 2.9 percent to $79.42.
Another diversified manufacturer, Textron, surged 14.6 percent to $24.76 after it raised its 2012 profit forecast. The S.& P. industrials index gained 1.2 percent.
Corning tumbled 10.7 percent to $13.05 as manufacturers cut back on the production of big-screen televisions that use the company's specialty glass.
Applications for home loans declined 5.4 percent last week after two straight weeks of gains, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in a report.
''We are encouraged by the pop in prices as it may be a signal of further stabilization in the housing market and evidence that the erosion in home prices may be nearing an end,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in December, dropped 3.5 percent to 96.6 in December, after hitting a 19-month high in November.
Economists had expected signed contracts for sales, which lead existing home sales by a month or two, to fall by only 1 percent. However, sales were up 5.6 percent in the 12 months to December.
The reports on Wednesday did not change perceptions that a nascent recovery is under way in the housing market, which continues to be challenged by an oversupply of properties.
''This is potentially negative for January existing home sales although the two do not always go hand in hand,'' said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ''So does this mean the story has changed and housing is back in the dumps? Nope.''
Another report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices rose 1 percent in November from October.

HEADLINE: Folk Art for Young Collectors

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Susan Baerwald, a former Hollywood producer who now runs Just Folk, a gallery outside Santa Barbara, Calif., that she started with a fellow TV industry veteran, Marcy Carsey, said her first brush with American folk art was buying quilts. ''They were a wonderful way to decorate an apartment in New York,'' she said. ''They took up a lot of wall space.'' 
Ms. Baerwald is one of five dealers participating in ''Folk Tales: Bringing Folk Art Home,'' a show at the 1stdibs gallery at the New York Design Center. The exhibition, which runs through Feb. 25, includes items for sale like painted furniture, a 1920s game wheel and a circa 1890 goat sculpture from an Odd Fellows Hall in Colorado.
Jeff Bridgman, a Pennsylvania-based folk art dealer who brought to the show a circa 1915 carousel horse, said partnering with 1stdibs is a way to ''introduce folk art to a younger audience,'' one that has shifted ''towards modernism and away from Americana'' in recent years. The recession and popularity of midcentury, he added, has advantages for new folk art collectors looking for deals. ''This isn't the worst time in the world to buy,'' Mr. Bridgman said.

HEADLINE: Shipping Becalmed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- The skyscrapers and immaculate beaches of this seaport look out on one of the world's largest parking lots: mile after mile of empty cargo ships, as far as the eye can see.
Similar fleets bob at anchor, with empty cargo holds, off the coasts of southeast Malaysia and Hong Kong. And dozens of newly built ships float empty near the giant shipyards of South Korea and China, their owners from all over the world reluctant to accept delivery during one of the worst markets ever for the global shipping industry.
As recently as six weeks ago large freighters that can carry bulk commodities like iron ore or grain were fetching charter rates of $15,000 a day. Now, brokers and owners say, the going rate is $6,000 a day. If any customers can even be found.
Although the fault lies partly with doldrums in the global economy, the bigger factor is a glut of new freighters. The oversupply is putting financial pressure on the shipowners that bought them and the already struggling European banks that financed many of the purchases. 
Shipping industry leaders hold little hope of a quick recovery.
''If the tunnel is 2012, I can't see any light at the end of it,'' said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a Hong Kong-based shipping line with 29 bulk freighters and tankers.
Back during the global commodity boom, which continued through the spring of 2008, the world's shipowners could hardly place orders for freighters fast enough. But because of the long lead times in shipbuilding, those vessels only now are being delivered by the hundreds -- into a very different, much less robust international economy than when they were ordered.
For the shipping industry, the glut means not only lower charter fares, but also steep declines in the value of their vessels. The bigger losers, though, could eventually be some big European banks, many of which are already struggling with big losses on their holdings of government bonds from Greece, Italy and other heavily indebted European nations.
Basil Karatzas, the chief executive of Karatzas Marine Advisors, a ship brokerage and finance advisory firm in Manhattan, estimated that European banks hold about $500 billion in shipping loans on their books and face nearly $100 billion in losses to restructure them.
Just as American banks have grappled with huge loan losses for houses that are worth less than their mortgages, European banks face tens of billions of dollars in potential losses on shipping loans.
The banks' ''biggest concern is what is the write-off, and how do you treat it from an accounting point of view,'' Mr. Karatzas said. ''They do not know how to deal with these losses.''
Banks in Europe have long been the world leaders in ship financing because many of the biggest fleet owners are based there. But many have abruptly stopped lending money to shipowners. Some, as they scramble to muster capital to meet tougher reserve requirements demanded by European banking regulators, have even tried to raise money by asking some shipowners to prepay loans in exchange for a discount.
There is a scant secondary market for ship loans right now, except at deep discounts that banks are loath to agree to, according to shipping finance experts. Even for loans on which the vessel is still worth more than the mortgage, these experts say, the discount demanded is about 20 percent.
Commerzbank in Germany and the Lloyds Banking Group in Britain are among European institutions that have publicly said they were reducing their exposure to shipping loans.
Societe Generale in France also has been looking for ways to reduce its holdings of shipping loans and instead focus on providing financial advice to shipping companies, according to two people with knowledge of the bank's moves.
The bank declined to provide a comment on its shipping exposure ahead of the release of its annual financial report next month.
Shipowners, meantime, are nervously monitoring an industry benchmark, the Baltic Dry Index of bulk freighter charter rates, which has lost more than half its value since the start of the year. The index is now at its lowest level since January 2009, during the depths of the economic downturn after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
And as charter rates plummet, so do prices of the vessels themselves. A large tanker that sold for $137 million in early 2008, the Samho Dream, was repossessed by bankers late last year and sold last week in Hong Kong for just $28.3 million.
The world's tonnage of large freighters is climbing by more than 10 percent a year, with 1,650 large freighters for bulk commodities expected to emerge from shipyards this year alone.
As long as the shipped tonnage of world trade is creeping up at an annual rate of only 2 to 3 percent a year, the oversupply can only grow more burdensome for the seaborne freight industry.
Making the glut especially acute right now is the fact that shipyards have delivered a large number of vessels to owners since the beginning of the year. Just as some car buyers wait to buy a car at the start of a model year -- because it will hold its resale value longer -- shipowners have traditionally taken delivery of as many vessels as possible in January, so as to have a full calendar year's use before a vessel celebrates its first birthday, said Natasha Boyden, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.
Buyers who might be tempted to refuse delivery of vessels can lose their deposits, which are typically up to 40 percent of the contract price of the ship. But it is getting harder to borrow money from struggling banks to pay for the remaining 60 percent -- particularly with resale values now much lower than the prices at which contracts were signed four or five years ago.
Freight rates are now close to operating costs for many bulk freighters, leaving almost nothing to pay the mortgage, so more old vessels may be scrapped in the coming years, which would eventually reduce oversupply.
Worldwide lending for ships totaled about $100 billion last year, down only slightly from previous years, according to industry estimates. But as much as three-quarters of last year's loans were to refinance or restructure previous loans that the borrowers were struggling to repay, shipping finance executives said.
One big question is whether the plunge in freight rates might also signal further trouble in the global economy. World oil demand has been fairly flat lately because of weak economic growth, so there has been limited need for more tankers to haul oil.
The biggest market for bulk carriers lies in carrying iron ore to China's voracious steel mills. But with a real estate slowdown in China undermining demand for steel, the annual growth rate of Chinese iron ore imports has abruptly slowed since October.
Harley Seyedin, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, said that many construction projects had slowed to a crawl, with barely enough work being done for developers to persuade their bankers to continue financing projects already under way.
Yet the growing glut of vessels, combined with seasonal factors, could skew the reliability of shipping as a global economic indicator. Bad weather lately off Australia and Brazil, the two countries where bulk freighters are most likely to take on iron ore and other cargo, has made companies leery of chartering vessels and risk waiting for days for ports to reopen after storms.
Further confusing the picture is that the cost to ship a container from China to the United States or Europe actually jumped in the first two weeks of this year, as factories rushed to fill orders before shutting down for up to a month for the Chinese New Year, which began Monday. But that could be a misleading metric, because container rates temporarily surge every year for the last sailings before the Chinese New Year.
Even if world trade does not slow in the coming months, the shipping industry still has a long way to go before cargo demand can possibly catch up to capacity. Meantime, bulk freighters, container ships, tankers and refrigerator ships by the hundreds may continue to bob idly in the waves here, their hulls showing wide bands of paint that would be submerged if the vessels were fully laden.

PERSON: Theo Angelopoulos 

HEADLINE: Theo Angelopoulos, Greek Filmmaker, 76

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Theo Angelopoulos, a renowned director whose films explored the human condition in general and the condition of modern Greece in particular through haunting imagery rooted in myth and epic, died on Tuesday of injuries suffered in a traffic accident near Piraeus, Greece. He was 76.
Mr. Angelopoulos was struck by a motorcycle earlier that day while crossing the street, police and hospital officials told The Associated Press. He was on location near Piraeus, the port of Athens. 
The driver of the motorcycle, who was injured in the accident, was later identified as an off-duty police officer.
Possessed of a singular style that has long divided critics, Mr. Angelopoulos was considered one of the most eminent directors of the second half of the 20th century; reviewers have likened his films to those of Michelangelo Antonioni and Akira Kurosawa.
He worked with some of the world's leading actors, among them Marcello Mastroianni, Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Bruno Ganz and Jeanne Moreau.
His best-known pictures include ''Eternity and a Day,'' which won the Palme d'Or, the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, in 1998. A rumination on death, it stars Mr. Ganz as a terminally ill writer who journeys in search of answers to vast metaphysical questions.
If Mr. Angelopoulos's work was not universally known in the United States, the explanation could be found in his style, the antithesis of Hollywood studio fare.
Seen most often here on the art house circuit, his movies are dreamy, atmospheric and enigmatic. Many are allegories that illuminate the painful history of 20th-century Greece, from its occupation by the Nazis in World War II to its brutal civil war in the late 1940s.
Visually evocative, often beautiful, his films contain long sections with little or no dialogue. They are suffused with melancholy symbolism, all of it intensely personal and some of it intensely obscure. They are typically organized around very long takes that can assume the form of wordless meditations on space, as the camera pans slowly across a landscape.
What dialogue there is can border on the opaque, at least in English translation. In ''Ulysses' Gaze'' (1995), for instance, Mr. Keitel, playing a Greek-American filmmaker on an odyssey in the Balkans in search of lost reels of an early Greek film, utters lines like ''Your image, still damp, unchanged since the day I left it, emerges once again from the night.''
The most distinguishing hallmark of Mr. Angelopoulos's work is his tendency to play fast and loose -- or, more precisely, slow and loose -- with time: scenes can unfold with dreamlike nonlinearity, with remembered scraps of a character's past played out as though they were part of the present action.
Some critics adored Mr. Angelopoulos's films. Others could scarcely abide them. Which side one came down on depended partly on staying power: some of his pictures were three hours long or more.
In short, what Mr. Angelopoulos strived for, as he made clear in interviews and in his work, was nothing less than a distillation of the Greek epic tradition on celluloid.
Perhaps it was only fitting, then, that Mr. Angelopoulos, who by all accounts had a robust sense of his own artistic merit, was guilty on at least one occasion of the storied Greek sin of hubris.
In 1995, he displayed a memorable lack of politesse on being awarded the Grand Jury Prize -- second prize -- at Cannes for ''Ulysses' Gaze.'' The Sydney Morning Herald described what happened after his name was called:
''The director caused a storm when the award was announced, remaining for some seconds in his seat, clearly enraged, his fingertips steepled tightly at his lips. Once on stage, his anger was undisguised. 'I planned my speech for the Palme d'Or,' he said, before adding contemptuously, 'but now I've forgotten it.' ''
Theodoros Angelopoulos was born in Athens in 1935. As a young man he studied law but, finding it dull, left school and moved to Paris, where he ostensibly studied philosophy but actually spent most of his time at the Cinematheque Francaise.
He attended France's chief film school, the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, before returning to Greece, where he worked as a newspaper film critic before embarking on his directorial career.
Mr. Angelopoulos's survivors include his wife and frequent producer, Phoebe Economopoulos, and three daughters. Information on other survivors was not available.
His other films include ''Landscape in the Mist'' (1988), which explores the ravages of modern Greece through the story of siblings roaming Europe in search of their father; ''The Weeping Meadow'' (2004), which treats Greek history between the world wars and was the first segment of an unfinished trilogy; and ''The Dust of Time'' (2008), the trilogy's second segment, about the fates of refugees from Greece, starring Mr. Dafoe, Mr. Ganz and Irene Jacob.
At his death, Mr. Angelopoulos was filming ''The Other Sea,'' about immigration and the crisis in contemporary Greece.
As he explained in interviews, it was the combination of a centuries-old oral tradition and a 20th-century visual medium that let him capture, for better and sometimes for worse, the soul of his homeland.
''I say to myself that I could have made a career anywhere, but I have chosen to speak in the same words that were spoken by so many who preceded me,'' Mr. Angelopoulos told The Los Angeles Times in 1999. ''Greece is more than a geographical locale to me. It's a spirit, a culture, and when I'm disgusted with present-day Greece -- the loss of spirituality and generosity -- I go back to those words said many, many years ago.''

HEADLINE: Seaport Museum Sets Sail, Again

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Its historic ships still aren't in any shape to hit the high seas.
And the museum remains easy to miss, wedged in among restaurants and retail stores.
But when the South Street Seaport Museum reopens on Thursday, after nearly a year of being closed, its new leaders will have tried to address some of the problems that had left it in peril.
Visitors will find two floors of expanded gallery space, cleaned, updated and re-envisioned by a new team of experts. Perhaps more important, the museum has an interim plan to pay bills as it works to attract more visitors. 
''We wanted to try to become an overnight cultural destination,'' said Susan Henshaw Jones, the president and director of the Museum of the City of New York, which assumed control of the Seaport Museum last fall. ''We hope the public's reaction is as intense as our efforts to get the place reopened.''
Before the renovation, the Seaport Museum had spent a decade in arrears to the city's Economic Development Corporation for rent and utilities, forcing board members to make personal loans to pay expenses. Trustees had resigned from the board; half the staff members had been furloughed; and exhibitions had been suspended.
But in September the Museum of the City of New York came to the rescue with help from a $2 million grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Since then the new leaders have pulled out all the stops to get the seaport institution in shape for visitors, at a cost of less than $500,000.
Still uncertain is whether the City museum is prepared to carry the Seaport Museum long term -- its grant provides for an 18-month period of evaluation -- and how much help the city will provide going forward. ''We are continuing our discussions with the museum with the goal of cementing a long-term agreement,'' said Seth Pinsky, the president of the Economic Development Corporation. ''We're not there yet.''
Annexing the Seaport Museum is expected to add $5 million to the Museum of the City's $16 million annual operating budget, an amount the museum hopes to raise from earned and contributed income. The Seaport Museum staff now numbers 16 -- half of whom are occupied with its waterfront -- but will increase after the opening because of additional guards and other employees.
''Unless they can resolve the challenges that are implicit in the fleet, it's going to be extremely difficult,'' said Rick Beard, the former chief curator at the Seaport Museum, who has been the executive director of several major history museums around the country. ''The magnitude of capital expense is just so great.''
Ms. Jones, who now directs both institutions, said she planned to reduce the museum's 11 vessels to a number (still undetermined) that can be comfortably berthed at Pier 16. In the meantime several ships are being mended, including the Ambrose, the Lettie G. Howard and the Pioneer. Also, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs has reactivated its grant of about $3 million for repair of the Wavertree; the project had been suspended pending the resolution of the museum's financial troubles.
''They have made impressive strides,'' said Kate D. Levin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner. ''The big variable is how the public will respond to this revitalized institution.''
The museum has a new seven-member interim board that is focused on raising the institution's profile. ''Identity for this place is an issue,'' Ms. Jones said. ''It should be 'today,' and you should have fun here. It should be a bright, uplifting place.''
Floors 3 through 5 of the museum's building on Fulton Street now have exhibitions; previously, there were no shows above the third floor. With spaces in six interconnected buildings, the museum has addressed navigational problems with clearer signage.
To work fast, the Museum of the City drew on its principal personnel, with Sarah Henry, its deputy director and chief curator, at the helm. It also expanded the Seaport Museum's scope to make its attractions more current and to connect better with the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
Donald Albrecht, the City museum's curator of architecture and design, assembled two ''Made in New York'' galleries, with pieces currently designed and made in New York City. Phyllis Magidson, the City museum's costume and textiles curator, collected the work of local fashion designers. Sean Corcoran, the City museum's curator of prints and photographs, worked on the ''Ship Breaking'' show (featuring images of ships being dismantled) and a show dedicated to photographs of the Occupy Wall Street demonstration.
The Museum of the City also cannibalized some of its own content, including ''Timescapes,'' an orientation film, and elements of its 2009 exhibition honoring the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's arrival.
The new exhibitions ''Bottled Up'' (ships in bottles), ''Super Models'' (an armada of model ships) and ''Handheld Devices'' (various antique shipping tools) were designed by Wendy Evans Joseph and Chris Cooper of Cooper Joseph Studio, using the Seaport Museum's collection.
''We rummaged around in storerooms,'' Ms. Joseph said.
To counter the Seaport Museum's staid reputation, Cooper Joseph Studio introduced bright blue paint, a playful lobby and an art installation, on the third-floor landing, comprising 4,000 fishing weights suspended from blue chords.
''The first thing every New Yorker says is, 'I know the Seaport Museum,' '' Ms. Joseph said. '' 'I was there 20 years ago.' ''
A merger of the institutions makes sense, Ms. Jones said, since seafaring history is part of the Museum of the City's turf. She estimated that they could ultimately draw a combined attendance of 500,000. (It was 230,000 at the Museum of the City before its south wing was closed for renovation two years ago).
But Ms. Jones is also realistic about the obstacles the seaport institution must overcome, including whether it can build sufficient earned income through its museum shop and event rentals.
''I believe it is possible from the standpoint of content and management,'' she said. ''It's the financial side we still have to see.''

FUND-RAISING Marc Andreessen, below, the venture capitalist who was a co-founder of Netscape, is in the process of raising $1.5 billion from investors for his namesake firm, with $900 million earmarked for a main fund and $600 million for a parallel fund, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. 
The round, if filled, will more than double assets for the firm, Andreessen Horowitz, which has $1.2 billion under management, spread across three funds. EVELYN M. RUSLI
BANK SANCTION Merrill Lynch agreed on Wednesday to pay regulators $1 million to settle accusations that it thwarted rules for clawing back bonuses doled out during the height of the financial crisis.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, sanctioned the firm for forcing highly paid former brokers to settle disputes over ''retention bonuses'' in New York State court rather than using arbitration panels. BEN PROTESS
EXPLOITING A LOOPHOLE With its staggered board, Illumina would appear to have the armor to withstand a $5.7 billion hostile offer from Roche Holdings.
The staggered board, in combination with a poison pill, has been called a powerful antitakeover device. But Roche Holding's hostile bid is built on a loophole in Illumina's takeover defenses, the Deal Professor says. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF
PROFIT JUMPS Greenhill & Company said that it earned $20.4 million in net income allocated to common shareholders in the fourth quarter, up nearly tenfold. For all of last year, the boutique investment bank earned $48.9 million, up 42 percent from 2010.
But those numbers exclude the accelerated vesting of restricted stock paid to the two executives, Jeffrey F. Buckalew and Rakesh Chawla, who died in a plane crash in New Jersey last month. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Trying to Shed Greek Debt

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
8:29 p.m. Updated
LONDON - So much for that big fat Greek payday.
Hedge funds that loaded up on Greek bonds in the last month - betting on a quick gain - are now scrambling to sell those holdings, fearful that European policy makers will force them to take a deep and binding haircut on the debt.
But walking away from the trade may not be that easy. While the money managers had little problem snapping up the bonds from European banks eager to sell, the pool of potential buyers is drying up. 
Hedge funds have few options. Although talks between Greece and its bondholders have stalled, European officials are pressing for a deal by the end of this month. Under the proposed debt restructuring plan, hedge funds and other private sector creditors would have to incur losses of 50 percent or more - whether or not the bondholders agreed.
''I think it's going to be take it or leave it. And if you do not participate you will get massively beaten up,'' said one hedge fund holder of Greek debt, alluding to the unpleasant prospect that if he did not take the deal - and the steep loss in value, or haircut - he would end up with nearly worthless Greek bonds and with virtually no legal protection.
The situation represents a significant shift in how Europe has approached the issue. Last year, when the idea of a Greek debt default seemed a remote possibility, the private sector agreed to a ''voluntary'' 21 percent loss on its bonds. The fear was that forcing mandatory losses would lead to a disorderly default and scare investors off European debt altogether.
But as Greece's economic problems have worsened and the need for debt relief has become more acute, Europe, particularly Germany, has come around to the realization that the private sector must take a deeper loss. In a sign of the new direction, the region's leaders have begun discussions with the European Central Bank on an arcane debt swap that would strip 55 billion euros ($72 billion) of Greek bonds from the central bank's portfolio, thus removing the possibility that the central bank might share losses with the private sector in a debt restructuring deal.
Now, the smart money isn't looking so smart. Starting in December, the counterintuitive, go-long Greece bet was one of the more popular pitches made to hedge funds in New York and London. Investment banks - Merrill Lynch was particularly aggressive in recommending the trade, investors say - argued that even though Greece was nearly bankrupt, those who bought the paper maturing in March could double their money when Greece received the next installment of its bailout, due that same month.
The theory was that the bulk of that money would be paid to bondholders to keep Greece solvent, just as was the case with past payments from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Greece might well restructure its debt, the bankers said, but added it was likely to happen later and would not affect the March payout.
The pitch worked. In the last month or so, hedge funds purchased an estimated 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of beaten-down Greek bonds that mature on March 20.
But the bonds have gone from bad to worse. ''There was a lot of volume going in, but not a lot going out,'' said one broker, speaking on condition of anonymity. The broker said prices for March 2012 bonds had slipped to about 35 cents on the dollar, from approximately 40 cents to 45 cents.
Brokers estimate that of the 14.5 billion euros worth of these bonds outstanding, the largest holder is the European Central Bank, which bought the securities in 2010 at a price of about 70 cents in an early, ultimately futile, attempt to lift Greece's failing bond market. The brokers say that 4 billion to 5 billion euros of bonds are owned by hedge funds at an average cost of about 40 cents to 45 cents on the dollar, with some of the larger positions being held by funds in the United States that have large London offices.
''It was a very binary trade,'' said one hedge fund executive who listened to the pitch but passed. ''If you got paid, you double your money in a month. But you may also look like an idiot.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The True Cost Of High School Dropouts

BYLINE: By HENRY M. LEVIN and CECILIA E. ROUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Henry M. Levin is a professor of economics and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Cecilia E. Rouse, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, was a member of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers from 2009 to 2011.

 BODY:
ONLY 21 states require students to attend high school until they graduate or turn 18. The proposal President Obamaannounced on Tuesday night in his State of the Union address -- to make such attendance compulsory in every state -- is a step in the right direction, but it would not go far enough to reduce a dropout rate that imposes a heavy cost on the entire economy, not just on those who fail to obtain a diploma.
In 1970, the United States had the world's highest rate of high school and college graduation. Today, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we've slipped to No. 21 in high school completion and No. 15 in college completion, as other countries surpassed us in the quality of their primary and secondary education. 
Only 7 of 10 ninth graders today will get high school diplomas. A decade after the No Child Left Behind law mandated efforts to reduce the racial gap, about 80 percent of white and Asian students graduate from high school, compared with only 55 percent of blacks and Hispanics.
Like President Obama, many reformers focus their dropout prevention efforts on high schoolers; replacing large high schools with smaller learning communities where poor students can get individualized instruction from dedicated teachers has been shown to be effective. Rigorous evidence gathered over decades suggests that some of the most promising approaches need to start even earlier: preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, who are fed and taught in small groups, followed up with home visits by teachers and with group meetings of parents; reducing class size in the early grades; and increasing teacher salaries from kindergarten through 12th grade.
These programs sound expensive -- some Americans probably think that preventing 1.3 million students from dropping out of high school each year can't be done -- but in fact the costs of inaction are far greater.
High school completion is, of course, the most significant requirement for entering college. While our economic competitors are rapidly increasing graduation rates at both levels, we continue to fall behind. Educated workers are the basis of economic growth -- they are especially critical as sources of innovation and productivity given the pace and nature of technological progress.
If we could reduce the current number of dropouts by just half, we would yield almost 700,000 new graduates a year, and it would more than pay for itself. Studies show that the typical high school graduate will obtain higher employment and earnings -- an astonishing 50 percent to 100 percent increase in lifetime income -- and will be less likely to draw on public money for health care and welfare and less likely to be involved in the criminal justice system. Further, because of the increased income, the typical graduate will contribute more in tax revenues over his lifetime than if he'd dropped out.
When the costs of investment to produce a new graduate are taken into account, there is a return of $1.45 to $3.55 for every dollar of investment, depending upon the educational intervention strategy. Under this estimate, each new graduate confers a net benefit to taxpayers of about $127,000 over the graduate's lifetime. This is a benefit to the public of nearly $90 billion for each year of success in reducing the number of high school dropouts by 700,000 -- or something close to $1 trillion after 11 years. That's real money -- and a reason both liberals and conservatives should rally behind dropout prevention as an element of economic recovery, leaving aside the ethical dimensions of educating our young people.
Some might argue that these estimates are too large, that the relationships among the time-tested interventions, high school graduation rates and adult outcomes have not been proved yet on a large scale. Those are important considerations, but the evidence cannot be denied: increased education does, indeed, improve skill levels and help individuals to lead healthier and more productive lives. And despite the high unemployment rate today, we have every reason to believe that many of these new graduates would find work -- our history is filled with sustained periods of economic growth when increasing numbers of young people obtained more schooling and received large economic benefits as a result.
Of course, there are other strategies for improving educational attainment -- researchers learn more every day about which are effective and which are not. But even with what we know, a failure to substantially reduce the numbers of high school dropouts is demonstrably penny-wise and pound-foolish.
Proven educational strategies to increase high school completion, like high-quality preschool, provide returns to the taxpayer that are as much as three and a half times their cost. Investing our public dollars wisely to reduce the number of high school dropouts must be a central part of any strategy to raise long-run economic growth, reduce inequality and return fiscal health to our federal, state and local governments.

HEADLINE: Obama Voices Theme Of 2 Choices for Nation

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's election-year State of the Union address on Tuesday echoed a theme that has run through his career: Government and citizens are responsible together for the common good, even as they celebrate individualism and free markets.
As an obscure Illinois state senator, as a United States senator and as president, Mr. Obama has even used the same phrases to describe a communitarian credo rooted in American tradition, but vying always in his telling with a Darwinian alternative: you're-on-your-own economics.
And now he is framing the 2012 election as a choice between the two approaches.
''We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules,'' Mr. Obama said as he opened his annual address. 
He began with the story of his grandparents -- just as he did at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, in the keynote speech that made him famous. After World War II, his grandparents went to college on the G.I. Bill of Rights, bought a house with a federal loan and knew their grandson could go to the best schools, with aid if needed.
''They understood they were part of something larger,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday, ''that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share.''
''The defining issue of our time,'' he added, ''is how to keep that promise alive.''
Mr. Obama similarly challenged the 2004 convention audience: ''Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you tonight, we have more work to do.''
''People don't expect government to solve all their problems,'' he said then. ''But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life.''
He added: ''For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga: a belief that we are all connected as one people.''
Mr. Obama's argument reflects a long-standing debate, one that is especially divisive now, given Americans' polarization.
Yet voters are conflicted, as hostile toward government in the abstract as at any time in the history of polling, but demanding of government services, not least Medicare and Social Security.
On Tuesday Mr. Obama claimed a historical pedigree for his proposals, including initiatives to promote manufacturing, clean energy, infrastructure, education, research, mortgage refinancing and a tax code that asks more of the wealthiest Americans, both for fairness and for additional revenues to finance government ''investments.''
As precedents, besides the G.I. Bill and housing aid that benefited his grandparents, Mr. Obama cited Abraham Lincoln, who backed railroads and land-grant colleges; the public works of the Depression era; and the interstate highways built after World War II.
Such examples have been staples of his speeches for years. Mr. Obama typically traces American history from the Civil War and industrial age up to the current era of technological change, globalization and financial crisis. At each juncture, he argues, government has faced a choice between doing nothing or giving a hand to businesses and individuals and setting ''rules of the road'' to curb market excesses.
''We have faced this choice before,'' Mr. Obama said as a new United States senator in June 2005, when he delivered the graduation address at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.
With the rapid growth of cities and industries in the late 1800s, he said, ''we had to decide: Do we do nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over the economy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worst working conditions?''
America decided otherwise, he said, breaking up monopolies, allowing unions, establishing ''basic rules for the market'' and creating public schools.
In Republicans' response to Mr. Obama after his speech on Tuesday, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said: ''He seems to sincerely believe we can build a middle class out of government jobs paid for with borrowed dollars. In fact, it works the other way. A government as big and bossy as this one is maintained on the backs of the middle class and those who hope to join it.''
Mr. Obama set the tone for his third State of the Union address -- and his re-election campaign -- with his much-publicized speech last month in Osawatomie, Kan., on strengthening the middle class.
''There are some,'' he said then, without naming Republicans, who ''want to go back to the same policies that stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way too many years. And their philosophy is simple: We are better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.''
''This isn't the first time America has faced this choice,'' he said in Kansas, as he had in Galesburg.
He recounted the complaints of early-20th-century farmers, workers and consumers that prompted Theodore Roosevelt to deliver his progressive ''New Nationalism'' speech at Osawatomie a century ago.
Mr. Roosevelt ''believed then what we know is true today, that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But Roosevelt also knew,'' he added, ''that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you can from whomever you can.''
That line was an echo of September 2007, a year before the near-collapse of the financial system, when Mr. Obama spoke at Nasdaq as a presidential candidate on the need for tighter regulation of Wall Street. ''Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get, however you can get it,'' he said.
On Tuesday he proposed a fee for the largest financial institutions to pay for refinancing relief to ''responsible homeowners'' hurt by the crisis. ''Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same,'' he said.
''Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don't destroy the free market,'' he added. ''They make the free market work better.''

HEADLINE: A Mortgage Investigation

 BODY:
In the State of the Union address, President Obama promised a fresh investigation into mortgage abuses that led to the financial meltdown. The goal, he said, is to ''hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.'' 
Could this be it, finally? An investigation that results in clarity, big fines and maybe even jail time?
There is good reason to be skeptical. To date, federal civil suits over mortgage wrongdoing have been narrowly focused and, at best, ended with settlements and fines that are a fraction of the profits made during the bubble. There have been no criminal prosecutions against major players. Justice Department officials say that it reflects the difficulty of proving fraud -- and not a lack of prosecutorial zeal. That is hard to swallow, given the scale of the crisis and the evidence of wrongdoing from private litigation, academic research and other sources.
This new investigation could be the real thing. Eric Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, will be a co-chairman of the group, and he has refused to support a settlement being worked out between big banks most responsible for foreclosure abuses and federal agencies and some state attorneys general.
He rightly objected to the fact that in exchange for providing some $20 billion worth of mortgage relief -- mainly by reducing the principal on homeowners' loans -- the banks wanted release from legal claims that have never been fully investigated, including those related to potential tax, trust and securities violations in mortgage loans.
In the past year, the Obama administration has pushed back against Mr. Schneiderman, even as other attorneys general also left the settlement talks. By choosing him now to help run the investigation, the president appears to be embracing the call for a much broader inquiry that, properly executed, could result in a far bigger settlement.
For now, the administration is saying that the new investigation and the settlement talks will both proceed. It would be better to settle with the banks only after officials have a full picture of any and all violations.
There are reasons to be wary. Some of the federal officials who will also be involved with the investigation -- including Eric Holder Jr., the United States attorney general, and Lanny Breuer, the leader of the Justice Department's criminal division, who will be a co-chairman -- have not distinguished themselves in the pursuit of mortgage fraud.
To win and retain public trust, both the administration and all the group's co-chairmen -- there are also four other officials from the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- must agree on several steps immediately.
The administration must ensure that the group has ample resources. The co-chairmen must hire a tough-as-nails prosecutor with a successful track record in financial fraud to drive the investigation forward. And the group must move quickly and vigorously, issuing subpoenas and filing cases. It is not starting from scratch; various agencies have all had separate investigations under way.
President Obama's credibility is on the line. To restore public faith in the financial system, nothing less than a full investigation and full accountability will do.

HEADLINE: The New York (Mayor's) Review of Books

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
He controls a global publishing empire, but few would call him bookish. His city is a hotbed of writers and critics, but when it comes to literature, he pleads ignorance.
So it came as something of a plot twist last week when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, visiting a high school English class in the Bronx, confessed that he was not averse to a spy novel now and again.
''Have any of you ever read 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,' by John le Carre?'' the mayor, a touch of excitement in his voice, asked a classroom of wide-eyed 11th graders. 
The reply came in the form of a deafening silence, but Mr. Bloomberg was unfazed. ''I like spy stuff,'' he said, then offered praise for another book by Mr. le Carre, ''The Honourable Schoolboy'': ''It's 600 pages, it's mostly description, there is almost nothing that happens. But it's fascinating!''
Indulging in a tale of make-believe is rare for a time-is-money workaholic whose regular literary diet consists of periodicals (The Economist, The Financial Times, Aviation Week), political histories (''The Power Broker,'' by Robert A. Caro), and entrepreneurial bibles (he has been known to hand out ''The Innovator's Dilemma,'' by the Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen, to friends and colleagues).
Virtually the only other work of fiction publicly endorsed by the mayor has been ''Johnny Tremain,'' the 1943 patriotic children's story that Mr. Bloomberg frequently cites as a favorite. His personal library now has several first editions, gifts from friends.
But most of the mayor's reading material is news and nonfiction, according to aides, colleagues and friends who spoke about his habits. One former colleague, informed that the mayor had admitted to reading a novel, responded in shock: ''That's not the Mike Bloomberg I know.''
When Mr. Bloomberg began planning a run for the mayor's office, his advisers gave him biographies of Fiorello H. La Guardia and Robert Moses. The mayor is currently reading ''On China,'' by Henry Kissinger, according to a City Hall spokesman; others said he had enjoyed histories of Prohibition, the Bronx in the 1970s, and World War I aviators.
The mayor likes his iPad, but prefers his books on the printed page. He reads at night and on the road. And in what appears to be a lifelong habit, he often tears out magazine articles that he wants to read later and carries around the torn pages in a folder.
Recently, the mayor gave a copy of ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'' -- a collection of humorous stories by a zany professor of theoretical physics -- to a deputy mayor, Howard Wolfson. But his recommendations to friends and colleagues are more often public policy works, like ''The Scandal of Reform,'' by the mayor's public affairs director, Francis S. Barry, and ''Start-up Nation,'' a book on Israel's economy.
Joyce Purnick, Mr. Bloomberg's biographer, recalled once sitting with the mayor in Gracie Mansion near a shelf filled with New York City books.
''I asked him if he had read them, and he gave me a dismissive 'Are you kidding?' look,'' Ms. Purnick, a former reporter and editor for The New York Times, recalled in an e-mail.
The mayor is said to have little patience for television, and he once told a friend he had seen only 10 movies in his life.
For Mr. le Carre, Mr. Bloomberg apparently made an exception: he recently watched the six-hour BBC ''Tinker, Tailor'' miniseries on DVD, and on New Year's Eve, he and his companion, Diana Taylor, took in the recent film adaptation, starring Gary Oldman, at the Loews Lincoln Square theater on the Upper West Side.
''I saw it,'' the mayor said of the film. ''I loved it.'' But, Mr. Bloomberg added, it was better to have read the novel beforehand: ''You've got to know the characters.''
Harold Bloom, the Yale professor and literary critic, was asked for his thoughts on the mayor's reading list. He admitted he had never heard of ''Johnny Tremain,'' and was only passingly familiar with Mr. le Carre.
''Is that as advanced as our great mayor's taste gets, eh?'' he asked. ''Maybe his secret ambition is to succeed General Petraeus.''
Professor Bloom said he had talked about books with the mayor only once, ''when I was being made some sort of a lion or another at the New York Public Library; he told me he published a book and it was about 4 million on the Amazon list.'' (Mr. Bloomberg's autobiography, which he wrote with a co-author, was released in 2001.)
In the Bronx classroom, Mr. Bloomberg said that he was ''never good at literature,'' and that he preferred math and engineering. ''What I like about science,'' he said, ''is there's a right or wrong answer.''
Even so, the famously unintrospective mayor made an attempt to address the capacity of literature to examine human experience.
''When you finish a book, any book, it's interesting just to sit and take a couple minutes and say, 'What'd I learn?' '' the mayor said. ''That friend of mine who has a problem, maybe I can understand his problem a little bit better. Doesn't mean I have to like him or anything, but being a little more sympathetic can come out of something like this.''
That day's English lesson happened to be about a classic of the American canon, ''Of Mice and Men.'' Had the mayor read it? ''A long time ago.'' Did he remember it? ''No.''

HEADLINE: New Housing Task Force Will Zero In on Wall St.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
After failing to produce any major prosecutions stemming from the housing crisis, an expanded federal task force is planning a new tack, cracking down on financial firms suspected of improperly bundling home loans into securities for investors, officials said Wednesday.
The Obama administration tried to instill confidence in the effort by installing Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general who is viewed by liberal groups as a crusader against big banks, as one of the leaders of a new unit within the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. But skeptics still doubted the sincerity of the new effort.
The unit, announced by President Obama in the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, while Mr. Schneiderman looked on from a prime seat behind Michelle Obama, is the latest in a string of efforts undertaken by the administration over the last three years to prosecute crimes related to the financial crisis, bolster the housing market and help homeowners who are suffering under unaffordable mortgages.
Many of those efforts have met with limited success. The Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, created in late 2009, seemed little more than ''a press release collection agency'' being propped up by the Justice Department ''to collect examples of investigations or prosecutions that would otherwise have been brought,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, at a Senate oversight hearing in June. 
Officials said the new effort would be more focused than previous interagency programs to tackle the mortgage crisis.
''There have been investigations going on in various states and branches of the federal government,'' Mr. Schneiderman said, speaking to reporters in Washington. ''We're now making a concerted effort to pull everything together and move forward aggressively to address these issues.''
Officials said the unit would most likely focus on Wall Street firms, big banks and other entities that many people thought had escaped scrutiny for their role in the housing crisis. The task force will most likely follow the lead of New York and Delaware, which are investigating potential flaws in the creation of mortgage-backed securities that could lead to charges of tax evasion, insurance fraud and securities fraud.
The Delaware attorney general, Beau Biden, has not yet signed on to the new effort. ''We are willing to work with any agency that has the same interest in pursuing accountability in the mortgage finance industry,'' said Ian McConnell, the director of Mr. Biden's fraud division, which has joined forces with other states to pursue their own mortgage-related cases. ''But any collaboration has to be real and meaningful.''
With only a year left in the president's term, the task force also has a limited amount of time to produce results.
Mr. Obama told Congress that the new unit would include federal law enforcement officials and state attorneys general and would ''expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.''
That sounds much like previous White House efforts, particularly in 2009 when Mr. Obama outlined a new program to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of mortgage fraud, promising more money and people to target ''virtually every step of the process, from predatory lending on Main Street to the manipulation on Wall Street.''
But Tuesday's announcement shifted focus away from yet another faltering effort -- an attempt, led by federal officials, to reach a settlement between state attorneys general and the large banks on foreclosure abuses.
Administration officials had tried unsuccessfully to reach a settlement before Tuesday night's State of the Union address. On Wednesday, one of the crucial players, Kamala D. Harris, the attorney general of California, rejected the most recent terms, saying, ''We believe it is inadequate for California.''
Mr. Schneiderman has been one of the most vocal critics of the proposed settlement because he feared it would provide the banks with immunity that would prevent him from a larger investigation into the causes of the crisis. The fact that he was appointed to the new unit reassured him that the proposed settlement would not give the banks a pass, he said Wednesday.
''Obviously, there's no way that I or that any of the others involved are going to release any of the claims we're investigating,'' he said.
Mr. Schneiderman's office carries the informal title of Sheriff of Wall Street and has broad powers to police financial firms. In his year in office, Mr. Schneiderman, a graduate of Harvard Law who once represented clients like the American Stock Exchange and Merrill Lynch, has begun to use his powers. His investigations of mortgage abuses have zeroed in on the trusts that are supposed to hold bundled mortgages on behalf of investors. The trusts are incorporated in either New York or Delaware.
In August, Mr. Schneiderman intervened to block a proposed settlement between Bank of America and investors in mortgage-backed securities. He argued that the Bank of New York Mellon, which had negotiated the deal as the trustee for the investors, failed to act in their best interest and that the payment represented ''a fraction of the losses'' involved.
More details about the new working group will be offered in a news conference planned for Friday, administration officials said.
''The question is whether they are going to organize a real task force that is additive to what was going on at the U.S. attorney level, which proved to be inadequate,'' said Jeff Connaughton, a former chief of staff to Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware, who was active in mortgage-related investigations after the financial crisis.
While there could be new areas of investigation in the pooling of mortgages and the sale of mortgage-backed securities by Wall Street firms and others, many of the largest participants in those markets have already been investigated. ''The trail has grown cold on a lot of these cases,'' Mr. Connaughton said.
A criminal investigation of Angelo R. Mozilo, for example, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, one of the largest subprime lenders, was dropped by the United States Attorney in Los Angeles last February. The case was closed after the Securities and Exchange Commission extracted a civil settlement and levied a fine of $67.5 million on Mr. Mozilo, two-thirds of which was paid by the company and its new owner, Bank of America.
In December, the Justice Department brought a residential fair-lending case against Countrywide, which prosecutors said engaged in a widespread pattern of discrimination against qualified African-American and Hispanic mortgage borrowers from 2004 through 2008. The settlement of the case resulted in $335 million in compensation for victims.
Other companies, like Goldman Sachs and Washington Mutual, have already been looked at by either Justice Department officials or the S.E.C., sometimes resulting in large settlements. Administration officials said many institutions that have previously been examined could be looked at anew for illegal acts including tax or insurance fraud.

HEADLINE: President Takes His Economic Message on the Road

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
CHANDLER, Ariz. -- Fresh from a State of the Union address he used to make his case for re-election, President Obama took to the road on Wednesday to build support for his economic message of fairness, calling for Congress to eliminate tax deductions for companies that move jobs overseas.
''If you're a company that wants to outsource jobs or do business around the world, that's your right,'' Mr. Obama said at a conveyor-belt manufacturer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ''But you shouldn't get tax breaks for it.'' 
Instead, the president is proposing that Congress instead give tax breaks to companies that hire more American workers, or ''insource''-- a new term the administration has adopted of late.
''It's become more expensive to do business in places like China,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Meanwhile, America is getting more productive.'' So for many companies, he said, it is starting to make more sense to bring jobs home. ''We have to seize this opportunity,'' he said. ''And it starts with changing our tax code.''
Despite the White House push, the reality is this is an election year for a deeply divided Congress that has shown itself barely able to take care of routine business, so the chances of Mr. Obama's tax code proposal getting approved are remote, at best.
Mr. Obama is borrowing a page out of his playbook from last fall, when he unveiled his jobs proposal in an address before a joint session of Congress, and then went around the country assailing Republicans for not passing it. That tactic helped drive down approval ratings for lawmakers.
From their responses, Republicans apparently plan to stick to their playbook from last fall as well: bashing the president and his proposals. ''While it's an exciting event any time the president of the United States comes to town, Iowans don't need a president concerned about hitting the campaign trail, giving speeches and rehashed promises, just to save his own job,'' said Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''They need one who's actually concerned about their job.''
Mr. Obama's backers say the president can credibly make the argument that even in an election year, he is out there fighting for American jobs. The White House on Wednesday rolled out a series of proposals meant to increase manufacturing jobs.
His plan would require American companies to pay a minimum tax on overseas profits, in order to stop other countries from using low tax rates to attract American businesses. Mr. Obama is also calling for Congress to eliminate tax deductions that companies get for the cost of closing factories, laying off workers and moving production overseas.
And he is proposing creating a new tax credit for moving expenses for companies that reverse the trend and bring jobs back to the United States.
After Iowa, Mr. Obama headed to Phoenix, the next stop on his three-day tour. He is also scheduled to go to Las Vegas, Denver and Detroit, in a trip that will cover five politically crucial states.
The president seemed upbeat, beginning the day with a congratulations to the Navy Seals team that staged a daring raid to rescue two hostages in Somalia and ending in Phoenix, where he talked up his manufacturing proposals at a computer chip manufacturing facility.
Between those bookends, he smiled through a rope line in Iowa and called to mind the Republican caucuses. ''I know there's been a lot of excitement here over the past couple of months,'' he said, to laughter. ''It kind of made me nostalgic.''

HEADLINE: Heated Exchange on the Tarmac

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- President Obama's visit to Phoenix got off to a rough start on Wednesday afternoon when Air Force One was met by Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona - she of the book ''Scorpions for Breakfast,'' in which she accuses the Obama administration of turning a blind eye to illegal immigration because migrants will help Mr. Obama register more Democratic votes. 
Mr. Obama stepped off the plane and was greeted by Ms. Brewer, who handed him a handwritten letter in an envelope that she later said was an invitation to discuss the ''Arizona comeback.'' The two had an intense exchange for several minutes; at one point Ms. Brewer pointed her finger at Mr. Obama.
Afterward, she told reporters that Mr. Obama ''was a little disturbed about my book.''
''I said to him that I have all the respect in the world for the office of the president,'' she said. ''The book is what the book is. I asked him if he read the book. He said he read the excerpt. So.''
At one point, the two seemed to be talking at the same time, seemingly over each other. Mr. Obama appeared to walk away from Ms. Brewer while she was still talking.
Asked what aspect of the book disturbed him, Ms. Brewer said: ''That he didn't feel that I had treated him cordially. I said I was sorry he felt that way but I didn't get my sentence finished. Anyway, we're glad he's here. I'll regroup.''
A White House official, pressed to explain the encounter, had this to say: ''The governor handed the president a letter and said she was inviting him to meet with her. The president said he'd be glad to meet with her again, but did note that after their last meeting, a cordial discussion in the Oval Office, the governor inaccurately described the meeting in her book. The president looks forward to continuing taking steps to help Arizona's economy grow.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Iran Allows Interest Rates To Increase

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Facing a wave of panic selling by Iranians worried that international sanctions and inflation are destroying the value of the country's currency, the rial, Iran's president reversed himself on Wednesday and allowed bank interest rates to rise sharply in an effort to stop a slide that has depressed the rial to a relentless string of record lows. 
The decision by the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was an unusual about-face for the Iranian hierarchy, which has maintained a public stance of stoicism on the sanctions, imposed in response to Iran's suspect nuclear energy program. On top of four rounds of penalties by the United Nations Security Council, the United States, Europe and other allies have begun curtailing purchases of Iranian oil and limiting other financial transactions, increasingly isolating Iran economically to try to halt its uranium enrichment.
Mr. Ahmadinejad in particular has said that the sanctions will fail and that Iran is shrugging them off. He had long opposed the advice of economic advisers to raise bank interest rates to counter the rial's declining value.
But he apparently changed his mind after panicked selling of rials for other currencies and gold by Iranian households and small investors, which increased sharply on Monday, when the European Union announced its intention to stop buying Iranian petroleum. The semiofficial Mehr News Agency said a flood of rials for sale had ''thrown the markets into total disarray.''
The unofficial foreign exchange rate in Tehran has fallen to about 23,000 rials to the dollar, compared with about 11,000 to 12,000 to the dollar in December -- a 50 percent drop over a month. The weakened rial means Iranians must pay far more for goods, especially imports.
Under the policy change, announced by Shamseddin Hosseini, the economics minister, Mr. Ahmadinejad ''agreed to a decision by the Money and Credit Council to increase interest on interest-bearing accounts.''
The rates will rise to 21 percent, up from 12.5 percent, to encourage people to put their rials in the bank instead of selling them. Still, it was unclear if the move would ease anxiety.
Private economists had said Iran would have to raise interest rates sharply -- to at least a level higher than the current official 20.6 percent inflation rate -- in order to ease the selling pressure on the rial. But the inflation rate is believed to be far higher than the official number.
The policy change also appeared to be an acknowledgment that the disruptions to Iran's economy because of the sanctions, and Mr. Ahmadinejad's apparent inability to manage them effectively, could turn into a domestic political issue in the March 2 parliamentary elections.
Concerns about the sanctions have also reverberated through the global oil market because Iran is a major exporter, and if those exports were halted without a sufficient increase by other producers to compensate, prices could increase drastically.

HEADLINE: Parsing the State of the Union Address

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Sets Goal of Economy Built for the Long Run'' (front page, Jan. 25):
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Obama hit a bipartisan high note when he called himself a Democrat who believes ''what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: that government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.'' 
I wish the president had framed his entire address around this theme because it resonated not only with those in the House chamber but also with the American people from coast to coast.
As he prepares to take his message on the road, I hope that Mr. Obama will consider expanding this issue. I'd like him to say: ''I'm a Democrat, but an American first. We've had enough partisan fighting in Congress to last a lifetime.''
As far as I am concerned, it's full speed ahead to find common ground that benefits our nation, not just one political party. Like the president, this writer is a Democrat; but I remind myself daily that I'm an American first. It is in this spirit that I say ''game on'' for 2012.
DENNY FREIDENRICH Laguna Beach, Calif., Jan. 25, 2012
To the Editor:
In his State of the Union address, the president again proposed higher taxes on those earning in excess of $1 million a year, based on the belief that important programs and deficit reduction could be financed with such income. His critics label such proposals ''class warfare'' and socialist redistribution.
Gov. Mitch Daniels, in his Republican response speech, recommended, instead of the president's proposal, reforms to Medicare. He proposed that the same wealthy people should pay more for their Medicare than those of lesser means.
The principles behind the proposals of President Obama and Governor Daniels are identical. That clearly shows that what the Republicans object to is not the idea of having those who can afford it pay more; rather, if the president proposes it, the Republicans are against it.
ALEC FLAMM Palm Beach, Fla., Jan. 25, 2012
To the Editor:
If you cut through the clouds of partisan politics, this is a president who is in touch with the people he leads and recognizes what makes America great. This speech illustrates the great ability that Barack Obama has to see what policies the United States needs to guide it into the future: clean energy, a competitive job market that brings jobs back home from overseas, economic fairness and a sensible immigration policy, among many others.
Meanwhile, all the opposition offers is negativity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Swoops In And Frees Two In Somali Raid

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN, ERIC SCHMITT and THOM SHANKER; Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Khartoum, and Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker from Washington. Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington, Mohammed Ibrahim from Mogadishu, Somalia, and Timothy Williams from New York.Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Khartoum, and Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Around 2 a.m. Wednesday, elders in the Somali village of Galkayo said they began hearing an unusual sound: the whir of helicopters.
It was the culmination of a daring and risky mission by about two dozen members of the Navy Seals to rescue two hostages -- an American aid worker and her Danish colleague -- held by Somali pirates since October. The commandos had dropped down in parachutes under a cloak of darkness while 8,000 miles away President Obama was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The commandos hiked two miles from where they landed, grabbed the hostages and flew them to safety.
For the American military, the mission was characterized by the same ruthless efficiency -- and possibly good luck -- as the raid on Osama bin Laden in May, which was carried out by commandos from the same elite unit. Nine Somali gunmen were killed; not a single member of the Seals was hurt.
One pirate from the area who seemed to have especially detailed information about the Seal raid said it involved ''an electrical net-trap, flattened into the land,'' which presumably was the parachute. ''Then they started launching missiles,'' said the pirate, who spoke by telephone and asked not to be identified. 
Pirates operate with total impunity in many parts of lawless Somalia, which has languished without a functioning government for more than 20 years. As naval efforts have intensified on the high seas, stymieing hijackings, Somali pirates seem to be increasingly snatching foreigners on land. Just last week, pirates grabbed another American hostage not far from where the Seal raid took place.
American officials said they were moved to strike in this case because they had received ''actionable intelligence'' that the health of Jessica Buchanan, the American aid worker, was rapidly deteriorating. The gunmen had just refused $1.5 million to let the two hostages go, Somali elders said, and ransom negotiations had ground to a halt.
Somali pirates have held hostages for months, often in punishing conditions with little food, water or shelter, and past ransoms have topped more than $10 million. One British couple sailing around the world on a little sailboat was kidnapped by pirates from this same patch of central Somalia and held in captivity for more than a year.
President Obama, who Pentagon officials said personally approved the rescue plan and raid, had called several high-level meetings on the case since the two aid workers were kidnapped by gunmen who Somali elders said were part of a well-established pirate gang. ''As commander in chief, I could not be prouder of the troops who carried out this mission,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement on Wednesday. ''The United States will not tolerate the abduction of our people.''
On Oct. 25, Ms. Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, the Danish aid worker, were kidnapped by two truckloads of gunmen as they headed to the airport in Galkayo, a central Somalia town on the edge of pirate territory. The two were working for the Danish Refugee Council, one of the few Western organizations still operating in that area. The aid workers had just finished a workshop on land mines right before they were kidnapped.
Ms. Buchanan, 32, has been working in Africa for about five years and ''could hardly talk about Africa without tears in her eyes,'' said Don Meyer, the president of Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville, Pa., which Ms. Buchanan attended.
Somali officials immediately suspected that a local employee of the Danish aid group had tipped off the gunmen, and though American officials argued that the kidnappers were criminals with no direct links to any of the pirate bands that have attacked shipping lanes off Somalia, Somali elders said the men belonged to a well-known pirate gang drawn from local clans.
Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, the internationally recognized but relatively impotent authority based in the capital, Mogadishu, has little influence over the pirates.
Neither do the traditional, clan-based militias that still operate in these areas but cannot afford the weaponry or manpower now fielded by well-financed pirate gangs.
Somalia is also considered out of reach for conventional American military operations, though it has been the site of several Special Operations raids, usually to kill wanted terrorism suspects. American forces stage the raids from a constellation of bases ringing Somalia, in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya.
On Nov. 23, Mr. Obama called a meeting with top White House national security aides to discuss what to do about the two hostages.
Two days before that, Mr. Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, met with the Danish justice minister.
Then last week, officials learned Ms. Buchanan's health was getting worse, providing an ''added sense of urgency,'' said George Little, a Pentagon spokesman.
Top aides advised Mr. Obama that a clandestine operation might be required, and Mr. Obama began directing the planning for a raid, Pentagon officials said.
On Saturday, top national security officials held a videoconference to discuss the final options, followed by another videoconference on Monday evening. Ninety minutes later, Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead.
According to Pentagon officials, shots rang out within minutes of the Seal team's reaching the pirate encampment in Hiimo Gaabo, south of Galkayo. In the ensuing gun battle, the nine Somali gunmen were killed.
There were differing accounts as to whether the Americans captured any of the gunmen, with local officials saying several had been captured, and the pirate who spoke by telephone saying that ''five were taken alive.'' But Pentagon officials were adamant that no prisoners had been taken.
Shortly after dawn, the nine bodies of the dead gunmen were taken to Hiimo Gaabo. But there was little sympathy for them there.
Several elders said that they were pleased with the rescue operation, and they blamed Somalia's pirate gangs for sullying Somalia's reputation and causing inflation by carelessly spending millions of dollars of ransom money.
''The pirates are not taking our advice or orders,'' one elder said Wednesday. ''They are outlawed, and they are only making our image look bad.''
Somali elders have been trying to mediate in hostage situations, and a team had just returned from trying to secure the release of another American, a freelance journalist, who was kidnapped last week in Galkayo.
He remains in captivity in Hobyo, a pirate den on the Somali coast, because the pirates holding him refuse to let him go without a hefty ransom.
At 6:43 p.m. on Tuesday, as Mr. Obama put the finishing touches on his State of the Union address, he was told that the two hostages had been rescued and were safely in American hands.
As he stepped into the House chamber to deliver his speech, he looked right at Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta standing in the crowd and said, ''Leon, good job tonight, good job.''
At 10:32 p.m., after the speech, Mr. Obama called John Buchanan, Jessica's father, and informed him that his daughter was safe.
Asked whether this rescue mission signaled a new more aggressive tact against Somali pirates, the National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said each episode would still be reviewed on ''case-by-case basis.''
But Mr. Vietor added, ''Certainly, this sends a pretty clear message that the kidnapping of U.S. citizens will not be tolerated.''

HEADLINE: Djibouti Outpost Behind Somalia Rescue Is Part of New Defense Strategy

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An austere Pentagon outpost in the hardscrabble desert on the Horn of Africa proved serendipitously ideal as a launching pad for Tuesday's commando raid that freed two aid workers held in Somalia. The use of the base, Camp Lemonier in neighboring Djibouti, is also a signpost to the future, as the military focuses on ''economy of force'' missions that can preserve an American military presence and protect national security interests at relatively low cost.
A rescue mission from any other American base in the region would have added hours to the raiding party's mission to infiltrate Somalia and neutralize the nine kidnappers -- all were killed -- without injury to the Navy Seal team or the hostages. Basing the complex airborne assault on a warship would have been far more complicated. 
The ''economy of force'' concept involves using small numbers from the American military to set up installations in far-flung regions of interest, where they can be joined by personnel from other arms of the United States government, including the State, Justice, Agriculture and Commerce Departments; Customs and Border Protection; and the Agency for International Development.
While a hostage-rescue mission generates news, the day-to-day work at Camp Lemonier focuses on quiet efforts at improving the abilities of local militaries and law-enforcement personnel to protect and police their own territory, while assisting in building schools, digging wells, laying roads and vaccinating livestock.
Camp Lemonier is part of an archipelago of outposts in high-risk environments that also can serve as lily pads for commando raids and intelligence operations if required. It offers runways, communications, housing, a hospital -- and privacy.
''Djibouti is the central location for continuing the effort against terrorism,'' Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said during a visit to Camp Lemonier last month.
The trend in favor of a small American footprint overseas is expected to grow as Mr. Panetta must cut about $487 billion from the Pentagon budget over the next decade, even as he shifts more forces to Asia while not diminishing American deterrence and influence in the Middle East.
This military math may require the size of American forces to shrink in Europe and elsewhere -- and bases like Camp Lemonier will be expected to manage the risk at a modest cost.
Jennifer G. Cooke, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy center here, said the mission of the military's Africa Command originally was to upgrade the abilities of local security forces -- ''so the U.S. would not be drawn into conflicts or crises.''
''But the United States may not have the leeway of waiting to build up partner capacities to take on these kinds of challenges,'' she said. ''So, being nimble and flexible with a light footprint in a place like Djibouti, the U.S. military may be required to tackle these crises immediately as they arise.''
Another important military mission that deploys a small force on the huge African continent is in Uganda.
In October, President Obama ordered 100 Special Operations advisers to Uganda to help train regional forces combating the Lord's Resistance Army, a notorious renegade group that has terrorized villagers in at least four countries with marauding bands that kill, rape, maim and kidnap with impunity.
When Mr. Panetta visited Camp Lemonier, there were about 3,500 American personnel assigned there, up from the several hundred Marines and members of Special Operations forces that landed in 2003 when the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa relocated. It had been based on a warship when the mission was conceived a year before, dedicated to hunting for remnants of Al Qaeda in the wake of the Taliban's ouster from Afghanistan.
The units include a headquarters staff, civil affairs teams that include doctors and veterinarians, as well as engineers and military trainers. Mostly invisible to the local population, the task force has responsibility for a vast area of Africa that includes Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden -- almost 70 percent the size of the continental United States.
While the Djibouti outpost is hot and isolated, American military personnel do get an unusual benefit: a daily beer ration, prohibited under General Order No. 1 for troops assigned to Afghanistan and, previously, to Iraq.

HEADLINE: Obama Wades Into Issue Of Raising Dropout Age

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
President Obama's State of the Union call for every state to require students to stay in school until they turn 18 is Washington's first direct involvement in an issue that many governors and state legislators have found tough to address.
While state legislative efforts to raise the dropout age to 18 have spread in recent years, many have had trouble winning passage. Last year, for example, such legislation was considered in Alaska, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland and Rhode Island -- but only Rhode Island actually changed its law. 
''Efforts to raise the age usually come up against the argument that requiring students to stay in school when they no longer want to be there is disruptive to other students and not fair to the teacher,'' said Sunny Deye, a senior policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''Home-school groups often oppose raising the compulsory attendance age, and especially now, in this budget crunch, there are major concerns about the fiscal impact.''
In Kentucky, where the dropout age of 16 was set in 1934, legislation to move the age to 18 has failed twice. Gov. Steven L. Beshear's State of the State message this month made another push.
The dropout age, historically set at 16 in most of the nation, has been edging up. Currently, 21 states and the District of Columbia have compulsory attendance until 18, and 11 others require attendance until age 17.
Given that Washington provides only about 10 percent of education financing, the federal government's effort to dictate policy in an area that has always been left to the states may raise hackles.
''I will concede that having the federal government decree this, that's going to stick hard with some people,'' said Bob Wise, president of the Alliance for Excellent Education, which supports the proposal. ''But with almost a third of our students dropping out of high school, we have an economic crisis and we need to be sending a stronger message about the importance of education.''
And, he said, it would not be hard for the federal government to incentivize the higher age requirement by making it a condition of states' getting Race to the Top grants or other federal education money.
Several economists, over two decades, have found that higher dropout ages improve not only graduation rates but entrance to higher education and career outcomes. ''The evidence is quite robust that raising the school-leaving age increases educational attainment,'' said Philip Oreopoulos, an economics professor at the University of Toronto, whose study found, however, that exceptions to the law, lenience in enforcement and weak consequences for truancy could all interfere with an increase. ''Ideally, you use both a carrot and stick approach, so that if students have to stay in school longer you're also providing wider curriculum options that might interest them.''
In a 2010 report on the dropout problem, Robert Balfanz, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University, found that of the six states that increased the compulsory school age from 2002 to 2008, two -- Illinois and South Dakota -- experienced increases in their graduation rates, and one, Nevada, had a decline.
''It's symbolically and strategically important to raise the age to 18, but it's not the magical thing that in itself will keep kids in school,'' Dr. Balfanz said.
Most policy experts warn that to prevent dropouts, schools need a broad range of supports for struggling students, as far back as the middle grades.
''There's a whole array of reasons students drop out: teen pregnancy, financial obligations, detachment from the school environment, boredom, feeling the curriculum has no relevance in the real world,'' said Jennifer Dounay Zinth, a senior policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States. ''Schools need to intervene quickly if there are warning flags.''

HEADLINE: Q. and A. With Li Qiang of China Labor Watch

BYLINE: DAVID BARBOZA


HIGHLIGHT: The founder of China Labor Watch speaks about labor conditions at Foxconn, which has some of the world's biggest factories, and at other electronics factories. 

 BODY:
Li Qiang, 39, is the founder of China Labor Watch, a nonprofit group in New York City that seeks to improve labor conditions in China. In the late 1990s, while studying law in southwest China's Sichuan Province, he began supporting striking workers and taxi drivers. Later, he moved south, to China's biggest factory zones near Shenzhen. He worked at several electronics, toy and shoe factories, where he investigated labor conditions, and tried to expose what he saw as unjust and inhumane conditions. 
Now, Mr. Li works from a small office near the Empire State Building, employing a team in China that sneaks into factories, smuggles out photographs and publishes reports of illegal or abhorrent labor conditions at suppliers to some of the world's biggest corporations. David Barboza, the Shanghai bureau chief of The New York Times, interviewed Mr. Li after doing the reporting reflected in his article, "In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad," written with Charles Duhigg. 
Q.
For years, labor rights groups like yours have described sweatshops and how factories serving global companies have abused and mistreated workers. What is the situation today?
A.
They've improved a lot, but labor conditions are still poor. One reason is the local economy is directly related to the well-being of the factories. So the local government regulators don't want to enforce a high labor standard and force the factories away.
Q.
 But many big factories are audited by independent firms, hired by multinational corporations. Hasn't that improved working conditions in China?
A.
 Every year, 30,000 factories in China are audited. But there's corruption in the auditing process. The factories need to pass an audit, but fixed factory costs are high, so the factory bosses bribe auditors, that is less costly. If a factory has 500 workers, to improve standards you might need to pay each worker another $20 a month. But 500 workers times $20 times 12 months is $120,000 a year. It's much cheaper to bribe auditors.
For the international companies that had an audit done, they get what they consider to be an advertisement, or certification that they comply with all the standards. But this isn't a true reflection of what is happening. Last year, we investigated 100 factories in China. And we found that only about 10 percent of the factories can pass the their own the international labor standards of their clients - the multinational corporations.
Q.
What are some of the key problems you see when you visit the factories? What are they doing wrong?
A.
The pay is the biggest issue. Based on our investigation, most workers have signed a labor contract so there is some improvement. But then the factories conceal their treatment of the workers, like they've shortened the lunch break from one hour to 40 minutes, so the workers lose one day a month. 
Another trick for factories to lower the payment is a system called "overall working hour system." As we know, the normal working hours are 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. If workers work overtime on weekdays, the overtime wage should be 1.5 times the original salary. If they work on the weekends, the wage should be 2 times the original salary. What the factories do is to let the workers work 6.7 hours a day, 6 days a week. So when the workers work on Saturday, they only get the original salary rather than the 2 times salary required by law. And often, they don't only get paid with the original salary when overtime for working on Saturdays or Sundays, when you should pay double salary to them. This is the way the factories reduce the salary and increase productivity.
Q.
What is your impression of Foxconn, which has some of the world's biggest factories and is China's biggest export machine?
A.
Foxconn is not good. But if we compare all industries, electronics, textile, toys, Foxconn is one of the best. The biggest problem for Foxconn is the workers are working under a lot of pressure. They're standing 10 to 11 hours a day. Foxconn treats the workers like they are machines. 
They think about how many products they can produce, not about giving the workers a rest. But in the electronics industry all the companies are the same.
They say they've increased salaries, but Foxconn doesn't say the workers have to produce more products per hour. So they have to work even harder. And the worst thing is that Foxconn is the biggest company in the industry. So they set the standard in the industry. And the working intensity has already been audited by the multinational companies, thus meeting the standards set by Foxconn's clients.

HEADLINE: What Are the Odds That Stats Would Be This Popular?

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: If you can answer this question, you are on your way to making $180,000 a year: build a sequence of nearest neighbor classifiers around its tuning parameter K, choosing K using prediction accuracy estimated through tenfold cross validation. In other words, how do you pick the best way to estimate whether an e-mail is spam? It's why statistics courses are hot. 

 BODY:
"Most of my life I went to parties and heard a little groan when people heard what I did," says Robert Tibshirani, a statistics professor at Stanford University. "Now they're all excited to meet me."
It's not because of a new after-shave. Arcane statistical analysis, the business of making sense of our growing data mountains, has become high tech's hottest calling. There are billions of bytes generated daily, not just from the Internet but also from sciences like genetics and astronomy. Companies like Google and Facebook, as well as product marketers, risk analysts, spies, natural philosophers and gamblers are all scouring the info, desperate to find a new angle on what makes us and the world tick. Computing has become cheap and available enough to process any number of formulas. 
What no one has are enough people to figure out the valuable patterns that lie inside the data.
At North Carolina State, an advanced analytics program lasting 10 months has, since its founding in 2006, placed over 90 percent of its students annually. The average graduate's starting salary for an entry-level job is $73,000. Its current class of 40 students had 185 applicants, and next year's applications are already twice that. In 2009, Harvard awarded four undergraduate degrees in statistics. Two graduates went into finance, one to political polling and one became a substitute teacher. There were nine graduates in 2010, 13 last year. They headed into Google, biosciences and Wall Street, as well as Stanford's literature department. Globally, LinkedIn recently found that from 2009 to 2011 the new jobs with titles related to "analytics" and "data science" grew by 53 percent.
Stanford's Department of Statistics, both renowned and near so many Internet and bioscience companies, is at the center of the boom. It received 800 résumés for next year's 60 graduate positions, twice the number of applications it had three years ago. Graduates head to business school at a starting salary of $150,000 or more, or to Facebook for about $130,000. 
"We won't look at many people without a 3.8 average, and for the advanced program, an advanced math graduate exam in the top 10 percent," says Trevor Hastie, the professor overseeing admissions. Statistics, he notes, dictate that many in the top 10 percent have placed equally, with perfect scores.
Mr. Hastie and Mr. Tibshirani are the authors of "The Elements of Statistical Learning," a top textbook in the field. Their star course, called "Modern Applied Statistics: Learning," started a decade ago with 30 students. Its current enrollment just closed off at 190. "We try to give them long and difficult homework assignments," Mr. Hastie says. "Nothing works."
(F.Y.I., most of us would fail the course. This week's homework involves building a sequence of nearest neighbor classifiers around its tuning parameter K, choosing K using prediction accuracy estimated through tenfold cross validation. In other words, how do you pick the best way to estimate whether an e-mail is spam?) 
The two men also teach a two-day course for businesspeople called "Statistical Learning and Data Mining" that costs $1,450 and attracts a broad range of data-laden people. "We had two guys from Hong Kong who taught a course in horse race prediction," Mr. Tibshirani says. "One of them came back and told us they're making $10 million a year by modeling the last-minute betting."
Both men also consult for a number of well-known and emerging companies, but they worry about how many of their students will be drawn away from academics to the private sector. The boom in scientific data may be greatest in academia, particularly genetics. 
"The data are going to be very wide, with lots of genes, and deep, with billions of variations, once we're able to decode individual human genes for $1,000," Mr. Tibshirani says. "It will call for new statistical techniques, and new kinds of computation." His own recent work, on the ability to spot false discoveries, is aimed at the genetics problem. Another major life's work, his son, just graduated from Stanford and is teaching statistics at Carnegie Mellon.
About half of the Stanford stat professors have joint appointments with other departments, including economics, human biology and environmental science. "Statistics is unusual," Mr. Hastie notes. "It's a service field to other disciplines. It doesn't rely on its own work. It needs others."

HEADLINE: Sharp Drop in State Funding for Higher Education

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: State appropriations for colleges and students dropped by 7.6 percent, the largest decline in at least 50 years, researchers say. 

 BODY:
The latest casualty of the economic downturn is state funding of higher education. 
The annual Grapevine study, conducted by Illinois State University's Center for the Study of Higher Education and the State Higher Education Executive Officers, indicated that state appropriations for colleges and students dropped by 7.6 percent, the largest decline in at least 50 years.
Forty-one states cut their spending from 1 percent to 41 percent, with a third plummeting by double digits. Twenty-nine states diverted less money to higher education in 2011-12 than they did in 2006-7, and 14 provided at least 10 percent less than they did five years ago.

HEADLINE: Fewer Students Attending Their First-Choice Colleges, Survey Shows

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: A survey shows disturbing trends in financial aid and first choice attendance, as well as increasing support for liberal social views and a greater focus on academics. 

 BODY:
A survey of nearly 204,000 college freshmen who started school in 2011 indicated that only 58 percent of them enrolled at their first-choice college, the lowest percentage to do so since the question was first asked in 1974.
The survey, "The American Freshman: National Norms Fall 2011," is based on the responses of full-time students attending 207 institutions. It showed that first-choice enrollment has been dropping since 2006.
John H. Pryor, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of California, Los Angeles's Higher Education Research Institute, which conducted the survey, pointed to another statistic that might help explain the drop: 18 percent of students, or nearly 1 in 5, who are accepted to their first-choice school decided not to attend.
"When you look at those students, the primary thing that jumps out is cost and financial aid," Mr. Pryor said in an interview. "These students who were accepted and are not attending are much more likely to say they are not going because they did not get the financial aid they wanted."
The survey also indicated that incoming students were less likely to receive financial aid from grants and scholarships; more likely to engage in a number of positive academic behaviors, like studying for more than six hours a week and abstaining from alcohol; and that students across the political spectrum were more likely to espouse liberal social views, especially in support of same-sex marriage.
The full survey is below.

HEADLINE: The Navy's Stone Fleet

BYLINE: JAMIE L. JONES


HIGHLIGHT: Why did the Union sink dozens of whaling ships in Charleston Harbor during the Civil War? 

 BODY:
In November 1861, the whaling ship Leonidas sailed from New Bedford, Mass., for the last time. Five times before, the Leonidas had departed New Bedford Harbor bound for whaling voyages in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans; each time, the ship returned home with a hold full of oil extracted from sperm whales. Whaling was one of America's first global industries, and oil carried home in ships like the Leonidas lubricated machinery in booming factories and lit homes in the nation's growing cities.
That November, though, the Leonidas departed New Bedford with a hold full of stone. One month later, the ship lay in pieces on the sandy bottom of Charleston Harbor, one of some 30 merchant and whaling ships sunk there by the United States Navy between December 1861 and January 1862. The mass sinking may or may not have struck a blow against Confederate shipping, but it arguably marked the death of the great New England whaling fleet.
Since the early days of the Civil War, the Navy had been blockading the Southern coast in an attempt to stop the import of Confederate military supplies and halt the export of Southern cotton. Charleston was particularly difficult. Known to Northerners as a "rat-hole" because of the numerous navigable channels in and out of its harbor, it had sent forth countless successful blockade runners in the months after the Navy began tightening its noose. In desperation, the Navy bought up old whaling and merchant ships that, once scuttled, would create a barrier to the harbor; they called the ships the "rat-hole squadron" or, more commonly, the "stone fleet."
As acts of war went, the sinking of the first stone fleet of 16 ships was quiet, orderly and grotesquely picturesque. "The weather was delightful," wrote one New York Times correspondent who witnessed the first mass sinking. "The sky was belted around the horizon by an exquisite purple haze; and the water, far and near, presented a busy scene."
Starting around 3 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 19, a small crew of sailors on each ship pulled the cork out of a carefully drilled hole in the ship's bottom. As the hull filled with water, sailors standing on the tilted decks chopped down the masts with sharpened axes. After dismasting each ship and removing its valuable sails and rigging, the sailors rowed away from the gurgling wreck in small boats. The work continued through the next day, when the last ship, the Robin Hood, was set on fire. The ship smoldered as it leaned into the harbor before settling beneath the waves. A month later, on Jan. 25 and 26, the Navy sank a second stone squadron of 13 or 14 vessels, sealing off a different entrance to Charleston harbor.
Although the stone fleet had sailed south under sealed orders, the mission and destination of the doomed whalers had been an open secret and the cause of a noisy controversy. While some Northern newspapers applauded the stone fleet as a legitimate (if desperate) act of war, London papers joined voices with the Confederates to denounce it as an atrocity against nature. Detractors and boosters both believed that the stone fleet would permanently destroy the harbor. More moderate voices on both sides doubted whether it could disrupt harbor traffic even temporarily, if at all.
Oddly, the officer who directed the sinking of the stone fleet sided with the critics. Capt. Charles Henry Davis, a hydrographer, had spent his career studying tidal action in order make global waterways more navigable, but in sinking the stone fleet he believed he would be merely destroying a good harbor - even though he didn't think it would have much of a lasting impact. "This is a disagreeable duty, and one of the last I should have selected," wrote Davis in a letter to his wife. But Gustavus V. Fox, the indefatigable assistant secretary of the Navy who had planned the failed attempt to relieve Fort Sumter in April 1861, insisted on carrying out the plan. Davis called it "the maggot [that] got into Fox's brain," but he carried out his orders anyway.
Davis and the skeptics were eventually proved right. The stone fleet disrupted harbor traffic temporarily, but Charleston Harbor soon reopened. The shipwrecks on the bottom sank deep into the sand or broke up and floated away. New channels formed around the remaining ships.
After the Civil War, another retired sailor, Herman Melville, looked back on the stone fleet with angry cynicism. In 1866, Melville published a poem called "The Stone Fleet. An Old Sailor's Lament," in a volume of Civil War poetry called "Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War." The poem eulogizes the stone squadron in its first sad stanza:
I have a feeling for those old ships,
 Each worn and ancient one,
 With great bluff bows and broad in the beam:
 Ay, it was unkindly done.
 But so they serve the Obsolete-
 Even so, Stone Fleet!
In a way, Melville and the whaling fleet he eulogized had followed a parallel path. Melville had sailed around the world on whaling voyages before beginning his literary career, and his early South Sea novels "Typee" and "Omoo" were wildly popular and had made him something of a literary star. But "Moby-Dick," Melville's 1851 novel ostensibly about the American whaling industry, was a failure. Critics were confused and disappointed, and the book sold few copies. When Melville surfaced in 1866 with a strange volume of Civil War poetry, The New York Herald announced its publication with unconcealed derision: "For 10 years the public has wondered what had become of Melville."
Something similar might have been asked of the American whaling industry. For good and for ill, the whaling industry had driven an early phase of American industrialization and imperialism. Whaling was the United States' first foray into global natural resource extraction, and it had awakened a demand for fuel that still shapes our decisions about energy, economics and environmental responsibility today.
But it seemed, already in the first weeks of 1862, that the whaling industry would soon follow the stone fleet into obsolescence. Deep petroleum reserves had been discovered in Pennsylvania in 1859, ensuring a local and plentiful alternative to whale oil. As the second stone fleet sailed south in January, the Whalemen's Shipping List published a report stating that 1861 had been a year "of unparalleled pecuniary hardship" owing to the replacement of whale oil with petroleum and kerosene. The Petroleum Age had begun. Even as the Civil War raged, speculators raced west to throw their harpoons into the earth.

HEADLINE: California to Consider Major Revision to Zero-Emission Mandate

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: If the proposed regulation is adopted this week, it would require zero-emission and partial zero-emission vehicles to account for 15 percent of the marketplace in 2025, up from a current 4 percent. 

 BODY:
This week, the California Air Resources Board, commonly known as CARB, will vote this week on a staff recommendation to require a significant increase of zero- and near-zero-emission cars to be on state roads in 2025. If the program is adopted, it would effectively require the addition of 1.4 million advanced-powertrain vehicles in 2025. They would include 500,000 battery-electric or fuel-cell cars and about 900,000 plug-in hybrids, called transitional zero-emission vehicles, or TZEVs, by CARB.
The zero-emission requirements would be phased in beginning with the 2018 model year, and all but the smallest automakers would be required to take part.
"This is a big deal," Dave Clegern, a CARB spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. "But it's not really a course shift for us. We're trying to bring the parties along rather than shoving anything down their throats."
California's fuel-economy regulations tend to become de facto standards for other states. Any mandate put forward that specified the types of cars to be built and sold in the state could very well be adopted elsewhere.
Under the existing program, cleaner cars would account for 4 percent of vehicles sold in California by 2025. But the new proposal would expand the cars' slice of the marketplace to as much as 15 percent. "This is gradual, and manageable, using numbers that we developed in cooperation with the auto industry," Mr. Clegern said. According to CARB, plug-in hybrids, fuel-cell and battery vehicles would account for one out of every seven new cars sold in the state by 2025. And by midcentury, to meet California's rigorous climate targets, 87 percent of all cars on state roads would have to be classified zero emission.
The zero-emission car requirements are part of a larger package that also includes smog and greenhouse gas reductions. According to CARB, the whole program will lead to a reduction of 52 million tons of climate emissions by 2025. Also included is a mandate to build more hydrogen fueling stations in the state for the fuel-cell cars that Daimler, Honda, Toyota and Hyundai plan to introduce around 2015. The scarcity of these stations in California and nationwide is a point of concern for automakers.
California's regulators helped develop the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, proposal that would require car fleets to achieve average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Environmental groups mostly applauded the new regulations, and criticism from automakers was uncharacteristically muted.
Even so, requiring manufacturers to build clean cars doesn't necessarily ensure a market for them. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the 12 largest automakers in the United States, will offer testimony on some aspects of the CARB proposal during the comment period at the regulators' meeting that begins on Thursday and could extend into Friday.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the alliance, said in a telephone interview that government regulations should be technology-neutral. "They should set performance-based standards and let the engineers decide which products will meet it," she said. "Mandates can leave cars unsold on dealers' lots. There's always a certain 'Field of Dreams' thinking with regulations like this: 'If you build it, they will come.'"
"We support government playing a supportive role in building the infrastructure needed to encourage consumers to buy new types of vehicles," Ms. Bergquist wrote in a follow-up e-mail.
Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles had relatively lackluster sales in 2011, and advocates believe that California's regulations would help to spark sales.
To build demand, Stanley Young, a CARB spokesman, cites the work of the state's Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative, a public-private partnership. Mr. Young said the group was working "to make sure the state is ready, and that owning, operating and charging an electric vehicle is easy for consumers."
Jamie Knapp, the coordinator of the California Clean Cars Campaign, an umbrella organization for groups supporting the state's auto-related efficiency mandates, said the proposed regulation would simply codify what automakers already know to be true, that zero-emissions vehicles must account for a significant portion of their fleets by 2025. "The reality is we need to have advanced zero-emission vehicles on the road, and in commercial numbers to meet the state's long-term climate and air pollution goals. And we have to start now," she said.

HEADLINE: Don't Mind the Gap

BYLINE: ANDREW KOHUT


HIGHLIGHT: Polls are finding that Americans seem less upset by the existence of income inequality than by the perception that federal policies unfairly favor the rich. 

 BODY:
Washington
Income inequality has become a hot-button issue during this political campaign. A recent Pew Research Center poll, for example, attracted an extraordinary amount of attention when it found that 66 percent of Americans believed there were "very strong" or "strong" conflicts between the rich and the poor - an increase of 19 percentage points since 2009.
But while Americans are hearing more and more about class conflict, there is little indication that they are increasingly divided along these lines. People don't necessarily want to take money from the wealthy; they just want a better chance to get rich themselves. They care about policies that give everyone a fair shot - a distinction that candidates in both parties should understand as they head into the 2012 campaigns.
An awareness of economic inequality is not new. Pew surveys going back to 1987 have found an average of 75 percent of the American public thinking that the "rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer." As far back as 1941, 60 percent of respondents told the Gallup poll that there was too much power in the hands of a few rich people and large corporations in the United States.
Despite that longstanding sense of inequality, there is no more sentiment today for populist revolt than there was then. A Gallup poll last month found 54 percent believing that income inequality was an "acceptable part of our economic system" - a slight increase, in fact, over the 45 percent that held that view back in 1998. 
What's different these days is that a despondent public, struggling with difficult times and an uncertain future, is upset over a perceived lack of fairness in public policy. For example, 61 percent of Americans now say the economic system in this country unfairly favors the wealthy.
Pew's surveys in recent years present a detailed picture of these frustrations. One major complaint is tax policy: Dissatisfaction with the tax system has grown over the past decade, but the focus is not on how much respondents themselves pay, but rather on the perception that the wealthy are simply not paying their fair share. Just 11 percent of Americans say they are bothered by the amount they pay, while 57 percent of respondents say they are bothered by what they believe are unfairly low amounts paid by the wealthy.
Reactions to the bailout programs of 2008 and 2009 got the unfairness ball rolling. Early on the public was divided over the fairness of government helping financial institutions, and overwhelmingly opposed loans to Detroit automakers. Much of the public was even put off by plans to help homeowners facing mortgage foreclosures. By 2010, 51 percent said the bailout of the banks was the wrong thing for the government to do, while just 40 percent thought it was right.
No doubt outrage over Wall Street bonuses played a large part in this trend: Pew Research Center surveys at the time found 86 percent disapproved of high bonuses reportedly given out by many financial institutions, with as many as 62 percent saying they were angered by them.
Even recent reforms to financial-sector regulation have not allayed public concerns. In a poll last month, 56 percent of Americans said the power and influence of banks and other financial institutions represented a major threat to the country.
But before candidates read this frustration as a call for class warfare, they should recognize the limits of that approach. Americans are still confident that their society provides opportunities for economic mobility. In one recent Pew poll, 58 percent of respondents said they believed that people who wanted to get ahead could make it if they were willing to work hard.
The issue here is not about class envy. Rather, it's a perception that government policies are skewed toward helping the already wealthy and powerful. While a December Gallup poll found few respondents wanting the government to attempt to reduce the income gap between rich and poor, 70 percent said it was important for the government to increase opportunities for people to get ahead. What the public wants is not a war on the rich but more policies that promote opportunity.

HEADLINE: Challenging the Silence of Others

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: After confronting anti-Muslim hostility, Bharat Choudhary - himself a Hindu - set out to document how young Muslims navigate their way through the fears and stereotypes imposed on them in the West. His journey has taken him across several continents and cultures. 

 BODY:
Bharat Choudhary has seen the power of religious hatred up close. After the 2002 sectarian riots in Gujarat State, India, Mr. Choudhary counseled victims who had been paralyzed or raped during the violence.
His clients were Muslims. Mr. Choudhary is Hindu.
"My job was to talk with them, to counsel them and try to convince them that everything was going to be fine, even though I knew that nothing was going to be fine with their life anymore," he said. "That always stayed with me."
He was painfully reminded of that a few years later while studying photojournalism in Columbia, Mo. Once while walking home from class, two white men in a pickup truck tailed him. As the truck drove past him, they hurled insults, shouting "Osama! Osama!" The truck made a U-turn and stopped in front of him. The barrage of insults continued.
The provocation? "I was brown and had a beard at that time," Mr. Choudhary said.
The jarring encounter would prove fortuitous, becoming the topic for his masters project, photographing young Muslims who were born in the United States. He admits that at first, he didn't know much about them.
Mr. Choudhary, 33, started with a young couple in St. Joseph, Mo. who were trying to establish the first mosque in the area. He found other subjects by word of mouth, at social gatherings and through national Islamic organizations. After working in Missouri, he spent time in Illinois and North Carolina. In all places, he strives to go beyond caricature or easy cultural references in his images.
"I have very consciously avoided photographing in mosques or making hijabs, beards or skullcaps the focus of the image," he said. "What people don't know is what is their family and home life is like."
As a result, he was less interested in how young Muslims defined themselves religiously, as he was in their emotions and their expectations of American society. His subjects used words like stress, isolation, depression, humiliation and confusion to describe their post-Sept. 11 experiences.
"Many said they were ridiculed because of their beards, head scarves and their practices," Mr. Choudhary said. "Despite being raised in the U.S. or U.K., they do not trust the law enforcement agencies and they feel more prone to being victimized because they are Muslims."
He realized the central question for many young American Muslims was how to be both authentically Muslim and authentically American. They were often asked - sometimes with hostility- whether they were Muslim first or American first. In many cases, the young men and women had found equilibrium.
Mr. Choudhary continued his project in London after he moved there to be with his wife. He learned that the July 7, 2005 terrorist bombings resonated among young Muslims in Britain in the same way that the Sept.11 attacks did in the United States - on both sides of the Atlantic they had to confront fear and prejudice.
But he also found differences between the communities.
American Muslims were proportionately better educated and better off financially than their British counterparts. Mr. Choudhary believes what divides Muslims and non-Muslims in the United States is mainly religion, while in England they are separated by political, economic and religious factors. In Britain, some of the poorest communities are predominately Muslim.
He has no intention of stopping two years into his project, which has been funded by the Alexia Foundation and the Open Society Institute. A journey that was sparked by religious intolerance in his homeland and cultural intolerance in Missouri has led him to Europe to explore political intolerance.
From the Swiss ban on the construction of minarets, to the French and Dutch edicts against the Niqab - the headdress covering most of a woman's face - he sees Europe becoming increasingly hostile to Muslims. And he intends to be there with his camera.
"I can't stay silent," he said.

HEADLINE: Davos Grand Cru 2012

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: It no longer looks right to sip the finest wines as the world economy goes down the drain, so tastings have not been on the official schedule for years. Fortunately, the private sector stepped in to fill the breach - deliciously. 

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - If you gather enough millionaires and billionaires in a single place, the talk during the evening hours inevitably turns to wine. The World Economic Forum used to cater to them by conducting tastings, led by well-known critics, as part of its official schedule of events in Davos. Then the global financial crisis struck, and it no longer looked right to sip grands crus while the economy went down the drain. Wine tastings were taken off the schedule.
Fortunately, the private sector stepped in to fill the breach, in a manner that would probably be applauded by many Davos-goers.
In 2009, David Spreng, the founder of Crescendo Ventures in Silicon Valley, and Vidhi Tambiah, chief executive of the World Microfinance Forum Geneva, founded The Wine Forum, a non-profit "society of very senior public and private sector leaders who share a passion for fine wine and philanthropy.''
Members of the group pledge to match their spending on wine with donations to charity. They also know how to enjoy themselves while doing so. The forum organizes tastings, sometimes in the company of big-name producers. Several invitation-only events this week in Davos, taking place in private hotel bars rather than the main conference center, have been well attended.
To be sure, Silicon Valley types had to broaden their horizons beyond their beloved Napa Valley cabernets. On Tuesday night there was a "vertical" tasting of Chateau Margaux, allowing attendees to examine a number of vintages of this great Bordeaux.
On Wednesday night, there was a broader selection of claret, including several dozen grands crus classé. Producers like Michel Tesseron of Chateau Lafon-Rochet and Jacques Thienpont of Le Pin were on hand to pour their wines.
The highlights? Many of the wines were still young, but 2000 Haut-Bailly was all elegance and class, 2005 Angelus was enormously impressive, 2006 Vieux Chateau Certan was velvety and open and 2003 Lafon-Rochet surprisingly fresh.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Chinese Factories and the iEconomy

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The latest installment of the iEconomy series takes an inside look at the working conditions inside Chinese factories that make electronics. The authors say that inside Apple, the leader in the industry, there is an unresolved tension: executives want to improve conditions within factories, but that dedication falters when it conflicts with crucial supplier relationships or the fast delivery of new products. 

 BODY:
In the latest installment of the iEconomy series in The New York Times, Charles Duhigg and David Barboza report on the manufacturing of consumer electronics in China. They report that the workers assembling iPhones, iPads and other devices often labor in harsh conditions, according to employees inside those plants, worker advocates and documents published by companies themselves. Problems are as varied as onerous work environments and serious - sometimes deadly - safety problems:
Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Under-age workers have helped build Apple's products, and the company's suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors. 
Apple, they note, is not the only electronics company doing business within a troubling supply system. Bleak working conditions have been documented at factories manufacturing products for Dell, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Lenovo, Motorola, Nokia, Sony, Toshiba and others. 
But they note that Apple is the leader in the industry. Some former Apple executives, they report, say there is an unresolved tension within the company: executives want to improve conditions within factories, but that dedication falters when it conflicts with crucial supplier relationships or the fast delivery of new products. 
"We've known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they're still going on," said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. "Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn't have another choice." 
The first installment of the series examined why it is difficult to bring overseas manufacturing jobs back to the United States. A poll conducted by The New York Times found that the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs remains a major sore point for most Americans, but also found that owners of some of the nation's most popular electronics - including iPhones and iPads - are less concerned than other Americans about where their purchases are made.
The New York Times joined with Caixin, a Chinese business magazine, topublish the latest article in Chinese and solicited Chinese comments for translation into English. Read some of the illuminating comments here. 
A sample:
On Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern time, Mr. Duhigg will join an hourlong Facebook conversation about the iEconomy series on The New York Times's Facebook page: facebook.com/nytimes.

HEADLINE: Gillibrand Enters Volcker Rule Fray

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Democratic senator expressed concerns to regulators about the potential for "inconsistent enforcement across regulatory agencies." 

 BODY:
The Obama administration's effort to crackdown on banks placing risky wagers with their own money has met Republican opposition. 
Now a Democrat from New York State has also questioned the overhaul, known as the Volcker Rule. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, whose constituents include Wall Street banks, urged regulators this week to clarify how they would enforce the rule.
While there have been some rumblings among House Democrats about the controversial plan, including concerns that it goes too soft on Wall Street, Ms. Gillibrand is the most prominent lawmaker yet to wade into the debate. 
Ms. Gillibrand voted in 2010 for the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which gave birth to the Volcker Rule. Ever since, a patchwork of regulators has struggled to draft policies to enforce the rule, prompting concerns among even the rule's supporters. 
"There are a number of areas in which the proposed rules leave unanswered questions over the implementation and enforcement of the proposal," Ms. Gillibrand said in a letter on Wednesday to the leaders of the five regulatory agencies fleshing out the Volcker proposal. 
Named after Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who campaigned for curbs on outsize Wall Street risk-taking, the rule would limit most proprietary trading, where a bank places bets for itself rather than for clients. Such trading was once a big money maker on Wall Street. 
Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, both Democrats, spearheaded the movement on Capitol Hill to include the proprietary trading ban in Dodd-Frank. The lawmakers say that big banks should not be allowed to place dangerous bets while the government guarantees their deposits.
Ms. Gillibrand praised the rule-writing effort under way at the agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "This provision poses many unique challenges to regulators and I appreciate your diligent efforts to draft rules," she said. 
But regulators have clashed over crucial aspects of the rule, particularly about how to enforce it. The divide, most often between the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has triggered delays in the rule-writing. Most of the agencies first introduced a Volcker Rule proposal in October, months behind the timeline outlined in Dodd-Frank. 
That proposal now spans roughly 300 pages and poses some 1,000 questions for the public to address, reflecting it complexity and the extent of unresolved details. 
"One of the challenges," Ms. Gillibrand noted in her letter, "is in the number of regulatory agencies engaged." She voiced concerns about the potential for "inconsistent enforcement across regulatory agencies." 
The letter was reported earlier by Politico's Morning Money newsletter.
In Congressional testimony this month, regulators acknowledged some obstacles writing the rule. They noted that the line can be blurred between proprietary trading and legitimate market-making, a practice in which banks hold securities with the intent of selling them to a customer.
Proponents of the crackdown say that alarming assertions that Wall Street and the broader economy will suffer under the Volcker Rule are overstated. 
"It is specious to the point of misleading to suggest that the needs for liquidity currently provided by banks will not be filled," Wallace Turbeville, who represented Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit group that favors new restrictions on Wall Street risk-taking, told a Congressional committee this month. 
The Volcker Rule is not Ms. Gillibrand's only concern stemming from Dodd-Frank. Last year, she and her fellow New York senator, Charles E. Schumer, called on regulators to tread lightly while planning an overhaul of the derivatives industry.

HEADLINE: Could Marco Rubio Solve Mitt Romney's Hispanic Problem?

BYLINE: ANDREW GOLDMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A lot has changed since I interviewed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on the morning of Jan. 17. That evening Newt Gingrich unleashed theatrical opprobrium upon John King, and Mitt Romney went from presumed nominee to bloodied establishment candidate. 

 BODY:
A lot has changed since I interviewed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on the morning of Jan. 17. That eveningNewt Gingrich unleashed theatrical opprobrium upon John King, and Mitt Romney went from presumed nominee to bloodied establishment candidate. Rubio's home state of Florida, which votes Jan. 31, has become, pick your metaphor - ground zero, Armageddon, The Last Exit To Somewheresville - for both candidates.
The young, dreamy-for-a-pol senator long vowed to withhold his endorsement. But Rubio has tipped his hand a few degrees. Earlier this week, he trumpeted Romney's conservative bona fides and blasted the Gingrich campaign. So even though Rubio continues to blow off speculation he'll be in the V.P. slot, he seems to be cementing a special friendship with Romney, who, as you'll see in the following outtakes from my Talk column, will undoubtedly encounter some issues with Hispanic voters that Rubio could help sort out.
In debates, Mitt Romney tacked so hard to the right on immigration that some have said he cost himself the Hispanic vote - which he will need to take Florida in the general election. Can Romney win it back?
I'm not going to do the political analysis on immigration. I think ultimately whoever the Republican nominee is will become president and confront the reality that the status quo in our immigration system is not sustainable. We need a functional guest-worker program so that when there is the need for seasonal labor, that there's a way for people to enter this country legally for a defined period of time. But we cannot just give citizenship to 9 million to 11 million human beings in this country without the proper documentation. It rewards people who have not done it the right way and serves as a magnet for people in the future to do the same thing. On the other hand it's not reasonable to ask the United States government to help round up and deport nine million people.
During the last presidential election, Mitt Romney offended the Cuban-American community in Miami by saying onstage, "Patria o muerte, venceremos," which was Fidel Castro's signoff for many years.
Obviously someone helped prepare that speech and gave him bad advice. I don't think anyone walked out of there thinking that somehow Mitt Romney was a supporter of Fidel Castro. I don't think that's going to be an issue for him.
In the same speech, he also referred to you as "Mario Rubio." 
I think Mario is much more common than Marco. He's not the first or the last one to do that.
There has been a great deal of consternation among Hispanics that you don't support the Dream Act, which provides a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants. The conservative columnist Ruben Navarette wrote: "Marco Rubio is the Republican Party's Superman. And the immigration issue, if not handled correctly, is his kryptonite."
The Dream Act is the wrong way to do the right thing. There is support helping out these kids in this country who were brought here at a very young age illegally through no fault of their own, who have something to contribute to our country. But the Dream Act is not the right way to do it, because it leads to issues of chain migration and other things like that. Sure, 85 percent of the Hispanic/Latino voters support the Dream Act because to them the Dream Act is symbolic of an effort to help these kids who find themselves in this predicament. But the specific bill, the Dream Act, has things in it I don't think can gain majority support.
On "Face the Nation" last July you said that unemployment has risen significantly under Obama, and the only way we could solve our budget crisis was by getting people back to work and contributing taxes. In December, unemployment was down to a two-year low of 8.5 percent. By the election, how low would that number have to be to demonstrate that Obama has actually succeeded by your measure? 
I think what you're looking for is long-term trends that show that there's growing confidence and permanency in the economy. I'm not going to root against the economy. I'd much rather have unemployment go down than win elections. I think the fact that we've gone two years without a new stimulus package, without a new health care bill has been helpful to some extent in helping this happen, but part of it is just the resiliency of the American economy.
But you very clearly blamed the president for the poor shape of the economy. You seem unwilling to give him any credit at all if there's an upswing. 
Hold on a second. What I said is everyone needs to be judged by their record, and the record is clear. When his party controlled the Senate and the House, he could have passed any public policy he wanted, and what he asked for was the health care law and the stimulus package, and both of those have failed to turn our economy around. The public-policy decisions that president has made have actually slowed down this recovery. If you look at similar downturns in the American economy, the steeper the decline, the steeper the recovery. That has not been the case here, and in many ways the recovery has been stagnated by uncertainty in the tax code, by the rhetoric out of Washington, by the nastiness and the back and forth of the entire political culture.
Considering you once vowed to end partisan squabbling in the Florida House and recently said you're not interested in playing the role of attack dog, I was surprised to see you on TV refer to the "Democrat Party." You know Democrats consider it an epithet, right? 
Why is it an epithet? I didn't even know that.
It's actually been considered derisive since at least 1940. I looked it up. You really had no idea it drives them crazy?
No, that's silly. I don't believe in partisanship for the sake of partisanship, but I think there are dramatic differences between the parties on key issues including the role of government. There's nothing wrong with having an energetic debate about those issues.

HEADLINE: Newt Gingrich, Gold and Property Rights

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: There is a legitimate critique to be made of the monetary and banking system, but talk of returning to the gold standard, rather than addressing the mortgage crisis, is not a serious approach, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich wants to broaden his primary appeal by invoking traditional conservative values and by extending his list of recommended policy changes. Unfortunately, he has chosen to follow the lead of Ron Paul in moving toward the gold standard, rather than pick up on the ideas of Jon Huntsman - who emphasized the need to re-establish property rights in the United States. 
Ron Paul is right to question the balance of power that lies behind our monetary system (as I wrote here three weeks ago). And he is also correct that the current operating principles of the Federal Reserve tilt the playing field far too much in favor of very large banks.
But proposing the gold standard - or a commission to study how to reinstate the gold standard - is no kind of solution to these issues. The imbalance of power in the United States at the end of the 19th century, under gold, was just as extreme as it is today.

And the idea that pegging the value of the dollar or any currency relative to gold leads to financial and economic stability is an illusion. During the 19th century the dollar was freely convertible into gold - except when it wasn't. There were serious "suspensions" of convertibility about every 10 to 15 years; most of these were the outcome of boom-bust cycles in the private sector and had nothing to do with the government, which had a very limited monetary role before the Civil War. (James Kwak and I have a new book out in April; Chapter 2 goes through this monetary history.)
The gold standard is just a rule and rules are broken by powerful people under all monetary systems. Assuming that this won't happen in any future arrangement just encourages illusions.
Mr. Gingrich's other economic ideas, for example as seen in the latest debates, also seem to be edging toward the less serious side of Republican policy proposals - including very large tax cuts that would greatly increase the deficit.
There is a better way for Mr. Gingrich and other Republican candidates to appeal to the kind of ideas that really did make America strong.
Jon Huntsman argued that homeowners need effective protection against being expropriated - by banks or anyone else (including presumably a government that is beholden to the financial sector lobby). Mitt Romney may be edging in a similar direction (see this intriguing moment spotted by Dylan Ratigan and Eliot Spitzer).
Specifically, Mr. Huntsman argued that banks should be held accountable for all their wrongdoing during the mortgage boom. With regard to mortgages, he stated the need to address how homeowners were mistreated by lenders (including with the robo-signing scandal) and framed the issue exactly right:
"This is a basic question of rule of law; in this country no one is above the law. There are also serious issues involving potential violations of the securities laws, particularly with regard to fair and accurate disclosure of the underlying loan contracts and property titles in mortgage-backed securities that were sold. If investors' rights were abused, this needs to be addressed fully. We need a comprehensive settlement that puts all these issues behind us, but any such settlement must include full redress of all legal violations."
On Tuesday night, President Obama took a big step in this direction - in particular by announcing that he would establish a federal-state task force to investigate abuses in mortgage practices (presumably both the homeowner dimension and also the nature of securities sold to investors). Eric Schneiderman, New York's attorney general, will reportedly be co-chairman of the panel.
This is a natural conservative agenda - and the Republican candidates should not cede this territory to the president.
Without secure property rights, no investor is really willing to put money into a project. This is true for entrepreneurs but it is just as true for families.
Even worse, if a family already has most of its wealth in the form of housing, then anything that makes this wealth uncertain - like questions about clear legal title and who really is the owner - will seriously disrupt savings and consumption decisions.
Mr. Gingrich seems to feel the need to expand his conservative policy proposals. That's logical when the Florida primary matters so much - a defeat there for Mitt Romney could really change the course of the election.
But Mr. Gingrich of all people should recognize the historical context of secure property rights. This has long been a relatively strong part of the American economic model. We allowed this to be undermined by sharp practices (and worse) in some parts of the financial system. 
It's time to enforce the law and protect property rights, something Mr. Schneiderman has been emphasizing. If Mr. Gingrich wants to steal a march on his remaining rivals and win Florida, he should follow suit.

HEADLINE: Latinos on the Economy: Hard Hit but Hopeful

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Latinos are keenly aware that they have fared worse than other groups in the economic downturn, a Pew survey found, but they remain surprisingly optimistic that things will improve for them. 

 BODY:
 Latinos have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn, with nearly four in 10 - 38 percent - saying they have skipped meals because they did not have enough money for food, according to a national survey published on Thursday by the Pew Hispanic Center.
 With Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, Republican candidates for the presidential nomination, duking it out in Florida for Latino votes, the Pew survey paints in the background to show why jobs and the economy, rather than immigration, are the leading issues for many Latinos. 
Latinos nationally are keenly aware that they have fared worse than other groups, the Pew survey found. Yet they remain surprisingly optimistic that things will improve for them.
 Nearly one-third of Latinos - 28 percent - say that as a result of plunging home values, their mortgages are higher than the current value of their homes, Pew found; that is double the rate of 14 percent found in a national poll conducted last March of homeowners who are underwater. And 7 percent of Latinos who do not own a home said they lost theirs to foreclosure in the past year; 5 percent of the general population that does not own a home reported facing a recent foreclosure in a survey conducted in May 2010. 
 About 37 percent of Latinos said they had trouble receiving or paying for medical care for their families.

 More than half of the Latinos in the United States - 52 percent - are immigrants, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, based on census data. The economic pain is more severe among them than among native-born Latinos, with 43 percent of the immigrants surveyed saying they missed meals because they could not buy food. 
 Yet two-thirds of Latinos said they expected their finances to improve in the coming year, and about two-thirds expected their children to do better than they did, Pew found. In a Pew survey conducted last March, only 48 percent of the general public expected the next generation to have better lives. 
 About 11 percent of Florida's registered Republicans are Latinos, according to official figures from the Florida secretary of state. Florida's Latinos include many Cubans, who vote Republican more frequently than other Latinos and whose views may diverge from those of the Hispanic population as a whole.
 Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Mr. Romney has taken a hard line on immigration, saying illegal immigrants should "self-deport." Mr. Gingrich has said he also opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants, but he would give legal status to some who have lived in the country for many years and to illegal immigrant students who agreed to serve in the military. Latinos nationwide overwhelmingly support policies to give legal status to illegal immigrants, Pew has found. Mr. Romney is betting that the economic issues will be more urgent to Latinos in Florida, where the housing crisis has been especially deep and long-lasting. 
 The survey is based on telephone interviews from Nov. 9 to Dec. 7 of a national sample of 1,220 Latinos, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Mr. Cameron's Excellent Adventure

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: 2011 was a tough year for Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain - the London riots, allegations of cronyism around the phone hacking scandal, and widespread predictions of his early political demise - but 2012 has been better and at Davos he seems uncharacteristically happy, even lighthearted. 

 BODY:
Despite David Cameron's downbeat talk about the euro zone, the British prime minister appears to be enjoying himself on the Continent. Shortly after delivering a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr. Cameron dropped in on a private afternoon tea in a cafe on the Davos main street, the Promenade. There, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, was detailing a new advertising campaign to promote investment in Britain, in conjunction with the 2012 London Olympics.
The ads, Mr. Johnson joked, were inspired by the old campaign for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, in which Tony the Tiger proclaims that the cereal is "grrrrrreat!" Posters show different aspects of Britain, from historical sites like Stonehenge to businessmen like Richard Branson, with tag lines including "Heritage is GREAT Britain'' and "Entrepreneurs are GREAT Britain."
When Mr. Johnson introduced Mr. Cameron, praising a speech in which, the mayor said, the prime minister had demonstrated why the euro was "doomed to fail," Mr. Cameron quickly shushed him, and began talking about London's Olympic preparations instead. Bashing Europe may play well with British euroskeptics, but is not necessarily a great prelude to a pitch for investment.
Mr. Cameron, Mr. Johnson and other British politicians, like George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, seem to have a jaunty spring in their step in Davos, marching up and down the Promenade with only a few handlers - a far cry from the vast security details that typically accompany, say, U.S. officials.
Yet not every British luminary in Davos decided to show up at what was billed as a "great British tea party." Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones had been widely expected to make an appearance until a British tabloid, The Sun, got wind of the news, proclaiming, "Sir Mick Jagger teams up with the Tories," in reference to Mr. Johnson's and Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party.
That prompted Mr. Jagger, who had been seen on the Davos party circuit Wednesday night, to send his regrets for the Thursday event. He issued this statement:
''During my career I have always eschewed party politics and came to Davos as a guest, as I thought it would be stimulating. I have always been interested in economics and world events. I now find myself being used as a political football and there has been a lot of comment about my political allegiances which are inaccurate. I think it's best I decline the invitation to the key event and curtail my visit.''
Mr. Johnson, not to be outdone, joked that Mr. Cameron had been drafted as a stand-in for the rocker, adding: "You can't always get what you wa-ant.''

HEADLINE: Romney Holds Fire On Gingrich as Surrogates Fire Away

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In Jacksonville, Fla., Mitt Romney criticized President Obama's economic policies, but only alluded once to his Republican rival, Newt Gingrich. 

 BODY:
1:38 p.m. | Updated JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Standing before a large "Obama Isn't Working" sign, Mitt Romney came to a printing plant that recently shut its doors and returned his focus squarely to President Obama, criticizing everything from the president's policies to his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
In recent days, Mr. Romney has been attacking Newt Gingrich on the stump, and his campaign has organized so many conference calls critical of Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, that on a call Thursday morning, reporters struggled to ask a single question. And the campaign on Thursday described Mr. Gingrich as "unhinged" and released ascathing statementfrom Bob Dole assailing him. 
But standing outside Paramount Printing here, Mr. Romney only alluded to Mr. Gingrich once.
"I want to use the experience I've had, working in the real economy, to go to Washington and fix it," said Mr. Romney, trying to adopt an outsider's mantle. "Now, if you think that you really need someone who's been part of the culture of Washington for the last 35 years to go there again and continue in Washington, why there are other people you can choose."
He concluded: "But if you want someone who's actually run a business, run two businesses, helped run an Olympics and helped run a state, who hasn't lived in Washington but is intent on changing Washington and making it work for the American people, then I'm the person to vote for on Tuesday. " 
Mr. Romney pointed to the shuttered plant as yet another sign of the struggling economy under Mr. Obama. "This is not a happy day here at this plant, of course, but it's an indication of what's gone wrong with this administration," he said, accusing Mr. Obama of becoming overzealous with government regulations. 
"Do you realize in his first two years in office, he hired 274,000 new regulators?" he said. "It's one of those regulators that came here and poked around the plant and said 'This is a problem, that's a problem, we're going to fine you for this, and fine you for that.' Business feels like they're the enemy of this administration, and they have been."
Mr. Romney was referring to fines the plant received from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Jon Cummin, the company's president, said that the agency had cited several small safety risks, including a bar on an exit door that they had not trained employees to properly lift off, and an electrical cord that was not grounded. The company fixed all of the violations, and settled the fine for roughly $7,000, roughly 40 percent of the original fine.
Mr. Cummin said that while the regulators' concerns and the ensuing fines did not lead to the closing of the plant, it certainly did not help. 
"At the end of the day, the fine was not so large that it was insurmountable," said Mr. Cummin, who added that he had not yet decided who to vote for in the Republican primary. "It was just another example of how business is challenging enough without these crackdowns."
In his remarks at the plant, Mr. Romney also characterized Mr. Obama's presidency as one of perpetual negative deja vu.
"This has been a Groundhog Day presidency - he keeps saying the same things, and we keep waking up and the same things are going on," Mr. Romney said. "Nothing changes. He said he was the candidate of change, but you still have 25 million people out of work, almost 10 percent unemployment here in Florida. You still have home values down and continuing to go down."
Turning to the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama seemed stuck in a "Fantasy Land," a reference to a speech the president gave last week at Disney World.
"And he spoke about how things were on the right track in America and in Florida," Mr. Romney said. " If you believe things are on the right track in America, then you ought to vote for Barack Obama. If you believe, like I do, that he has not put things on the right track, that we're on the wrong track, and that we need to change course in this country and get back to American values and American principles, then I want your vote on Tuesday."
Mr. Romney came to Florida hoping to blunt the momentum of Mr. Gingrich, who left South Carolina last week with a resounding win, spurred largely by two strong debate performances. Referring to Thursday night's debate, Mr. Romney joked, "I can't wait."
"This is going to be fun again, you know that," he said. "We're going to have some choice times talking about the president and his failures. We'll probably talk a good deal about the State of the Union address, and how badly mischaracterized he has described our nation at a time when so many people are suffering in this state and across the country."
Referring to his Republican rivals, he added: "We may talk about the differences between ourselves, as well. There may be good give and take. That's always fun and entertaining, I know."
He urged the audience to attend the debate, and when some shouted that they didn't have seats, Mr. Romney replied: "No tickets, huh? Well, just storm in!"

HEADLINE: House Democrats Embrace Obama's Newfound Combativeness

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At their annual retreat, House Democrats appeared to be buoyed by President Obama's turn toward a populist confrontational approach to Republicans in Congress. 

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Md. - The on-again-off-again relationship between Barack Obama and House Democrats appears to be on again with the president's turn toward a more populist, confrontational tone on the Republican Party. 
Meeting here for their annual retreat, House Democrats appeared to be buoyed by Mr. Obama's State of the Union address, his new class-conscious emphasis on "fairness" for the middle class and his public castigation of Republicans for failing to cooperate on his agenda. 
Congressional Democrats had expressed frustration - even anger - in the past, sometimes because they saw Mr. Obama as too quick to compromise, and sometimes because they feared his broadsides against Congress would harm incumbents in the coming election.
But as they try to put control of the House in play, Democratic leaders are now encouraging confrontation, and they say they will deliver that message to the president and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday, when both are scheduled to address them.
"Not only is it O.K. for the president to run against Congress, I encourage him," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader.
In some ways, Mr. Obama's message remains at cross-purposes with the House Democratic minority. The president has to convince voters that the economy and the country writ large, is improving on his watch, while House Democrats are portraying Washington as broken and the middle class as struggling against powers beyond their control. 
Democratic leaders here tried to finesse that divide. Representative Xavier Becerra of California, the caucus vice chairman, proclaimed "America is coming back," as Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, lamented that too many people were still unemployed or underwater on their mortgages.
But House Democrats, who need 25 seats to win back control, sometimes slip off message. Representative Henry A. Waxman of California said the Democratic message was getting through "to people that are frightened by an economy that is pushing them down," who want "to get somebody to care about them."
That message doesn't necessarily work for the party that controls the White House and the Senate.
Mr. Waxman said House Democrats understood that they could not go it alone if they hoped to chip away at the Republican majority or win back the House.
"We're both going to rise or fall together," he said. "We depend on the president doing well, and he relies on us to get his message across."
That unity is extending now to the most liberal members of the Democratic Party, who have been most at odds with the White House.
"Unity is not necessarily unanimity on every issue," said Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a leader in the House Progressive Caucus. But referring to the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, he added, "not one Democrat prefers Romney or Gingrich or Santorum."

HEADLINE: Fact Check: Profiting From the Housing Crisis


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich have accused each other of profiting from the housing crisis. Both charges are misleading. 

 BODY:
Seeking to exploit questions over Mitt Romney's investments, Newt Gingrich attacked Mr. Romney on Thursday night for profiting from the housing woes of Florida residents.
"Governor Romney owns shares, has an investment in Goldman Sachs, which is today foreclosing on Floridians," Mr. Gingrich charged. "So maybe Governor Romney, in the spirit of openness, should tell us how much money he's made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments."
The attack is one Mr. Gingrich first unveiled earlier in the day on the campaign trail, when he appeared at a Tea Party rally and responded to Mr. Romney's attacks on him for his advocacy by saying he thought "someone who owns stock in a place that forecloses on Floridians has a lot of gall to start raising the issue."
Both charges are misleading.
Most of Mr. Romney's assets, along with those of his wife, are held in blind trusts. Those trusts, managed by a trustee without input from Mr. Romney, include among dozens of assets an an investment in a Goldman Sachs fund -- one of many -- that in turn invests in mortgage-backed securities. Some of those securities are linked to adjustable rate mortgages from banks. And some of those banks, or the companies that now own them, are known to be engaged in foreclosure proceedings in Florida, along with other states.
To sum up: The Romneys have assets in a blind trust that invests in a fund that invests partly in securities backed by some banks that are attempting or have attempted to foreclose on some people in Florida.
But it is not clear how much money -- if any -- Mr. Romney's trusts may have earned (or lost) as a result of those investments. And at any rate, those investments would have been made without his knowledge or guidance.

HEADLINE: Jacksonville Debate Fact Check

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements made by the Republican presidential candidates in Thursday night's debate. 

 BODY:
Profiting From the Housing Crisis 
Seeking to exploit questions over Mitt Romney's investments, Newt Gingrich attacked Mr. Romney tonight for profiting from the housing woes of Florida residents.
"Governor Romney owns shares, has an investment in Goldman Sachs, which is today foreclosing on Floridians," Mr. Gingrich charged. "So maybe Governor Romney, in the spirit of openness, should tell us how much money he's made off of how many households that have been foreclosed by his investments."
The attack is one Mr. Gingrich first unveiled earlier in the day on the campaign trail, when he appeared at a Tea Party rally and responded to Mr. Romney's attacks on him for his consulting work for Freddie Mac by saying, "Someone who owns stock in a place that forecloses on Floridians has a lot of gall to start raising the issue."
Both charges are misleading.
Most of Mr. Romney's assets, along with those of his wife, are held in blind trusts. Those trusts, managed by a trustee without input from Mr. Romney, include among dozens of assets an investment in a Goldman Sachs fund that in turn invests in mortgage-backed securities. Some of those securities are linked to adjustable-rate mortgages from banks. And some of those banks, or the companies that now own them, are known to be engaged in foreclosure proceedings in Florida, along with other states.
To sum up: The Romneys have assets in a blind trust that invests in a fund that invests partly in securities backed by some banks that are attempting or have attempted to foreclose on some people in Florida.
But it is not clear how much money -- if any -- Mr. Romney's trusts have earned (or lost) as a result of those investments. And at any rate, those investments would have been made without his knowledge or guidance.
-- 
Israel and the Palestinian People 
Mr. Romney said President Obama "threw Israel under the bus" by criticizing its construction of Jewish settlements while not condemning the hail of rockets sent into Israel from the Gaza Strip. But in December 2008, as a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama referred specifically to these attacks, declaring, "If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing."
Mr. Obama also condemned rocket attacks on Israel in speeches before the United Nations in 2009 and 2011.
Mr. Gingrich, repeating a charge he first made in early December, asserted that the Palestinian people were "technically an invention in the late 1970s." But the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in 1964 to lobby for the rights of the Arab people who had historically lived in lands that became part of Israel. Historians trace the identity of Palestinians back to the early decades of the 20th century.
-- 
Romney Voting Democrat
Mitt Romney said, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot."
However, he has said that he voted for Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, when he ran in 1992 for the presidential nomination against Bill Clinton, among others.
That was the same day, and the same year, that President George H.W. Bush and Pat Buchanan were on the Republican ballot.
As an independent, Mr. Romney could have voted in either party's primary, and apparently chose to vote for the Democrat.
Mr. Romney has said that it was clear that Mr. Bush was going to win the Massachusetts primary -- he did, with 65 percent of the vote -- and that he voted in the Democratic primary simply to try to stop Bill Clinton.
(Despite Mr. Romney's support for Mr. Tsongas that year, Mr. Bush has said he supports Mr. Romney now.)
-- 
Fannie and Freddie Created the Housing Bubble
Earlier in the debate, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies now under government conservatorship, came under attack for helping to cause the housing crisis, which is nearly five years old. But that significantly exaggerates their role in the crisis, in the view of numerous nonpartisan analysts. By attacking the companies, rivals of Mr. Gingrich by extension attack him, since his company earned more than $1 million as a consultant for Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2006. So it was that Mr. Romney prominently criticized them, saying, "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were a big part of why we have the housing crisis," then adding that Mr. Gingrich "should have been anxiously telling people that these entities were causing a housing bubble that would cause a collapse that we've seen here in Florida and around the country."
Those, especially Republicans, who put much blame on the mortgage finance companies and the federal government say that because of federal mandates that Fannie and Freddie encourage affordable mortgage loans, the companies enabled mortgages to be granted to people who could not afford them and then invested heavily in securities that packaged these subprime loans, many of which went bust. But numerous analysts and reports have shown that Fannie and Freddie belatedly invested in subprime mortgages in 2005 and 2006 because Wall Street firms were way ahead of them and seizing market share. Many of these analysts are hardly fans of the companies but criticize them for other reasons. When it comes to the financial crisis that began in 2007, Fannie and Freddie were more victim than villain, they say.
The Times's Joe Nocera has written several columns on the subject, including this one: "An Inconvenient Truth."
-- 
Gingrich and Balanced Budgets 
Clearly, Newt Gingrich is not reading the myriad fact-checking articles about these Republican debates. Once again, he incorrectly took credit for four balanced budgets while he was House speaker. But it makes for easy fact checking when we can simply repeat what we have written before. Here is what The Times wrote last week:
It is a claim Mr. Gingrich makes almost every day on the campaign trail, but it is based on an odd timeline. The years of balanced budgets in question are from fiscal 1998 through 2001, but Mr. Gingrich was in office for only the first two. He left the House in January 1999 and had no role in crafting the budgets for the subsequent two years.
When pressed on this discrepancy, Mr. Gingrich sometimes argues that he deserves credit for policies enacted in the 1990s that promoted economic prosperity and established a climate for balancing budgets that carried beyond his time in office.
This is at least the third time The Times has fact-checked this claim. PolitiFact has also looked into it repeatedly, most recently at the last Fox News debate in Iowa in December, when it was rated "false."
This time makes four. But even before The Times could react, Ron Paul did. Mr. Paul, who was in the House while Mr. Gingrich was speaker, said to him, "I think you've stretched that a little bit more than you should have."
-- 
Obama's Policy in Latin America 
Mr. Santorum said President Obama's policy in Latin America was "abysmal," singling out his response to a coup that removed the president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya. Mr. Santorum said the administration sided with leftist leaders like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba over the people of Honduras. In fact, Mr. Zelaya was the legitimately elected leader of Honduras.
Some Republicans in Congress called for the United States to recognize Roberto Micheletti, a parliamentary leader who was installed in the presidency. But the White House refused, trying instead to broker a deal to bring Mr. Zelaya home from exile to serve out the remainder of his term. When that failed, the United States accepted the results of a new election, in which a third person, Porfirio Lobo, was elected president.
-- 
'Language of the Ghetto'
Mr. Gingrich was asked if he had called Spanish "the language of the ghetto," as a new ad from the Romney campaign suggests.
Mr. Gingrich said he had not.
This is accurate, given the original context of his remarks. Mr. Gingrich said, "We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto."
Based on that quotation, the Romney campaign ad accused Mr. Gingrich of saying that Spanish "is the language of the ghetto."
Mr. Gingrich did not specifically refer to Spanish in that remark, though many assumed that was his intent, and he later apologized for his word choice-in Spanish.
-- 
Number of Languages Spoken at Miami Dade College
Mr. Gingrich exaggerated when he said 94 languages were spoken at Miami Dade College, but he got the number right just days ago at Monday's debate - 86. His earlier statement - like tonight's, characteristic of Mr. Gingrich, who commonly drops obscure "facts" into his rhetoric - prompted the nonpartisan fact checkers at PolitiFact.com to get to work. PolitiFact quoted a college spokesman as saying that in the 2010-11 school year, students spoke 85 languages besides English, for a total of 86. "We rate this claim verdad, or vrai, or true," it said.
-- 
Self-Deportation
Wolf Blitzer asked Newt Gingrich whether Mitt Romney is anti-immigrant; a Gingrich campaign Spanish-language radio ad called Mr. Romney "anti-immigrant."
While saying Mr. Romney is "anti-immigrant" may be hyperbole, during the primary campaign, Mr. Romney has moved well to the restrictionist right on immigration. He took his "self-deportation" idea from groups, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, that not only oppose benefits for illegal immigrants but also seek big reductions in legal immigration.
Mr. Romney generally rules out any opening for illegal immigrants. His plan is to create an airtight national system of worker verification, based on a secure identity card. Illegal immigrants without cards would not be able to find jobs, Mr. Romney argues, and soon they would pack up and leave-they would "self-deport."
Mr. Romney has said that as president he would veto a bill known as the Dream Act, which would give legal status to immigrant students brought to the United States illegally as children, if they finish two years of college or military service. But in Monday night's debate, he said he would approve the Dream Act for those who serve in the military, although not for college students.
He opposes state laws like the one in Texas that allows children of illegal immigrant residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates.
Mr. Romney also welcomed the endorsement of Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who was an author of laws based on the self-deportation strategy that were adopted in Arizona and several other states, designed to drive illegal immigrants out of those states.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Debate No. 19 Means Everything

BYLINE: DAN SCHNUR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has a lot to worry about. 

 BODY:
It's the most important night of Mitt Romney's political life.
Us pundit types tend to get a little bit overwrought when framing presidential campaigns as a series of breathless and seminal do-or-die moments. But Romney's current predicament and challenge is such that it's not difficult to see how the outcome of the Republican debate in Jacksonville this evening could have a defining impact on the outcome of next week's Florida primary and fundamentally shape the road forward for Romney and his opponents.
When he and the other three remaining Republican candidates gather for the 19th debate, Romney will be dealing with poll numbers that show the race as a virtual tossup as a result of Newt Gingrich's convincing win in South Carolina last weekend. More important, he will be facing his first sustained questioning and criticism since releasing his voluminous tax returns earlier this week. For a candidate who continues to find innovative ways to sound tone-deaf to the voters' economic challenges - he explained that "banks weren't bad people" at a Tuesday morning campaign rally - a prolonged discussion of a $20 million income, a 15 percent tax rate, and offshore holdings in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands sounds like a miserable and dangerous way to spend an evening.
Watching the debate most nervously will be the remnants of the once-dominant Republican establishment, who for decades have played the determinative role in selecting their party's presidential nominees. Most of these experienced players know that Romney still has a solid chance at winning Florida, but they also understand that a shaky debate performance could doom him there. They also realize that Gingrich could win the Republican nomination if Romney falters, and Gingrich's unpredictability, tendency toward polarization, and weak general election poll numbers frighten them immensely.
But the establishment is not going down without a fight. If they decide Romney can't carry their banner forward, they could well decide to find someone else who can. Should Romney lose next Tuesday's primary, the search for an alternative will begin in earnest. The slew of prominent conservatives who decided not to run last year will feel increased pressure to reconsider, and the speculation about a new establishment-backed stop-Newt candidate will reach a sufficient pitch to hobble Romney even further.
The buzz about Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana may now subside as a result of his doctrinally acceptable but uninspiring response to the State of the Union address earlier this week. But look for the speculation on Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and other potential alternatives to increase multifold.
Romney's challenge was underscored by two separate events that took place this past Tuesday, Barack Obama's State of the Union address and the release of Romney's own tax returns. Although the themes of the Obama re-election campaign have been clear for some time now, the populist pitch of his speech this week was a full-throated "people vs. the powerful" confrontation. While Romney was not mentioned by name, his presence - and that of his tax returns - was palpable when the president dove into his message of economic fairness with a call for higher taxes on wealthy Americans.
Assume that as the campaign progresses, Obama's kind words about Warren Buffett's secretary are about to be replaced by much harsher language about Romney's financial holdings.
Romney's tax returns create a more immediate challenge as well. Gingrich has been aggressively positioning himself on the stump as a champion of the white, working-class voters who increasingly populate Republican voter rolls and has already dubbed his own 15 percent flat tax as "the Romney flat tax." After an unusually subdued and relatively unsuccessful debate on Monday night and armed with 500 pages of suspicious-looking tax returns, the pressure will be on Gingrich to take the fight directly to Romney as he did in South Carolina.
Romney's support among independent voters is dropping, most notably among the working class voters Gingrich is courting, who are not likely to be comforted by the candidate's explanations about his investment and tax opportunities and will be a ready audience for his opponents' attacks.
Worse for Romney is that by releasing only two years of returns, he guarantees a fresh set of headlines going forward - whether he turns over several more years of information or not. After his needless hesitations allowed the story about his taxes, and therefore his wealth, to define the South Carolina primary, the actual release of the documents days before Florida votes guarantees that the discussion will be on the minds of that state's Republican voters as they consider their options.
Further down the road, imagine what Obama's campaign will do in a general election when pushing their boss's tax plan. Rather than running ads that portray nameless, faceless billionaires, Team Obama will be able to use Romney himself as a convenient and recognizable straw man. Operating in a political landscape colored by the media's infatuation with the Occupy movements, these assaults will have the ability to disfigure a candidate who's not prepared to explain his financial assets more comfortably than he has to date.
Nor is this simply a question of whether the rich guy can relate to middle-class voters. There are significant policy implications as well. Lanhee Chen, a Romney adviser and one of Republican Party's brightest policy minds, has suggested that his candidate might change the tax code to do away with the shelter that allowed Romney to shield much of his investment income.
Other campaign aides quickly threw cold water on the idea, but it's not hard to imagine Gingrich or Rick Santorum leaping on Romney's new proposal for raising taxes on investors.
Romney's problem isn't that he's financially successful, but rather that he has had such difficulty discussing his wealth. Moneyed candidates, from Franklin Roosevelt to the elder George Bush, have occasionally struggled to overcome their lack of connection to working-class voters, but plenty of them have been able to overcome that hurdle through either policy proposals or more symbolic and cultural gestures. Romney still hasn't figured out a way to effectively move the conversation surrounding his biography from out-of-touch aristocrat to committed jobs creator. Thursday's debate would be a good place to start.
Romney's fate is not yet determined; far from it. He could use the debate to finally make the case for his economic successes. He could sufficiently disfigure Gingrich to survive Florida. There's no question that Gingrich's own lobbyist/not lobbyist professional biography gives Romney ample opportunity to do so.
Romney has a strong campaign organization, lots of money and continues to come across as the safe, stable alternative to Gingrich. Current controversies notwithstanding, his professional biography brings him significant credibility in discussion of economic issues.
The volatility of national polls suggests that Republican primary voters have not rejected Romney outright, but rather that they are unwilling to award him the nomination unless they feel that he has earned it. So far, he clearly hasn't. In Monday's debate, Romney took a few tentative steps toward criticizing Gingrich in person, and has stepped up his assault on the campaign trail over the last few days.
The pressure on him tonight is to demonstrate that he's willing to fight harder and more aggressively while looking his opponent in the eye.
Attacking an opponent is not the only way - and maybe not even the best way - to demonstrate fire in the belly to skeptical and wavering Republican voters. An ineffective or uninspiring debate in Jacksonville certainly won't end Romney's campaign. But if his performance tonight leads to a Gingrich victory next Tuesday, the whispers of doubt about his candidacy will quickly grow into shouts and screams about the need for a Romney replacement.

HEADLINE: Fair Is Fair

BYLINE: STANLEY FISH


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama should keep the focus on unfairness, not inequality. 

 BODY:
President Obama's choice to emphasize fairness rather than equality in the State of the Union address makes good political sense. Although equality is the central concern of the Occupy Wall Street movement, focused as it is on income disparities, Americans are at least ambivalent toward equality as a primary value. They think emphasizing equality was O.K. in the context of the Civil War and segregation because inequality was institutionalized in those days and it is a good thing those days are over.
But Americans also hear in the invocation of equality an appeal to the redistribution of income. Americans don't mind if income is redistributed as long as it is done by market forces and not the government. Income equality is fine if it is "naturally" achieved, but if it is socially engineered it can be perceived as class warfare, a plot against the well-to-do.
Fairness is a better mantra than equality, for it rests on a notion of formal equality - everyone should be treated alike - rather than a notion of substantive equality - everyone should have the same stuff. Fairness, rather than undermining the American virtues of self-realization and entrepreneurial advancement, establishes a framework within which these virtues can be exercised. Fairness doesn't tamper with the rules or skew them in the direction of the unemployed or impoverished: it just insists that the rules be followed and that no one gets to go to the head of the line if it is not his turn.
The difference between equality and fairness can be illustrated by considering the issue of Mitt Romney's taxes. In the eyes of most Americans, it is O.K. that Mitt Romney makes more money than they do; there's no demand for the equalizing of income so that he can be brought down to their level. But it is not O.K. (or at least the Democrats will argue) for Mitt Romney to be paying a lower tax rate than his housecleaner. It's unfair. So inequalities that arise from the unequal abilities of people and even from the unequal distribution of luck and birth are all right; but the kind of unfairness that occurs when someone plays by different rules than the rules you are held to isn't.
President Obama can take the fairness mantra all the way to the bank and a second term. He can make the same argument up and down the line. Is it fair that children who live in school districts with a poor tax base because the residents of the district are poor should receive an inferior education? (Notice that this is not argument against school districts made up of wealthy people; it is an argument against allowing wealth to skew the educational opportunities that should be fairly available to everyone.) Is it fair that Internet pirates in China can appropriate without paying for it the intellectual property of Americans who rely for their income on ideas they have copyrighted? Is it fair that those who fail to purchase health insurance take advantage of hospital emergency rooms at the expense of those who do the responsible thing? Is it fair that the voices of some citizens should be incredibly amplified because they have the money to buy a megaphone larger than the National Broadcasting Company? Is it fair that insurance companies that take premiums from us in return for taking risk make every effort possible to insulate themselves from risk, by refusing, as they long have, to cover pre-existing conditions?
Equality and freedom have often been trumpeted as the key words in the lexicon of liberal democracy. But they are too abstract and they won't play in the political arena. Everyone understands fair, and fair is the word Obama should be uttering again and again and again.

HEADLINE: In North Carolina, the Governor and a Lawmaker Will Not Seek Re-election

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Bev Perdue has decided not to seek a second term, while Representative Brad Miller will forgo a sixth term. Both are Democrats. 

 BODY:
5:20 p.m. | Updated Bev Perdue, a Democrat who made history when she became North Carolina's first female governor in 2009, will not seek re-election this year, a Democratic source with knowledge of her decision said on Thursday.
Ms. Perdue, 65, is expected to announce Thursday afternoon that she will step aside when her term ends instead of facing a likely rematch with Pat McCrory, her Republican rival in 2008 and the former mayor of Charlotte. 
Ms. Perdue's popularity has been sagging in North Carolina, and she has struggled to raise money to support her re-election campaign. In November, three of her former 2008 campaign aides were indicted on felony charges of obstruction of justice, handing Republican ammunition in attacks against her. She has also come under fire for suggesting a two-year postponement of Congressional elections and a sales tax increase to finance education.
"She wasn't polling great and had some ethics issues," the Democratic source said. "We're viewing it as a very positive thing for us, and we have a really good quality pool of candidates."
The source asked not to be named because Ms. Perdue has not announced her decision. 
Her decision to step aside opens the door for a stronger Democrat to compete in North Carolina, where Democrats will meet this year for their national convention. Among the names floated to replace Ms. Perdue on the Democratic ticket are Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, Attorney General Roy Cooper, Erskine Bowles, the former White House aide, and Mayor Anthony Foxx of Charlotte, the source said.
Mr. Cooper, the attorney general, said on Thursday that he planned to seek re-election. He did not say whether he would run for governor, although he declined invitations from party officials to run for governor in 2008 and the Senate in 2010.
"I am honored to serve as attorney general, and plan to file for re-election for that office to continue my work keeping people safe and moving North Carolina forward," he said.
Representative Brad Miller, a five-term Democrat from North Carolina, also will not seek re-election to avoid a primary battle against another incumbent Democrat, he told supporters in an e-mail on Thursday.
Mr. Miller, 58, said the Republican-controlled redistricting process split his current district six ways, leaving him to compete in an uphill primary against another Democrat, David Price, for the state's redrawn Fourth Congressional District.
"There would be no joy in this campaign," he said. 
"I have spoken to many friends who have supported both David and me in the past. Some would support me and some would support David. But none wanted to see a primary between us," he added.
His other options were to run in a Republican-leaning district or step aside.
In Congress, Mr. Miller has voted with his party on major policy priorities, like the stimulus program, health care, and financial regulations, especially legislation that would protect consumers.
A lawyer, he was first elected to public office in 1996, serving three terms in the State Senate. He was elected to the House in 2002 and serves on the Financial Services Committee and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
In the e-mail to supporters, Mr. Miller denied rumors that he would run again in 2014.
"The reality is that if I sat out a term and returned to Congress, I would be starting over for most purposes," he said. "I would have no assurance of my committee assignments, and even if I won, assignment to the same committees, I would lose all seniority. Just as important, the debate on the issues that I care about, and on which I am now a leader, would move on. No, I could not simply pick up where I left off."
Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Mr. Miller's decision gives Republicans a "promising opportunity."
"With one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, North Carolina families want a new leader who will put an end to the Democrats' reckless, job-destroying agenda," Ms. Bozek said.
Update: In announcing her decision, Ms. Perdue said she was stepping aside to avoid a potentially nasty fight over school funding. 
"The thing I care about most right now is making sure that our schools and schoolchildren do not continue to be the victims of shortsighted legislative actions and severe budget cuts inflicted by a legislative majority with the wrong priorities," she said in a statement. " Therefore, I am announcing today that I have decided not to seek re-election. I hope this decision will open the door to an honest and bipartisan effort to help our schools."

HEADLINE: Regional Cap-and-Trade Effort Seeks Greater Impact by Cutting Carbon Allowances

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Adjusting to shifts in the economy, states in the cap-and-trade system known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative have slashed the number of allowances that electric power companies can buy to offset their emissions.
The decision, made last week, was intended to shore up the pioneering program as it undergoes its first comprehensive review this year. While the program has been judged a success by most of the participating states, in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, an oversupply of the allowances -- in essence, permits to pollute -- has limited the program's impact.
The program, the nation's first cap-and-trade system, sets a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power providers and requires the companies to pay for their heat-trapping emissions by buying the allowances in online auctions held four times a year. Companies that pollute less can benefit by selling off allowances to other companies. 
Because of a switch to natural gas from coal by many utilities and a limping economy, however, both the demand for electricity and the plants' emissions have been lower than expected since the program was first put into effect in 2009, with many of the allowances going unsold.
On Jan. 17, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont announced that they were permanently eliminating 72 percent of the unsold carbon allowances, or a total of 67 million. (Each allowance amounts to one ton of carbon dioxide emissions.) Maryland has also said it intends to retire some unsold allowances, raising the percentage of the unsold permits retired to 93 percent.
The reduction is widely viewed as a prelude to a major change expected by the end of the review period this summer: the potential tightening of emissions ceilings for electric power providers, which are currently set to reduce emissions by 10 percent by 2018. But emissions have already dropped by more than 30 percent below the cap.
''Lowering the number of allowances in the program sounds like the direction the states want to go in,'' said Ashley Lawson, a senior analyst with Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, a carbon-market research firm.
Ms. Lawson said that while the regional initiative had so far proved itself as a working cap-and-trade model, the oversupply of allowances led to a lower price for them, easing the pressure on electricity providers to emit even less.
Since they began, the sales of carbon allowances have nonetheless produced almost $1 billion in revenue for the 10 original participating states.
Still, as political winds shifted nationally, with many Republican candidates denouncing cap-and-trade in the 2010 midterm elections, the program came under fire from critics who argued that the initiative imposed additional costs on electric utilities that were then passed on to consumers. Among them was Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who pulled his state out of the program last year, and also contended that it did not reduce emissions.
Officials from supporting states vehemently countered that the benefits of the program far outweighed any costs, and an independent study released last November backed them up. The study, commissioned by four nonprofit foundations and conducted by the Boston consulting firm Analysis Group, concluded that the regional initiative had saved consumers money over all and created jobs. States have often used proceeds from the program to improve energy efficiency in offices and homes and to promote renewable energy installations, the report pointed out.
Although there were differences in how individual states applied the money -- New York and Massachusetts heavily invested in energy efficiency programs, while New Jersey used most of the money to offset a shortfall in the state budget -- carbon dioxide emissions in the initiative's 10-state region were 6 percent lower than they would have been without the program, said Susan F. Tierney, one of the study's authors.
As the program goes forward with 9 states instead of 10, some power companies say that the sweet spot will be lowering emissions without imposing too great a financial burden.
''My hope is that it will be strengthened because we need to address greenhouse gas emissions, but we need to do it in a responsible way so it doesn't impact utility customers, especially in this economy,'' said Bob Teetz, vice president of environmental services for National Grid, an electrical and gas company.
Some environmental groups are advocating changes that would broaden the program to include other industrial and commercial sources of greenhouse gas emissions and link it to similar programs in the works, like the cap-and-trade system being planned by California and some Canadian provinces.
A boost may come from the Environmental Protection Agency's plans for new performance standards to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. One way for states to comply with the new rules could be to join the initiative or a similar program authorized by the agency.

HEADLINE: House Speaker Spreads Blame for State's Mess

BYLINE: By KRISTEN McQUEARY. 
Kristen McQueary covers state government for The Chicago News Cooperative and public radio station WBEZ.; kmcqueary@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
In a crowded college dining hall brightened by white linen tablecloths, a Chamber of Commerce official delivered remarks into a bouquet of microphones on the lectern before him.
But the microphones, from Chicago television and radio stations, were turned off. The media were eagerly awaiting the next speaker, whose words carry more weight than those of virtually any other official in state government.
That speaker, Michael Madigan, chairman of the Democratic Party and speaker of the Illinois House for 27 of the last 29 years, stood quietly, waiting for his cue to take the stage and address more than 300 invited guests at Elmhurst College. 
It was a rare public appearance for Mr. Madigan, made even more unusual by the locale -- one of the state's most Republican-leaning counties -- and the fact that Mr. Madigan was at the college's governmental forum as a favor to a former Republican adversary, Lee Daniels, now an adjunct faculty member and special adviser to the college president.
Mr. Daniels shook hands with Mr. Madigan and the two exchanged pleasantries, a sharp contrast to 1995, when Mr. Daniels wrested control of the House for one term and Mr. Madigan refused to move his belongings out of the speaker's office until the last minute.
In his remarks, Mr. Madigan acknowledged the state's budget crisis, glancing at a folded piece of paper and occasionally bumping the microphones as he gestured with his hands.
If those in attendance were hoping for a glimpse into his strategic mind, they may have left disappointed, although he did entertain them with behind-the-scenes stories of former governors. He said George Ryan once pulled Pate Philip, the Senate president at the time, into a separate room to berate him for resisting Mr. Ryan's bricks-and-mortar spending program.
''There was a lot of screaming and shouting, and they both came back and sat down and Pate said, 'Well, Governor, there will be enough votes to pass your bill,' '' Mr. Madigan said. ''That was George's method.''
Mr. Madigan blamed both Democrats and Republicans for spending Illinois into its current fiscal crisis, but said the budget that was passed last year with bipartisan support in the House was a good start in restoring the state's economic health.
''Bear with us,'' he said when asked about the state's inability to pay its bills to social service agencies.
The state has more than $4 billion in unpaid bills, according to the Illinois comptroller's office, and a pension liability of about $85 billion, and more cuts are expected when Gov. Pat Quinn presents his budget next month.
''We've got huge budget problems in this state,'' Mr. Madigan said. ''Why? Well, there was overspending in the past, and many people engaged in the overspending. It wasn't just one or two people.''
Even though Mr. Madigan blamed Republicans in part for the shortfalls, Democrats have held majorities in the House and Senate and controlled the governor's mansion since 2003. Most budgets have been passed primarily with Democrats' votes.
Asked whether he should bear greater blame for the state's financial ills, having served in Illinois government in an influential position for nearly 30 years, Mr. Madigan said it took more than one person to drive Illinois into a pattern of spending beyond its means.
In flusher times, party leaders and the governor cut pork-heavy budget deals behind closed doors. To bring lawmakers on board -- often at midnight on the final day of a legislative session -- the budget included hundreds of their demands, from road improvements to new fire engines and playgrounds. Mr. Madigan said that spending from both sides of the aisle had helped put the state in the red.
He lauded last year's legislative session, when House members from both parties helped pass a budget that allocated $2 billion less than Mr. Quinn had requested.
''The next good step would be to do that again under even more difficult circumstances,'' Mr. Madigan said. ''If we can convince the budget makers to live within our means, we would be taking some significant steps to fiscal solvency, but it's not going to be done overnight.''

HEADLINE: Starbucks Outperforms Expectations and Raises Outlook

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Starbucks on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street's expectations, but its shares fell as investors in the world's biggest coffee chain focused on softness in Europe rather than strength in the United States. 
The company's shares, up roughly 45 percent from a year ago and hovering near record highs, were off 2 percent in extended trading after closing at $48.34.
Sales from cafes open at least 13 months were up just 2 percent for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, versus the 9 percent gain for the much larger America unit, chiefly from the United States.
Starbucks's chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, said on a webcast that the company had been underperforming internal targets in Europe amid debt worries and unemployment there. But he said it had taken steps to improve results there. Operating margin for the region was 6.5 percent in the first quarter, down from 9.7 percent a year earlier.
Starbucks said the margin contraction was primarily a result of higher distribution costs related to moving to a consolidated distribution center in Britain.
Based on its better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $1.78 to $1.82 a share from $1.75 to $1.82.
Global sales at established Starbucks cafes jumped 9 percent, helped by an increase in customer visits and spending per transaction. That beat the 7.7 percent gain analysts, on average, expected, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Net income was $382.1 million, or 50 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 1. That was up from $346.6 million, or 45 cents, in the year earlier period. Analysts, on average, were looking for a profit of 49 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Total revenue rose 16 percent to $3.4 billion.
The chain has been raising prices on some drinks to help offset higher costs for commodities like coffee and milk. Starbucks expects new products to build sales as the year progresses.
In November it started selling its coffee and Tazo tea for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters' popular Keurig machines, which control about 80 percent of the fast-growing North American single-serve brewing segment.

HEADLINE: Don't Mind The Gap

BYLINE: By ANDREW KOHUT

 BODY:
Washington
Income inequality has become a hot-button issue during this political campaign. A recent Pew Research Center poll, for example, attracted an extraordinary amount of attention when it found that 66 percent of Americans believed there were ''very strong'' or ''strong'' conflicts between the rich and the poor - an increase of 19 percentage points since 2009.
But while Americans are hearing more and more about class conflict, there is little indication that they are increasingly divided along these lines. People don't necessarily want to take money from the wealthy; they just want a better chance to get rich themselves. They care about policies that give everyone a fair shot - a distinction that candidates in both parties should understand as they head into the 2012 campaigns. 
An awareness of economic inequality is not new. Pew surveys going back to 1987 have found an average of 75 percent of the American public thinking that the ''rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.'' As far back as 1941, 60 percent of respondents told the Gallup poll that there was too much power in the hands of a few rich people and large corporations in the United States.
Despite that longstanding sense of inequality, there is no more sentiment today for populist revolt than there was then. A Gallup poll last month found 54 percent believing that income inequality was an ''acceptable part of our economic system'' - a slight increase, in fact, over the 45 percent that held that view back in 1998.
What's different these days is that a despondent public, struggling with difficult times and an uncertain future, is upset over a perceived lack of fairness in public policy. For example, 61 percent of Americans now say the economic system in this country unfairly favors the wealthy.
Pew's surveys in recent years present a detailed picture of these frustrations. One major complaint is tax policy: Dissatisfaction with the tax system has grown over the past decade, but the focus is not on how much respondents themselves pay, but rather on the perception that the wealthy are simply not paying their fair share. Just 11 percent of Americans say they are bothered by the amount they pay, while 57 percent of respondents say they are bothered by what they believe are unfairly low amounts paid by the wealthy.
Reactions to the bailout programs of 2008 and 2009 got the unfairness ball rolling. Early on the public was divided over the fairness of government helping financial institutions, and overwhelmingly opposed loans to Detroit automakers. Much of the public was even put off by plans to help homeowners facing mortgage foreclosures. By 2010, 51 percent said the bailout of the banks was the wrong thing for the government to do, while just 40 percent thought it was right.
No doubt outrage over Wall Street bonuses played a large part in this trend: Pew Research Center surveys at the time found 86 percent disapproved of high bonuses reportedly given out by many financial institutions, with as many as 62 percent saying they were angered by them.
Even recent reforms to financial-sector regulation have not allayed public concerns. In a poll last month, 56 percent of Americans said the power and influence of banks and other financial institutions represented a major threat to the country.
But before candidates read this frustration as a call for class warfare, they should recognize the limits of that approach. Americans are still confident that their society provides opportunities for economic mobility. In one recent Pew poll, 58 percent of respondents said they believed that people who wanted to get ahead could make it if they were willing to work hard.
The issue here is not about class envy. Rather, it's a perception that government policies are skewed toward helping the already wealthy and powerful. While a December Gallup poll found few respondents wanting the government to attempt to reduce the income gap between rich and poor, 70 percent said it was important for the government to increase opportunities for people to get ahead. What the public wants is not a war on the rich but more policies that promote opportunity.
Andrew Kohut is the president of the Pew Research Center.

HEADLINE: Apple in China: Has iOrwell Arrived?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work'' and ''In China, the Human Costs That Are Built Into an iPad'' (''The iEconomy'' series, front page, Jan. 22 and 26):
It's ironic and disheartening that the company that set out to change the world could accomplish the task only by employing vendors who subject workers to slave-labor wages and an Orwellian work environment. 
With all due respect to the late, great Steve Jobs, if the famous 1984 Super Bowl commercial for Apple were reshot, the image of Big Brother on the giant screen might fittingly be his own.
In stark contrast to its counterculture origins, Apple seems to have evolved into the embodiment of everything it once despised -- a greedy, callous, ruthless behemoth beholden only to fund managers who demand incremental profits every quarter at any cost.
BRUCE SILVERMAN Minneapolis, Jan. 26, 2012
To the Editor:
I'm grateful that American workers do not have the ''flexibility'' or ''diligence'' of those who are manufacturing our electronics overseas.
Your articles and other investigations of the Foxconn plant in China where Apple products are made have noted terrible conditions there: under-age workers; a rash of suicide attempts by employees; workers stuffed into overcrowded dormitories; serious injuries and even death as a result of poor safety standards.
If we don't want workers' lives to look like this, we can't be unscrupulous as consumers.
I can pay more for humanely produced beef. Maybe it's time for stickers certifying humanely produced electronics.
ANDREA GARA Palo Alto, Calif., Jan. 26, 2012
To the Editor:
I beg to differ with what Jennifer Rigoni, former supply demand manager for Apple, said about the American work force: ''What U.S. plant can find 3,000 people overnight and convince them to live in dorms?''
I actually think that we have a huge population that would relish factory and dormitory life. We have many immigrants, recently discharged service members, homeless veterans and recent high school graduates who would gladly accept a roof over their heads, warm meals and a steady job.
But to employ this highly motivated work force, we need to improve our immigration policies and train our workers. Apple could use some of its $400,000 in profit per employee to lobby for immigration and education reform, and to build factories and train its work force on American soil.
Has Apple ever wondered who could afford to buy its products if Americans aren't working?

Your series about Apple's overseas manufacturing suggests that production in the United States is ultimately uncompetitive with China because of shortcomings in engineering talent, lack of low-wage worker drones at the ready, and a resulting inability to rapidly scale up (or down) when necessary.
For big business, you nailed it. However, for many small and midsize companies, the appeal of domestic manufacturing is extremely strong. Low-cost technology, lean manufacturing and rising freight costs have enabled aggressive entrepreneurial companies to succeed against the mass-production Chinese machine.
Domestic manufacturing, though, is no longer synonymous with jobs creation -- at least, not the assembly line jobs that for generations defined the middle class. Government policies cannot alter this evolution. A paradigm shift has occurred, in which production jobs have been supplanted by marketing, design, engineering, finance and other more skilled roles.
It may be too late for an entire generation of wrong-skilled labor. But for American manufacturing, the next chapter holds extraordinary promise.

To the Editor:
The Republican argument that unfettered capitalism will solve American unemployment dissolves as a myth when corporate executives observe, as one Apple executive did: ''We don't have an obligation to solve America's problems. Our only obligation is making the best product possible.''
If corporations don't care, the government must.

HEADLINE: Profitable Ripple Effect Projected for Berkeley Lab's Second Campus in Richmond

BYLINE: By FRANCES DINKELSPIEL. 
fdinkelspiel@gmail.com

 BODY:
Richmond's selection as the site of a second campus for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will not only bring in millions of dollars to a struggling city, but it may signal its shift into one of the most desirable business locations in the region. 
When the University of California, Berkeley, finishes a two-million-square-foot complex at the 120-acre Richmond Field Station, on university-owned land at the edge of San Francisco Bay, it will house more than 800 scientists doing research in bioscience, cancer, bioenergy and on the human genome.
But that may be just the first step in developing an even larger research center, said Robert Birgeneau, Berkeley's chancellor. Mr. Birgeneau envisions a vibrant second campus with ample room to bring together University of California researchers and scientists from around the world.
''We are quite landlocked in the city of Berkeley, so each time another national project comes along, we are challenged where to place it,'' he said. ''Now we have new possibilities. Instead of exporting jobs, we will be importing jobs,'' he said.
Richmond, which has a 17 percent jobless rate and a tax base that has declined by double digits in recent years, considers the second lab potentially transformative. Residents will be in a position to get some of the construction jobs. Developers are expected to construct buildings to accommodate spinoff businesses.
''This is the biggest thing we've had in terms of economic development,'' said Bill Lindsay, the city manager.
The laboratory announced last year that it had outgrown its headquarters at Berkeley and was looking to build a second campus to unify its facilities, which are scattered around the East Bay. They include the Joint BioEnergy Institute in Emeryville, the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in Oakland and the Berkeley West Biocenter.
Developers from eight cities gave 21 proposals, and the lab whittled those down to six final sites in May. Richmond beat out sites in Berkeley, Oakland, Emeryville and Alameda for the campus, widely regarded as one of the juiciest economic plums of the last few decades.
An environmental review of the site will begin soon. Lab officials hope to move in by 2016.
Richmond's eagerness for the campus apparently played a role in its selection, according to A. Paul Alivisatos, the lab's director, who pointed to ''an outstanding show of community support.''
More than 700 residents attended the lab's information night. The city put up a billboard along Interstate 580 that flashed ''Richmond LBNL.'' It printed buttons and postcards and had more than 500 residents write personal notes to lab employees inviting them to the city.
While neighboring cities that vied for the lab were disappointed, there are no hard feelings, said Michael Caplan, the City of Berkeley's manager of economic development.
''What the lab has actually done is highlight the East Bay's special position, particularly in bioscience, research and development, and the broader pipeline that exists,'' Mr. Caplan said. ''We're happy for Richmond and we think it will be good for the whole East Bay.''

HEADLINE: Silencing Cheers, to Save Troubled School District

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
PREMONT -- A plan to save a school district has come down to rows of yellow Post-it notes.
Dozens of the pieces of paper dot a wall in Superintendent Ernest Singleton's office, covering white poster boards labeled with the 11 state benchmarks that the Premont Independent School District must meet to remain open next year. Each note points to a step taken toward the corresponding goal.
Scrawled on one Post-it are two words that have brought national attention to this 570-student South Texas school district: suspend sports.
Mr. Singleton came to the Premont district in June. He received a letter from the Texas Education Agency in July saying that after years of financial disarray and lagging academic performance, the district would lose its accreditation and be absorbed into a neighboring district. 
After the initial shock subsided -- despite the district's shabby record, Mr. Singleton said he had not expected closure so quickly -- he took his case to Austin and asked for more time to turn around the schools. In November, Premont residents voted overwhelmingly for a property tax increase to support the schools. A month later, the education agency agreed to delay its decision by a year, setting out the stringent demands that now line the superintendent's wall.
The reprieve was hard won. If Premont fails, there will be no appeal. With that in mind, Mr. Singleton turned to a budget that he had already scrubbed bare and looked for more ways to save. The estimated $150,000 that the district would spend during the next year on spring and fall sports, including football, could no longer be justified.
''I couldn't let the district go down to save a particular program,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''A year's suspension of sports, as painful as that is, it would be much more painful to shut down and not have sports ever again in a district that doesn't exist.''
It was a daring move in a state where football fields are hallowed turf. But at the basketball game Tuesday night against the Hebbronville Longhorns -- one of Premont's last athletic contests before the suspension -- most residents appeared supportive.
''This is the time to make the sacrifice,'' Joann Moreno said. She sat next to her husband, whom she met when they were both students in Premont, as they watched their son on the court.
Students worried that some of their friends would transfer to high school at ''Fal'' -- the town of Falfurrias 10 minutes south -- so they could participate in sports. But they also acknowledged that the move was worth saving the school district.
Steven Pena, 15, said he was ''crushed'' by the announcement and that playing sports year-round helped him stay out of trouble. He acknowledged, however, that without games and practices, he might study more.
The only criticism of the district came from the side of the bleachers where the Hebbronville families sat.
Andrew Miller, whose 14-year-old son was playing basketball that day, said the students should not be punished for the mistakes of the adults running the districts. He said taking away sports would mostly hurt the children with the fewest resources, whose families could not afford to move or take them to school at a neighboring district.
The scarcity of outcry from the community, however, could be a measure of the district's bleak finances. It accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt by overstaffing and failing to properly plan for declining enrollment. In January 2011, a study conducted by a regional state education service center found that the district had too many employees and recommended consolidating two campuses to cut costs. Before the current school year began, the district laid off eight employees.
Mr. Singleton has already scooped $307,000 out of the budget to pay back the remaining debt. By December, he must come up with $400,000 to retire a line of credit. Then there is the $150,000 needed to renovate the high school science labs, which have been closed for safety reasons and overcome by mold.
All of this comes as state financing to the district is cut by $400,000 to $500,000 as part of the Legislature's multibillion-dollar reduction in public education money. But while each of the state's 1,030 traditional school districts is taking a hit, because of a mechanism in Texas school financing that allocates more state money to property-wealthy districts, Premont, where 75 percent of students are economically disadvantaged, was one of the most poorly financed to begin with.
State Representative Scott Hochberg, a Democrat of Houston who is the vice chairman of the House Public Education Committee, said in a phone interview that the Premont district's situation was an example that ''called into question the entire punitive nature'' of the state's accountability system.
''We are picking the winners and losers by the way we fund them,'' he said, adding, ''The districts that we choose to fund poorly are the districts that we then come down and whip.''
In 2006, when the Legislature voted to reduce property taxes, it promised school districts that they would receive no less per student than they had before, creating a system that resulted in financing differences between $5,000 and $10,000 per student across school districts.
For Mr. Singleton, the district's financial problems are the easier pieces of the puzzle. Overcoming the culture of poor academics and truancy that have become endemic to the district, he said, is a mightier task.
One recent morning he went knocking on doors with a constable and high school principal, asking parents why their children were not in school.
The district's financial support is based on attendance, and it loses money when students do not attend; the district's fate is also tied to the students' performance on state tests in the spring. Compounding the challenge, this year will be the first administration of Staar, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a rigorous new measurement.
The intense scrutiny has affected morale among teachers, Mr. Singleton said. He added that if student performance did not improve, he would be forced to make more staffing changes before the 2012-13 school year.
But back at the high school right before classes let out one afternoon, the hallways were quiet and orderly. At the end of last year, said Rick Ruiz, the school's principal, it would have been a completely different scene.
Just before students began to spill out into the hallway, the loudspeakers came on. Mr. Singleton paused midsentence to listen.
Attendance was at 92 percent today, the announcement said. Mr. Singleton smiled. It was not quite where they need to be -- 96 percent -- but it was a vast improvement.
''We'll take it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Verdi's Fearsome Hun, With Destruction Writ Large in Neon Green

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- The Seattle Opera's production of Verdi's ''Attila'' opens with a scene that is nowhere to be found in Verdi's ''Attila.''
It is sometime around the present day, perhaps in Iraq, perhaps in the Balkans, perhaps somewhere else. Soldiers have led a group of civilians to a rocky plain surrounded by bombed-out ruins. They proceed to execute several of them, marking the survivors as Attila's victims with spray-painted neon green A's. A young woman is left clutching the dead bodies of her family. Then the opera begins.
That the production's director, Bernard Uzan, felt it necessary to interpolate the scene -- which helpfully clarifies the reasons for that young woman's vengeful rage throughout the rest of the opera -- is a testament to the difficulty of putting this work onstage. One of Verdi's most problematic operas, ''Attila'' has music of beauty and excitement, but also awkward proportions and characters that seethe yet never quite come to life. 
What the opera unquestionably has is energy, a relentless martial drive that spurs on the story of the infamous Hun, the aftermath of his invasion of Italy and his tragic love triangle with the shattered survivor from Mr. Uzan's prologue, who eventually kills him to avenge her parents' murder.
On Wednesday that energy was in the pit, where the conductor Carlo Montanaro led a spirited performance featuring a big-voiced cast powering its way through the score. Nevertheless things stayed a little bland. In part the blame falls on Verdi and his librettists, who didn't make it easy to create cohesive, compelling theater out of ''Attila.'' But part is the fault of the singers and director, who didn't take advantage of what opportunities there were for drama.
Mr. Uzan's banquet scene began as a riveting spectacle of paranoia and decadence, but the tension petered out. The sequence in which Attila rises from a nightmare should shudder with fear, but here, as elsewhere, the bass-baritone John Relyea was vocally and dramatically even keeled rather than commanding. As Ezio, general of the enemy Romans, the baritone Marco Vratogna seemed more irritated than grandly somber in his aching monologue mourning Rome's lost glory.
In both cases the performances were reasonable but lacked the intensity and sweep to make these moments, and the evening in general, really crackle. The soprano Ana Lucrecia Garcia, as the murderous Odabella, flung out blazing high notes, and as her lover Foresto the tenor Antonello Palombi sang with bright tone, but there was room for more commitment to these blunt characters.
Though buffeted by the recession Seattle Opera has consistently balanced its budget without sacrificing artistic integrity , even if it has been forced to replace some ambitious pieces like ''Tannhauser'' and ''Don Carlo'' with smaller ones. It was encouraging to see a large, enthusiastic audience for ''Attila,'' a work that is hardly a staple. Coming next month is Gluck's ''Orphee et Eurydice,'' another opera on the outskirts of the standard repertory.
Next season's programming shows more conservatism; a double bill of Puccini's ''Suor Angelica'' and Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine'' is as esoteric as it gets. This is a spooked time for American opera: the Chicago Lyric Opera, for example, one of the country's most prominent companies, recently announced a 2012-13 season of discouraging artistic caution.
It is possible to do better. With a season only a bit longer than Seattle's, the Canadian Opera Company of Toronto presents varied, thoughtful and popular programs. The well-loved Speight Jenkins, Seattle Opera's general director since 1983, plans to retire in 2014, after presentations of his beloved Wagner: Seattle's signature ''Ring'' cycle and a new ''Meistersinger.'' His successor will face the same financial and programming challenges.
The recession may have left in its wake a ''new normal'' of lower donations and more selective ticket buying. But that must not keep opera companies from leading audiences in new directions.
''Attila'' continues through Saturday at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall, Seattle; (800) 426-161,9 seattleopera.org.

Art
Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Sarah Sze: Infinite Line' (through March 25) Promising a new angle on Sarah Sze's mesmerizing, minutely detailed installations, this midcareer solo reveals that Ms. Sze, who is Chinese-American, has been profoundly influenced by many forms of Asian art. It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
- Brooklyn Museum: 'African Innovations' (continuing) The museum has done some reshuffling on its first floor, and the African galleries, which once claimed a privileged spot next to the lobby, are now relocated a distance away and reduced in size. But the new display, ''African Innovations,'' is effective. It eliminates the graphic overkill of the former installation; sets out work with an easily graspable logic; and over all shows the African holdings to decent advantage. It would be pretty hard not to. The collection is spectacular, an institutional treasure. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture' (through Feb. 12) Like many events that are the first of their kind, this sampling of the roles of same-sex desire -- and unconventional notions of masculinity and femininity -- in over 100 years of American portraiture feels both overdue and a little behind the times. Despite exemplary works by Marsden Hartley, Jasper Johns and Robert Mapplethorpe, it is more sketchy overview than thorough examination and often errs on the side of mild-mannered caution. But it illuminates aspects of mainstream art that have long been hiding in the light, and it both makes and remakes history. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor to ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Pop Objects and Icons from the Guggenheim Collection' and 'Surface, Support, Process: The 1960s Monochrome in the Guggenheim Collection' (through Feb. 8) Where anxiety and trauma sat on the surface of slashed and burned canvases from the '40s and '50s, art of the '60s had a new detachment. Two exhibitions drawn from the Guggenheim's collection show how differently this sentiment could manifest. ''Surface, Support, Process'' features Mary Corse, Tadaaki Kuwayama, Agnes Martin, Robert Mangold and Brice Marden. ''Pop Objects'' includes Andy Warhol's ''Orange Disaster #5'' (1963) and a micro-retrospective of Roy Lichtenstein paintings, along with works by Robert Rauschenberg, John Chamberlain and Richard Hamilton. It also includes a 1997 James Rosenquist painting commissioned by Deutsche Bank, in conjunction with the Guggenheim, that pays curious ''tribute to industrial growth and capitalism.'' 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (through March 25) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Infinite Jest: Caricature and Satire From Leonardo to Levine' (through March 4) It is not nice to make fun of other people, but it is hard to resist. This fascinating and often amusing show presents about 160 drawings and prints from six centuries in which men and women appear ugly, weird, venal and foolish. The show shies away from troublemaking work by contemporary artists, but examples of exceptional draftsmanship and satiric imagination from the past abound. Watercolors by the great British cartoonists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson alone make a visit rewarding. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Renaissance Portrait From Donatello to Bellini' (through March 18) This magisterial, intensely thought-provoking show presents about 160 works by the most celebrated masters of 15th-century Italian painting and sculpture. It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create extraordinarily lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited, especially after several substitutions on Feb. 8 for conservation reasons. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: Sanja Ivekovic: 'Sweet Violence' (through March 26) This timely and resonant survey familiarizes American audiences with the spare, selfless achievement of this pioneering Croatian artist, born in Zagreb in 1949. Conceptual in style, photo- and performance-based in approach, political in motivation, ardently and precisely feminist, her work makes use of materials at hand -- personal photographs, women's magazines, state-sponsored television, even government surveillance -- to dissect different forms of power and illuminate the plight of the powerless, while also presaging familiar developments in appropriation art and relational aesthetics to a startling degree. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-32 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through Feb. 20) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (through April 2) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Bearden Project' (through March 11) Of the many New York City events celebrating the Romare Bearden centennial year, the Studio Museum has come up with the best in this sparkling cross-generational shout-out to the artist. In addition to a small handful of superb works by Bearden himself, the show is made up of tributes by a hundred contemporary artists, old and young, who together extend Bearden's cosmopolitan, griot-to-the-global-village spirit into the future. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
- Swiss Institute Contemporary Art: 'Jean-Frederic Schnyder' (through Feb. 26) The first New York show of this lapsed Swiss Conceptualist, who was born in 1945 and represented his country at the 1993 Venice Biennale, is a characteristic mix of benign and barbed, as well as of painting, sculpture and video. The 35 small, delectable paintings of ''Landscape'' bivouac at the border of art and kitsch, tackling themes of hearth and home, taste and cliche, while a video parade of bottles of schnapps implicates the tourist industry. It's deceptively tidy, deeply Swiss satire. 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Smith)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Real/Surreal' (through Feb. 12) Seeing this exhibition is like visiting your grandmother's attic and finding it loaded with forgotten treasures. The lonesome Romanticism of Edward Hopper and Joe Jones; the Magic Realism of Peter Blume and Paul Cadmus; the nightmarish urban visions of George Tooker and Louis Guglielmi; Yves Tanguy's otherworldly blobs in space; and Andrew Wyeth's dead crow in a winter field: these and many more vividly realistic and surrealistic works from the 1930s to the early '50s capture a mood of dreadful unease that gripped the mid-20th-century American psyche and that, in many ways, still does.

Lee Bontecou: 'Recent Work: Sculpture and Drawing' (through Feb. 11) If Terry Gilliam were to make a movie based on Thomas Pynchon's ''Against the Day,'' he might consider Ms. Bontecou's recent suspended sculptures as models for the airship Inconvenience. They have bowed, sail-like parts that seem as if filled by a steady, ethereal wind and slender, soldered wire structures like sleds attached below. On paper, Ms. Bontecou envisions submarine worlds where bug-eyed, toothy fish are refracted by watery swirls. Freedman Art, 25 East 73rd Street, (212) 249-2040, freedmanart.com. (Johnson)
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London.

Ai Weiwei (through Feb. 4) This Chinese artist's famous sunflower seeds, fashioned from slip-painted porcelain, formed a turbulent, oceanlike expanse -- ruled untouchable because of ceramic dust -- in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in the fall of 2010. Now that expanse is recapitulated, downsized and manicured Chelsea-fied, in a large, smooth-topped rectangle a few inches thick with meticulously slanted, even sharp edges. Less an ocean than a reflecting pool, it is still very much worth seeing. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. ( Smith)
- Damien Hirst: 'The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011' (through Feb. 18) The formerly young British artist's spot-painting summation may be spread throughout the 11 emporiums of the worldwide Gagosian franchise, but New York is bearing the brunt, with 115 of the total 331 distributed among three galleries, one of which (980 Madison) could count as four shows on its own. Despite the consistency of the formula, a typically Hirstian range of quality, from good to atrocious, prevails. Some are engaging paintings; others aren't really paintings at all. Similarly, at least one installation -- at West 21st Street -- is ravishing; others are oppressive, best suited for the artist's most hard-core fans. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212) 744-2313; 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 741-1111; and 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)
- 'Interiors: Pierre Bonnard, Marc Camille Chaimowicz, William Copley, Edouard Vuillard' (through Feb. 11) ''Interiors'' lets some fresh air into the ''Intimist'' rooms of Bonnard and Vuillard, with help from the contemporary installation artist Marc Camille Chaimowicz and the late-Surrealist painter William N. Copley. Mr. Chaimowicz's untitled wallpaper makes an excellent backdrop for Bonnard's ''Breakfast Room'' (1925), on loan from the Brooklyn Museum; the broad, squiggly contour lines in Mr. Copley's paintings confuse figures and interiors, as does a small Vuillard oil of a matronly woman whose green jacket matches the drapes on her French windows. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Rosenberg)
- 'The Wedding (The Walker Evans Polaroid Project)' / Michael St. John: 'In the Studio Twenty Eleven' (through Feb. 4) The cooked and the raw meet head-on in serendipitously dovetailed exhibitions. Ydessa Hendeles, a Canadian collector and respected independent (and independently wealthy) curator, weaves contemporary and vintage photographs and assorted Gothic-style artifacts into an illuminating if slightly precious meditation on art and craft, the quick and the dead, fact and faith. Mr. St. John follows up with bracing, seemingly uncouth excursions into contemporary Americana via fibrous collage paintings that channel Jasper Johns and trace a love of the ephemeral and accident through trompe l'oeil painting, appropriation art and downsized, portable installation art. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Smith)
Weegee: 'Naked City' / Vivian Maier (through Feb. 25) Two careers in street photography -- markedly different in sensibility and visibility -- are contrasted in side-by-side shows. The raw, exuberant tabloid art of the famous Weegee (1899-1968) is manifest in a display of 125 images from throughout his career. Meanwhile, the secretive, recently discovered photographer Vivian Maier (1926-2009) took pictures ceaselessly, pursuing a style as unobtrusive as Weegee's is loud and in your face, but no less assured.

'Diggers, Mimes, Angels and Heads' (through Feb. 4) With dissent so much in the air these days, it is good to remember the Diggers, the hippie radicals who produced absurdist public theater and established free food dispensaries and a medical clinic in San Francisco in the mid to late '60s. Evoking the countercultural landscape in which they operated, this walk-in scrapbook of a show presents photographs; alarmist articles from the straight press; all kinds of ephemera; and a wall of psychedelic rock posters. Jack Hanley, 136 Watts Street, TriBeCa, (646) 918-6824, jackhanley.com. (Johnson)
Matt Hoyt: '2006-2011' (through Feb. 12) Displayed on wooden shelves in groups of two to six, Mr. Hoyt's sculptures look like nondescript found objects. Some resemble pieces of plastic plumbing; others are like small, rounded rocks. One could be a braded bracelet, another a piece of chicken bone. Learning that he made them out of clay, putty, paint and other materials turns them into epistemological thought experiments: what is real when appearances deceive? Bureau, 127 Henry Street, Lower East Side, (212) 227-2783, bureau-inc.com. (Johnson)
'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (through March 31) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
'Luminous Modernism: Scandinavian Art Comes to America, 1912' (through Feb. 11) In 1912 a big exhibition of contemporary art from Scandinavia opened in New York to much acclaim. Revisiting that show, ''Luminous Modernism'' presents 48 paintings and drawings mostly from the first decade of the 20th century. Twenty of the artists and eight of the works that were in the 1912 exhibition are included. Highlights include gloomy, Vermeer-like paintings by Vilhelm Hammershoi, of Denmark, and Edvard Munch's explosive ''Girl Under the Apple Tree,'' which alone is worth the visit.

Out of Town
- Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: 'Degas and the Nude' (through Feb. 5) This exceptional show -- which ought perhaps to have been called ''Degas and the Naked'' -- explores the unstinting, even cruel naturalism Degas brought to the female form. It will be especially eye-opening for the casual museumgoers who still think of Degas as a polite Impressionist, a painter of dancers and jockeys and hygienic groomers. On view are some 140 works by Degas and 20 more by his influencers, contemporaries and successors. 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
Brooklyn Museum: 'Youth and Beauty: Art of the American Twenties' (closes on Sunday) The compelling thesis of this expansive selection of works by more than 60 artists is that a turn to traditional forms of representation in the 1920s was a humanist response to industrialization, bureaucratization and consumerism. Nudes in photographs by Edward Weston and Alfred Stieglitz and in paintings by Peter Blume and Edwin Dickinson suggest an embrace of erotic freedom. Pastoral landscapes by Georgia O'Keeffe and Katherine Schmidt and still lifes by Louis Lozowick and Luigi Lucioni dream of holistic accord with rhythms of nature and ordinary life. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- 'Grisaille' (closes on Saturday) Organized by the writer and curator Alison Gingeras, this exhibition breathes life into a stodgy-sounding bit of art terminology. Its title refers to a painting method that dates to the 14th century and was sometimes used to imitate sculpture. Here, though, it's applied to just about any artwork made in shades of gray: tonal 17th-century Dutch harbor scene, monochromatic 18th-century wallpaper, or shimmering metallic works by Carl Andre and Jeff Koons. Luxembourg & Dayan, 64 East 77th Street, (212) 452-4646, luxembourgdayan.com. (Rosenberg)
Georges Hugnet: 'The Love Life of the Spumifers' (closes on Saturday) A poet, critic, publisher, book binder and collage maker, George Hugnet (1906-74) was a busy if minor player in the Parisian art scene between the wars. The main attraction here is a delightful series based on antique, soft-porn postcards of pretty young women, to each of which Hugnet added with a pointed brush what he called a ''Spumifer'': a colorful, comical monster resembling a randy, weird house pet. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, ubugallery.com. (Johnson)
'Kindred Spirits: Native American Influences on 20th Century Art' (closes on Saturday) This fraught yet exhilarating exhibition centers on a shatteringly beautiful array of American Indian art, including chalky Mimbres burial bowls, electrifying Navajo blankets, Western Apache baskets and dazzling earthenware of Zia, Zuni and Acoma derivation. Works by 20th-century artists from Georgia O'Keeffe to Bruce Nauman attest to the influence of these objects but rarely equal their seamless unity of material, technique and expression. Books and photographs dating from the mid-19th century onward indicate another unequal contest, this one between indigenous peoples and often admiring white interlopers. Peter Blum Gallery, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Smith)
- 'Late Medieval Panel Paintings: Methods, Materials, Meanings' (closes on Friday) This gem of an exhibition presents 22 panel paintings, mostly from Northern Europe and the second half of the 15th century. They are not by the top-tier artists of their times -- many remain unidentified -- but they still are riveting to behold. Highlights include a divinely blissful vision of the Virgin seated on a grass-topped wall with the naked baby Jesus in her lap. from the workshop of Dieric Bouts, and a luminous portrait of Mary praying, by Jean Bourdichon. Richard L. Feigen, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, www.rlfeigen.com. (Johnson)
Vivian Maier: 'Photographs From the Maloof Collection' (closes on Saturday) Along with a show at the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea, this exhibition provides a look at the recently discovered street photography of Maier (1926-2009), who worked as a children's nanny and died without exhibiting or publishing a single image. Her work adds to the history of 20th-century street photography by summing it up with an almost encyclopedic thoroughness while maintaining a consistent quality of calm, empathy and compositional clarity. Howard Greenberg Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 334-0010, howardgreenberg.com. (Smith)
- 'Matta: A Centennial Celebration' (closes on Saturday) This exhibition of paintings from the last three decades of Matta's 91-year life is a great revelation. Matta was an important influence on Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s while living in New York, but he fell off the American radar after the 1950s. Here, on canvases measuring up to 22 feet wide, figurative elements rendered with graffiti-like spontaneity blur into luminous, acridly colorful hazes and moods of cosmic delirium. Prepare to be exhilarated. Pace, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, thepacegallery.com. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures' (closes on Sunday) If you still think that African art is not your thing, here's a show that may change your mind. It's as beautiful to look at as a show can be, and it's a perception-changer in the way that it argues against basic misunderstandings surrounding this art. African art has no history? No independent tradition of realism? No portraiture? African and Western art are fundamentally different in content and purpose? Untrue across the board, as we see exquisitely demonstrated here. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sherrie Levine: Mayhem' (closes on Sunday) Despite the provocative title, nothing resembling mayhem occurs in the 30-year sampling of this die-hard appropriation artist's work. Photographs of photographs by Walker Evans and casts of sculptures by Duchamp and Brancusi undermine notions of originality and authorship, but more in the mind than the eye. The slyly appropriational abstract paintings look liveliest. Otherwise the general effect is of a tastefully appointed art boutique full of fastidious, expensive-looking objects, lightly dusted with irony, that personify the preciousness that Ms. Levine initially sought to expose. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
'The Woodstock Story Told in Paintings, Photography, Sculpture & Ceramics' (closes on Saturday) This lively exhibition concentrates on works made in New York State's famous rural artist outpost during the 1920s and '30s, when painters like George Bellows, George Ault, Emil Ganso, Doris Lee, Konrad Cramer and Ernest Fiene sifted through possible combinations of Precisionism, folk art, realism and Impressionism. Full of surprises, it delves into a pocket of American art history that museums all too frequently ignore. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'MATTA: A CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION': (closes on Saturday) This exhibition from the last three decades of Matta's 91-year life is a great revelation. Matta was an important influence on Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s while living in New York, but he fell off the American radar after the 1950s. Here, on canvases up to 22 feet wide, figurative elements rendered with graffitilike spontaneity blur into luminous, acridly colorful hazes and moods of cosmic delirium.

HEADLINE: Gaining 60%, Caterpillar Is Upbeat

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 60 percent, lifted by pent-up demand for new equipment and by continuing growth in developing countries.
The performance of Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, is an indicator of the strength of the global economy. Along with strong fourth-quarter earnings, Caterpillar issued optimistic guidance, saying that it expects the global economy to grow faster this year and construction activity to continue to improve in most parts of the world. 
Net income was $1.55 billion, or $2.32 a share, compared with $968 million, or $1.47 a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue jumped 35 percent, to $17.24 billion, as sales volume increased at all three of the company's main businesses. Revenue from the mining equipment company Bucyrus International, which Caterpillar acquired in July, totaled $1.39 billion.
Caterpillar's results easily topped Wall Street predictions for profit of $1.76 a share and $15.95 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. That sent its shares higher. The stock rose $2.26, or 2.07 percent, to $111.31.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria. Ill., said that despite the continuing downturn in the construction industry, many of its customers had to replace their aging equipment during the quarter. In addition, the company continued to get a boost from rapid economic growth in developing parts of the world.
Construction sales rose 31 percent, to $5.26 billion, while resource industries sales, which include Bucyrus, jumped 80 percent, to $5.06 billion. Sales of power systems were up 22 percent, to $5.67 billion.
Caterpillar expects the global economy to grow about 3.3 percent this year, with the United States economy expanding by at least 3 percent. In addition, construction spending in the United States, which has been declining since 2004, should finally begin to recover, the company said.

HEADLINE: Markets Fall as Bank Shares and Home Sales Decline

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell, reversing a rally that sent the Dow Jones industrial average toward its highest level since 2008 earlier Thursday, after bank shares tumbled and a report showed that sales of new homes declined unexpectedly.
Banks fell the most among 24 groups in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index because of concern about the industry's ability to increase profits after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep the benchmark interest rate low. Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp slumped. AT&T, the phone company, slid 2.5 percent as its profit forecast trailed estimates.
The S.& P. 500 lost 0.6 percent to 1,318.43. The Dow fell 22.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,734.63, after earlier rising to the highest level on a closing basis since May 2008. The Nasdaq composite index was down 13.03 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,805.28. 
''It's a little bit of cold water in the face,'' said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. ''We're in risk territory because we've come a long way in the market and in terms of optimism on the economy. It's premature to think that we've solved all problems.''
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 17/32, to 100. The yield fell to 1.94 percent, from 2.0 percent late Wednesday.
A report showed that sales of new homes declined unexpectedly in December for the first time in four months, capping the slowest year on record for builders. Claims for jobless benefits rose last week, showing the usual volatility around holidays that has masked an improvement in the labor market. Orders for durable goods rose more than forecast in December.
The Fed's low interest rate pledge may hurt lenders' profits as they struggle to find loans or securities with yields high enough to support their net interest margins, a gauge of profitability that measures the difference between the cost of money and what they earn on assets.
''The statement itself was market-friendly in terms of reiterating that the Fed is going to remain largely accommodative,'' said Ryan Larson, Chicago-based head of United States equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management. ''When you talk about the banking environment and some of these companies that are directly tied to interest rates, it's going to probably put a cap on some of those companies going forward until rates start to increase.''
A gauge of home builders in S.& P. indexes slumped 3.4 percent. PulteGroup retreated 2.4 percent to $7.80. Lennar declined 2.9 percent to $22.13.
E*Trade Financial tumbled 15 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, to $7.99 after the online brokerage firm's results missed analyst estimates and Sandler O'Neill & Partners cut its rating.
Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, rallied 2.1 percent, the biggest gain in the Dow, to $111.31. It posted fourth-quarter earnings and forecast full-year profit that topped analysts' estimates. Netflix Inc. surged 22 percent, the most since January 2010, to $116.01. The online and mail-order video rental service reported fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates and forecast improving margins in its streaming business.
J. C. Penney climbed 19 percent to $40.72 after saying cost reductions may increase 2012 profits more than analysts estimated.
''Earnings continue to come in better than expected, our economy is improving,'' said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''It looks like the 'euro-quake' situation appears, at least in the short term, to be on the back burner.''
European stocks advanced, climbing 20 percent from a September low and entering a bull market. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.1 percent to 257.86.

HEADLINE: Economy Ended '11 With More Energy Than Expected

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New orders for manufactured goods rose in December and a gauge of future business investment rebounded, showing the economy ended the year with more momentum than previously thought. 
Other reports on Thursday showed new claims for jobless benefits rose moderately last week, suggesting the labor market was healing only slowly, while new single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in December.
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods climbed 3 percent last month, helped by a surge in aircraft orders. Economists had forecast a 2 percent rise.
''There's some momentum here,'' said Jacob Oubina, an economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
''Heading into the first quarter, the momentum is going to be pretty decent.''
Durable goods range from toasters to big items like aircraft and are meant to last three years or more.
The data suggested that American companies could be more willing to invest the $2 trillion in cash they have amassed in recent years. The Federal Reserve warned on Wednesday that business investment had cooled.
Orders for capital goods outside of military spending and excluding aircraft, which are a proxy for business spending plans, climbed a steeper-than-expected 2.9 percent. They had declined the previous two months.
Also, shipments of orders within that category, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, rose 2.9 percent after declining 1 percent in November.
The overall increase in orders was buoyed by an 18.9 percent jump in orders for civilian aircraft. Boeing received 287 orders for aircraft during the month, according to the plane maker's Web site, increasing from 96 in November.
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of future economic activity rose to a five-month high in December as labor market conditions improved. It said that its index of leading economic indicators was up 0.4 percent in December, after a 0.2 percent increase in November and a 0.6 percent rise in October.
The Labor Department data showed new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week but the underlying trend continued to point to improving labor market conditions.
Initial claims for state unemployment aid increased 21,000, to 377,000. The four-week moving average for initial claims, which provides a better view of trends, fell 2,500, to 377,500.
''We're still very much established below 400,000, continuing to suggest that there is modest improvement in the labor market,'' said Lindsey M. Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
A report coming Friday is expected to show the economy grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from 1.8 percent in the previous period.
The Commerce Department also released a report showing new single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in December for the first time in four months, while the median home price dropped.
The housing market remains constrained by high unemployment, falling prices and an oversupply of unsold homes after a the real estate bubble that led to the 2007-9 recession.
Still, there were a record low 157,000 new homes on the market last month. That could feed additional speculation that the housing sector is on the cusp of a recovery.

HEADLINE: After Fall, Winter

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Eric Schaeffer has said he intends his latest film, ''After Fall, Winter,'' to be the second of four he will make at 15-year intervals focused on the same character. Watch out, current holder of the World's Longest Vanity Project title. 
As in ''Fall,'' the first installment, in 1997, Mr. Schaeffer wrote and directed and awarded himself the lead role, that of a fellow named Michael Shiver. He also awarded himself a gorgeous woman, as he did in the earlier film. Must be some kind of legal requirement in this type of self-aggrandizing movie.
Michael is a writer in New York who had one successful book but can't replicate that achievement. So he goes to France because, in the movies at least, people with no apparent income can indulge in international travel at will. In Paris he quickly takes up with Sophie (Lizzie Brochere), because, in the movies at least, beautiful, much younger women always fall for unemployed middle-aged losers.
The lovebirds' dialogue has the sophistication of a junior high school romance, and Mr. Schaeffer appears to have pasted his story together from the button-pushing plotlines of other films. A kid with leukemia. A mom with no memory. A dominatrix. None of it is convincing; Mr. Schaeffer's acting is shallow (Ms. Brochere's isn't); and the Shakespearean-tragedy ending stands a good chance of drawing guffaws.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Eric Schaeffer 2 hours 10 minutes; not rated
