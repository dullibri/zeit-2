HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Contrarian Bets on Growth In Japan Send Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday ahead of the release of a quarterly Japanese economic report that some traders gambled would surprise markets with hints of strength.
The dollar gained slightly against the mark after Germany's central bank left a money market rate there unchanged. The securities repurchase rate remained at 3 percent, though traders expect an increase later this year. 
 While the Tankan report, the Japanese central bank's quarterly measure of business sentiment, is expected to be gloomy, the chance of a positive report had many traders betting on the yen. "If it comes out bad, there's not going to be much movement," said Ralph Del Zenero, a First National Bank of Chicago vice president. "You hope for a better number and take a little flier."
The yen has been battered by the weak Japanese economy, which has left interest rates at record low levels. A surprisingly strong Tankan report would shift sentiment toward a rate increase, which could be expected to bolster the yen.
Evidence has been building that the report, to be released today, would be weak. Yesterday, reports on Japanese industrial output and retail sales for August were both weaker than expected. But in pieces of positive news, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in September industrial production and an increase of eight-tenths of a percent for October.
The Federal Reserve's decision to leave American interest rates unchanged was no surprise. But two reports that have the ability to move the market are due this week. Today, the National Association of Purchasing Management is to issue its reading of the economy for September, and on Friday, employment figures for September are due.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 120.50 yen, down from 120.95 yen on Monday. The dollar traded at 1.7624 German marks, up from 1.7621. It declined against the British pound, which sold for $1.6168, up from $1.6093 Monday. The pound regained more of what it had lost last Friday on a report that Britain was considering participation in the planned European single currency sooner than expected.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Downsizing Opens a Door For a Sculptor

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE ROARING 20's served Corrine Weinberg well during the Go-Go 80's. Her detailed Art Deco sculptures of flappers and elegant couples, which cost as much as $30,000, sold briskly to collectors and executives who identified with the era's good times and easy money. But the art market eventually shriveled up when, like the old days, the economy nose-dived and executives were downsized out of existence.
So Mrs. Weinberg did a little downsizing, too. She makes cabinet handles and knobs that fetch one-thousandth the price that her flappers used to command. Working on a thick-planked table in her Yorkville apartment, she stays up late into the night with her tools and sheets of casting wax as she sculptures knobs that range from Art Deco pieces to bugs, animals and even a Texas Ranger's badge. 
 North River Mint, the company she founded last year with her husband, Harvey, sells its tiny textured pieces through 73 outlets nationwide that offer what the trade calls "alternative hardware." In her own alternative career, Mrs. Weinberg still taps into the spirit of the times, because her work appeals to homeowners who want to spruce up their rooms without busting the budget.
"People are redecorating in lieu of buying a new house," she said. "A knob can change the mood of a whole room."
It can also lift the spirit of an artist who refused to go away when the galleries closed their doors.
"If it's sculpture, I can do it," she said. "It's just a smaller scale for a different purpose."
The view of the East River from their apartment gives the Weinbergs a nice vista of Brooklyn and Queens, where they lived and met as teen-agers. During their marriage of "a long time," he was a business marketing and promotions executive, while she pursued her work as a self-taught artist.
She drew and sculptured, without ever quite having a vision of her own. That changed in 1980, when she and Harvey visited the Met.
 "WE walked down this long hall and there was this painting by Renoir," he said. "I asked her who did it. She said, 'Renoir, of course.'
He said to her: " 'You know that because you can recognize his style. I'll tell you something, you have no style at this point.' "
One morning the next week, she told him about a dream she had about flappers and the 1920's. That, she felt, was her style.
"It was more than just dancing and music, but an overall attitude people had at the time," she said. "It just thrills me. It was very sensuous. The clothing left a lot to your imagination."
It obviously captured other people's attention, because by the mid-80's she was selling thousands of pieces, having gallery shows and even being featured in the window of Tiffany.
 THAT changed when the recession settled in and galleries began closing, since mid-priced artwork like hers was not something you absolutely needed to have in order to live. A few years ago, her husband had an idea of his own, though. He took her to a local hardware store and showed her a selection of knobs. She could beat this stuff easily, he said. Besides, with his business knowledge, they could finally work together.
With the kind of attention to detail his wife favors in her work, Mr. Weinberg did exhaustive research before settling on the metals and manufacturing method he now uses for the individually hand cast pieces.
Mrs. Weinberg, who has designed more than 100 pieces, said the transition from fine art to hardware was smooth.
"The work I'm doing could bring art into the bedroom, kitchen or any room they choose to put my work," she said. "I have seen ladies' dressing rooms where closets go up to the ceiling, with dozens of cabinet doors with a different knob on each. It's a very artistic way of dealing with my designs."
With one or two new distributors signing on every week, the Weinbergs are busy planning to expand into clothing hooks and towel racks. Their pieces sell well in the $20 range, said Michael Rizzuto, a senior buyer at Gracious Home, which was the first store to feature the North River Mint. He still remembers when Mr. Weinberg came to him with his wife's sculpture portfolio and proposed making similarly styled knobs and hardware. He took to the idea and has encouraged the couple ever since.
"Somebody gave me a break," Mr. Rizzuto said. "I was the house carpenter here and with a decent knowledge of hardware I came up through the ranks. I lucked out, and that's why I probably want to spread it around."
You could say he opened the door for the Weinbergs. Luckily, they were ready with the knobs.

HEADLINE: Aim Sanctions at Iran, Not France

 BODY:
The $2 billion Iranian gas-field development contract signed by the Total Oil Group of France, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia is doubly unfortunate. It will provide new funds to a Government that is exporting terrorism, developing nuclear weapons and disrupting peace efforts between Israel and the Arab world. The contract could also trigger the first application of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, an ill-advised law that attempts to impose American penalties on foreign companies doing energy business with Iran or Libya.
The Sanctions Act, crafted primarily by Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York and signed by President Clinton last year, is intended to force Europe's policies on Iran into line with those of the United States. Instead it drives Europe and America further apart. Washington and Paris should be talking about how to change Iran's unacceptable policies. Instead they are now engaged in a noisy, unproductive dispute over Congress's attempts to legislate beyond American borders. 
 This trans-Atlantic quarrel comes at a time when there are signs that Iran may be reconsidering its policies following the recent election of Mohammed Khatami, a relative moderate, as President. The West should now be sending coordinated signals that Teheran can secure increased international investment and an end to American sanctions if it abandons its dangerous behavior.
President Clinton must decide what penalties, if any, to apply against the offending foreign companies. At most, he could bar all three from any trade with the United States. He should instead emphasize diplomatic responses, including continued discussions with France, despite the rebuff Prime Minister Lionel Jospin gave Washington this week.
The United States, in defense of its own national security, rightly bans American oil companies, like Conoco, from developing Iranian energy resources. But most European countries dispute American contentions about Iranian terrorism and nuclear weapons programs and insist that maintaining what they call a "critical dialogue" with Teheran is the most effective way to influence Iranian policies.
In the case of France, with its extensive and long-established business dealings with Iran, this approach is a smokescreen for subordinating global security to commercial gain. France has also unhelpfully appointed itself the world's leading challenger of American diplomacy and economic ideas.
Iran's weapons development programs, support for terrorism and disruptive diplomacy pose grave dangers not only to American interests but to the security and prosperity of Europe as well. Washington needs to keep the strongest possible pressure on France to restrain its commerce with Teheran. Yet the D'Amato law dilutes the case by shifting the argument from Iran's dangerous conduct to America's legislative interference in its allies' sovereign affairs.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds End Quarter on Some Profit Taking

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities finished generally lower yesterday, though they closed out the third quarter far higher than where they were at the end of the second quarter.
Yesterday's decision by the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged, which had been expected, had little effect. But bonds briefly rose after the release of weaker-than-expected economic data. Those gains were eroded later in the day by profit taking ahead of today's report from corporate purchasing managers and Friday's release of September employment data. 
 As Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, put it, "Bond market participants are rarely comfortable, even when they are happy."
With the Fed choosing not to raise short-term rates, the market's focus now shifts to the November and December meetings. "Undoubtedly, the Fed kept its bias toward tightening in place," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. Given the economy's momentum -- despite yesterday's reports, growth has been relatively robust of late -- the Fed might move to raise rates in November at any hint of inflation, he said.
Yesterday, the 30-year bond slipped 4/32, to a price of 99 24/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.38 percent on Monday. That is still nearly four-tenths of a percentage point less than the yield of 6.78 percent on June 30, when the second quarter ended.
Mr. Donne said that for the broad bond market, July was good, August was terrible and September had turned out to be strong again.
"We're coming out of what appears to be another good quarter, maybe one showing about 3.50 percent total return" for investments, he said. "If you multiply that by four quarters, then it's a great year for bonds."
Most of the market's gains in the quarter have come in securities with long maturities, the end of the market most sensitive to expectations about inflation. After an uptick in the fourth quarter of 1996, inflation pressures for the most part have shown steady declines.
There was some nervousness in the bond market going into the third quarter because of the second quarter's strength. Market participants expected that the second quarter's rate of growth was unsustainable, but did not know how much it would slow. Of particular concern was the tightness of the labor market -- a concern that has been punctuated by strikes like the one at the United Parcel Service -- raising fears that inflation might be rekindled.
Some portfolio managers found it difficult to stick with traditionally high-return investments like corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities because of the uncertainty over the direction of interest rates. In times of declining yields, mortgage-backed securities are often called in advance, leaving managers with voids in their portfolios.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that in the third quarter market participants came to realize that the Fed had changed the theoretical framework it used to view the economy. During Congressional testimony in July, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, alluded to the idea that inflation could remain low despite a robust economy.
Despite the big movement in the 30-year bond, Mr. Alexy said, the third quarter was not as volatile as the second. The yield on the long bond in the second quarter rose to more than 7 percent; in the third quarter, it fell back to levels seen at the beginning of the year.
Mr. Alexy said he believed that the preference of investors has been shifting to the fixed-income market, from equities, in the last six weeks. "Going forward, I expect the Fed to keep rates stable and for consumer spending to be slower," he said. Those conditions, Mr. Alexy added, could result in the long bond's yield dropping to about 6.125 percent.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Envoy to Paris Ponders His Stormy Start

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Barely three weeks after presenting his credentials as the new American Ambassador to France, Felix G. Rohatyn found himself today in the middle of a full-fledged crisis over a $2 billion investment in Iran by the French oil company Total.
French officials from President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on down have made little secret of their contempt, shared by most governments in Europe, for American legislation that threatens sanctions against foreign countries that invest more than $20 million in Iran. And on Monday, Mr. Jospin went so far as to express enthusiasm for the oil deal, which had been a long time in the making for Total and its Russian and Malaysian partners. 
 "Why now?" Mr. Rohatyn asked himself, in shirt sleeves during an interview today in his New Deal-era embassy office off the Champs-Elysees. He was apparently taken aback by the timing of Total's announcement and Mr. Jospin's support for it.
"You know, at age 69, you are not surprised by much," he said. "Does it poison the relationship between France and the U.S.? I hope not. I don't believe it will. It shouldn't."
An open relationship, he said, would always have differences, but it should be able to overcome "singular events" like this one.
Mr. Rohatyn, a former partner of the Lazard Freres investment firm in New York City, implied that conversations he and other American officials have had with Europeans in high places about their dealings with Iran had not led them to believe a major confrontation would be in the works so soon.
Mr. Rohatyn presented his credentials to Mr. Chirac on Sept. 11, succeeding Pamela Harriman, who died on Feb. 5 after suffering a stroke. His perfect French and his expertise in the world of international finance both earned a warm welcome in the diplomatic and corporate salons of Paris, a capital preoccupied with preserving French influence in an increasingly competitive global economy that the French think is dominated by Anglo-Saxon interests.
"Globalization doesn't carry a threat, but it carries discipline, and then you always have a notion that we are imposing an American-style Anglo-Saxon capitalism," he said. "People forget that 10 years ago, we were being written off, and Japan and Germany were going to take over the world. Now that, like a lot of economic predictions, turned out to be wrong."
Mr. Rohatyn spoke coolly about the deal involving Total, which was once state-owned but is now almost entirely privately held. One way to view the issue, he said, was to see it as "three private companies deciding to make an investment, recognizing that there are risks in this investment because it flies in the face of the law in the U.S.A."
"They decided to make the investment, presumably because they thought the profit was greater than the risk, and they clearly knew the risk," he said. "They evaluated it, and now they have to deal with it, whatever that risk turns out to be."
Gazprom, a huge and politically influential Russian petroleum company, and Petronas, a Malaysian state oil firm, are partners with Total in the Iranian deal.
Mr. Rohatyn would not say today what steps he thought the Clinton Administration would take under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, often called the D'Amato law after Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, a Senate sponsor.
But he had an answer for French and other European critics of the D'Amato law and the Helms-Burton law relating to business dealings with Cuba; these critics complain that the laws are examples of attempts by Congress to legislate beyond American boundaries.
"The issue of extraterritoriality, you know, that's a little bit like modern art," he joked. "What is extraterritorial?"
After the European Union's executive commission threatened to disapprove the Boeing Company's merger with McDonnell Douglas last summer, he said, Boeing had to agree to remove exclusivity provisions from 20-year supply contracts with three domestic United States airlines -- American, Continental, and Delta.
"A lot of people back home thought that was extraterritorial," Mr. Rohatyn said. "It's not an open and shut issue." Beyond the problem of Total's decision to put $2 billion into exploitation of an Iranian gas field, he said, was a more important quandary facing Washington and its European allies. "That is, how does the West, how the European Union, France, and the U.S. deal with the behavior of a state that can pose a danger to Western society," he said.
Washington suspects that Iran has tried to develop nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them, with help from unemployed Russian scientists. The European Union has its own problems with Iran; its member states withdrew their ambassadors from Teheran last summer after a German court found Iranian leaders directly responsible for the killing of three Iranian Kurdish opposition figures in the bombing of a cafe in Berlin in 1992.
"One of the unfortunate things about the timing of this," he said of Total's decision, "is that it may get in the way of what I think is clearly a more important discussion." That, he said, would include an evaluation of a change in direction by the authorities in Iran after last summer's presidential election there.
Keeping up good American relations with France despite continual French suspicions that America would secretly like to relegate its oldest European ally to the rank of a second-rate economic and military power bedevils every American ambassador to Paris.
One of Mr. Rohatyn's jobs has been reassuring banking friends and the numerous French officials he has been calling on that the United States does not oppose the European Union plan to create a common European currency, the euro, in 1999.
"We have an interest in a strong Europe, and Europe has an interest in a strong U.S.," he said. "The euro is a European construction. The criteria of who should join, when, what the parities should be, are all very important, somewhat technical issues in which we have no say, and no preference.
"There is this notion that we are threatened by the euro, that the dollar is threatened by the euro," he laughed. "It is absolutely not true. Our interest is in the outcome. If their decision is to go ahead, we hope that will be successful."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Albright Criticizes France
 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright strongly criticized France last night for supporting the Total project, expressing frustration that "our friends and allies" did not agree with the United States' efforts to isolate Iran because of its support for terrorism.
Ms. Albright also said that while the election of Iran's new President, Mohammed Khatami, was "intriguing," his Government had done nothing to change what she described as Iran's sponsorship of terrorism, its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process.
"It is also a grave concern to us that our friends and allies don't get it," Ms. Albright said, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. "They seem to think that there is some way that we can deal with them without in some way supporting" Iran's behavior.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Aide Warns Czechs to Upgrade Military for NATO

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Just as three Central European Governments began detailed talks this month on how their forces would be integrated into NATO, a senior Pentagon official warned the Czechs that they were trailing behind in upgrading their military, according to Czech and American officials.
Assistant Defense Secretary Franklin D. Kramer met with the Czech Defense Ministry two weeks ago and said the Government's military spending was not sufficient, the officials said. He also expressed concern about the lack of enthusiasm among the Czech public for membership in NATO. 
 The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were invited to join NATO at a meeting of the alliance in Madrid in July. Opening NATO to the three former Warsaw Pact countries has been a major foreign policy initiative of the Clinton Administration.
The Administration pushed for the inclusion of the new members but told them that they would have to modernize their outdated, Soviet-trained armies. A principal element of the Administration's argument has been that expanding NATO would not burden taxpayers.
This month the three Governments sent delegates to NATO headquarters in Brussels to begin the first round of specific negotiations. Mr. Kramer's criticism of the Czechs came just as they started.
Czech military spending, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, is the lowest of the three countries. In Poland it is 2.2 percent of gross domestic product. And Czech popular opinion lags far behind the roar of Polish public sentiment and the growing enthusiasm in Hungary, where military spending accounts for 1.7 percent of gross domestic product.
Because of recent economic difficulties in the Czech Republic, the Government has been under pressure to continue the downward trend in military spending.
"It's true that more needs to be done," said Jire Pehe, the foreign policy adviser to the Czech President, Vaclav Havel. "There needs to be increased public support, and the army needs to modernized and restructured."
Mr. Pehe said Mr. Havel had taken the unusual step of intervening in a Government meeting three weeks ago and insisting that the Czechs keep to a promise of increasing annual military spending by one-tenth of 1 percent of the gross domestic product over five years. Last week the Government approved a draft budget that included the increase. The budget still has to survive three presentations in Parliament.
The Czech Deputy Foreign Minister, Karel Kovanda, presented the military spending plans to President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, at a meeting in Washington on Monday, an Administration official said. The Foreign Ministers of Poland and Hungary also attended.
Czech Government officials have known for more than a year that they were behind in meeting some NATO requirements but have been slow to remedy the problems.
This is in part because the Czechs have been good at selling themselves abroad but less adept at selling NATO at home. They have also basked in the knowledge that they have a big ally in the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia.
Public opinion surveys at the beginning of this year showed that about 35 percent of Czechs were in favor of joining NATO. Recently the number has climbed to 50 percent in some surveys, Mr. Pehe said.

HEADLINE: Experts Envision Battle Between Drug and Tobacco Companies

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The increasing popularity of smoking-cessation aids like nicotine gum and skin patches portends intense competition between drug makers and tobacco companies to deliver smoke-free nicotine to millions of Americans who now smoke, tobacco researchers and market analysts say.
The desire of many smokers to quit and the availability of nonprescription nicotine replacements pose substantial financial risks for the tobacco companies and a huge market opportunity for pharmaceutical manufacturers, these experts say. 
 As a result, tobacco companies, in addition to selling cigarettes, are working on alternative devices of their own that deliver nicotine without the severe health risks of smoking. The drug companies, meanwhile, having already introduced nicotine gum and the nicotine patch, are now marketing a nicotine nasal spray and are developing related products, including a nicotine-laced lollipop.
An article being published on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that although their ultimate goals are different -- tobacco companies want to keep their customers for a lifetime, while the drug companies' products are aimed at weaning them from nicotine -- the two giant industries are on a collision course.
"A series of technological, economic, political, regulatory and social developments augurs a strange-bedfellows competition in which these industries will vie for shares of a new multibillion-dollar long-term nicotine-maintenance market," says the article, titled "The Emerging Market for Long-Term Nicotine Maintenance."
Pharmaceutical companies contend that their nicotine replacement products are to be used only temporarily, as a therapeutic aid to help cigarette smokers kick the habit. And until recently, public health officials had been unwilling to speak openly about encouraging development of products to support protracted "nicotine maintenance." Doctors and anti-smoking advocates have urged rapid smoking-cessation programs or quitting cold turkey as the only ways to address nicotine addiction.
But the principal author of the report in the journal, Dr. Kenneth E. Warner of the department of health management and policy at the University of Michigan's School of Public Heath, said in an interview that it was now acceptable to begin thinking about longer-term nicotine therapy, perhaps lasting for years. Such therapy could take the form of a so-called safe cigarette that delivers nicotine without the lethal byproducts of burning tobacco. Or it might be one of the nicotine replacement products now available over the counter, like Nicorette gum or the Nicoderm patch.
"When I first broached this idea three or four years ago, the public health community's reaction was one of horror," Dr. Warner said. "But now a lot of leading thinkers have become more sympathetic," given the recognition that long-term use of nicotine alone, whatever its health drawbacks, is by far preferable to a continuation of smoking.
Dr. Warner acknowledged that some health professionals might find the idea of long-term nicotine use undesirable. But as the cigarette companies and the drug makers rush to develop new nicotine delivery systems, he said, tobacco users will have numerous new means of satisfying their nicotine craving.
"I think the time is right to open this debate and do so with no blinders on," Dr. Warner said.
The SmithKline Beecham Corporation is the nation's leading marketer of nicotine replacement products, selling both Nicorette and Nicoderm through its Consumer Healthcare division. George M. Quesnelle, Consumer Healthcare's vice president for medical marketing and sales, said the company had no intention of marketing its products for long-term use to compete against the cigarette companies for customers.
"We have very opposite goals from the tobacco companies: to help people quit smoking," he said in an interview. "We're coming from diametrically opposed views."
Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, said the company's officials had not seen the article in the journal and so could not comment on it.
But she added, "We have never perceived ourselves in competition with drug companies."

HEADLINE: Syracuse and S.E.C. Settle a Case Alleging Bond Fraud

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Budget officials in Syracuse fraudulently misled the bond market about the crumbling state of the city's budget in selling $23.1 million in bonds in late 1995 and early 1996, the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday.
The commission, in a settlement agreement with the city, said that Syracuse supplied misleading and mislabeled information about its revenue, which, among other results, made it appear as though the city had a budget surplus of $400,000 when it faced a deficit of $9.4 million. 
 Syracuse officials admitted no wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, and the city's Mayor, Roy A. Bernardi, stressed that the problems cited by the S.E.C. were inadvertent and not deliberate deceptions. A spokesman for the Mayor said the two employees of the Finance Department who were named in the complaint had been reassigned to non-financial reporting duties.
"There was no deliberate effort on the part of any member of this administration to mislead securities investors," Mr. Bernardi said in a statement. "I am pleased that the S.E.C. in its report today recognizes these facts and the extraordinary steps we have taken to insure that problems of this nature will never again occur."
City officials said that the bonds were paid back in full and that no investor lost money.
But the bonds were sold at interest rates that were set on the basis of information supplied by the city that later turned out to be false. Credit analysts said bond buyers did lose money because they would have demanded higher interest rates on the city's debt had they known the truth.
The settlement comes as one more blow to New York's fifth-largest municipality, a once-solid manufacturing city that has struggled in recent years as its economy and its taxation system have come under severe stress. Its recovery from the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's was far weaker than much of the state's -- or the nation's. And the city budget was further crimped beginning in 1991 when Onondaga County reduced the city's share of the local sales tax revenue.
Haphazard or inadequate financial reporting systems at City Hall made those problems worse, according to the bond-rating agencies that follow municipal finances.
"The recession impacted the city's finances negatively, but poor management systems compounded the degree of fiscal erosion," Standard & Poor's said in announcing a cut in the city's bond rating in March.
The Syracuse auditor, Minch Lewis, a Democrat who has been a vehement critic of the Mayor's financial management -- one of Mr. Lewis's reports led to the commission's investigation 18 months ago -- said yesterday that he believed the problems had still not been fixed. The city is still unable to produce monthly reports on its financial condition and has not done so for years.
"They're flying a $330 million plane with no instruments," he said, referring to the city budget.
The commission said in its settlement report that Syracuse had improperly counted tax revenues that had not yet been paid to the city and overstated the amount of money it had on hand. The city also labeled certain statements as having been "audited," which generally means that the material had been thoroughly checked, when in fact the auditors had expressed reservations. The misstatements collectively made the city's fiscal position seem more solvent than it was, which then made the city's bonds more attractive to the market. The S.E.C. sought no fines, penalties or criminal charges in the case.
Mr. Bernardi, who served as Syracuse's auditor for 20 years before being elected mayor in 1993 -- the first Republican mayor in 24 years -- said that many of the city's reporting problems resulted from trying to overhaul an antiquated Finance Department. The city was still using handwritten ledgers for its accounts when he took office, for example. That system has been replaced with computers.
A spokesman for Standard & Poor's said the settlement would probably not damage the city because the problems, as well as the commission's investigation, had already been factored into the company's most recent risk assessment of the city, in March.
"It's a restatement of something that was out there all along," said Richard J. Marino, a director in Standard & Poor's New York office. "I wouldn't anticipate any change in the rating at this time."

HEADLINE: Fur Is Coming Out of the Fashion Industry's Closet

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Perhaps it started in the spring, when the fashion model Naomi Campbell, who once posed nude for an advertisement that read "I'd rather go naked than wear fur," strolled down the Fendi runway draped in a sable-lined coat from the Italian fashion house. Or maybe it was this fall, when all the important American retail fashion directors announced that they were buying something with fur. But what surely sealed it was the September issue of Vogue, whose cover featured a baby-blue Mongolian lamb jacket.
Fashion is once again placing its bets on fur, so recently a pariah in the industry. 
 Fashion magazines have sold more pages advertising fur this fall than they have in recent memory. Vogue sold 28 pages of fur ads for its fall issues, the most in a decade, said its publisher, Ronald A. Galotti. At Harper's Bazaar, fall fur ads for 1997 are up 87 percent from last year and are also at a 10-year high .
In the September issue of W magazine, the fashion directors of Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale's and Barneys New York all praised fur -- the first such group hug in years.
And maybe most striking, many more designers, often up-and-comers, now use fur in their collections, and in dozens of new ways. Indeed, 42 designers worked with fur in 1985, while nearly 160 do today, said Stephanie Kenyon, spokeswoman for the Fur Information Council. And they make far more than coats.
Fur is now used as trim on suits, woven through evening gowns and fashioned into handbags. The designer Michael Kors even sent a mink hooded sweatshirt down the runway last spring.
The rebirth of the fur business traces its roots to an odd confluence of circumstances, from a stronger economy and an expanding number of affluent people to growing annoyance with the tactics of anti-fur protesters to a mercurial swing in fashion and life styles, both of which have moved steadily from simplicity to conspicuous consumption.
To be sure, those who stand firmly against fur are enraged about the fashion industry's new embrace.
"Fur is not back," insisted Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "We are pretty flabbergasted that the fashion press has picked up on the fur industry's constant barrage."
The emergence of new designers can be credited almost entirely to the fur industry itself, which spent millions of dollars reaching out to them, teaching them how to work with fur, modernize dowdy looks and convince the trend-obsessed fashion press that fur is once again hip.
The fashion press is an essential part of the equation: it gives the green light on trends to retailers, who in turn buy from designers, who then buy advertisements in the fashion press. And all these players seem determined to bring back fur from its very public downfall at the beginning of the decade, when fur-draped matrons were doused with paint as they emerged from Macy's.
Already, fur sales in the United States have crept back from a 1991 low of $987 million, to $1.25 billion last year. Though that is far below the 1987 peak of $1.8 billion, retailers around the country are confident that a rebound is under way.
"I started to see the handwriting on the wall in the summer of 1996," said Wanda Presburger, president of Somper Furs in Beverly Hills, Calif. "Clients started asking me to clean furs that they haven't had cleaned in a few years. They also started asking, 'What's new?' " She said her sales in 1996 were $1.6 million, a 20 percent increase from the previous year.
"It is absolutely tremendous," said Doyle Hoyer, president of Hoyer's Glasgow Ltd. in Fort Madison, Iowa. "I was up 18 percent last year over 1995, and the trend looks the same for this year."
Like cigars, large vehicles and red meat, fur may be on the brink of returning to the fold of socially acceptable indulgences as many wealthy consumers brush off early 1990's taboos in favor of flaunting their good fortune.
"Fashion is simply less drawn to the moral strictures that drove fur out," said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "In the late 1980's, people avoided stiletto heels out of a sense of prudence and morality, and it was the same thing with fur. But those forces are certainly waning now. There is a certain cultural sense now that if it feels good, wear it."
Debbie Porter, a sales clerk in Morrison, Ill., bought her first fur coat six years ago but did not dare wear it too often for fear of confrontations with anti-fur protesters. "I would never wear it in an airport," she said. "That was just asking for trouble."
But lately she has draped herself in her ankle-length mink to go everywhere from dinner to the grocery store, pairing the coat with high heels or sneakers.
Demand for furs has clearly risen.The National Trappers' Association and other wildlife experts estimate that the number of wild animal skins now on the market is up at least 30 percent from 1992. The Seattle Fur Exchange, one of the two largest fur auction houses in North America, said mink prices at auctions this year were the highest ever.
Another reason for the return of fur, say people on both sides of the debate, is that Americans have grown weary of anti-fur protesters, who were often perceived as shrill and whose rhetoric often seemed peppered with contradictions.
The argument against animal products, for instance, is hard to swallow for those who wear leather shoes and nibble on chicken wings. And while many saw the rights of animals as a noble cause, many Americans became increasingly irritated at not being able to walk down the street without being accosted. An added twist is that synthetic furs have become so real-looking that often no one can even tell a real fur from a fake, making it hard for the anti-fur people to pick a target.
"The anti-fur movement had its moment and did sort of spend itself," said Julia Emberley, author of "The Cultural Politics of Fur" (Cornell University Press), which will be published in December. "Consumers have become somewhat cynical because the movement presented itself in a very morally self-righteous way. Many consumers feel that it is effectively an issue of consumer rights."
As for the overall boom in luxury goods, Ms. Newkirk of the animal-rights group added: "People know more about the cruelty than ever before. Smoking a cigar is not like anally electrocuting a chinchilla." Unpleasant images like that have been at the heart of the debate for a decade, and until recently animal-rights advocates -- also citing throat-slitting and paw-mangling traps -- seemed to be winning the debate handily.
A spokeswoman for the Fur Information Council, though, insists that anal electrocution is not done on fur farms and that animals are slaughtered much the way they are at animal shelters, which People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals insists is untrue. The group argues that killing animals for their fur is unethical no matter how it is done.
Demand for fur was so strong in the 1970's and early 1980's that furriers could not make enough coats, and prices rose sharply, leading to a flood of inexpensive knock-offs. By 1990, prices and profit margins had softened, and fur began to lose much of its fashion edge. Bargain-basement prices meant that anyone who saved a few dollars could get a cheap coat, which eroded a central appeal: exclusivity.
"Obviously, the fact that coats were being offered at $1,995 with installment payments enlarged the customer base," said Claude Potier, chief executive of Revillon, based in Paris. "But the women for whom the coat was a symbol of luxury were discouraged and bought fewer."
The 1990's also ushered in a recession, along with a short-lived austerity in style. Monkish looks dominated the fashion pages, right next to the grunge look. Cashmere, BMW's and club-hopping took a momentary back seat to flannel shirts, recycling and mulching. Animal-rights groups were in their heyday, and many furriers went bankrupt.
Then, in 1994, the fur business quietly began a public relations campaign of its own. Led by Saga Furs of Scandinavia, an international fur marketing organization owned by breeders in the region, the industry began to lure new designers. Saga financed trips to Copenhagen for dozens of designers, where it taught them how to work with fur, explaining the difficult sewing techniques and walking them through knitting and weaving of the material.
At about the same time, the Fur Information Council began its own counterattack. It placed advertisements in various fashion magazines to counter some of the animal-rights arguments and to try to convince fashion customers that fur was really acceptable.
Many women, of course, will still never go near fur. Margaret Godfrey, who runs Bagatelle, a leather-goods manufacturer, deplores it. "I know fur is selling better," Ms. Godfrey said. "But I don't work with it. I think the traps are terribly cruel. I don't fancy feathers, either."
But as Kim Major, who runs the fur salon at Bergdorf Goodman, sees it, as long as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W magazines keep doing large fashion spreads on fur, retail sales should follow. "The fashion press is backing us, and that is all we need," Ms. Major said. "It is easy to make a beautiful coat, but if that attitude change isn't there, we can't sell it."

HEADLINE: At the New Year, a New Day for Riverdale;
A Bronx Neighborhood Is Now a Lively Center for Orthodox Jews

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Like many college seniors, Noah A. Hammerman finished his education last June with a B.A. in economics and no clear plan for the rest of his life. Unlike most, he saw his prospects in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and bought a kosher butcher shop there.
Now, he stands in his blood-spattered smock, a dark blue yarmulke pinned to his red hair, surveying the hubbub surrounding his first Jewish New Year as proprietor of the Arc of Glatt. He was raised in Riverdale's Orthodox community, and knows that its expanding ranks guarantee a demand for kosher meat. But Mr. Hammerman, 22, mused aloud that it was the presence of a full spectrum of Jews, from the most observant to the least, that clinched his decision. 
 Indeed, while the number of Orthodox Jews living in Riverdale is growing, they account for at most only a fifth of the community's Jews.
"People will come in and ask some question like, 'Can I have a shank bone for my plate?' and one of my non-Jewish employees will tell them they have the wrong holiday, that is for Passover, not Rosh ha-Shanah," Mr. Hammerman said. "I like the fact that there is a range of people here. I feel comfortable where I fall, even if where I fall is more religious than others. I don't shun anyone."
Riverdale is undergoing a profound transition. Once the preserve of foreign diplomats and media executives, the neighborhood is being transformed into a center for one of New York City's most vibrant Orthodox Jewish communities.
The transformation is more evident than ever this time of year, with 10 days of reflection and observance that stretch from Rosh ha-Shanah tomorrow to sundown on Oct. 11, Yom Kippur. The phone rings incessantly in the butcher shop, on Riverdale Avenue. Across the street, at Riverdale Hebrew Books and Gifts, the shelves are stacked with special prayer books and fancy ceramic dishes used to serve the apples and honey that herald a sweet year. Next door, Heisler's Bakery has amassed more than 2,000 orders for challah loaves.
"It will be bedlam," said David Heisler, son of the neighborhood's first kosher baker, who moved to Riverdale from the Grand Concourse 30 years ago. "It wouldn't be Rosh ha-Shanah if you did not have a line out the door, people getting edgy, stepping on each other's toes."
If the holidays make Orthodox Jews survey their neighborhood with a certain satisfaction, it makes the less religious Jews uneasy. Some residents fear that the swelling numbers of the Orthodox may signal that the non-Orthodox and non-Jews are unwelcome.
"You hear a sense of discomfort," said Bernard Stein, editor of The Riverdale Press, the weekly newspaper. "One woman told me that a house near her was bought by 'another Orthodox family.' You hear it in the way the voices drop in conversation, as if it is some secretive, not-so-good thing: 'He has AIDS.' "
Forty years ago, few Jews lived in Riverdale. The Riverdale Temple, a Reform synagogue, opened in an abandoned nightclub in 1947. When Jacob M. Sable, the first Orthodox rabbi to be assigned to the neighborhood, arrived in 1954, he had just five names for his congregation. Most mornings he approached people on the street to get a minyan, the required 10 for prayer.
But the erosion of renowned Jewish neighborhoods in the Bronx and northern Manhattan throughout the 1960's and 1970's changed that, with the middle class moving up from the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and Washington Heights in Manhattan. Today an estimated 35,000 to 40,000 Jews are among the 100,000 residents of Riverdale. Some 10 to 20 percent of those are Orthodox, an estimate based on membership in the three largest Orthodox synagogues, which have 1,400 families.
The last United States census found that in Riverdale the most common language spoken at home after English and Spanish was Yiddish. The Riverdale Jewish Center, the oldest Orthodox congregation, is building a new synagogue to increase seating capacity to 2,100 from 1,300.
"When I opened up eight years ago, I couldn't sell one of those religious books if I gave it away," said Israel Wilhelm, owner of the Hebrew bookshop, pointing to a wall now holding some 10,000 texts of scriptural interpretations.
Many Orthodox Jews choose to live in Riverdale for the same reason others choose it, its leafy streets and river views 30 minutes from Manhattan. The Orthodox are drawn both by the strength of Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy, the main yeshiva for elementary-school children, and a spirit of cooperation among the different Jewish rabbis.
"Although we are an Orthodox synagogue, we are unorthodox in that we are open to people of all backgrounds, regardless of affiliation," said the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale's Avi Weiss, a rabbi known beyond Riverdale for his political activism but in Riverdale for opening the doors of his synagogue to all comers.
Harsh doctrinal differences do erupt occasionally. Some Orthodox rabbis recently lambasted the 100-strong women's prayer group that meets at the Hebrew Institute because they believe women should be excluded from leading prayer services, even for other women.
But some rabbis say there is also exceptional cooperation among Orthodox, Conservative and Reform synagogues. Residents believe that has to do with both the rabbis involved and the higher level of education and wealth in Riverdale, compared with other Orthodox centers.
"People here are more educated and more involved in real business, so they look more assimilated, but they still retain their religion," said Mr. Hammerman, the butcher. "People here can afford to do things; very religious people go to Aspen to go skiing. They are just more worldly here."
Riverdale has only small outposts of Hasidim, the more rigorously Orthodox Jews, but the Orthodox community has become more fundamentalist and more pointed in pushing less observant Jews to conform, according to Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews alike in Riverdale.
Residents cite as an example the bagel wars. Lenny Moskowitz opened the Bagel Corner in 1966 and initially served all the synagogues, although he broke kosher rules by opening on Saturday, the sabbath. By 1993 the Orthodox trade was such that he opened a second shop, Rolen Bagels, a few blocks away. That shop is closed on Saturdays.
But the local rabbinical board overseeing kosher standards would not certify his new shop, he said, because he kept the first one open all weekend.
The shift right in Riverdale is attributed largely to young adults whose yeshiva teachers instilled in them an appreciation for the kind of cloistered communities prevalent in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust.
Some Orthodox Jews point out that this closer regard for basic standards is something happening in all religions, not just their own.
"Look at the Arab countries that were so liberal, like Egypt, where the fundamentalists are coming in and changing the nature of the country," said Deena Spindler, a member of the Riverdale Jewish Center.
But the shift makes others uncomfortable. Some residents object, for example, to halting renovation work on apartment buildings during Rosh ha-Shanah, and leaders of both the Reform and Conservative congregations express anxiety over the Orthodox fostering their private institutions. Some attribute an erosion in public school test scores to Orthodox families sending their children to yeshivas.
Rabbi Stephen D. Franklin of the Riverdale Temple, the Reform synagogue, said of the Orthodox, "If they don't send their kids, they won't care about the schools."
Although relations are usually civil, occasional conflicts lead to barbed public exchanges, like the outcry when the Orthodox were initially reluctant to distribute the telephone number of their new ambulance service.
Rabbi Franklin also worries about not being able to attract potential members to his Reform temple amid the Orthodox influx. The Orthodox leaders say Riverdale will not become an isolated enclave. Rabbi Jonathan Rosenblatt of the Riverdale Jewish Center said the Orthodox presence will help keep the real estate values stable, even if the public schools erode, and that congregants will remain active in community affairs.
But the face of Riverdale is undoubtedly changing.
A movie company recently wrote to residents of Fieldston, a neighborhood of expensive homes, to announce plans to shoot some Halloween scenes in late October. The shooting will coincide with Succoth, the holiday following Rosh ha-Shanah. Jews build outdoor huts during Succoth to commemorate the years spent wandering in the wilderness.
"One of my neighbors decided to write a letter, explaining that there would be Succoth huts everywhere," said Mr. Stein, the newspaper editor. "He wanted to tell them that it will be hard to get a clear angle for a Halloween movie."

HEADLINE: Survey Reveals More Pessimism in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Japanese corporate managers have turned more pessimistic about the economy than they were three months ago and do not foresee improvement until 1998 at the earliest, the Bank of Japan said today in a widely followed survey.
The results of the quarterly survey, known as the tankan, were worse than forecast and offered the latest evidence that Japan's protracted economic weakness would not end soon. Japanese stocks and the yen fell sharply on the news, while yields on the benchmark Government bond -- a barometer of interest rate trends -- dropped to a record low of 1.83 percent before rebounding slightly. 
 "We're stuck with weak growth, and there's no end to it at this stage," said Michael Lockrow, an economist at Technical Data, an economic research firm.
The survey measures the sentiment of executives from 10,000 businesses. Almost every manufacturing group was more pessimistic, including auto makers, machinery makers and steelmakers.
The sentiment index for major manufacturers fell to 3 from 7 in the last survey, in June. That was less than the 8 the companies forecast in the prior survey and the 5 widely projected by economists. The index is derived by subtracting the percentage of those who feel pessimistic from those who are optimistic.
Most manufacturers are even less optimistic about their prospects. The major manufacturers' index will decline further to 1 in the next survey, in December.
Exports have been the economy's only strength. Yet while many big manufacturers are profiting from strong sales in the United States and Europe, this has intensified American pressure on Japan not to rely too much on exports.
At the same time, Japanese businesses cannot rely on much improvement in sales at home, where consumer spending has been suppressed by tax increases earlier this year.

Latin America's Disabled: Unsafely Hidden Away

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: COLINA, Chile, Sept. 30

 BODY:
At a morgue in this suburb of Santiago, 20 bodies lay unclaimed today, a poignant illustration of how this society treats the mentally and physically handicapped.
They were among the 30 children and adults who died when fire engulfed Los Ceibos home for the mentally retarded. By late today relatives of only 10 of those killed had come forward to claim the bodies. 
 In Chile and elsewhere in Latin America, people often react to the disabled with a sense of shame, distance and helplessness, leading many families to abandon them in institutions operated by well-meaning but overburdened private foundations and church groups. Governments provide little money for such programs.
"They deposit these poor, helpless children in institutions as they would a check at a bank," said Sergio Prenafeta Jenkin, executive secretary of the National Fund for the Disabled, a Government agency. "The only problem is that many never come back to see them, and they remain in these facilities for the rest of their lives."
Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition on Monday shortly after midnight when an overheating electric lamp set off a raging fire that quickly engulfed a building housing the most severely disabled residents of Los Ceibos. Many were heavily medicated or in wheelchairs and could not escape. The fire left three other residents injured.
Some relatives of the victims at the home, operated by a nonprofit group called the Limited Child Assistance Foundation, said the eight attendants on duty the night of the fire had not been enough to oversee the 140 residents.
While many industrialized countries discourage warehousing the disabled in institutions and have passed laws to help them integrate into society, less developed nations like Chile still consider the mentally handicapped an aberration or embarrassment who should remain hidden from society.
Disasters involving the disabled have not been unique to Chile. Argentina has been debating the quality of its health care system for the mentally impaired since a suspicious fire in a mental hospital killed 79 people in 1985 and 30 patients died from malnutrition in a Government-run women's psychiatric hospital in 1990.
In the United States, the disabled have never been more visible, taking part in everything from work to organized sports. In Chile and other Latin American countries, they are rarely seen in public. When they do appear, people often point, giggle or treat them as if they should have remained indoors.
"We don't care about the disabled in Chile," Mr. Prenafeta said, "because we are a society that places too much value on success, and we leave those who do not prosper to fend for themselves. How can disabled children fend for themselves?"
Officials of the nonprofit foundation that operates Los Ceibos said half of the 3,500 residents in its 28 homes throughout Chile had been abandoned and did not receive visits from relatives.
Guillermo Vidal, vice president of the foundation, which is known by the Spanish acronym Coanil, said many families of the disabled were so poor that they were incapable of caring for the mentally retarded.
"It would be ideal if every family would assume its responsibility for these children," Mr. Vidal said, "but many of these kids come from families that live in such extreme poverty that they receive much better care in our hands."
About 400,000 of Chile's 13 million people are considered mentally disabled. About 35 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and the average monthly salary is about $175.
On the other hand, Chile has become a model for economic reform in Latin America, having become rich in cash reserves and having established one of the fastest-expanding economies and lowest inflation rates in the region.
It is unclear exactly how much money the Government provides for the care of the mentally disabled, mainly because the money is administered by various agencies and there is no central department with responsibility for the disabled.
Most homes for the disabled are operated by church groups and independent foundations like Coanil that receive Government and private donations.
One estimate in the local press said the Government provided Coanil about $200 a month for each resident, or about 45 percent of the monthly cost of care.
Some family members of the fire victims at Los Ceibos said the home suffered from overcrowding and understaffing.
"There were not enough workers on duty that night, and that electric lamp should not have been there," said Rosa Ramirez Guzman, 57, whose 20-year-old daughter, Lucinda, died in the fire. "But I have nothing against the institution, because the attendants were the best. They treated my child better than I could, because I had to work very hard for a living."
Early reports of the fire on Monday misidentified the home, referring to it as Los Laureles, another home where some of the survivors had been taken.
Mrs. Ramirez is a single mother who lives in San Antonio, two hours west of Santiago. The last time she saw her daughter was last week, when she took a picture of the young woman standing next to a new bed that Mrs. Ramirez had taken to the home.
Today, Mrs. Ramirez and her other daughter, Magarita, carried that photograph with them as they walked through the charred remains of the home. "She's gone, she's gone," Magarita said, bursting into tears. "There's nothing left of the bed where she used to dream."
Fire officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today that the ward contained highly flammable insulating material in the roof, which helped the fire spread rapidly, and lacked appropriate fire walls and exits for people using wheelchairs.
The fire officials agreed with victims' families that there had not been enough attendants on duty to remove the large number of incapacitated residents. The officials added that the nearest fire hydrants were two-thirds of a mile from the home.
Mr. Vidal of Coanil disputed accusations that the dormitory ward was a fire hazard, saying it had been recently upgraded to comply with all existing standards.
Mr. Vidal also denied that the home was overcrowded, saying it had about 90 full-time employees who worked in shifts. He said there was a list of 400 prospective residents waiting for vacancies.
Meanwhile, residents of Colina said gruesome images of the fire were forever etched in their memories, particularly scenes of young residents who believed that the fire was a game and continued to return to the burning building after they had been rescued by firefighters.
"It was surreal," said Miguel Lara, who lives near the home and helped in the rescue efforts. "Those poor, innocent children had no idea what was going on. Some of them were burned and could barely walk, or scooted along on their hands, but they were smiling as they kept trying to go back into the fire. They need our help."

HEADLINE: New Immigration Rules Hit Some Companies Hard

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
In SoHo, a Japanese restaurant closed its doors last Friday after the chef returned to Japan. In Westport, Conn., a construction company shut down when the owner, a Chilean immigrant, suddenly left with his family. And in a midtown Manhattan factory, where 25 employees work making fine jewelry 14 hours a day, the owner, a Ukrainian refugee, wonders whether he too should pack and leave.
Changes in immigration rules have prompted many immigrants in the New York area and across the country who are seeking legal status to return to their homelands in the last week, believing that such a move, however painful, is their best hope for someday returning legally. 
 It is impossible to tell how many people may have left the country in the recent exodus. But immigration lawyers and advocates believe that the wave of departures will have a great impact on some businesses, especially those that rely heavily on the expertise of foreigners, like detailed construction work, specialty restaurants and some highly technical jobs.
Already, in Manhattan, a popular downtown restaurant, Katana, closed after its chef, Nao Hiko Sugiyama, returned to Japan to continue his appeal for residency status in the United States, said Sam Firer, the restaurant's public relations man. Mr. Sugiyama's specialty was kaiseki cuisine, a rare food that originated with the Japanese tea ceremony.
Other restaurants in the city lost a significant number of employees last week and had to scramble to find replacements on short notice. Nobu, a Japanese restaurant in TriBeCa, lost 6 of its 20 waiters, said Richard M. Notar, the restaurant's general manager. "One day, I had a full staff," Mr. Notar said. "Next day, no waiters. And it is not easy to replace them. We are very particular about who we hire. And then there is the training."
The sudden exodus has been set off by two changes in immigration rules. One is the expiration of a three-year-old law that allowed illegal immigrants who were seeking green cards to obtain the documents here. Under the new rules, those close to obtaining a green card, which confers legal status, must go home to get the document.
Under a second change, which took effect on Saturday, immigrants who have been in the United States illegally for more than six months and who leave for any reason, including going home to get a green card, can be barred from returning for three years. Those who have been in this country illegally for more than a year can be denied re-entry for 10 years.
The Senate joined the House yesterday in delaying the expiration of the green-card rule, which was to happen yesterday, for three weeks. But experts said the brief reprieve would affect very few of the thousands of immigrants faced with the decision of whether to stay or go. The American Immigration Lawyers Association and about 80 other national organizations and big businesses, including Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard, support a longer extension of the provision allowing those seeking green cards to stay here.
Those who left, like Mr. Sugiyama, played it safe, being willing to wait for their green card outside the United States. But those who stayed took a gamble. Their hope is that the expiring provision will be extended beyond the three weeks, so that they can continue to live here while seeking their legal status.
Judith B. Sporn, an immigration lawyer in Westport, said 99 percent of her clients opted to stay despite a letter that she sent them urging them to leave by the deadline.
"If they are wrong, they are in a lot of trouble," Ms. Sporn said. "But had they left, they would have had an incredible impact on businesses. There isn't a restaurant that does not need people like them. How are you supposed to have foreign specialties without the foreigners?" One who chose to stay, a client of Ms. Sporn's who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was a Brazilian chef who works without a working permit. He stayed, he said, because there is nothing and no one waiting for him in Brazil.
"My wife is here, my job is here, my home is here," he said. "My boss told me that if I left, the restaurant would be in a lot of trouble."
That is Feodor Sheffer's dilemma. He is a refugee from Ukraine, who was denied political asylum two days before the deadline. Mr. Sheffer decided to stay in the hope that an immigration judge would grant him his asylum in January, his next immigration hearing.
Mr. Sheffer is the owner of the NK Star Corporation, a jewelry factory in midtown Manhattan that employs 25 people. If he leaves, Mr. Sheffer said, the factory will close and his employees will have no work.
Despite the disruption for some families and businesses, Rae D. Rosen, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said she did not expect the departures to have a broad effect on the economy. "The size of the labor market here is so great, that their departure will not have a significant impact, however painful to the individual it is," Ms. Rosen said.
Lawmakers who oppose the extension of the expiring rule say that if illegal immigrants leave, more Americans, who are now unemployed, will find jobs.
Allan Kay, a spokesman for Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who opposes the provision, said the Congressman "is deeply concerned about American citizens and legal residents not getting jobs because they are filled by people who are here illegally."

HEADLINE: Panel Urges That Immigrants Become Further Americanized

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
A Federal advisory panel called today for a major campaign to integrate new immigrants into American society, and it won support from an influential Republican Congressman for its proposal to dismantle the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
In its final report to Congress after five years of work, the panel, the United States Commission on Immigration Reform, also said that some decisions on applications for visas should be subject to review by a new Government agency. 
 That would represent a radical change. Now, would-be immigrants and their American sponsors generally cannot appeal decisions of consular officers who deny applications for visas. The panel would allow such appeals in some cases.
Bruce A. Morrison, a member of the panel, explained the reason for appeal rights by saying, "Lack of accountability in any decision-making structure is not tolerable."
The nine-member commission concluded its work with a ringing endorsement of the value of legal immigration, saying that migrants contributed to the nation's economic growth and productivity.
But it said that Federal and state officials must step up their efforts to incorporate immigrants into the nation's civic and political culture. For example, it said, newcomers need help in English-language skills and should be trained for high-tech jobs, so that they will move up the economic ladder.
Susan Martin, executive director of the commission, said that many children of Hispanic immigrants dropped out of school and that many immigrant teen-agers never enrolled in schools in this country.
Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization, said she saw great merit in the proposal for a new emphasis on the "Americanization" of immigrants.
"The United States has relied on immigrant families and on employers to help immigrants adjust to life in this country -- to find jobs and housing, to enroll in school, to open bank accounts," Ms. Munoz said. "If the Government and the larger society would invest in such services, we could get a huge return, and immigrants would make a quicker adjustment to American life. Immigrants are accused of not wanting to learn English, but they are eager to do so. Many English-language programs have enormous waiting lists."
The chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the immigration service, Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, welcomed many of the panel's recommendations. He endorsed the proposal to dismantle the immigration service and distribute its functions among the Departments of Justice, State and Labor.
He agreed with the commission's conclusion that the immigration service was suffering from "mission overload," but not from a lack of money. Indeed, he said, the budget of the agency, $3.1 billion this year, has increased 50 percent in the last two years and has more than tripled in the last decade.
"At last," he said, "someone is telling it like it is. The I.N.S. is overloaded, and money is no longer an excuse. The agency has too much on its plate. It cannot control our borders, process immigrants and safeguard U.S. citizenship. We've seen tens of thousands of criminals granted the most precious benefit our country has to offer: U.S. citizenship. We have over five million illegal aliens residing in the United States, the same all-time high of 10 years ago."
The House Appropriations Committee recently instructed Attorney General Janet Reno to devise a plan to "transfer some of the responsibilities of the I.N.S. to other departments and agencies."
Advocates for immigrants and immigration lawyers were cool to the proposal to break up the I.N.S.
Jeanne A. Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said she doubted that immigrants would receive better service from the State Department than from the immigration service, which is now part of the Justice Department. From years of dealing with State Department officials, she said, "we know that they are opposed to review of their decisions, have no mechanisms in place to assure due process of law and are ill equipped to deal with the volume and complexity of cases that I.N.S. must adjudicate on a daily basis."

HEADLINE: Betting Inflation Stays Dormant, Fed Leaves Interest Rates Alone

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to keep interest rates unchanged, again showing its willingness to tolerate strong growth as long as the economy displays no clear signs of incipient inflation.
With prices of both consumer and producer goods rising at barely perceptible rates, the Fed's decision not to change monetary policy had been widely expected by economists and in the financial markets. 
 But the decision pushed the central bank deeper into uncharted economic territory. In leaving its official rates unchanged, the Fed continued to set aside the long-held doctrine that robust growth at a time of low unemployment leads almost inevitably to rising wages and prices. It is betting instead that either a confluence of temporary factors or a more fundamental improvement in the economy's ability to expand without inflation will keep price increases under control.
"By conventional measures the U.S. economy seems like it should be overheating," said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities in New York. "But you have to have confirmation that there is inflation before you have a problem to address, and for the Fed there's no problem to address right now."
Economic statistics reported today did little to alter current perceptions of the economy.
Consumer confidence edged higher in September, from an already strong level, said the Conference Board, a business research group in New York. The group's index of consumer confidence rose to 128.6 in September from a revised 127.6 in August.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes fell a larger-than-expected 2.2 percent in August to an annual rate of 800,000, but that followed a climb of four-tenths of a percent in July and kept sales at a relatively strong rate.
The question is how long the current, almost ideal combination of robust growth, low unemployment and minimal inflation can be maintained. Under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Fed over the last decade has built a record of acting to suppress inflation long before it could infect the economy. With the long expansion expected to continue through this year, analysts said the Fed could face difficult decisions about whether to resurrect its pre-emptive strategy by nudging rates up at one of its next two policy-setting meetings, in November and December.
The Fed has raised rates only once during the surge in growth of the last 18 months. In March it raised its Federal funds target rate by a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent, near the end of a quarter in which the economy grew 4.9 percent.
The economy grew at a 4.1 percent pace in the first half of this year -- almost double the rate at which traditional economic models would predict inflationary stirrings -- and appears likely to have grown 3 percent or more in the three months ending today.
Unemployment stands at 4.9 percent, and has touched a 23-year low of 4.8 percent several times this year. Many economists believe that sustained unemployment of less than 5.5 percent ultimately leads employers to raise wages to attract workers, leading in turn to higher prices as companies pass their higher labor costs along to consumers -- a phenomenon that has been noticeably absent in the economy this year.
Fed officials as well as most private economists have consistently forecast slowdowns in the economy over the last 18 months that have either not materialized or proved transitory. If there is no sign by the end of the year that the economy is cooling off, the pressure on the Fed to tighten policy by a notch is sure to grow, analysts said.
"They always see a slowdown around the corner or under way," said David Hensley, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York.
There are only the faintest signs of even preliminary inflation pressures building. The rate at which factories are operating, for example, has been creeping upward and last month stood at 83.9 percent of capacity, just below the level economists consider an early warning signal of production bottlenecks that can lead to higher prices.
The Fed's policy-making committee met at the same time that the Senate Banking Committee began considering President Clinton's nominees to fill two vacancies on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board.
The nominees, Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Edward M. Gramlich, both stressed in their testimony to the committee that they considered achieving price stability to be the Fed's primary mission. Their statements were unsurprising given that the Republican-controlled Senate would probably not be willing to confirm them if they did not publicly place price stability ahead of the Fed's other legislatively mandated mission, promoting maximum employment.
But both Mr. Ferguson, a specialist in banking and technology for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, and Mr. Gramlich, dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, hinted that they saw the Fed as a pulpit to promote other goals as well.
"I strongly feel that both economic and social goals are important," Mr. Gramlich said. "Sometimes one's advice must be weighted toward economic practicality, sometimes toward humanity."
Mr. Ferguson, who if confirmed would be the third black Fed governor, said he was concerned by issues like income inequality and job creation, even if the Fed could not address them directly.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
ITT soars as its suitor, Hilton Hotels, and traders anticipate a court-ordered vote.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
The price of the ITT Corporation's stock jumped more than 8 percent yesterday, one day after a Federal judge ruled that the company's board could not split ITT into three companies without shareholder approval.
The ruling gave a big lift to the $70-a-share, $11.5 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT by the Hilton Hotels Corporation. The plan for a three-way split, announced on July 16, was part of a strategy devised by ITT to fend off Hilton's bid. 
 Investors, in their latest reaction to developments in a battle that began in January, pushed up ITT's stock price by $5.25 a share yesterday, to $67.75. Hilton's stock also rose, albeit more modestly: at the close, on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares were quoted at $33.6875, up $1.5625.
Hilton had taken ITT to court in Nevada, contending that the anti-takeover strategy was a violation of shareholders' rights.
ITT, which is based in New York, is incorporated in Nevada, and has not held a shareholders meeting since the spring of 1996. Under Nevada law, which requires that a shareholders meeting be held at least every 18 months, ITT was facing a deadline of mid-November for a meeting. ITT had sought to split up the company before a meeting could be held, but Hilton challenged that intention.
At a hearing in Las Vegas on Monday, Judge Philip M. Pro of the Federal District Court in Nevada agreed with Hilton's arguments, and ordered ITT to hold a meeting by Nov. 14 to consider the plan.
After saying on Monday that it would abide by Judge Pro's decision, ITT said yesterday that it would hold its annual meeting on Nov. 12 in New York City, at a site to be determined. Shareholders of record as of today will be eligible to vote at the meeting, ITT said.
After the ruling, Hilton said that it would welcome an opportunity to try to negotiate a merger agreement with the management of ITT. But ITT, which has flatly rejected that request in the past, did so again yesterday.
"We have nothing to discuss with Mr. Bollenbach," Jim Gallagher, an ITT spokesman, said, referring to Hilton's chief executive, Stephen F. Bollenbach.
Marc A. Grossman, a Hilton spokesman, said of the ITT response, "It is unfortunate, because we think there is a great opportunity to work together to create value for shareholders."
Securities analysts said that with such a short time left before the November meeting, ITT would find it difficult to push its stock price much above Hilton's $70-a-share offer, meaning that shareholders might look favorably on the bid.
Bruce Turner, the lodging and gambling analyst at Salomon Brothers, said, "Everything ITT did hinged on proceeding with their plan without shareholder approval." With that strategy foiled, "I don't think ITT can win," Mr. Turner added.
To raise its stock price, ITT has sold a number of noncore assets, including its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden.
When it announced its breakup plan in July, ITT said it would separate its remaining hotel and casino businesses, its technical school and its international telephone directory operations, as well as buy back up to 30 million of its shares at $70 a share and repurchase all $2 billion of its public debt.
"We look forward to the annual meeting and remain confident that our comprehensive plan provides superior economic value to our shareholders," Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement yesterday.
Responding to one of Judge Pro's criticisms, ITT said it would eliminate a proposed staggered board at ITT Destinations, the hotel and gambling operation that Hilton wants most and that is the core of the company.
A staggered board, on which the directors come up for re-election at different times, is often used as an anti-takeover device.
Since late January, ITT has used the Nevada law permitting it to put off its annual meeting as a shield against Hilton, one that provided it time to sell assets in an effort to lift its share price and to formulate its defensive strategy.
But some law professors said the delay might actually have made it easier for Judge Pro to rule as he did.
"What ITT was proposing in terms of restructuring the company is sweeping in scope, but other companies, like AT&T, have done the same thing without shareholder approval," said Lawrence R. Hamermesh, an associate professor at the Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Del., and a former corporate attorney.
"But when you do it as a means of deferring a meeting in which stockholders are threatening to throw you out, then the courts get excited," he said. "If ITT had had a shareholders meeting within the last 12 months, I don't know how much the judge could have said."

Business Activity Is Rising

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Business activity in the New York metropolitan region continued to expand in September from the previous month, the National Association of Purchasing Management-New York said yesterday.
The New York purchasing managers index rose to 60.3 percent last month, from August's 55 percent. A reading above 50 percent signals growth. The index has been above 50 percent every month since March 1996, after falling to 46.7 percent in February of last year. 
 Looking at the next six months, New York purchasers remained upbeat, with the monthly index of future conditions holding steady at 69.5 percent in September from August's 70.9 percent.

Asians Suffer Further Damage On Malaysian's New Remarks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Southeast Asian currencies again fell to record lows against the dollar yesterday, and analysts said further declines were likely because of continued concerns about the region's faltering economic growth.
Contributing to yesterday's decline was a speech on Tuesday by Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Reiterating comments he had made last month, Dr. Mahathir called for more regulations on currency trading. 
 David Bassanese, senior economist at Bankers Trust Australia Ltd. in Sydney, said: "We are at a point where fear is feeding on fear. As long as they come up with anti-market rhetoric, currencies and markets will come under pressure. We're getting into panic levels."
The Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso all fell to record lows. The ringgit declined as much as 5 percent, to a rate of 3.41 to the dollar; the rupiah fell for a sixth consecutive day, losing as much as 2.6 percent, to 3,369 for each dollar, and the Philippine peso decreased as much as 2.9 percent, to 34.96 to the dollar, setting a record low for the fourth day.
The Singapore dollar, a strong currency in past periods, touched its lowest level in more than three years, and the Thai baht fell to its lowest level in eight days.
A number of Asian stock markets were also lower yesterday.
The currency troubles were touched off by the effective devaluation of the baht three months ago. It has fallen 41 percent against the dollar this year; Malaysia's currency has lost one-third of its value, and the Indonesian currency has fallen 42 percent.
The Singapore dollar, whose value is determined in relation to a basket of the currencies of its trading partners, has lost 10 percent against the United States dollar.
Andy Tan, general manager at MMS International, a financial services unit of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said: "It no longer makes sense to pick a ceiling" for the American dollar's value against regional currencies. "Everything is being driven by sentiment."
Speaking on Tuesday at an Asia-Pacific regional meeting in Santiago, Chile, Malaysia's Prime Minister said, "I would like to suggest that we do away with trade in currency as a commodity." He added that although there were no immediate plans to regulate trading in the ringgit, "there must be some regulation" in the future.
His comments were ill timed, said Richard Gibbs, an international economist at the Macquarie Bank in Sydney. "We were starting to get to a position where stability was coming through."

U.S. Dollar Is Higher
 By The Associated Press
 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York trading yesterday after a Japanese central bank survey showed business confidence in the country's economy weakening.
The dollar gained against the German mark on reports that a Bundesbank policy council member, Edgar Meister, said the dollar was not creating inflationary pressure. That dampened expectations that the German central bank would soon raise interest rates.
In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 120.90 Japanese yen, up from 120.50 yen on Monday. The dollar sold at 1.7734 German marks, up from 1.7624. It rose, too, against the British pound, which declined to $1.6152, from $1.6168 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Betting the U.S. Economy on a Rising Stock Market

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Twice in the 1990's, the American economy has produced nearly identical periods of booming growth. Yet the experts looked at what was happening and saw in the first surge, in 1994, the makings of a disaster and in the second, this year, nirvana.
A big reason for the shift to optimism from pessimism appears to be the stock market. Sustaining the Dow Jones industrial average at record levels is gradually becoming as much a priority among investors as fighting inflation. And for the Dow average to keep rising seems to require a leap of faith that the economy will continue along its present prosperous course, unhindered by a rising inflation rate, or even the threat that this might happen. 
 "The stock market is coloring every decision," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and consultant. "It is no longer the consequence of confidence but the cause of it. It now extends way beyond itself in its influence, pushing into the background concerns about inflation."
The purveyors of the new optimism are the economists, executives, stock and bond traders, and the mutual and pension fund managers who, in their constant forecasts and pronouncements, shape the public perception of the national economy. Most take their cue from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. And in sharp contrast to the growth surge three years ago, Mr. Greenspan seems to have given his O.K. for this one to continue.
The Fed's announcement on Tuesday that interest rates would remain unchanged was the latest reaffirmation of this O.K. In the new dynamic, raising interest rates to slow the economy and keep inflation in check would almost certainly provoke a sharp decline in stock prices, and falling stock prices would in turn discourage spending and investment far more than in the recent past. With the Dow average up nearly 24 percent this year, rising stock prices have become for millions of Americans a powerful source of confidence, wealth and spending, sustaining the economy.
"We have a huge vested interest in keeping stock prices up," said Albert Wojnilower, senior economic adviser to the Clipper Group, a Wall Street firm. "Millions of people who have put their money into stocks want to be optimistic and corporations have invested on the basis of their optimism. It won't change unless we get slapped in the face with evidence of rising inflation."
The shift in attitudes -- from pessimism to optimism, from expectations of rising inflation and a weakening economy to a growing confidence that neither will happen -- shows up in striking fashion in a comparison of the two nearly identical growth periods, each covering nine months. The first, starting in October 1993, produced an average growth rate of 4.3 percent, which is quite powerful. During the second surge in growth, beginning last October and running through June of this year, the gross domestic product rose by an average of 4.2 percent, according to final data for the period, released last week.
The inflation rate also behaved in strikingly similar fashion in each period. It averaged 2.7 percent in 1993-94 and 2.4 percent in 1996-97. More important, the inflation rate fell during both periods. But while low inflation is taken as a given in the optimism of 1997, that was not the case three years ago. Although inflation was edging down, the great expectation then was that strong economic growth would inevitably generate a destructive rise in the inflation rate.
"We all thought then that inflation must follow excessively strong growth," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "That same view would resurrect itself now in a second, of course, if Mr. Greenspan were to say that he was worried on this count. But he does not say that."
The unemployment rate also fell during both periods, although it was higher in 1993-94, averaging 6.5 percent, than in the most recent nine months, when the average was down to 5.2 percent. There is irony in this difference. With fear of inflation the dominant concern three years ago, there was much speculation that falling unemployment would soon result in labor shortages, rising wages and accelerating inflation as companies raised prices to pay the higher labor bills. An unemployment rate of just over 6 percent was thought to be the flash point.
Indeed, such thinking was a big factor in the Fed's decision to slow the economy and dilute the demand for labor by raising interest rates to 6 percent from 3 percent, starting in February 1994. Today, the unemployment rate is more than a percentage point below the 1993-94 level, but the unemployment-inflation tradeoff is hardly discussed.
"It is a very important concept in economic theory, but the discussion just died," said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of California in Riverside.
Certainly changing circumstances help to explain the reversal in concerns. The budget deficit has fallen sharply, nullifying that as an inflation issue. The Fed has left short-term interest rates just below 6 percent, which helps in restraining the economy and inflation, some economists argue. Job insecurity and a flood of relatively inexpensive imports also help to keep down wages and prices. And the latest surge in economic growth without any sign of sharply rising prices has finally convinced many Americans that low inflation has become the norm.
To explain this sea change in the behavior of inflation, many economists, investors and executives have embraced the view that American workers have become more efficient and productive -- allowing profits and wages to rise without feeding inflation. The booming stock market, in this view, reflects this new era of rising productivity, pushing concerns about inflation to the back burner, says Mickey D. Levy, chief economist of Nationsbank.
Mr. Greenspan, in his public statements, has encouraged this thinking. The dissenters from this spreading optimism are becoming a distinct minority. One is Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who was the Fed's vice chairman when interest rates were doubling in 1994 and early 1995. While voting for all the increases, he had argued that some should have been smaller. In his view, inflation does not suddenly shoot up, as if a trip cord had been released, but rises gradually, giving the Fed time to reverse the trend without overdoing rate increases.
Mr. Blinder still holds this view, but he argues that the tendency now to overlook inflationary pressures may have gone too far. "At the current low rate of unemployment and high rate of capacity utilization," he said, "we have to keep in mind the possibility of gradually mounting wage and price pressures."

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
British Quartet Rocks Jamaica

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
While surfing the World Wide Web earlier this year, Coach Steve Sampson of the United States came across a German soccer player named Michael Mason. The midfielder spoke little English and had never set foot in this country, but Mason's father was a retired serviceman born in Philadelphia.
Thus, under soccer's liberal rules, the son was eligible for the United States national team. Mason was signed up and, given his Internet connection, was handed the nickname Dotcom. 
 It is a common practice for soccer teams to cast a wide net for players. Jack Charlton, who coached Ireland during the World Cup in 1990 and 1994, was an acknowledged master. If a player had ever vacationed on the Emerald Isle, or stopped in to buy a wool sweater, Charlton seemed to find a way to make him eligible.
El Salvador has called up a naturalized Serbian and two Brazilians. And now, after struggling early in the final round of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, Jamaica decided to take a plunge into the international talent pool.
During tomorrow night's game against the United States in Washington, Jamaica will feature four players from England who have revived a ragged, deflated team and given it a fighting chance to become the first World Cup qualifier from the Caribbean since Haiti in 1974.
Collectively, these British sons of Jamaican immigrants have been labeled the Fab Four, and the Beatles. One of them, Deon Burton, scored the winning goal for Jamaica (3-2-2) in both of its recent 1-0 victories over Canada and Costa Rica.
A victory over the United States (2-1-3) would vault the Reggae Boyz, as the team is known, to the top of the North American, Central American and Caribbean region with two games remaining. Three of the region's six teams will advance to the 1998 World Cup in France.
Rene Simoes, the Brazilian who has coached Jamaica to the verge of its first World Cup appearance, was reluctant to send out an international S O S last June. He wanted players who were born in Jamaica and who played in Jamaica. But he changed his mind after his team scored only two goals in its first five qualifying games. The Reggae Boyz had wasted a chance at victory in a 0-0 draw at home against an unprepared United States team in March. Then Jamaica lost a humiliating 6-0 game in Mexico after brawling with a Mexican club team during an earlier scrimmage.
Onandi Lowe, one of Jamaica's top players, simply walked off the field during the Mexico game after refusing Simoes's order to switch positions. He was later suspended for four years.
Faced with internal dissent and lapses in determination and organization, Simoes desperately needed to make changes. When Jamaica limped to the midway point of this final qualifying round in June, the coach decided to hold a casting call for players based in Britain.
"I knew there were more than 100 players in the United Kingdom who have parents from Jamaica," Simoes said. "My first attitude was to build a Jamaican product. But we needed more experience, a more professional attitude."
For a couple of years, Paul Hall and Fitzroy Simpson had been sending letters and press clippings to the Jamaican federation from their playing base in Portsmouth, England. When they came to Kingston for a tryout in June, they asked a teammate, the 20-year-old Burton, to join them. Not that the Jamaican federation had any great expectations about him.
"There didn't seem to be any harm in him coming, so we said O.K.," said Horace Reid, general secretary of the Jamaican federation.
Burton, whose father is from Jamaica, didn't have any high hopes of his own, either.
"I was just going there to get fit for the English season," he said. "This is all a big surprise."
The last three months have been a splendid blur. Burton has been transferred from Portsmouth to Derby County in the English Premier League. In Jamaica, he has gone from afterthought to national hero after his winning goals against Canada and Costa Rica. His shaved-head brilliance and cafe-au-lait skin tone have brought him the nickname of Ronaldo, a reference to the Brazilian star.
"From the looks of it, he's a bit better than me, and he has a lot more money," Burton said, jokingly.
Paired at forward with Burton, Hall has scored six goals in eight games (including friendlies) since joining the Jamaican national team. Simpson has helped build cohesion in the midfield. The fourth Beatle, Robbie Earle, has come out of the bullpen to relieve Burton. The English presence has allowed Simoes to dismiss another dissident, striker Walter Boyd, who criticized the coach for "wanting to be God" with his disciplinarian style.
"Hall and Burton are very comfortable with their backs to the goal, receiving the ball at their feet, and they are quick on the turn," Sampson said. "They have a great combination of speed and technical ability. With Simpson in the midfield, they have the English mentality, a high work rate. In the past, Jamaica was criticized for a lack of organization and work rate."
While Deon, Paul, Robbie and Fitzroy may not have the same resonance as John, Paul, George and Ringo, Jamaica has grown giddy over this incarnation of the Fab Four. Some 15,000 fans of the Reggae Boyz are expected at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium for Friday's game. A berth in the World Cup would have implications far beyond soccer.
"It would be a welcome push to the Jamaican psyche," said Reid, general secretary of the soccer federation. "Each day in Jamaica and the Caribbean we wake up to face the difficulties of the economy and employment. This would give us added incentive to go out and put in hard work. It would push our spirit and our motivation high. It would be the greatest achievement in the last couple of decades for this country and the Caribbean."

HEADLINE: The Tide Is Not Lifting Everyone

 BODY:
The Census Bureau set the White House aglow this week when it reported that in 1996 median income rose for the second consecutive year while black and Hispanic poverty rates fell. President Clinton said the report proved that his economic policies were working and that the middle class was finally on the rise. But a deeper look at the census report finds a gloomier perspective -- the middle class is not doing very well and the poor are falling further behind.
The backdrop for the report is an economy that has steadily recovered since 1991 and is growing at a healthy 3 percent a year. Unemployment has dropped below 5 percent to its lowest level in a quarter-century. Inflation is low and falling. Welfare rolls fell almost 10 percent last year. The minimum wage is rising. The economic landscape could not be better for middle-class families in general, and low-wage workers in particular. 
 Median income -- the income of households halfway up the income ladder -- rose about 1 percent last year, to almost $35,500 a year. Even so, that leaves the living standard of a typical family below its level in 1989, before the last recession took hold. Indeed, when adjusted for inflation, incomes fell on average for the bottom 60 percent of households over the past seven years, in sharp contrast to what happened after recessions in the 1970's and 80's. Worse, the median earnings of full-time male workers fell last year, despite plummeting unemployment rates. Family income went up because women earned more.
The poverty rate last year, 13.7 percent, was higher than in 1989, despite seven years of uninterrupted growth and a higher minimum wage. Black and Hispanic poverty rates were down last year, but not significantly; the drops might reflect sampling error. Growth used to be the salvation of low-paid workers. But over the past three years, the gap between rich and poor has not budged.
The weakness of the current recovery can be seen by comparing the 1990's with the 1950's, when median income rose by about 30 percent despite the economy's suffering two major recessions. The difference is explained by the fact that productivity in the 1950's rose at a rapid clip, whereas today it rises by barely 1 percent a year. Sluggish productivity gains produce sluggish income gains.
Those at the bottom are not faring well. Median income, adjusted for inflation, for the poorest 20 percent of families fell last year, even though the economy was zipping along. Mr. Clinton is right that recovery is beginning to pay off, though modestly, for the middle class. But the chilling lesson from the census data is that even a healthy economy leaves the poor firmly in a depressing place.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A record year for underwriting seems to be a certainty.

BYLINE: By David Barboza 

 BODY:
WITH the stock market continuing its phenomenal ascent and interest rates holding steady, stock and bond underwriting reached record levels last quarter, putting the new issues market on course to have its best year.
In the three months ended Tuesday, stock and bond underwriting rose 59 percent from the comparable period a year ago, totaling $343.2 billion, up from $216 billion, according to the Securities Data Company, which tracks underwriting. That puts Wall Street investment banks on pace to reach the $1 trillion mark for only the second time. 
 The gains have come in a market awash in mergers and acquisitions and flush with new corporate debt offerings. All call upon the tools of the investment banker, who helps supply corporate chiefs and others with the capital they seek.
"It's been a busy summer," said Jeffrey Weiss, head of the global debt syndicate at Lehman Brothers. "There's been a lot of corporate activity because interest rates have trended lower, and there are lots of acquisitions that have to be financed."
Indeed, about $201.7 billion worth of American mergers and acquisitions were announced in the quarter just ended, the second-best period ever, after the $213 billion in the third quarter of 1995, said Richard Peterson, a spokesman at Securities Data. Already this year, there have been $577.2 billion worth of deals, he said, a pace that could easily eclipse last year's record $649 billion.
Such activity has fueled a buoyant underwriting business, dominated by debt offerings. For instance, of the $343.2 billion underwritten last quarter, about 90 percent was in debt offerings, while the rest came from equity offerings. In the third quarter, the sale of bonds and other debt totaled $310 billion, up 65 percent from $188 billion a year ago.
The sale of new equities also gained, with common stock bringing in $30.2 billion, up from $21.1 billion a year ago. Of that total, initial public offerings raised $9.3 billion in the third quarter, up 18 percent from $7.8 billion a year ago.
Brian Hehir, co-chief of global capital equity markets at Merrill Lynch, said a large part of the surge in new offerings reflected the large cash inflows into mutual funds and broad stock market gains that saw smaller company and technology stocks soar in the third quarter.
"The overall performance of the stock market has been strong," he said, "and small and midcap strength helps drive up the level of new issuance; it certainly helps drive the I.P.O. market."
For the year, though, initial public offerings are trailing last year's record-breaking pace by about 29 percent. But several analysts said they expected the fourth quarter to be the best of the year particularly because of a surge in new international issues. "We have as big a backlog as we've ever had," Mr. Hehir said. "I.P.O.'s are poised to have a very big fourth quarter."
In the third quarter, Merrill Lynch, the mammoth retail and investment house, was once again the leading underwriter in debt and equity offerings, raising about $52.6 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover; Salomon Brothers, J. P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs. The 10 most-active securities firms accounted for 82 percent of all the underwriting business.
The merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter helped catapult that firm into second place for the quarter, from seventh place a year ago, after underwriting 389 issues to raise about $49.2 billion, up from $15.8 billion a year ago. Morgan Stanley was the leading stock underwriter in the quarter.
Salomon was third in the quarter. Yet, had its recently announced merger with the Smith Barney unit of Travelers Group been completed, the new company would have tied for second. Salomon made big gains in underwriting mortgage- and asset-backed debt, leading all other Wall Street firms with $14.3 billion raised, up from $4.9 billion a year ago.
One reason why merger activity accelerated was low interest rates, which enabled corporations to sell debt to pay for a range of large acquisitions or planned takeovers.
"We've seen a lot of jumbo offerings this year, and at their root has been a steady merger market," said Randy Snook, a syndicate manager in the fixed-income division at Goldman, Sachs.
In all, Wall Street firms have raised $943.9 billion this year in just three quarters. For all of 1996, they raised about $967.7 billion, and in 1993 they raised a record $1.05 trillion. The number of issues is also climbing, gaining 28 percent, to 2,721 this year from 2,123 at this time last year.
But disclosed fees, or what is left over for Wall Street firms, were up just slightly in the third quarter, to $1.9 billion, from $1.7 billion a year ago. For the year, however, fees were down to $5.6 billion, from $6.7 billion a year ago.
Part of the reason is that equity underwriting declined as a percentage of overall underwriting; equity fees generally are higher.
There was also greater competition for business and an increase in one- and two-year financing deals, which bring lower fees.
Mr. Snook at Goldman, Sachs, however, said that the lower fees were not a sign of sluggishness. "Even though we're seeing lower stated fees, the business is very healthy," he said. "And the outlook for the rest of the year is very good."

Wanted: a global warming policy that stands a chance.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT'S crunch time at the White House on climate change policy. With the meeting on global warming set for Kyoto, Japan, in December, the Clinton Administration has less than three weeks to come up with its own proposal before the agenda is locked in place by meeting planners and America is reduced to the role of commentator.
Cynics have assumed that President Clinton would stake out the easy high ground, demanding more from developing countries (or the United States Congress) than they are prepared to give, thereby obviating the need for action. But the Administration is reportedly trying to piece together a plan that rapidly growing economies like China could live with, yet still buy some insurance against climate change. That is why White House policy wonks are now focusing on hybrid plans that limit greenhouse gas emissions, yet provide an escape hatch. 
 "The idea is to get started, but without fear of economic surprises," said Richard Morgenstern, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who is a researcher at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan group in Washington.
The European Community is officially gung-ho to set ambitious emissions goals for the developed world and to meet them with the help of carbon emission taxes. The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries -- notably China, India and Russia -- join in. Administration economists are especially taken with emissions trading plans that would allow private businesses in developed countries to pay their counterparts in developing economies to do the heavy lifting.
This opens two avenues for rationalizing doing nothing at all.
The Administration could earn brownie points with hard-line environmentalists by going along with the Europeans, effectively inviting the Republican Congressional majority to shoot down any agreement. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has already warned against an accord in which "the U.S. would likely bear too much burden." And Republicans would no doubt go to the barricades before approving a new tax on carbon emissions.
Or President Clinton could insist that developing countries fully commit to both targets and means for limiting emissions before he presents the deal to Congress. This would seem statesmanlike while indefinitely delaying the need to ask sacrifice from Americans.
The ease of procrastination explains the new interest in hybrid proposals from serious policy types in the Administration who want the President to take the lead in Kyoto.
The idea is simple, says Mr. Morgenstern, who, in collaboration with Raymond Kopp and William Pizer at Resources for the Future, has outlined its virtues on the group's Web site (www.rff.org). The researchers would set limits on total carbon emissions and parcel out rights to emit that can be traded between businesses and perhaps countries. But they would also guarantee that no one would ever have to pay more than a ceiling price for permits in the private market -- say $10 a ton -- by having governments sell any number of additional permits at the ceiling.
If the ceiling price were low enough, business might be willing to go along. Indeed, a few companies -- most notably British Petroleum, which announced a voluntary emissions monitoring program earlier this week in conjunction with the Environmental Defense Fund -- seem eager for modest actions that reduce business uncertainty. And since proposed charges for added permits aren't necessarily "taxes" in the Republican lexicon, they, too, might go with the flow.
The concept is unappealing to environmental lobbies that want strict targets and timetables. But Mr. Morgenstern suggests that the hybrid approach would call the bluff of perennially optimistic enviros, who argue that there is a cheap fix for every problem. And it would please many economists, who want to set up a framework for efficient containment of greenhouse gases before the risks of climate change are fully understood. "This would be a way to initiate a broad but realistic commitment," argued Robert Stavins of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Warwick J. McKibbin and Peter J. Wilcoxen, authors of a climate change "policy brief" at the Brookings Institution (www.brook.edu), see other benefits. The price ceiling on permits could be set low enough, they suggest, to make it palatable for rich countries to begin containment without the cooperation of developing countries. Moreover, the chance to collect a fee on excess emissions would give revenue-hungry governments an incentive to enforce the standards.
The hybrid approach is too new to allow for a realistic assessment of its chances at Kyoto. But it is appealing on its face. More important, its prominence in current Administration thinking suggests that the White House is treating sacrifices in containing climate change as a problem in political coalition-building rather than a potential obstacle to Al Gore's election in 2000. "The real choice is not between a sharp reduction in emissions and a more modest policy," Mr. Wilcoxen said, "but between a modest policy and no policy at all."

In New York, All Sides Give Albright Advice

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The problem with reaching out to the American people -- if you're Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright -- is that the American people feel free to reach out right back.
And since she is in New York, a city where foreign affairs are as much a part of the daily discourse as the weather, that means she gets plenty of advice. 
 "As I'm going to the ladies' room," Ms. Albright said, describing a visit to a Greek diner on the East Side of Manhattan on Saturday morning, "this guy gets me in the corner and says, 'You got to do something about Cyprus.'
"So then I'm walking along further and this woman yells out, 'Do something about our Prime Minister. You've got to push Bibi,' " less familiarly known as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
"Coming back again, this guy yells out, 'When are we going to make sure we get those guys in Bosnia?' " she went on. "And then finally I go into this restaurant, which I thought was Italian but ended up being Albanian, and the daughter and father start explaining to me what has to be done in Albania."
And that was her day off.
No matter. Ms. Albright, to hear her tell it, has been relishing every minute of her return to New York City, now as Secretary of State after four busy, sometimes contentious years as the United States' representative to the United Nations.
Ms. Albright, here for the opening of the General Assembly, has held forth at the United Nations and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the better part of two weeks, conducting a flurry of diplomatic meetings and nearly as many social ones. (She has dined with everyone from Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia to the actress Glenn Close, whom she declared the only woman in Government to outrank her, since Ms. Close played a Vice President in "Air Force One.")
 
Diplomatic Pace Stepped Up
The opening of the General Assembly in September -- luring as it does foreign ministers, presidents and other dignitaries from around the world -- has traditionally been an opportunity for Secretaries of State to carry on the business of American foreign policy in a fairly concentrated way.
But even by her own frenetic standards, notorious for exhausting her staff, Ms. Albright has stretched the opportunity to new limits.
Since arriving with President Clinton last Monday, she has held "bilaterals" -- the one-on-one meetings that are the bread and butter of diplomacy -- with three dozen foreign ministers. She has presided over a meeting of the Security Council's 15 members, signed arms control agreements with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine and brokered modest progress in talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
All told, she has met more than 100 ministers or heads of state in some capacity or another -- from gatherings of the Southeast Europe Cooperation Initiative to the Organization of African Unity to the Persian Gulf Cooperative Commission.
The prodigious pace has produced some grumbling that her extended stay seemed a waste of time and money. (Last year, her predecessor, Warren Christopher, stayed barely a week.) But she brushed aside a question of whether a schedule of endless meetings -- usually starting over breakfast and continuing through dinner -- amounted to little more than "assembly-line" diplomacy.
"If you concentrate," she explained, "you can get an awful lot done."
 
Sharp Questions at School
Yesterday Ms. Albright carried on with her reaching out -- or "public diplomacy," as she likes to call it -- by attending a breakfast of corporate leaders and visiting two of the city's public schools.
At the Bronx High School of Science, one of the nation's elite public schools, she delivered a commencement-like speech encouraging students to embrace the globalization of the world's economy and culture. She then found herself facing some fairly sharp questions. One student even raised the thorny subject of the United States' failure to pay back dues to the United Nations, an issue that has bedeviled her throughout her meetings.
Ms. Albright also visited Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx. Her aides said she had deliberately sought out a school where the students were less privileged than those at Bronx Science.
In the school's library, where Ms. Albright spoke, one student, Ada Valencia, a junior, stepped forward to say she did not have a question as much as a request: Could she shake her hand? She got a hug instead.
"I really admire her," she said afterward, in tears. "She's the highest paid woman in the country, and she came to my school."
While Ms. Albright, who makes $148,400 a year, might quibble with the description of her earnings, she often calls attention to the fact that she happens to be a woman, as she puts it. And it seemed to have its effect on the boys, too. Juan Lopez, a senior, said he was very much impressed, though a little confused, adding, "I thought it was Janet Reno who was coming."
 
Changing of Guard Stressed
It was hardly a showdown, but the Council on Foreign Relations celebration on Tuesday night of the 75th anniversary of its magazine, Foreign Affairs, offered the tantalizing prospect of sparks between the old, Henry A. Kissinger, and the new, Ms. Albright.
The former Secretary of State, called upon to introduce her, has sharply criticized the Clinton Administration's foreign policy, most recently its efforts in Bosnia, which Ms. Albright was intimately involved in shaping even before becoming Secretary in January.
In the end, however, there were nothing but niceties, though Ms. Albright seized on the chance to declare a changing of the guard when Mr. Kissinger spoke of the ties that bind those who have held the job as top diplomat.
"We are a fraternity of Secretaries of State," he said at the Council's stately building on East 68th Street. "We have shared unique experiences."
To which she replied, "Henry, I hate to tell you, it's not a fraternity anymore."

HEADLINE: Dow Again Passes 8,000, Rising 70.24

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market rose yesterday after the Government reported that manufacturing activity cooled in September. The report, which traders took as an indication that the economy is not about to overheat, helped lift prices in the bond market, and the rally spread to the stock market, sending the Dow Jones industrial average above 8,000 for the first time since Aug. 20.
Yesterday, the Dow gained 70.24 points, to close at 8,015.50, just 243 points, or 3 percent, below its all-time high, set on Aug. 6. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also gained, climbing 8.13 points, to 955.41.
For the day, blue-chips outpaced smaller issues, but yesterday's Dow showing understated the strength of the broader market, where more than two issues gained for every issue that lost ground on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said they were surprised at how tame the Dow was through much of the session, despite a powerful rally in the bond market and the optimism unleashed after Worldcom Inc. announced a $30 billion stock bid for the MCI Communications Corporation.
Since early August, the Dow has bounced around in a trading range, unable to mount the kind of 100-point rallies that came so easily earlier in the year. In fact, going into the last hour of trading, the Dow was up only 21 points, as investors bypassed the blue chips in favor of a wide array of smaller issues.
Although many analysts view the recent shift toward buying shares of smaller companies as healthy, some worry that a slowdown in the perennial market favorites could precipitate a decline in the larger market.
"The market's stuck between a rock and a hard place," said Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Bosworth. "It's a little unsettling that the broad market is so strong, and the big caps are just not cutting it."
Other analysts, however, like H. Vernon Winters, the chief investment officer at Mellon Private Asset Management, say the market is simply readjusting after a period of incredible gains.
"We had this substantial run in the market since the spring," he said. "We ran so hard, and so we needed a pause; the buying power was exhausted. Besides, we had this struggle going on between those who were accumulating stocks and those who were lightening up. There was a lot of rebalancing of portfolios."
In recent weeks, during the rebalancing, the market has steered a much steadier course, gently tip-toeing its way higher with a lot less volatility than previously.
And while blue-chip stocks have been under pressure in response to earnings warnings from some leading companies, a wide range of stocks have shown surprising strength, partly because many of those smaller companies posted strong second-quarter earnings and relatively low price-to-earnings ratios.
"For a while, small-cap companies were just hated," Mr. Winters said. "And now, everyone wants you to put your money into them. This large cap-small cap transition has been a major event."
Indeed, small-cap stocks have caught up to the large caps, and in many cases surpassed them. Yesterday, for instance, the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 84-hundredths of a point, to 454.69, notching its third consecutive record. And in the last six months, the Russell has risen about 33 percent, while the Dow has gained 21 percent.
Still, at the close of trading on Tuesday, the Dow ended the third quarter rising 3.55 percent -- its 11th consecutive quarterly gain, the longest such stretch in the postwar era. In the 1950's, there was a string of 10 consecutive quarterly gains.
The Nasdaq composite index also gained yesterday, adding 4.61 points, to close at 1,690.30. An earnings warning from Advanced Micro Devices hurt the index, with A.M.D. falling 5 9/16, to 27. Heavy trading surrounding the Worldcom-MCI deal, however, helped push volume on the index up to a record 970.6 million shares. Shares of Worldcom fell 1 3/64, to 34 21/64, while MCI rose 5 7/8, to 35 1/4.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 25 gained yesterday, led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 1 15/16, to 94 3/8. The company had a breast implant case dismissed on Monday. I.B.M., which like much of the tech sector was buffeted by the A.M.D. warning, was the worst performer, down 2 1/2, to 103 1/2.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise on Weak Report From Purchasing Managers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rallied yesterday on an unexpectedly weak manufacturing report that suggested the economy is slowing enough to suppress inflation, substantiating the Federal Reserve's decision the day before to leave interest rates unchanged.
However, the market still must contend with tomorrow's monthly employment report, which by itself is capable of unnerving bond investors by stoking their concern about inflation. 
 Yesterday, the 30-year bond surged a full point, to a price of 100 24/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.32 percent, from 6.40 percent Tuesday. The primary influence on the bond market yesterday was the monthly report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which showed manufacturing growth declined in September. Traders interpreted the report as a signal the economy might be slowing.
The purchasing managers' manufacturing index, a widely watched component of the N.A.P.M. report, fell to 54.2, from 56.8 in August. Although that still suggests further manufacturing momentum, it was below the market forecast of 56.5.
The N.A.P.M. prices-paid index -- viewed as a gauge of inflation -- rose to 54.7 from 53.8. But Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "The market paid less attention to this than usual in its bull run."
Mr. Fine noted that the release yesterday of both leading indicators and construction spending data for August were also market friendly. Construction spending declined three-tenths of 1 percent, following a 1.6 percent gain in July, while leading indicators rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent.
The market's advance also reflected purchases by traders who had bet on stronger economic data and sold bonds on a bet that prices would decline on inflation anxiety. As prices rose instead, these traders were forced to buy bonds to limit their losses, known as a short-covering rally.
In the municipal market, New York City's Transitional Finance Authority, which will pay for capital improvement projects over the next four years, sold its first bond issue.
The $650 million offering through underwriters, led by Lehman Brothers, was priced to yield a maximum 5.38 percent for bonds due in 2027, with another long maturity due in 2021 yielding 5.36 percent. Serial bonds with shorter maturities ranged from 3.90 percent in 1999 to 5.30 percent in 2017.
Alan L. Anders, treasurer of the Transitional Finance Authority, said he was pleased with the results, noting the issue sold less in yield than triple-A rated insured New York State paper. "In fact, it would have been 30 basis points less than New York City general obligation bonds had they been sold today," he said. "It represents a savings of $40 million over the life of the issue." Mr. Anders said the next sale would be at the end of this month, when the authority has an $840 million refunding of general obligation bonds.
According to Bloomberg Fair Value, the 10-year maturity had a yield that was about 41 basis points less than the city's general obligation bonds. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Sylvan G. Feldstein, municipal bond analyst for the Guardian Life Insurance Company, said that even though economic numbers abound this week there was good investor demand. Investors are generally drawn to a new name, particularly one with a strong investment grade rating.

HEADLINE: Latest Reports Give Economy A Little Chill

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, a group of manufacturing executives said today in a sign that the overall economy may be cooling.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly report provided the first substantive reading of the economy's condition last month. An index derived from the report fell to 54.2, from 56.8 in August, as orders, production and backlogs all declined. 
 The result surprised economists, most of whom expected only a small change in either direction. The unexpected slowdown also buoyed the securities markets, which viewed it as a signal that inflation remained benign. Interest rates for the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell sharply, and the Dow Jones industrial average surged to close above the 8,000-point level for the first time since Aug. 20.
In what appeared to be another sign of slowing growth, both the Chrysler Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation said sales of cars and light trucks fell 14 percent last month, partly because of diminished demand. Other big auto makers report September sales later this week.
Other economic reports today also suggested sluggishness, though they were based on older data. The index designed to predict the economy's course advanced two-tenths of 1 percent in August, while spending on construction projects in August eased.
"All these indicate that the economy continues to move ahead but with some signs that perhaps the pace is slowing somewhat," said David W. Berson, chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association. But he added that whether this turns out to be the harbinger of a respite long sought by policy makers, it is clear that "we're not there yet."
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided against raising short-term interest rates despite low unemployment and an economy that has not paused as anticipated this year. It is thought that the Fed is likely to raise rates at its meeting on Nov. 12 unless clear evidence of a slowdown exists.
Indeed, today's report by corporate purchasing managers offered the Fed little comfort on inflation.
The survey's price index climbed to 54.7 from 53.8, the highest reading since February, just before the Fed's March rate increase. The index of supplier deliveries, which is widely watched as an indicator of potential bottlenecks, eased only modestly, to 55.2 from 55.8, despite what analysts thought should have been a substantial impact from the end of the strike against United Parcel Service.
David Orr, an economist for First Union Bank, said that while manufacturing slowed the last two months, probably reflecting the huge buildup of inventories this year, "the level of activity is gradually moving up the inflation pressure gauges" that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is using as a focal point.
But while the group's price index posted its third consecutive increase last month, the September change was small: 19 percent of managers paid higher prices, compared with 20 percent in August, while 9 percent paid lower prices, compared with 10 percent. The rest reported no change.
"There appears little reason for concern" about inflation, said Norbert J. Ore, purchasing director for the Sonoco Products Company and head of the trade group's survey. He cited the "remarkably short list" of commodities that rose in price in September: aluminum, caustic soda, corrugated containers, linerboard, natural gas, soybean oil and zinc.
The two-tenths of 1 percent advance in the Conference Board's index of leading indicators, covering August, reflected increases in seven of the 10 components, with the main impact from an expansion of the money supply and a jump in orders at factories making consumer goods. The main drag on the index came from an increase in the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits.
As for the spending on construction, compiled by the Commerce Department, the three-tenths of 1 percent decline was the third lower reading in four months, but all were so modest that July's 1.6 percent gain -- revised up from five-tenths of 1 percent -- more than offset them.
The next significant look at the domestic economy comes on Friday with the release of the Labor Department's job-creation and unemployment data. The August rate was 4.9 percent, and many forecasters are expecting a 4.8 percent reading.

HEADLINE: U.S. Starts Trade Sanction Process Against Koreans and 4 Others

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Seeking to show its toughness on trade both to other nations and to Congress, the Clinton Administration listed the countries today that it said were failing to live up to their free trade obligations, citing South Korea, in particular, for obstructing access to American automobile exports.
The report set in motion a process that could in time lead to sanctions against Seoul and four other trading partners -- Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union -- as a result of disputes over particular industries or products. 
 It also raised the Administration's more general concerns over longstanding trade problems with nations including Japan and China. The United States was "increasingly concerned that Japan's progress in opening its market has slowed," it said.
The report cited China for "multiple and overlapping barriers to U.S. exports" of many types of goods and services. The trade deficit with the Chinese has grown rapidly in the last few years and now rivals the deficit with Japan, both in size and in political sensitivity here.
"While our large and growing trade deficit with China is the result of many factors, China's trade and economic policies are a significant contributor to that deficit," it said. "Opening China's market and bringing China's policies into conformity with international norms are the Administration's key objectives in the trade area and the best means" to address the deficit.
The report came as the Administration made some headway in its effort to win permission from Congress to negotiate new trade agreements on an expedited basis -- the so-called fast track authority. The Senate Finance Committee approved legislation that would grant the authority, although the prospects remained uncertain in the House. Page A16.
The Administration has tried to counter critics of free trade, many of them Democrats, by mounting aggressive efforts to insure that American companies get as much access as possible to foreign markets.
With the contentious debate over trade-negotiating authority as a backdrop, the writers of today's report were at pains to lay out in detail the steps the Government had taken in the last year, including winning the first five cases it had brought to the new international arbiter, the World Trade Organization.
"Enforcement of international trade agreements and U.S. trade laws underpins our entire approach to trade," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, whose office prepared the report.
In accusing South Korea of impeding American auto makers from entering that market, the Administration invoked provisions of United States trade law known as Super 301, which require the Administration each year to identify those countries whose policies are most hurting American exports.
The Administration has been under pressure from the auto industry to threaten the Seoul authorities with sanctions. The chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are scheduled to meet on Thursday with President Clinton at the White House, where they are expected to discuss trade as well as other issues.
Invoking the law requires the Administration to open an investigation that can last as long as a year. If the dispute is not settled in the interim -- and if the investigation concludes that South Korea is violating a 1995 agreement with the United States to open its car market to American companies -- Mr. Clinton would be able to impose sanctions on South Korea.
Despite the 1995 accord, the Big Three auto makers have less than a 1 percent share of the Korean market, Ms. Barshefsky said.
Compliance with the agreement has been disappointing, the report said, noting that South Korea continued to put in place new barriers to American entry into the market. "Although some progress was made during recent bilateral negotiations to improve market access in Korea for foreign automobiles, Korea was not prepared to undertake the reforms which are necessary for real opening of its autos market," it said.
 Korean officials and industry executives said in Seoul early Thursday that the main reason for the difficulty the American car companies had experienced was the weak economy and lackluster auto sales there. They said the American accusations of unfair trade practices were unjustified.
In the other specific cases cited in the report, the Administration said it intended to bring action at the World Trade Organization. In the case of Japan, the Administration said American apples, nectarines, cherries and other fruit were being kept out of the market by Japanese rules requiring repeated testing for safety of pesticide treatments.
The Administration said Canada was unfairly subsidizing exports of its dairy products to the United States and violating the rules in enforcing import quotas on milk.
Australia, it asserted, is violating a prohibition on export subsidies for leather used in automobiles by providing loans and grants to the industry. And the European Union was said to be circumventing an agreement to limit subsidized exports of processed cheese.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Announces a Program to Reduce Illegal Drug Use

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Announcing a series of antidrug measures that he hopes to make the hallmark of a second term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would expand special police drug-fighting efforts into Queens and the Bronx, offer more treatment for addicts and make Washington Square Park a drug-free zone by placing it off limits to those convicted of selling drugs there.
In a speech billed as a major policy announcement, Mayor Giuliani told a roomful of administration officials and police commanders that he thought drug use could be reduced in the city, much as crime has been reduced in the last four years. "I want to be able to hold up a national magazine two or three years from now and have New York City lead America in massive reductions in drug abuse," Mayor Giuliani said. 
 The Mayor outlined a wide-ranging proposal, calling for tougher law enforcement, more treatment opportunities for addicts in prison, curfews for juveniles on probation for drug offenses, expanded drug education programs in schools and a new advertising campaign on the dangers of drugs.
The first phase of the antidrug strategy will begin in November, when the Police Department is scheduled to begin deploying 1,000 officers against drug traffickers in the South Bronx and the southern Queens neighborhoods of Jamaica and St. Albans.
The department, which now has 850 officers assigned to similar antidrug efforts in northern Manhattan and northern Brooklyn, has long credited the city's declining crime rate to its success in dismantling violent drug gangs. "These areas export crime to other areas of the city," said Tony Coles, a senior mayoral adviser.
Police officials did not explain in detail where the 1,000 officers would come from. But they noted that 1,300 new officers would graduate from the Police Academy this fall and said that the next class of 1,000 recruits would begin training in December instead of July 1998.
The various parts of the Mayor's drug strategy are expected to cost the city $80 million a year, said administration officials, who added that they expected a large part of the cost to be covered by state and Federal funds. Commissioner Howard Safir said that the Police Department's extended antidrug initiatives would cost $14 million to $17 million.
The antidrug strategy also focuses on the symbolic, like the effort to make Washington Square Park a drug-free zone. For decades the park has been not only the heart of Greenwich Village and the site of New York University graduations, but also one of the city's most notorious drug spots.
Hawkers there offer drugs to young and old alike, and it is the scene of annual smoke-ins and rallies by advocates of legalizing marijuana. Residents have long complained that despite repeated crackdowns by the police, the park persists as a drug spot, because drug dealers receive short sentences or probation and return to the park as soon as they are released. One drug dealer arrested last summer had been caught there 75 times before, the police said.
Mayor Giuliani said his administration was working with the court system and the Department of Probation so that people convicted of selling drugs in Washington Square Park would be barred from returning there as a condition of their probation. "Washington Square Park can be used for playing chess, not for shooting heroin," Mr. Giuliani said.
In staking out the war on drugs as a main priority of a second term, the Mayor's speech marked something of a departure in his campaign for re-election, which until now had largely focused on the achievements of his first term.
A spokesman for Ruth W. Messinger, the Mayor's Democratic rival, said Ms. Messinger was "very pleased that the Mayor has finally come forward to address the problem of drugs in New York City."
"We only wish he had demonstrated the same enthusiasm for dealing with the crisis in our schools and among our unemployed," added the spokesman, Leland T. Jones.
Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the president of the Phoenix House Foundation, a drug-treatment organization, said that it was the most sweeping antidrug proposal by any mayor since John V. Lindsay.
"The fact is that treatment works and addiction is curable," Dr. Rosenthal said. "What we have had are insufficient resources."
Pressing his case that drug abuse is one of the greatest problems facing the city, Mayor Giuliani said that more than 70 percent of the people arrested each year test positive for drugs and that 71 percent of the children in foster care in New York City have a parent with a substance abuse problem.
Mr. Giuliani, who has been trying to raise his national profile lately and gave a speech earlier in the week on the urban agenda at Harvard University, also made a series of recommendations for fighting drugs on the national level. He said drug policy should be made a priority of foreign policy, and called for tighter border controls and interdiction efforts, longer prison terms, and better drug treatment and education programs.
He said he would lobby for several changes in New York State law, including allowing felony charges against people who are convicted repeatedly on misdemeanors for selling drugs; revoking driving privileges for youths who use drugs, and creating the presumption of parental neglect for newborn babies who test positive for drugs.
Donna Lieberman, director of the Reproductive Rights Project of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said there was no compelling evidence that women who fail one drug test necessarily make poor parents. She stressed the dangers that could arise from separating families based on faulty test results. "You're putting their families into turmoil, you are splitting up families and depriving children of their parents without an adequate basis," she said.
Mayor Giuliani said he hoped to surprise critics and nay-sayers again by making his antidrug strategies a success, and pledged to come up with ways to measure the amount of drug abuse in the city.
"I have a feeling now that in this city there's a sense that you can do things that used to be considered impossible," he said. "Because we have been doing things that were considered impossible and made them possible."

HEADLINE: ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
Economics 101: Slaughter Makes Sense

BYLINE: By William C. Rhoden 

 BODY:
Early last month, a couple, perhaps in their mid-60's, took in the sights of Jacksonville, Fla. Their matching jackets and caps identified them as proud Central Michigan University supporters.
In fact, they were alumni, come south for what they jokingly referred to as "The Game." 
 A day earlier, the Central Michigan Chippewas had played the high-powered, top-ranked Florida Gators. The game was a Chippewa disaster. Florida won, 82-6, the worst loss in Central Michigan history.
But the couple were not angry. "Hey, we never thought we'd get to play a program like Florida," the man said. "We got $300,000 for the game, so it wasn't all bad."
In fact, Central Michigan received a $350,000 guarantee, but not everyone was thrilled. "We received some flak," said Herb Deromedi, the Central Michigan athletic director and former head football coach. "When I say flak, some people responded, and I responded back.
"No one complained when we beat Michigan State two out of three times." He was referring to victories in the 1991 and 1992 seasons. The game with Florida was actually scheduled in 1991, when Deromedi was the head coach. He became the athletic director in 1994.
In the fragile ecosystem of college football, administrators feed their football programs to predators as a way of keeping healthy. Athletes march bravely into combat, convinced that the sky is blue when it in fact is green.
"When you're in schools like ours, you have to look at your finances," Deromedi said. "It would be great if the money came from other sources. If John Smith came in and said, 'Here's $300,000 so you don't have to go to Florida,' that's fine. Then maybe you might want to rethink it."
Central Michigan is a member of the Mid-American Conference, an 11-team league that is trying to increase its profile by playing schools like Florida and Nebraska. Its other members are Akron, Ball State, Bowling Green, Eastern Michigan, Kent, Marshall, Miami of Ohio, Ohio University, Toledo and Western Michigan.
Bill Lynch, the head coach at Ball State, said that from the players' standpoint, there should be no shame. "It's a great challenge for them," Lynch said. "It's an opportunity for our guys to go play against teams many of them grew up watching. Every now and then, we knock one of them off."
Already this season, Marshall and Miami defeated Army, Ohio University defeated Maryland and Toledo defeated Purdue. Ball State lost to Indiana, 33-6, and lost to Purdue, 28-14. At the same time, Akron lost to Nebraska, 59-14, and lost to Louisiana State, 56-0. Last weekend, Bowling Green lost to Kansas State, 58-0, and on Saturday will play Nebraska.
Jerry Ippoliti, the Mid-American commissioner, looked at the routs and saw the glass as half full. "If I was a school like Kentucky and got beat, 55-28, by Florida, I'd be concerned about it," he said, "because we're talking about budgets that are about $24 million in their athletic program to maybe the highest we might have is $9 million. Look at Iowa-Iowa State" -- Iowa won, 63-20 -- "look at that rout. Iowa State has four times the budget any one of our schools has. They are in the Big 12. How do you justify that?"
It is one thing to compete as a Big 12 member and lose, quite another to accept an invitation to certain slaughter for a guaranteed profit. Ippoliti said the aim of the conference is to increase its visibility. "We've really focused on football the last four or five years because of having to maintain our Division I attendance requirements. Every one of our institutions, facility-wise, has improved their football stadium."
The bottom line of the Mid-American's search for higher visibility, its forays into elite competition, is to make ends meet and to do so as gracefully as possible.
"There are Title IX issues that now affect supporting men's and women's programs," Ippoliti said. "Therefore, $350,000 or $400,000 certainly is an enhancement to anyone's budget."
What about the student athlete, thrown into a situation that is often hopeless -- and humiliating? Ippoliti sees it as opportunity, not exploitation. "I think we have to look at our country," he said. "When you're looking at the philosophical approach to intercollegiate athletics, as in the business world, you're trying to do the best you can against the best. You never know until you try."
The Mid-American Conference will continue to take on the fat cats. Some members will take lumps, Ippoliti said, but the ebb and flow of college football virtually insures that, now and then, there will be a breakthrough.
"You never know when you'll hit the cycle," he said. "You hit the cycle when one of the elite teams are down, then you've got a chance to win." And if you hit the cycle when they're up?
"That's a risk," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
The On College Football column yesterday, about the Mid-American Conference's rigorous schedule, omitted one school from the number in the conference. There are 12, including Northern Illinois. The column also misidentified Bowling Green's opponent for tomorrow; it is Northern Illinois.

HEADLINE: MY NEW YORK;
On a Soaring Ride Of Reminiscence, Speed and Wonder

BYLINE: BY KATIE ROIPHE; Katie Roiphe is a New York author whose most recent book is "Last Night in Paradise."

 BODY:
My father left Flatbush 55 years ago, and now, on a bright fall day, I find myself going back to deepest Brooklyn, to Coney Island, to the last stop on the F train.
My date stops in front of the Cyclone that curls ominously above us. I am astonished that he wants to ride it. I feel twinges of panic on elevators and airplanes. But it seems too early in our acquaintance for him to know that I am too neurotic for roller coasters. My date does not give the impression of being afraid of anything. So we end up at the ticket counter. The ticket seller catches a crazy glint of fear in my eyes and says, "Nothing's happened to anyone in the seven years that I've worked here," and we hear the whoops and shouts and rattle of the cars above us and I look up at my date and wonder how well I really know him. 
 As we climb into the car it feels rickety and fragile. The wooden track rising against the sky reminds me of the dinosaur bones in the American Museum of Natural History, which is not a reassuring image. The other passengers are teen-agers from the neighborhood who look as if they do things every day that make the Cyclone about as exciting as a cross-town bus. The hand-painted signs warn us against losing handbags and beepers.
Once the Cyclone starts, it just doesn't feel safe. It shakes and moans. This is not the sleek modern sound of speed. This is speed from another era. It's the roller-coaster equivalent of reading by gas lamps or sending telegraphs. The Cyclone was built in 1927. "Don't worry," my date tells me. "There's a guy who checks every inch of it every day." But should we trust a roller coaster constructed before they knew about computers or television?
We are pulled into the sky. I feel as if I am nothing but a stomach, air and fear. As we hurtle to the top, I grasp my handbag, my date pressed against me, and I see the water and sky and sand, the crowd swirling below us, and it's the greatest view in the whole city, the thrill and terror blending into clarity, and I feel as if I've never really seen the ocean before.
Down below us is the boardwalk where my father used to come with his friends in the early 30's to swim and buy Nathan's hot dogs for a nickel. He rode the Cyclone in the brighter, grander days of its youth. He grew up only a few miles from here, on East 22d Street between Avenue T and Avenue U, in a house that I've never really seen. He drove us there once, but when we got to his block he suddenly put his foot on the gas, and we perceived his childhood house, the house he was evicted from during the Depression, as a blur of color. Now, I'm like a tourist in my father's childhood. I am sailing over the past he won't talk about. I am almost reaching it.
The track dips and the car zips down. My date and I are in our late 20's, and he at least seems very adult, but the years are stripped away by wind and fear and we are children again, clutching each other's hands.
It seems as if there is only a small chance that the metal bar will actually hold us in. At any moment we are going to fly out -- little dots against the horizon. I imagine us falling through the air, like astronauts in a movie, our hair streaming out in the wind, frozen in a black and white photograph the next day in the tabloids.
As we turn the curve, even the blase teen-agers shriek, but I am too scared to scream. It seems as if all of my energy has to be focused on staying alive. In 1911, the Cyclone's predecessor, the Giant Racer, flew off its tracks, killing two women.
It feels as if the earth is falling out from under us and I have to close my eyes, no matter what my date will think. We swoop and swerve and finally clatter to a halt. It has been 100 seconds.
I wonder why I feel so good. I feel sort of bruised and banged up but that feeling is part of the beauty of the Cyclone. It's about terror and the release from terror, about how close dreams are to nightmares, and how easy it is to escape from your life. A journalist from the turn of the century wrote, "Coney Island has a code of conduct all her own," and I know exactly what he means. The Cyclone gives you the feeling that nothing matters but the moment you are in, a feeling worth much more than the $4 price of the ticket. In fact, it may be the platonic ideal of dates -- a whole journey of risk and reassurance condensed into a minute-and-a-half.
As I step onto what seems like solid ground, I feel lightheaded and shaky and my date puts his arm around me. We pass a freak show and a dance contest in which couple No. 2 seems to be the best bet to win. The brightly painted food stands and arcades bear more of a resemblance to the old peep shows in Times Square than the glamorous architecture of Coney Island's past. But you can still feel the seediness and greatness of the place, the vague feeling of menace, of leisure and unemployment mixing, along with the elation of a day at the beach.
My date buys a large bag of Nathan's french fries, and I wonder how on earth he can eat after what we've just been through, and the crowd is milling around us with stuffed dogs and blown-up alligators tucked under their arms, and the sun glistens in the sand, and the sky is as blue as the cotton candy sold by vendors, and, for a moment, I am dazzled by the mysteries of another person and of the city itself.

HEADLINE: Classical Music and Dance Guide

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in New York City.
 
Opera
 
THE AMATO OPERA'S "FALSTAFF." For 50 years, Anthony Amato has been conducting and directing pocket-size productions of repertory classics and rarely staged works, using chamber orchestrations and casts that combine amateurs who are enthusiastic enough about opera to learn a role and conservatory students who crave experience. The results are unpredictable, but for anyone used to hearing opera in the vast uptown houses, there is something to be said for the perspective afforded by an intimate staging, particularly in a comic work like Verdi's "Falstaff," the opening production of the golden anniversary season. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 P.M., Sunday at 2:30 P.M. Amato Opera, 319 Bowery at Second Street, East Village. (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $20 (Allan Kozinn). 

"CARMEN." The Metropolitan Opera's current run of "Carmen" survives into early October with much of its original cast intact. Denyce Graves, a welcome firebrand in the title role, will be around tonight and next Thursday. Placido Domingo gives way to Luis Lima on Thursday. The interesting new face will operate with his back to the audience. Yves Abel, a fast-rising young man with a bent for French music, will be the conductor both nights. Elsewhere, Franco Zeffirelli's production offers a placid, photographic attractiveness and should be balm for those not hellbent on modern metaphor. The orchestra and chorus promise to be splendid. Tonight at 8. (212) 362-6000. Tickets, $25 to $200. Sold out; returns may be available the day of the performance (Bernard Holland).
 DICAPO OPERA THEATER. This scrappy company is dedicated to presenting familiar and sometimes unfamiliar works in a wonderfully intimate theater. Leoncavallo's popular verismo melodrama "Pagliacci," the first offering of the season, might benefit from a close-up viewing. For all the crowd scenes, it is essentially the story of a fateful love triangle, played as a domestic drama. Tonight at 8. Also tomorrow at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan. (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $25. (Anthony Tommasini).
 "L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI," the New York City Opera. If you share the sensibilities of most of the audience at the first performance, you may have a delightful time with Christopher Alden's new production of this Rossini lark, imported from the Glimmerglass Opera. But if you persist in looking for Rossini's sensibility, you may not find it amid garish trappings and predictable pratfalls. It all feels like a bad sitcom, and the music, surely the main point, counts as little more than tinkling soundtrack despite game efforts from several performers. Tonight at 8. New York State Theater. (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $20 to $85 (James R. Oestreich).
 "THE MAGIC FLUTE." The New York City Opera has several wonderful Mozart stagings in its repertory, and notable among them is this 1987 Lotfi Mansouri production that captures both the comic fairy tale qualities and the more sober glimpses into the human spirit that are bound together in "The Magic Flute." Thierry Bosquet's colorful sets provide a storybook backdrop for a solid and vocally secure cast. Tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. New York City Opera, New York State Theater. (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Kozinn).
 "MANON," the Metropolitan Opera. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's idiosyncratic production of Massenet's wrenching tragedy was much maligned when it was staged in 1987, but although his scenic excesses remain, the production has been substantially rethought for the current revival. The work's emotionalism, skewered by Ponnelle, now blossoms, both in the fine singing of a well-balanced cast and in Julius Rudel's shapely rendering of the lush orchestral score. Most crucially, Renee Fleming conveys both the passion and inner turmoil that drives Manon in her descent from ingenue to courtesan, and Marcello Giordani offers a thoughtfully nuanced portrayal of the Chevalier des Grieux. Tomorrow at 8 P.M. (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $150 (Kozinn).
 "LA TRAVIATA," the New York City Opera. Susan Patterson, an American soprano, recently made her City Opera debut as Violetta in this production of Verdi's "Traviata" by Renata Scotto. Though vocally Ms. Patterson sang unevenly, she was an ardent and affecting heroine. The baritone Christopher Robertson is a rewarding Germont. Sunday at 1:30 P.M. New York State Theater. (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Tommasini).
 "TURANDOT," the Metropolitan Opera. In reviving Puccini's "Turandot," the Met pits Franco Zeffirelli's 10-year-old extravaganza of a production against a cast worthy of the competition. Jane Eaglen trumpets beautifully in the title role. Luciano Pavarotti is in good vocal shape as Calaf, though somewhat wobbly on his feet. Hei-Kyung Hong invests the part of Liu with some lovely singing and uncharacteristic vocal weight. James Levine and his orchestra are superb. "Turandot" is not rocket science, but its inspired simplicity has its effect. Mr. Zeffirelli's ministrations alternately add to and get in the way of the proceedings. Tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $150. Sold out; returns may be available the day of the opera (Holland).
 
Classical Music
 
CHRISTINA KISS. The line between bravery and foolhardiness may be a thin one, and undertaking to perform the complete solo piano works of Liszt -- from memory -- in several dozen recitals might easily fall on either side. Christina Kiss, a pianist who was born in Budapest and has won prizes at several international competitions, undertook this project in 1990 and expects to complete it in 2005. She has both the bravura technique and the imagination to make it work, and in the 22d installment of her projected 50-concert traversal, she offers the "Soirees de Vienne," Nos. 1 to 3, "Historical Hungarian Portraits," "Souvenir de la Fiance," and Liszt's transcription of the Beethoven Second Symphony. Weill Recital Hall, Sunday at 2 P.M. (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $35 to $65 (Kozinn).
 KOCIAN QUARTET. This quartet from Prague was formed in the early 1970's, and is familiar to American listeners through a series of recordings that show its playing to be finely polished and full of character. Judging from its discography, its players' tastes range fairly widely, and that breadth is reflected in its New York debut program, devoted entirely to Czech composers. Included are Dvorak's Quartet No. 14 (Op. 105), Erwin Schulhof's vibrant Quartet No. 1, composed in 1924, and an intriguing 19th-century rarity, the Quartet in G (Op. 8) by Zdenek Fibich. The Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, Sunday at 5 P.M. (212) 288-0700. Free, but tickets must be reserved in advance (Kozinn).
 NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Kurt Masur's season-opening performances of the first three Brahms symphonies were satisfying and at times enlightening, showing an affinity born of the conductor's long experience with the music as well as an obvious affection for it. Now he reaches the Fourth, which he described last week in a public forum as a "result of a lifetime," the capstone of "a life symphony in four movements." Schubert's Third Symphony should also be given an idiomatic turn. And who knows? Perhaps Mr. Masur and Boris Berezovksy, a Russian pianist, will make something interesting of Liszt's wheezy inflation of Schubert's "Wanderer" Fantasy. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Avery Fisher Hall. (212) 875-5030. Tickets: $20 to $75 (Oestreich).
 JEROME ROSE. A piano recital devoted to the last three piano sonatas by Schubert may sound like a heavy-going evening. But these works, while as mystical and searching as the late Beethoven sonatas, are also full of lovely tunes and bumptious dance music. The pianist Jerome Rose, best known for his recordings of the complete works of Liszt, will perform Schubert's posthumous sonatas at the Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan. (212) 580-0210. Tonight at 8. Free (Tommasini).
 ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE. Arnold Schoenberg had a wonderful way of distilling other composers' works for presentation by the Society for Private Musical Performances in Vienna. Here, in a program conducted by Philippe Herreweghe, Schoenberg works his magic on Mahler: "Das Lied von der Erde," which Mr. Herreweghe has recorded in this form for Harmonia Mundi France, and the "Songs of a Wayfarer." Tonight at 8. Metropolitan Museum of Art. (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $30. Sunday at 2 P.M. Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park. (212) 840-7470. Tickets: $12 (Oestreich).
 TANGO. Over the last century, tango composers have transformed this Argentinian tavern dance into a complex expressive form, bringing complexities to its structure and blending its original rhythms with harmonic influences of jazz and contemporary European classical music. In recent years it has taken its place in the concert repertory, much as the minuet and the waltz did in centuries past. Gidon Kremer has lately become a champion of the tangos of Astor Piazzolla, and in this installment of the Next Wave Festival, Mr. Kremer and the Astor Quartet will present a concert of his music. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Majestic Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene. Tomorrow at 7:30 and Sunday at 3 P.M. (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $20 to $45 (Kozinn).
 
Dance
 
CREACH/KOESTER. St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue and 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. An all-male ensemble dances its way through choreographic meditations on asceticism, the Bible, Michelangelo and AIDS-influenced poetry in Terry Creach's "Study for a Resurrection," to sacred music performed by Lionheart, a male vocal ensemble. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30. Tickets: $12 (Jack Anderson).
 NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE OF INDIA, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. The 11-member company from a village near Bangalore, dedicated solely to training dancers, offers varied examples of three great traditional forms of classical Indian choreography: Odissi, Mohiniattam and Kathak. Tomorrow at 8 P.M. Tickets: $20 (Anderson).
 "RIVERDANCE," Radio City Music Hall, (212) 247-4777. They're back, feet flying and fiddles playing, in a mega-celebration of Irish culture, with help from some friends from other countries. Tonight at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 8 P.M.; and Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 P.M. Through Oct. 12. Tickets: $37-$77; Ticketmaster: (212) 307-7171 (Jennifer Dunning).
 STARS OF THE KIROV BALLET. Two performances by dancers from this hallowed Russian ballet troupe at college theaters in the area will give New Yorkers a chance to see glowing chestnuts from the classical repertory including, if advance word on Russian touring repertory proves for once to be correct, the "Black Swan," "Corsaire" and "Diana and Acteon" pas de deux. Marius Petipa's "Satinilo" and "Arlequinada" pas de deux are also scheduled, as well as a solo by Boris Eifman performed by Farukh Ruzimatov, appropriately nicknamed "Razzle-dazzle" by the fans. Led by Ruzimatov and Yuliya Makhalina, the touring group also includes several New York favorites and new stars unknown here. The youngsters include Ilya Kuznetsov, Uliyana Lopatkina, Diyana Vishneva, Anastasiya Volochkova and Yevgeny Ivanchenko. Tomorrow night at 8 at Tilles Center, C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville. (516) 299-3100. Tickets: $34 to $50. Sunday at 3 P.M. at Lehman Concert Hall, Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, the Bronx. (718) 960-8833. Tickets: $20 to $30 (Dunning).
 TANZTHEATER WUPPERTAL. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. "Die Fensterputzer" ("The Window Washer"), Pina Bausch's latest extravagantly scaled production, features a mountain of red flowers, a panorama of serious and comic dramatic situations and a window washer who is lowered onto the stage, squeegee in hand. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets: $50, $35, $20 (Anderson).
 THARP!, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Twyla Tharp is one of the few artists of whom the unexpected can genuinely be expected. Back in Manhattan (through Oct. 12) with yet another new company, one of the few predictable things about her, Tharp will present the world premiere of "Roy's Joys," set to and inspired by music written and recorded by the jazz trumpeter Roy Eldridge during his expatriate years in Paris in the 1940's and 50's. Program A will also include a revival of "The Fugue," an exhilaratingly astringent 1970 dance performed without music on an amplified stage. The three New York premieres that make up Program B are set to an astonishing range of scores that include work by Philip Glass, 18th- and 19th-century American religious songs, and "bachelor-pad music" from the 1930's through the 60's. Tonight at 8 (Program A); tomorrow at 3 and 8 P.M. (Program B) and Sunday at 3 P.M. (A) and 8 P.M. (B). Tickets: $25 to $45 (Dunning).

HEADLINE: Don't Cut Legal Aid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report (news article, Oct. 1) that the Legal Services Corporation may face one of the biggest Federal budget cuts for the 1998 fiscal year, receiving only $141 million, half its current level. However, an amendment to approve $250 million for this legal aid source for poor families passed in the House by a vote of 246 to 176 on Sept. 25. A more generous Senate endorses $300 million. 
 Even $250 million is barely adequate to sustain the agency, which channels the Federal money to 275 local programs throughout the country. The programs provide poor and low-income people with free legal assistance for family, housing, employment, consumer and other life problems. While these may sound like routine issues, they are usually a matter of survival for families living on the economic edge.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Falls on Economy Woes; Mark Up on Rate-Rise Talk

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed against the yen yesterday on further signs that Japan's economy was faltering, but fell against the mark on renewed speculation that Germany might soon raise interest rates.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average plunged 2.17 percent in Tokyo to an eight-month low, a day after a closely watched central bank survey showed a growing number of Japanese manufacturers thought business conditions would worsen. 
 "It's hard not to be bullish on the dollar and bearish on the yen," said Robert Houck, a currency salesman at the Norwest Bank in Minneapolis. "Traders focused on the Japanese economy and said, 'Let's buy dollars.' "
The dollar settled at 121.65 yen in New York, up from 120.90 yen Wednesday. It fell to 1.7728 marks from 1.7734. The pound cost $1.6160, up from $1.6152.
Traders said signs that Japan's economy was faltering outweighed concern that trade tension between the United States and Japan might intensify, which tends to weaken the dollar.
The dollar's strength makes United States exports more expensive and gives Japanese exporters a price advantage over their American counterparts. Some traders are beginning to worry that United States officials may soften their support for a strong dollar if the trade gap with Japan keeps widening.
Dragging the dollar down versus the mark, a Bundesbank council member, Franz-Christoph Zeitler, said he was on guard against inflation. That resurrected intermittent concern that the German central bank might soon raise interest rates. "The price climate is not as trouble-free as it was half a year ago," Mr. Zeitler said. "We have to watch carefully how import prices develop."
A rise in rates to combat inflation would also help lift the mark by making bonds and deposits denominated in the German currency more attractive.
Mr. Zeitler's remarks follow last week's report showing German import prices rose nine-tenths of a percent in August, pushing the annual rate to an eight-year high of 5.4 percent. The mark's weakness relative to the currencies of Germany's major trading partners has helped cause the price increases.

HEADLINE: Room Service a l'Americain;
Old World Charm Bumps Into New World Economics

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

 BODY:
It's not that Sol Melia, a Spanish hotel chain, was in financial trouble. It's just that it wasn't sufficiently Americanized.
Founded on the island of Majorca in the 1950's by a young hotel worker-turned-entrepreneur named Gabriel Escarrer, Sol Melia had become one of Europe's fastest-growing hotel empires by the early 1990's. But Mr. Escarrer, realizing that the competitive terrain was shifting beneath him, put his son Sebastian in charge. 
 The younger Mr. Escarrer, who had held summer jobs as a teen-ager with the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta and the International Business Machines Corporation in New York and studied business at the Wharton School in Philadelphia, set out to overhaul the company along American lines. He tightened management controls, created three brand names instead of one, separated the real estate holdings of the company from its management operations and, last March, went public.
Currently, the company is negotiating a strategic alliance with an American chain, he says, though he declines to identify it.
The reason he acted so forcefully, the 31-year-old Mr. Escarrer says, was his realization that profitable though Sol Melia was, it would get left in the dust in the 21st century if it did not jump on the bandwagon driven by the American chains. "Either you go for a niche," he said in a phone interview, "or, if you want to compete, you need to go global."
In the European hotel industry these days, everybody seems to be going global. With American chains breathing down their necks, most hotel companies figure they do not have much choice. And the way to go global, they are discovering, is pretty much to follow the trail blazed by the American giants -- with, of course, some graceful Old World twists.
They are making the shift at a time of great turmoil in the European hotel industry.
Construction is booming, both at the high end and the low end of the market, and a wave of mergers and acquisitions is sweeping the Continent as hotel chains search out allies to strengthen their market positions.
Yet, because the European hotel business remains dominated by independents -- fully 75 percent of the trade, compared with just 25 percent in the United States -- it remains vulnerable to penetration by American chains like Marriott International, Sheraton, and HFS Inc., which manages Howard Johnson, Days Inn and Ramada hotels. Sheraton is a unit of ITT.
"Europe is a very fragmented market," said Nigel Reed, an analyst with Paribas Capital Markets in London. "Booking systems, reservation systems, yield systems, all are in the Dark Ages." The current upheaval, he added, though wrenching, also provides European chains like the Accor Group in France and Britain's Forte P.L.C., a unit of the Granada Group, an opportunity to become world players.
And they are seizing it, largely by copying the American model. The Europeans are increasingly separating out real estate holdings from hotel management operations, a bookkeeping practice designed to raise the return on investment for hotel companies that was virtually unknown in Europe only a few years ago. And they are luring business travelers with such amenities as voice mail and computerized business centers.
Taking another page from the textbook, the Europeans are increasing their clout by merging forces, taking over weaker properties and pushing aggressively into the budget-hotel business. In March, for example, Accor announced it was teaming up with NH Hoteles, a unit of the Cofir beverages and hotel group in Spain, to open 60 budget hotels under Accor's Ibis brand around Madrid and other Spanish cities. And earlier, Hilton International, a unit of Britain's Ladbroke Group that acquired the Hilton name outside North America in 1988, announced an equity swap and marketing alliance with the Hilton Hotels Corporation of New York.
Increasingly, too, experts say, European hotel chains are following the American practice of moving into related fields, from family resorts to gambling halls. The Scottish Stakis Group, for example, which runs St. Ermin's in London, operates golf resorts in Scotland and casinos on the Channel Islands.
European hotels are also working to close the gadget gap. "American hotels, even medium-priced ones, are better versed in handling technology," said Werner J. Hein, a Washington lawyer who travels frequently in Europe. But Mr. Hein acknowledged that electronic amenities such as voice mail and telephone systems that lend themselves to laptop hookups are spreading. Air-conditioning, too, is becoming more widespread, though it is often still lacking, as many American visitors to London and Paris discovered during a heat wave this August.
To finance their growth, European chains have discovered the stock market. In Britain, six medium-range hotel companies were taken to the stock market in 1996, and two more have followed thus far this year. Mr. Escarrer's Sol Melia raised $275 million when it sold 45 percent of its equity on the Madrid exchange earlier this year, the first Spanish hotel chain to go public. Sol Melia's share price has soared by 120 percent since then, to almost 5,800 pesetas, or about $39.
Much of the action is in response to an American invasion of the European hotel trade. Marriott began dipping its toes in Europe's hotel waters two decades ago, but only two years ago plunged in with a construction and acquisition binge that has so far doubled the number of its rooms to more than 6,000.
Other American companies are spreading franchising practices to Europe. In 1993, for instance, Choice Hotels International Inc., the Maryland-based franchising company that is a unit of Manor Care, entered Europe with brands like Quality, Clarion and Sleep, and now boasts 360 hotels. By the end of the century, Choice executives expect the number to exceed 500. In the same period, HFS Inc., based in Parsippany, N.J., expects to increase the number of its hotels outside the United States to 1,000, from 300 now. Most of the additions will be in Europe.
Eric Pfeffer, the president and managing director of HFS Global Services, is leading his company's invasion of Europe. In recent months, Mr. Pfeffer has been negotiating agreements with European chains. In exchange for franchise fees, the Europeans will become part of an international brand and expect to benefit from HFS's global marketing muscle.
Mr. Pfeffer, in an interview, said that HFS, which has only 6 percent of its hotels outside the United States, expects to conclude agreements by the end of this year for two of its brands in at least 10 European countries. The agreements, he said, would help HFS "advance toward our goal of having 1,000 hotels outside the United States by the year 2000.
"The fruits of our efforts are now paying off," he said.
The Americans are not just aiming for the mass market, either. ITT's Sheraton unit, long a presence in Europe, controls the gilded Compagnia Italiana Generale Alberghi that boasts such jewels as the Ritz in Madrid and Des Bains on the Venice Lido. And in June, the American investor Asher B. Edelman surprised the hotel industry by offering $630 million for the French Societe du Louvre Group, which owns the fabled Le Crillon on the Place de la Concorde in Paris.
The European hotel business has become "very attractive" to American investors, Mr. Edelman said by phone from New York. "Luxury is being substantially reborn; tourism and business travel have picked up substantially. And it's helped by the weakness of European currencies."
Furthermore, with European independents in need of global reservation links, American providers of franchising and booking services are having a field day signing up new customers. The American companies are not only bringing their names and technology, but are also changing in subtle ways the way the Europeans run their hotels, stressing consistency of service on a continent where you might find the sheets turned down one night but not the next, and introducing American-style quality controls.
To be sure, one of the attractions of Europe for American tourists has always been the charm of its old hotels, with their creaky elevators and dark wood armoires and polished-brass bathroom fixtures, in contrast to the cookie-cutter plastic look back home.
Even so, the shakeout in the European hotel industry bestows undeniable benefits on American travelers. The increased competition has helped keep rates down. And the spread of American-style chains has cut costs further by providing the sort of creature comforts and services that in years past could be counted on only in luxury hotels.
Neil C. Longhurst, an American executive with the Ford Motor Company in Spain, says he now routinely checks into budget hotels in Europe. "I sleep there, and that's it," he said. When he ventures into more opulent settings, he says, he thinks to himself, "That's nice, but I don't need it."
For all the influence of the American chains, the Europeans insist they are not about to become Yankee clones. For one thing, they say, regional differences on the Continent are too great to allow the uniformity of style and service that is possible in the United States.
That is why Mr. Escarrer split Sol Melia, which operates 215 hotels in 25 countries (including the United States), into five geographical divisions. "At many levels, I am very Americanized, like the Americanization of our management style, with bottom-up communications," he said. "Having said that, our style remains for sure not American, though not Spanish, either."
A Sol Melia hotel in Brussels may have a Spanish restaurant, yet the style of the hotel remains distinctively Belgian, he said. "In Latin America, we are Mexican, we are Brazilian, we are Costa Rican. We may give a hotel some Spanish flavor, but there will be more local flavor than Spanish, and for sure not American."

Charts: "More American Service in Europe"
United States hotel chains have become big presences throughout Europe, and a competitive threat to Europe's hoteliers. Chart lists hoteliers (Marriott, Radisson, Holiday Inn, & Sheraton) and european countries (Britian, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, & Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) along with the number of hotels owned by each hotelier in each country.

"Fewer Rooms, but More Affordable"
A revival of tourism across Europe has increased the occupancy rates of many European hotels. But that has not led to higher room rates; increased competition has driven many rates down in dollar terms. Here are figures for selected European cities.

HEADLINE: Virginia A. Dwyer, 76, Former AT&T Executive

 BODY:
Virginia A. Dwyer, a former senior vice president for finance at the AT&T Corporation and one of the first women to gain a top position at a major American company, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. Miss Dwyer, a resident of Manhattan, was 76.
The cause of death was cancer, her brother, Jack, said. 
 Miss Dwyer spent her entire 43-year career at AT&T, starting as a clerk and rising to vice president and treasurer in 1979. In that capacity, she directed the company's stock and bond financing, at the time second in size only to the Federal Government's money-raising operations. Miss Dwyer was also responsible for three of the largest corporate stock offerings -- each exceeding $1 billion. In 1984, she was named senior vice president for finance.
After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, Miss Dwyer was also responsible for planning the stock distribution for the seven regional telephone companies that resulted. When she retired in 1986, Miss Dwyer was the highest-ranking woman ever at the company.
She was the first chairwoman of the board of trustees at the University of Rochester in New York.
In 1943, Miss Dwyer graduated from the University of Rochester with a bachelor's degree in economics and worked in New York City as a statistical clerk for Western Electric, an AT&T manufacturing subsidiary. In 1953 Miss Dwyer received a master's degree in economics at New York University and became chief economist at Western Electric in 1972. She moved to the parent company as assistant treasurer three years later.
She is survived by a sister, Marie Buley of Seaford, N.Y.; her brother, of Naples, Fla.; 8 nieces and nephews, and 13 great-nieces and great-nephews.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Jump 1.3% On Big Electronics Demand

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Orders placed with factories increased 1.3 percent in August, helped by the strongest rise in demand for electronic components in almost four decades, the Commerce Department said today.
The increase, which was near analysts' expectations, was the third consecutive monthly gain. The Commerce Department revised July's rise upward today, to half a percent from the two-tenths of 1 percent reported initially. 
 Inventories increased four-tenths of 1 percent in August, the same as in July.
The August data for factory orders were released one day after the National Association of Purchasing Management said manufacturing growth as measured by its index slowed for the second consecutive month in September. A slowdown in orders, production and exports contributed to September's decline in the index.
Some of that weakness could reflect economic problems in Japan and Southeast Asia. Weaker Asian demand for American products could be "the greatest vulnerability of the U.S. economy," said Paul Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
As for factory orders, economists caution that it is difficult to discern trends from month-to-month shifts in the data, which are heavily influenced by large changes in orders for commercial jetliners and military weapons.
Today's report showed that orders outside of the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment increased eight-tenths of 1 percent during August. Excluding the military industry, factory orders rose 1.3 percent.
Orders for durable goods, which are made to last three or more years, advanced 2.7 percent, with demand for electronic equipment and aircraft accounting for the bulk of the increase. Orders for electronic components jumped 76.9 percent in August, the largest increase since February 1960.
Orders for nondurable goods like food and clothing decreased four-tenths of 1 percent in August, the first drop since May.
Manufacturers' shipments, a gauge of current demand, fell eight-tenths of 1 percent. Unfilled factory orders, a measure of pent-up demand, increased 1 percent.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of first-time jobless claims filed last week increased by 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 308,000, in line with analysts' expectations. The decline in claims during the previous week was revised to 1,000 from the 2,000 initially reported.
The four-week average for new jobless claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, fell to 308,750, from 313,000 the previous week.
A low level of initial jobless claims, coupled with a low four-week moving average, "is consistent with solid job growth," said Cary Leahey, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. He said he expected "big numbers" on Friday when the Labor Department releases its September employment report. Analysts expect the data to show a large gain in payrolls following the return of about 185,000 striking workers at United Parcel Service.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Surge in Lower East Side Apartments

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Manhattan's strong residential market is having a ripple effect on the Lower East Side, where property owners are renovating into rental apartments the upper floors of older buildings, floors that for decades were empty or used for storage, and new housing is springing up on empty lots.
The activity, which started about a year ago, reflects that this neighborhood east of SoHo, long home to immigrants and known for its bargain shopping, is becoming a less expensive alternative to such areas as SoHo, TriBeCa and Greenwich Village, brokers said. 
 Along Orchard Street -- between East Houston and Hester Streets, and the side blocks in between -- the upper floors of 10 five-story buildings dating from the 1860's have been refurbished, creating 100 studio and one-bedroom market-rate rentals. Also, 20 more structures, with 200 more rentals, are under construction or planned. The activity is also spreading eastward onto other blocks, where conversions as well as new construction projects are at various stages of development or planning. Two weeks ago, the Zucker Organization of Manhattan, for example, broke ground for a new market-rate rental building with just under 100 apartments on Second Avenue, between Avenues B and C.
And Asian Americans for Equality, a nonprofit housing and economic development organization long active in the neighborhood, has three new projects planned that would create close to 100 1ow- to moderate-income residences, said Julio Colon, its deputy executive director.
All told, the projects could produce close to 1,000 market-rate and mixed-income residences, most of them rentals, said Sion Misrahi, who runs a real estate firm on Rivington Street bearing his name. "With every other nook and cranny spoken for in Manhattan," he said, "this is the last frontier for reasonably priced real estate."
Martha Danziger, district manager of Community Board 3, which guides growth in the area, said, "Yes, the activity is positive because having the upper floors of buildings empty or even used as storage is not a sign of health."
It has also brought mixed-income residences to an area that has its share of low-income housing, and it has not resulted in widespread displacement, some community leaders and real estate executives said. But others are concerned that as empty buildings become harder to find, rents will rise, forcing out low-income residents.
The story of how the residential floors became vacant began in the 1920's with the passage of Federal restrictions limiting the number of immigrants to the United States, and later the enactment of a New York State law requiring modernization of the apartments, including fireproofing and the installation of toilets within each apartment.
"The lack of demand and added cost convinced a lot of people to discontinue renting the residential floors," said Stephen H. Long, director of the study center of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. In the years since, the residential real estate market -- even during the mid-1980's building boom -- had not filtered into the Lower East Side.
Fueling the activity in recent months are the climbing rents for apartments elsewhere in Manhattan and the improving image of the neighborhood. Increased police presence over the last few years has curtailed prostitution and drug sales, and the formation of the Lower East Side Business Improvement District five years ago has helped to reverse the decline of small businesses and to stabilize the area.
Another factor is that new restaurants, shops and retail outlets, including Tahari and Kenar, which sell women's clothing, also have opened in recent years. So have bars, performance spaces and clubs, but so many that Community Board 3 is discussing ways to cap their number to avoid saturation. The business improvement district is also encouraging those that serve food to open during the day "to bridge the day and nighttime traffic in the neighborhood," said Matthew A. Bauer, its executive director.
Rents in the neighborhood have risen. Newly renovated one-bedroom apartments with 450 to 550 square feet rent for $1,195 to $1,295 a month, and two-bedroom units with 700 to 800 square feet go for $1,695 to $1,995, Mr. Misrahi said. One-bedroom apartments in established areas like Greenwich Village and the Upper East and West Sides, for example, rent on average for $1,695 to $2,295 a month, according to Mr. Misrahi.
Tenants moving into the area are mostly young single professionals and couples. One is Eric Brothers, 22, who recently graduated from New York University and works for a company in the financial district.
"Its an up-and-coming area," said Mr. Brothers, who also is a guitarist for a band called Burt Waters. "It's different and has a lot of bars and places to hang out in." So in June, he rented a one-bedroom apartment at 175 Orchard Street. "Compared to the tiny spaces at ridiculous rents I was finding, this apartment is pretty good for the money," he said.
The renovation at 175 Orchard Street was done by the property owner, Shimon Avadi. He also runs Shulie's, a women's clothing store, and a Tahari outlet in the building's ground-floor retail space.
"With uptown rents going crazy and apartments in short supply, it made common sense," Mr. Avadi said of renovating the building. The $500,000 project, completed last November, created 15 one-bedroom units and one studio. They range in size from 400 to 500 square feet and in monthly rent from $950 to $1,200. All are leased, Mr. Avadi said.

HEADLINE: In August, Fed Had Concern On Labor Cost

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided unanimously to hold interest rates steady at their Aug. 19 meeting but expressed concern about rising labor and health care costs.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10 to 0 to leave its target for the Federal funds rate on overnight loans at 5.50 percent, minutes of the session showed today. They also showed that the committee maintained a bias toward raising the Fed funds target if needed to guard against accelerating prices. 
 "The members remained concerned about the outlook for inflation," the minutes read. "Some signs were beginning to emerge that wages and other labor costs might be experiencing increasing pressure."
At its latest meeting Tuesday, the policy-making committee again refrained from altering monetary policy. Consumer prices are rising at the slowest pace since 1996 even as the economy expands and the jobless rate hovers below 5 percent.
Minutes of this week's session will be available Nov. 13, after the Nov. 12 committee meeting. The committee meets eight times a year and the minutes are released several weeks later.
The committee last raised the Fed funds target a quarter-point on March 25, expressing concern that the economy's rapid growth could translate into accelerating inflation. Since then, inflation slowed even as the economy expanded at a rapid pace.
At the August meeting, committee members viewed the two-week strike against United Parcel Service of America as a possible "harbinger of more militant labor negotiating attitudes," the minutes showed.
Committee members also expressed concern about what they called anecdotal evidence of a "less benign outlook for health care costs."
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has suggested that labor costs have been suppressed by a general tendency of workers to be more concerned with job security than wages. Medical costs have been restrained by the trend toward managed care.

HEADLINE: Safety Standards for Imported Food

 BODY:
Global trade allows Americans to satisfy their appetites for strawberries in spring, apples in midsummer and asparagus in autumn. Last year 38 percent of fruits and 12 percent of vegetables consumed here came from foreign fields. But getting fresh produce year round also means that consumers are exposed to foreign food production systems that may not be well regulated. Although the vast majority of the 30 billion tons of food imported annually is wholesome, recent incidents of illness caused by tainted Guatemalan raspberries and E. coli-contaminated domestic meat and fruit juices have made food safety a public concern.
Yet even as food imports have doubled since the 1980's, Federal health inspections of imports have been cut in half. Since the Food and Drug Administration samples less than 1 percent of food imports at the docks, tainted food can easily reach consumers undetected. 
 In a sensible effort to tighten food safeguards, President Clinton asked Congress yesterday to give the F.D.A. power to halt imports of fruits, vegetables and other food products from countries that do not maintain food safety standards equivalent to those in the United States. That would give the agency the same authority that the Department of Agriculture has long exercised over imports of meat and poultry. Monitoring the agricultural and food handling practices in exporting nations will be far more effective than random checks at the border. The Administration will seek $24 million in 1999 to send F.D.A. inspectors abroad.
The President is also asking government agencies and representatives of the agricultural sector to draft standards of good agricultural practices, such as keeping latrines away from vegetable fields and screening food workers for hepatitis, to guide both domestic and foreign growers.
Foreign producers are already denouncing the plan as an unfair trade barrier. But there is no reason to believe that asparagus growers in Mexico will be asked to live by higher standards than growers in Washington State. In the long run, Federal efforts to bolster consumer confidence in the wholesomeness of imported food will help the American appetite for foreign produce grow.

HEADLINE: Anheuser-Busch Queried On Distribution Practices

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
The Justice Department is investigating whether Anheuser-Busch Inc. has been using its enormous muscle to squeeze smaller competitors out of the beer market.
Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser beer, said the Justice Department was looking into its marketing and distribution practices. Competitors, particularly microbrewers, contend that Anheuser-Busch, the industry leader, has been trying to keep their brands off of store shelves. 
 The investigation, they said, centered on Anheuser-Busch's practice of enticing beer distributors to agree to exclusivity contracts and a program that offered them cash incentives to do so.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that an investigation into industry practices was under way but added that she could not comment on specific targets of a continuing inquiry.
Anheuser-Busch, which is based in St. Louis and has a 45 percent share of the United States market, said it was notified yesterday that it was the subject of an investigation and said it intended to cooperate fully.
"We are confident that all our practices are entirely legitimate and legal," said Royce Estes, vice president of corporate law at Anheuser-Busch.
At issue is the company's practice of granting wholesalers exclusive rights to distribute its beer in a given area in return for an agreement not to do business with Anheuser-Busch competitors. "Because we are completely reliant on them for product distribution, we have put in place incentives to encourage the sale and distribution of our products," Mr. Estes said. "This is a common business practice. Participation in these programs is voluntary."
Several analysts said that the inquiry, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, would probably have little effect on the company and that the Justice Department would have difficulty building a case against the beer maker.
"There are other distributors in the marketplace that aren't Anheuser-Busch distributors, so if microbrewers want to get their products to market they have other options," said Skip Carpenter, an industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "I think it would be a very tough case to prove."
While Anheuser-Busch maintained that the distribution program was voluntary, critics said it applied pressure to persuade distributors not to carry other brands. Nonetheless, because of the strength of Anheuser-Busch's brands, wholesalers might have little financial incentive to deal with lesser-known brewers anyway.
"If you're a wholesaler, you've been very successful with them and you know what their resources are," said George Thompson, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "You've seen them build several brands very successfully. It's probably not, for the most part, the wholesalers that have any particular complaint about the policy."
Yet several small breweries have filed lawsuits against the company to challenge its sales and marketing tactics. Advocates for small beer makers say Anheuser-Busch's practices are clearly intended to eliminate weaker competitors, which raises antitrust issues, they said.
"The distributors are supposed to be independent," said Doug Green, an economics professor at San Jose State University, who is also a consultant to microbrewers. "What they are doing is exercising their power over them. As long as they are supposed to be independent, then exclusive dealing is something that needs to be looked into as an antitrust matter."

HEADLINE: PCS to Expand Drug-Claim Role

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 2

 BODY:
Eli Lilly & Company's PCS Health Systems unit agreed today to administer pharmacy claims for 5.9 million health plan members of Humana Inc., as PCS seeks to increase its mail-order business.
The agreement calls for PCS to handle 30 million prescriptions annually for an undisclosed amount through the year 2000. PCS, based here, currently oversees about 300 million prescriptions a year valued at around $10 billion. 
 Humana said the accord was expected to cut costs and help improve its pharmacy service by using PCS's technology and economies of scale. The move comes after Lilly took a $2.4 billion charge in the second quarter to write down the value of PCS.
Some of the 30 million prescriptions will be processed through PCS's mail-order operation in Fort Worth. That will let PCS druggists fill the prescriptions and have more contact with doctors, which industry analysts said was expected to result in more sales of Lilly drugs. The move comes, though, as PCS is being watched by the Federal Trade Commission to insure that it does not favor Eli Lilly drugs over those of competitors.

HEADLINE: Car Makers Voice Complaints About Limiting Gas Emissions

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
President Clinton met this evening with the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler to promote his trade policies, but received instead an earful of complaints about the Administration's interest in limiting emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming.
The White House held the meeting the day after threatening South Korea with trade sanctions if it did not remove auto import limits. But the auto executives were more worried about the Administration's stance on global warming for a United Nations conference in December, and took the opportunity this evening to tell the President just what they thought. 
 Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, was particularly critical of the Administration for considering legally binding limits instead of voluntary targets. "That would be bad for the auto industry in terms of jobs and the economic vitality of this country," he told reporters outside the West entrance to the White House after the meeting.
Stephen Yokich, the president of the 800,000-member United Automobile Workers union, joined the Big Three executives at today's meeting and expressed misgivings afterward about possible moves to limit emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming. Auto exhaust has been linked to this greenhouse effect.
"We're taking a hard look at it because it is our jobs that are concerned," Mr. Yokich said.
While the Administration has not yet made specific proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the possibilities include higher taxes on gasoline or tighter fuel economy requirements for new vehicles. The auto makers make most of their profits on big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that might not meet tighter fuel economy standards unless fewer are sold or the vehicles are redesigned in smaller versions at considerable cost.
Mr. Trotman contended that if the United States did accept binding limits on emissions of gases that contribute to global warming, only American companies would be forced to comply because legal systems and public pressures are weaker in some foreign countries. The American auto makers also fear that the more lenient rules being drafted for 132 developing countries, including South Korea, would give an advantage to manufacturers in those countries and might create an incentive for them to move factories overseas.
"There will be an incentive to move plants," said Mr. Trotman, who stopped short of threatening to move Ford factories abroad.

HEADLINE: Messinger Ad Strikes Back at Giuliani Over a Commercial on Sex Businesses

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger released a new television advertisement yesterday in an effort to rebut a Giuliani campaign commercial that she says distorts her position on sex businesses in New York City. Her ad accuses the Mayor of using "false quotes" and of "throwing garbage."
About a week ago, Ms. Messinger called on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to withdraw the commercial in which an announcer says twice that the Democratic mayoral candidate once said that "sex businesses give New York character." But the Republican Mayor's campaign has continued to run the ad, prompting Ms. Messinger to respond directly to the allegation with her own commercial. 
 Ms. Messinger's new advertisement begins with her seated next to a television set. After the screen of the set displays the Giuliani ad in question, Ms. Messinger quickly turns the television off with a remote control.
"Isn't this just what you'd expect from Rudy Giuliani?" Ms. Messinger says calmly in her ad. "False quotes. Absurd accusations. Garbage. Rudy Giuliani may not want to talk about the city's future, but I do." The commercial goes on to outline the issues that she has focused on during her campaign -- overcrowded schools, domestic violence, unemployment and homelessness.
Ms. Messinger's new ad prompted another round of fingerpointing from both mayoral campaign offices, with each side accusing the other of starting the negative campaigning.
"Until last week, we were running our 'why I want to be mayor ad,' " said Leland T. Jones, spokesman for Ms. Messinger. "But the Mayor went up with his nasty ad, and it was important to respond to his garbage. We had to get the record straight."
In a statement, Fran Reiter, the Giuliani campaign manager, said: "For six months, Ruth Messinger has run a singularly ugly and negative campaign seeking to demonize Mayor Rudy Giuliani while refusing to say anything about who she really is and what she really stands for. This commercial is simply the latest demonstration of Ruth running away from her record."
Mr. Giuliani's aides have not been able to provide direct proof that Ms. Messinger had made the remark about sex shops.
Ms. Messinger also filed a Federal lawsuit yesterday against the City University for what she described as a violation of her First Amendment rights by CUNY. Since September, she has complained that CUNY officials have illegally barred her from speaking on Oct. 14 at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn.
In her lawsuit, she has asked the court to issue an order that would require the university to stop enforcing a policy that forbids candidates to speak at City University campuses unless their opponents are invited to attend. An employee with the City University's public affairs office said no official was available yesterday to comment on the suit.
City University officials have said that allowing Ms. Messinger to speak without extending a similar invitation to Mr. Giuliani could jeopardize the university's tax-exempt status. Federal tax laws prohibit nonprofit institutions like schools and churches from supporting candidates, from lobbying politicians or from otherwise engaging in political activity.
But visits to City University campuses have been common for many candidates during campaigns. Mr. Giuliani has made such visits both as the Mayor and as a mayoral candidate, and Ms. Messinger has spoken on City University campuses at least three times in this year's campaign.
"We hope the court moves quickly on this and hands down a decision before the invitation date that we have to speak at Kingsborough," Mr. Jones, the Messinger campaign spokesman, said. "We intend to be there on Oct. 14."

HEADLINE: French Oil Official Asks If U.S. Law Reaches Iran

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 2

 BODY:
One of the warmest memories of Thierry Desmarest, chairman of the French oil company Total S.A., came when, fresh out of France's finest schools, he was on his own managing a mine in New Caledonia.
"I was 18,000 kilometers away from my immediate superior with no faxes and telephone connections -- it was fantastic!" he said. 
 Last Sunday he realized how far he had come when he went to Teheran and signed a $2 billion agreement to develop one of Iran's largest natural gas fields. The deal brought a firestorm of criticism from the United States, which says Iran supports terrorism, but drew praise from the French Government.
Since then the faxes, phones and telegrams have poured in, many of them, the company says, with support from around the world, including some from American oil executives. Few adopted the official United States view that the deal violates an American anti-terrorism law and could subject Total to economic sanctions.
"To say the incremental share of our project in a country already producing 3.6 million barrels of oil a day will help finance terrorism while the country already possesses huge revenues from its hydrocarbon exports is absurd," Mr. Desmarest said this afternoon in his offices atop a 30-story tower on the outskirts of Paris.
"I never practicsed politics, but it seems to me the concept of extraterritoriality is not compatible with our day and age," he added.
A courteous 51-year-old whose main strength is never to show emotion, Mr. Desmarest seemed unable to suppress a smile as he said, "It was, I believe, Ms. Albright who said politics, after all, is part principles and part pragmatism."'
This was a sarcastic reference to an earlier statement by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright explaining why Washington does not place sanctions on China but has no qualms advocating them for Myanmar, when both countries are accused of violating human rights.
Ever since the agreement was signed to develop the South Pars natural gas field with Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia, Mr. Desmarest has been caught in a fight between two traditional allies.
For its part, the European Union has threatened a trade war if the United States acts on what much of the world regards as imposing American law on sovereign nations.
"We will respect all legislation applied by the United Nations, France or international law," he said. "But we are under no obligation to apply an American law produced by a domestic lobby for narrow interests."
His remarks reflect a common view among international oil executives. Faced with a looming shortage of oil, major producers are scouring the globe for production possibilities and chafe at restrictions imposed by the United States.
Executives from major American oil companies argue that sanctions rarely force governments to change their policies, and that Americans are shut out of projects in some of the most promising areas as rivals like Total sew up lucrative deals.
"We cannot isolate ourselves from half of the world's oil and gas reserves and believe that it does not have a negative impact on the United States," said Archie W. Dunham, president and chief executive of Conoco.
At Total, Mr. Desmarest's shy manner, his gray suits and his aristocratic air, the hallmark of graduates of the "grandes ecoles," have earned him the nickname Little Prince. But Mr. Desmarest, a mining engineer who became chairman and chief executive in 1995, is also known as the "central computer," a manager with a finely honed mind who forgets nothing, analyzes everything and moves audaciously.
He confesses that he was taken aback by the American reaction. "I was surprised by the magnitude of the coverage," he said.
The confrontation was long in coming. European Union members who do a lot of business with Iran and Libya have long opposed American laws with extraterritorial dimensions: written in the United States but meant to affect trade beyond American borders. There is little question that France, Russia and the European Union knew, as one senior French foreign affairs official put it today, "they were opening the abscess" with the Iranian move.
Mr. Desmarest does not say quite that, but his feelings about the law are barely disguised.
"We operate in 100 countries," he said. "In all these countries we make sure our operations are clean. We pay proper wages and treat people decently. But it is not our job to change the governments or impose policy."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Wolves May Be Limited By Garnett's Contract

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
On the surface, Kevin Garnett was back in good graces with Ned and Mabel from Mankato. The throng of Minnesota Timberwolves fans who had turned on him over the summer were delighted to see their Kevie sign with the home team -- for more than $125 million over six seasons.
The 21-year-old Garnett -- a reclusive holdout all summer who turned down $103 million in August -- played blackjack to the nth power and won, with a roughly $21 million annual salary. And one of the National Basketball Association's small-market teams warded off a maddening fear of free agency, of losing its All-Star forward to Chicago or some other ridiculously rich franchise. 
 But the reality of buying your dream house usually hits after the down payment. And the Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor, was talking about a potential six-year diet of rice and beans yesterday. By agreeing to the richest multiyear deal in team sports, the franchise must now find a way to keep its burgeoning playoff team together.
With the point guard Stephon Marbury eligible for a contract extension next July and the All-Star forward Tom Gugliotta able to exercise an option-out clause in his deal next summer, a good measure of imagination will be sorely needed.
"All I can say is, three to four years, yes, we can run profitably," Taylor said. "But five, six and seven years from now, I don't know. We may have to get by getting more minimum-salaried type players. Unless some things happen that I don't know about right now, it's going to be difficult."
The flip side is that Taylor, with his deep pockets, has shown an extraordinary commitment, one that Garnett's agent, Eric Fleisher, feels will become a lightning rod for other players.
"I think everybody got what they wanted," Fleisher said.
"The deal was structured in such a way that some of those things could be permitted down the road," he said, a reference to larger salary payments in later years. "I believe certain franchises have created an atmosphere where players want to play. And I think Minnesota has done that."
The 6-foot-11-inch Garnett signed a contract that was front-loaded in order to create salary-cap room for future signings. But it is not too difficult to do the math and realize the potential problems. At $5.5 million a year, Gugliotta was the team's highest-paid player. Marbury, the schoolboy legend from Brooklyn who has been darting past the league's best point guards at 20, will be highly sought.
Even if both players are somehow compensated by Minnesota, what kind of money will be left to lure a key role player who could push the Timberwolves into title contention? The lone hope may rest in the owners' possibly re-opening the collective bargaining agreement next spring to change the league's economics.
For an owner such as Taylor, who paid $88 million for the entire franchise two years ago, the check writing has only begun. Was it really a good deal?
"Yes and no," Taylor said. "We're happy we got Kevin, but we wanted to pay considerably less. I would say the difference between the first offer we made and the one he took was basically the type of players that will surround him.
"But we're going to be creative. And maybe we can attract some guys that are willing to play for a team like this. I would have never imagined this two years ago. I paid one and a half times for Kevin what I paid for the whole thing. It makes absolutely no sense. But I have a franchise."
And a very rich young star. Garnett, who averaged 17 points and 8 rebounds a game last season, signed a deal that surpasses Shaquille O'Neal's seven-year, $120 million contract signed last summer with the Lakers. O'Neal and Patrick Ewing, who signed a four-year, $68 million pact in July with the Knicks, will make about $4 million less than Garnett in annual salary. Only Michael Jordan's one-year, $33 million contract with Chicago is worth more for one year.
"We sat and talked for about three hours after it was done," Fleisher said. "It was like draft night for him again. No one could imagine this kid out of high school two years ago being picked in the top five. He came out of nowhere. We were both a little numb."

Yeltsin Hints He May Run Again
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin shocked political analysts when he did not rule out the possibility of running for a third term in the elections in 2000. Though Russia's Constitution limits the President to two consecutive terms, after the announcement, pundits began discussing ploys that Mr. Yeltsin could use to circumvent the law. A3
 
New Evidence in Diana's Crash
French investigators have determined that paint found on the Mercedes in which Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed came from a black Fiat Uno that apparently collided with the Mercedes just before it smashed into a tunnel support pillar, officials said. No one has reported having been involved in a collision. But some witnesses told the police they saw another car and a motorcycle weave in front of the Mercedes moments before it crashed. A3

Reno to Expand Gore Inquiry
Attorney General Janet Reno has decided to expand the Justice Department's inquiry of Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising telephone calls, moving to the next phase in the process of deciding whether to seek an independent prosecutor, Government officials said. Her decision is contained in a letter to be sent Friday to House Republicans who have demanded for months that she seek the special counsel and move the investigation outside the Justice Department. While it remains uncertain whether she will ultimately make such a request, her decision takes the Justice Department one step closer to it. A1

HEADLINE: Attacking and Defending The Internet, Yet Again

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
When the authorities said yesterday that the New Jersey teen-ager accused of sexually assaulting and strangling an 11-year-old neighbor was himself the victim of sexual assault by a man he met in an America Online chat room, people on both sides of the Internet debate had the same reaction: not again.
Not again, said those who believe that a spate of highly publicized sexual abuse cases related to the on-line world underscores the need for tougher laws. "This gives further support for the argument that the Internet should not be exempt from the laws that protect kids in every other medium," said Cathy Cleaver, director of legal policy at the Family Research Council. 
 Not again, said those who think that those same cases give people the impression that the on-line world is a nesting ground for deviants. "I think we need some sort of 'Internet Anti-Defamation League,' " wrote Thomas F. Hespos Jr., on an E-mail discussion group called the World Wide Web Artists Consortium.
A chat room is an on-line forum in which people can exchange their typed messages about a particular subject -- say, the Yankees, grunge music or Quentin Tarantino. The "chats" are interactive, which means that if someone in New York types out, "The Yankees will win the World Series," someone in Atlanta could respond instantly, "Don't think so." And then someone from Baltimore could weigh in, with the result being a staccato list of messages.
Most of the conversations are short and rather mundane, but chat rooms are exploding in popularity, partly because people are mesmerized by the prospect of finding likeminded souls out in cyberspace, and partly because people can use a pseudonym -- say, JohnDoe123.
On any given night, America Online alone has perhaps 100,000 people chatting in 19,000 rooms created by both the company and subscribers, said Tricia Primrose, an America Online spokeswoman. Put all the Internet servers together, and there may be 1 million people across the country chatting on a given night, said Kate Delhagen, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
At the same time, that anonymity has been used as a mask by people looking to engage in illicit activities. As a result, most on-line companies offer software tools to prevent children from entering certain chat rooms. The problem is, many parents do not know how to use those tools or do not bother doing it: on America Online, only about a quarter of parents use the software, though that proportion is growing.
In the legal arena, there are two major areas of concern: disseminating explicit information and luring children for sex.
In 1996, President Clinton signed the Communications Decency Act, which sought to prohibit the distribution of indecent material to minors over the Internet. But in June, the United States Supreme Court struck down the law, saying it impinged upon free speech.
It is the solicitation part, though, that is now the primary focus of several lawsuits and state legislation. The Family Research Council believes that tougher laws are required to punish criminal activity somehow enabled by the Internet, Ms. Cleaver said. But the American Civil Liberties Union says that there are already sufficient laws punishing people who try to solicit children -- whether it is using the Internet, the telephone or any other means, said Ann Beeson, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.
If there is one area of consensus, though, it is the sense that more people need to understand that cyberspace is not much different than the real world.
"The on-line world is not immune to people with less than good intentions any more than the off-line world is," said Ms. Primrose of America Online. "The same rules apply: Don't talk to strangers. Don't give out your personal information. And don't agree to meet somebody without telling a parent or going with a parent."

Retail Space Shortage

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The same frenetic real estate market that has made it so hard to find an apartment in New York City is tightening the supply of retail space, too. The number of stores available to rent in Manhattan fell to 1,893 from 2,205 in the first six months of this year, according to a study by Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing, a retail brokerage firm.
The expansion in Manhattan of national chains like Nine and Company, Athlete's Foot and Borders Books and Music, along with a brightened economy, has fueled much of the growth in retailing, said Faith Hope Consolo, senior managing director for Garrick-Aug. 
 During the same period, the average asking rent rose to $61 from $57 per square foot per year.

HEADLINE: America Has a Labor Shortage. Europe Has the Answer.

BYLINE: By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is chief economist of the Deutsche Bank Group.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
One month, the financial markets are bent over backward because the United States economy is supposedly growing too fast. Interest rates are pushed higher. The next month, fresh statistics cool the inflation fever, and the markets calm down.
But what would really turn America's "inflation tango" into something more dangerous would be a broad rise in labor costs. This possibility, which would increase inflationary pressures, seems the main concern of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 Leaving aside the debate about exactly how low the American unemployment rate can fall without fueling inflation, the reality remains that finding talented workers in the American labor market is becoming more difficult.
For a while longer, employers will still be able to draw workers from the ranks of those who until recently were not actively seeking work. Productivity increases have also eased some pressure.
These buffers, though, may not suffice to keep inflation at bay over the long haul. Assuming the American economy keeps growing above 2.75 percent a year, labor will get very scarce -- unless the United States makes more creative use of international labor mobility.
If it can take advantage of this safety valve, I am convinced the United States could have an unemployment rate below 4 percent and still avoid inflation. If the United States doesn't have enough workers, and if low-wage countries like India and China can't provide enough of the highly skilled labor that America needs, then Europe may have the cure.
Though growth forecasts are turning cautiously positive, few analysts predict any meaningful reduction in European unemployment. Europe's pressing need (finding jobs for its people) happily coincides with America's pressing need (finding people for its jobs).
The skills of Europe's work force are particularly well suited to fill this need. Increasingly, the labor shortages threatening the American economy are in the "new collar" occupations -- technically skilled jobs in the manufacturing and service industries that require specialized training, but usually not a college degree.
Europe's labor resources are quite rich in these areas, a result of the huge investment in job training made by the continent's corporate and public sectors. This expertise -- in computer-assisted design and manufacturing, for example -- is an ideal fit for the current needs of American business.
Suppose a grand bargain could be arranged whereby many of Europe's unemployed packed up and moved to greener pastures in the United States?
American immigration laws already have provisions that allow the recruitment of skilled labor abroad, but the administration of the law has been uneven at best. Perhaps all that is needed is for the rules to be interpreted more broadly -- or for American employers to make more creative use of them.
If this strategy works, then American corporations would gain a vast pool of qualified workers, many of whom already speak excellent English. The American people would win as inflation fears caused by low unemployment gradually disappeared, pushing down interest rates for consumer loans and home mortgages. The Europeans would finally find solid jobs, and the European governments could slash unproductive social spending.
Is this a pipe dream? If French or German workers won't move just a few miles to find a job in Europe, how can migration across the Atlantic be a credible option? And can the Europeans live without the long vacations and other fringe benefits they have long felt entitled to?
Yes, many Europeans who were raised in an era of generous benefits tend to be immobile. But there is anecdotal evidence that the situation is changing, particularly among the young and better educated.
 A German newspaper, the Neue Presse, has reported a sharp rise in the number of Germans inquiring at the American Consulate in Frankfurt about the possibility of immigrating to the United States.
Is it even conceivable that American officials would accept a major increase in immigration? With jobs plentiful and American voters increasingly optimistic about their personal financial prospects, perhaps the needs of the American economy will prevail over politics.
And at this moment, Europe's and America's labor needs are a perfect match.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Weaken as Buyers Await Deals

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Call it the car buyer's revenge.
Auto sales slowed in September, and as a result auto makers are expected to announce a new round of rebates and discounted lease deals as they vigorously try to woo more buyers into showrooms. 
 "I wouldn't be surprised if sales pick up again, but only as a result of further incentives," said Nicholas J. Colas, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. "Incentives will rise further if this persists."
For the industry as a whole, sales dropped 3.8 percent in September. Two of Detroit's Big Three auto makers reported their September sales results today. The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 3.7 percent in September, compared with the period a year ago, while the Ford Motor Company said its sales slipped 1.5 percent.
Ford expected its sales to be even worse, and it began offering buyers discounts of $500 to $2,000 yesterday, even on its 1998 models that have just reached showrooms. The 1998 Mercury Villager mini-van, for instance, carries a $2,000 rebate, and it can be financed with a four-year loan at 1 percent interest, far below market rates. Wall Street analysts expect G.M. and Chrysler to announce new rebates as soon as next week.
And that is sweet revenge for those out shopping for a new car. For years and years, manufacturers got away with raising prices with each new model year. But lately, customers have been holding tight to their checkbooks and waiting for cars to go on sale.
As a result, manufacturers dropped many sticker prices on their 1998 models, or at least held price increases below inflation. Apparently, that is not enough for many buyers.
"If it ain't on sale, it doesn't sell well," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "A little incentive goes a long way in this market."
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales, at 15.1 million in September, slowed from its pace earlier this summer. But Wall Street analysts expected the slowdown to be short-lived, and pointed out that September marked the third consecutive month that industry sales topped a healthy 15 million annual pace. "Things are pretty much steady here, and we'll see a better annual rate for October," said David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities.
Perhaps most surprising this month were G.M.'s results, which were stronger than analysts expected and marked the third consecutive month of sales increases. The company's market share reached 33 percent, its highest level since December 1995.
G.M. attributed the stronger sales to the many new models it introduced earlier this year -- including the Pontiac Grand Prix, three new mini-vans and the Chevrolet Malibu. "We've said all along that the new products we introduced in the 1997 model year would fuel momentum and that's happening right now," said Ronald L. Zarrella, G.M.'s North American sales, service and marketing chief.
G.M.'s sales of mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles rose 7.3 percent in September, while its car sales rose 1.3 percent.
While Ford reported an overall sales decline of 1.5 percent last month, analysts had been expecting worse. Ford's truck sales rose 8.3 percent, but the overall results were pulled down by Ford's abysmal car sales, which fell 12.2 percent. Ford said that the weak sales reflected fewer discounted sales to fleet buyers like rental car companies.
Other auto makers reported mixed results in September. Nissan said its sales plummeted 32.5 percent. Mazda said its sales fell 11.1 percent. Volkswagen said its sales dropped 15.2 percent and Jaguar said its sales fell 9.1 percent. The Chrysler Corporation said on Wednesday that its sales declined 14.1 percent in September and Toyota said its sales fell by the same amount.
But many auto makers fared better. Mercedes-Benz sales jumped 75 percent, partly because its new American-built sport utility vehicle is so popular. BMW sales rose 4.8 percent. Hyundai sales climbed 2.5 percent. Porsche sales soared 44.8 percent and Audi sales rose 5.3 percent. Honda sales increased 9.1 percent.
All percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 25 selling days last month but 24 in September 1996.
The Toyota Camry beat out the Ford Taurus in the best-selling car race for the 1997 model year, which ended in September. Toyota sold 385,814 Camrys, while Ford sold 367,496 Tauruses. The nation's best-selling vehicle is the Ford F-Series pickup for the 16th model year in a row. Ford sold 751,492.

HEADLINE: Markets Soar, Then Plunge, On Their Way To Slight Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
For those not watching yesterday, nothing much happened in the bond and stock markets as prices ended a little higher.
But the marginal gains came after a tumultuous day of trading that saw wild swings in prices and interest rates as the bond and stock markets gave up most of their spectacular early gains, which were prompted by weaker-than-expected employment figures. 
 Before the afternoon collapse, the price of the 30-year bond was up almost two points, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, plummeting to 6.16 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 100 points, and other major stock measures were up 1 percent or more.
But then the rallies unwound, with the price of the 30-year bond falling as much as a point and the yield jumping to 6.37 percent. This reversal helped undermine stocks; the Dow fell more than 70 points, and the other indexes gave up most or all of their gains.
While traders and analysts had trouble pinpointing the reason for the retreat, they cited several factors: selling by hedge funds and central banks to take profits on the bond rally; investor worry that interest rates may have fallen too much, and selling by large institutions to take profits in stocks. They also cited a surge in crude oil prices -- and inflation concerns -- as tensions rose between Iran and Iraq and the United States dispatched the aircraft carrier Nimitz to the Persian Gulf.
Traders were also mystified that the September jobs report -- which showed moderating economic growth and no additional wage or inflation pressures -- did not produce a more lasting rally.
"The rejection of this morning's data is baffling to many of us," said Patrick Dimick, a Treasury market analyst with UBS Securities.
Despite the trading frenzy, analysts contended that the economic fundamentals for both stocks and bonds remained positive. And although the day's huge gains were given up, the modest finish seems to support that view, with several key stock indexes at new highs and the yield on the 30-year bond at its lowest since February 1996.
The Dow inched up 11.05 points, to 8,038.58, just 220 points from its record high. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.57 points, to 965.03, a new high, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 13.46 points, to 1,715.87, also a new high. The price of the 30-year bond climbed 7/32, to 101 9/32, as the yield fell to 6.28 percent, from 6.30 percent on Thursday.
The September jobs report, which ignited the early rally, showed an increase in nonfarm payroll jobs of 215,000, well below the forecast of 325,000. But even more surprising, said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, was the tiny 1.1 percent increase in the index of hours worked for the third quarter. The index, he said, was hardly up and indicated that economic growth for the third quarter would be 3 percent or less.
If that is the case, that would be a slowdown from the 4.1 percent pace for the first six months of the year and could put the economy on a moderating course that would allow the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone.
With bonds already soaring by the time the stock market opened, the Dow and other indexes shot up.
But the Dow began to lag behind the other indexes as the indications of slower growth undermined some of its economically sensitive cyclical stocks, including DuPont, which fell 1 13/16, to 60 3/8; Union Carbide, down 9/16, to 47 7/8, and International Paper, down 1/2, to 54 13/16. Stocks that had given recent earnings warnings, like Coca-Cola, also did not fare well in the rally. Coke fell 1/2, to 62 3/8.
"If the economy slows, it is not good for economically sensitive stocks, and the Dow is the most cyclically oriented," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company.
Questions were also being asked in the bond market, traders said, as there seemed to be few buyers at the high bond prices that were reached in the surge after the release of the jobs report at 8:30 A.M. Investors seemed to be assuming that the Fed would never raise interest rates and might even cut rates, said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. Matthew F. Alexy, the chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said there was "sticker shock."
Mr. Dimick of UBS Securities said that the morning euphoria had been further undermined by talk of hedge funds selling five-year notes and central banks selling 10-year notes.
The rise in crude oil prices raised concerns about inflation but also, some analysts said, gave investors an excuse to sell, especially because the stock and bond markets were already reversing direction. The price surge, which had been building all week, came after Iran sent jet fighters on Monday into an area of Iraq used by Iranian opposition groups that is part of the no-flight zone enforced by the United States.
Crude oil for November delivery soared 99 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $22.76 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Feb. 19. It was the biggest one-day gain in prices since March 18. Prices for November crude rose $1.89, or 9 percent, during the week.
"Clearly things in the Middle East frightened the market," said Gail Dudak, chief investment officer at UBS Securities. "I think the reason the market can reverse so quickly is that investors are very nervous because it's very, very richly valued. If the market is cheap, it can sustain a lot of bad news. But if it's richly valued, it can't."
Stocks and bonds may also have been rattled a little by another sharp decline in the value of the dollar against the German mark and other European currencies.
In late trading in New York, the dollar fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 1.7572 German marks, from 1.7728 marks on Thursday. The dollar also dropped against the French franc and the Italian lira. It was little changed against the British pound, dropping to $1.6155 from $1.6160. And the dollar rose against the Japanese yen to 122.03 from 121.65.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Was Modest Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
For a second consecutive month, America's employers have added only modest numbers of new workers to payrolls, the Labor Department said today, releasing September data widely regarded as further evidence that the pace of economic growth is slowing.
The figures also showed that the unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent last month, still near the lowest levels in 23 years and a reflection of the economy's strength. Still, economists said the slowdown in job growth represented a welcome sign for the inflation-wary Federal Reserve. 
 "It's a legitimate indication of a slight cooling," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation.
Investors, seizing on the possibility that the Fed will find it unnecessary to restrain the economy with higher interest rates, initially drove prices sharply higher for bonds and stocks. Much of those gains, however, were relinquished later.
Payroll growth totaled 215,000 jobs last month, far less than the 325,000 expected. Moreover, about three-quarters of the increase represented employees returning to work after the August strike against the United Parcel Service.
That meant the actual number of jobs created last month was about 54,000, a modest increase akin to the 40,000 jobs created in August.
September payrolls were held down partly by a decline of 47,000 in local education jobs that reflected the problems the Labor Department's statisticians are having with school calendars. Support staff, like cafeteria workers, typically leave at the end of the school year and return in the autumn, sometimes taking other jobs in the summer.
One prominent question raised by today's report, the first broad survey of economic performance for the month, was whether the sluggishness in late-summer job growth reflected a slowing of demand for workers or a depletion of the labor pool.
Another possibility, one mentioned by Philip L. Rones of the Labor Department, was that this might be little more than statistical "payback" for a huge increase in jobs, now revised up to 384,000, in July.
Joseph Liro, an analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York, found confirmation of a slowing economy in the latest data, noting that payroll growth averaged 187,000 a month during the third quarter as a whole, down from 206,000 in the spring and 218,000 last winter.
"One thing came through loud and clear," he said. "For now, employment growth is on a downward trend."
But William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business, cited his survey of that group's members showing 25-year highs for hiring plans and hard-to-fill openings to conclude that "job growth may have slowed because there is no one left to hire."
Others expressed skepticism that the labor pool was essentially empty. "If that were the case, we'd be seeing a lot more pressure on wages" and more overtime work, said Eric Green, senior economist at the Paribas investment bank.
The September report showed average hourly earnings had risen 4 cents, or three-tenths of 1 percent, including the effect of a Sept. 1 increase in the minimum wage. Over the last 12 months, earnings have risen 3.6 percent.
The length of the private-sector workweek edged down six minutes last month, while factory hours and overtime were unchanged, though all three measurements remained at high levels.
It is possible, some analysts suggested, that the economy is slowing only temporarily, in response to a large buildup of unsold products during the first half of the year.
"In no way, shape or form does this represent a significant decline in economic activity, just an inventory adjustment, as we expected," said Mickey D. Levy of Nationsbanc Capital Markets in New York.
Manufacturing jobs fell 16,000 in September, mainly reflecting the temporary closing of several automobile plants for inventory adjustment and a sizable job loss in the apparel industry. Factory jobs had gained 48,000 in August.
According to the department's survey of households, the proportion of the unemployed who had quit their last jobs fell sharply in September, to 12.9 percent from 13.7 percent, after rising for much of this year. Although the "job leavers" rate often swings widely from month to month, some analysts said the September result showed that workers were less confident about finding better jobs and thus tended to cling tighter to current ones.
The report pointed up large gains made by adult black men over the last year compared with adult black women. The men's jobless rate has tumbled nearly two percentage points, to 7.8 percent from 9.7, while the women's has eased only to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent.
Alexis Herman, the Secretary of Labor, said in an interview that she had directed that some extra data covering worker education and job skills, currently collected but unpublished, be included in the monthly report beginning in January.
"Not everyone is sharing in this prosperity," she said, pointing to the widening earnings gap between the well trained and the ill trained.
Over all, the household survey found 89,000 fewer people employed in September. But because of a reduction of 13,000 in the labor force, that decline was not enough to raise the unemployment rate from its August level of 4.9 percent. The 4.8 percent rate posted in July matched the lowest level since late 1973.
Regionally, the jobless rate in the Northeast stayed at 5.3 percent last month, while the Midwest showed an increase of three-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.2 percent, and the West was up one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5.7 percent. The South's jobless rate edged down one-tenth of a percentage point, to match the national average of 4.9 percent.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN FINANCE;
Text of the Attorney General's Letter Sent to the House Judiciary Chairman

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Following is the text of a letter from Attorney General Janet Reno to Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, as made public today by the Justice Department:
On Sept. 4, 1997, the Department of Justice received a letter from you and the other 19 majority party members of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives in which you request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible fund-raising violations in connection with the 1996 Presidential campaign. You made that request pursuant to a provision of the Independent Counsel Act (the Act), 28 U.S.C. 592(g)(1), which provides that "a majority of majority party members of the Committee on the Judiciary . . . may request in writing that the Attorney General apply for the appointment of an independent counsel." The Act requires me to respond, setting forth the reasons for my decision on each of the matters with respect to which your request is made. 28 U.S.C. 592(g)(2). 
 With respect to each of the matters mentioned in your letter, I have considered all the information known to me as a result of the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into campaign finance allegations; I have not confined myself to the facts set out in your letter, which are apparently drawn in substantial part from press accounts, and which in some cases are inaccurate or incomplete. You should also know that because many of these matters are the subject of active, ongoing investigation before a grand jury, I am extremely limited in the extent to which I can reveal details concerning these matters. However, I will address each of your identified areas of concern in turn.
With respect to two of the matters mentioned in your letter, I have initiated a "preliminary investigation," as that term is defined in the Independent Counsel Act. The first concerns the allegation involving former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and a $25,000 donation made to a charitable organization by Johnny Chung. The preliminary investigation in that matter began on Sept. 19, 1997. A copy of the notification to the court initiating the preliminary investigation is enclosed.
The second involves allegations that Vice President Al Gore solicited political campaign contributions as defined in the Federal Election Campaign Act (F.E.C.A.) in telephone calls that he made from his White House office. The preliminary investigation in that matter began on Oct. 3, 1997. A copy of the notification to the court initiating the preliminary investigation in that matter is also enclosed.
In each of these cases, I concluded, based upon the results of an initial 30-day inquiry, that a preliminary investigation was necessary. As required by the Act, I will report to you at the end of the preliminary investigation of these matters as to whether or not I have sought appointment of an independent counsel.
With respect to one additional matter identified in your letter -- information indicating that the President may have made phone calls from the White House to solicit political contributions within the meaning of the F.E.C.A. -- I initiated a 30-day initial inquiry pursuant to the provisions of the Act on Sept. 15, 1997. If, at the conclusion of that inquiry, I determine that the information is sufficient to warrant further investigation of whether the President may have violated Federal criminal law, then I will order the initiation of a preliminary investigation into that matter, as well. As required by the Act, I will inform you of my decision at that time.
With respect to the other matters discussed in your letter, I have not initiated a preliminary investigation. If an independent counsel is ultimately appointed with respect to any of the three matters outlined above, I will consider whether these matters, among others, should be referred to the independent counsel as necessary to fully investigate and prosecute the matter on which an independent counsel is sought, or as related to that matter. However, none of them warrants a preliminary investigation pursuant to the Independent Counsel Act.
As you know, matters relating to campaign financing in the 1996 Federal elections are under active investigation by a task force of career Justice Department prosecutors and Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) agents. I recently added to the task force significant numbers of new investigative and attorney personnel. The task force is continuing to pursue the investigation vigorously and diligently. I can assure you that I have given your views and your arguments careful thought, but at this time, I am unable to agree with your view that an independent counsel should be appointed to handle the investigation of those matters not already subject to Independent Counsel Act procedures.
I would like to briefly address your general observations regarding the Independent Counsel Act. I agree that the statute requires that I conduct a preliminary investigation when I find specific and credible evidence that a covered person "may have violated any Federal criminal law." 28 U.S.C. 591(a). This does not, of course, mean that the Act is triggered by speculation or innuendo. Nor is it triggered, as you put it, when it is merely "possible" that a covered person committed a crime; rather, it requires specific and credible information which supports a conclusion that a crime may have been committed. This is the standard that I have consistently applied in making determinations under the Act, and I will continue to do so.
I also agree that I am not permitted under the Act to decline to conduct a preliminary investigation based on a lack of evidence of the required criminal state of mind. That is a correct reading of the Act.
However, I must again correct one misunderstanding of the Act contained in your letter. As I explained in detail in my letter of June 19, 1997, to you, in order to invoke the discretionary clause, it is necessary that I find the potential for an actual conflict of interest, as opposed to the mere appearance of a conflict of interest. The plain language of the Act so requires, and its legislative history could not be more explicit. My testimony, which you quote at length, is inapposite; I was describing the basis for the mandatory provisions of the Act. The portions of my testimony quoted by you in your letter have no application to the discretionary provisions of the Act.
Let me now turn to the specific allegations in your letter. You request that I seek appointment of an independent counsel with respect to five broad areas.
a. Bribery of the President. You identify a number of particular political (and, in one case, nonpolitical) donations or contributions by six different individuals and entities -- Johnny Chung, Ernest Green, Charlie Trie, Lippo Companies, Mark Jimenez and his employees, and residents of Guam -- and you suggest that those donations or contributions were made in exchange for particular official actions by the President. You correctly note that if this suggestion is accurate, these transactions could violate a number of Federal criminal statutes. However, at this time we are aware of no specific and credible evidence -- indeed, we are aware of no evidence whatsoever --indicating that the President may have demanded, sought, received or accepted, or agreed to receive or accept, any of these donations or contributions in quid pro quo exchange for official action, or participated in any criminal conspiracy to do so. Indeed, your letter cites no more than speculation in newspaper articles based on the fact that certain Government actions favorable to a contributor followed or preceded a contribution. However, it would be inappropriate to commence a criminal investigation every time an elected official took action that benefited any contributor, in the absence of actual evidence that there may have been a quid pro quo. We are aware of no such evidence in the matters to which you refer.
Moreover, several of the transactions to which you refer, based on available information, involve mere access to the President or the White House, purportedly obtained by virtue of political donations. The courts that have addressed the issue have held that such access in exchange for political contributions is not an "official act" that can provide the basis for a bribery or extortion prosecution. See United States v. Carpenter, 961 F.2d 824, 827 (Ninth Circuit, 1992) ("granting or denying access to lobbyists based upon levels of campaign contributions is not an 'official act' "). Indeed, one court has focused on the constitutional right to "petition the Government for a redress of grievances" guaranteed by the First Amendment in refusing to find that alleged gifts provided in hopes of access to an elected public official could amount to a scheme to defraud the public of the official honest services:
We do not think that the desire to gain access, by itself, amounts to an intent to influence improperly the legislators' exercise of official duties. The Government points to no legislative duty to provide equal access to all members of the public; and, from a practical standpoint, we doubt one exists. United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 731 (Fourth Circuit, 1996). To the extent that the allegations you have set out suggest simply a decision by an elected politician to provide access to political contributors, we conclude that no Federal violation is suggested.
The campaign financing task force is investigating the circumstances surrounding many of these contributions for other potential violations. Should it develop any evidence that suggests that the President or any other covered person may have participated in any criminal conduct in this regard, I will invoke the procedures of the Act.
b. Unlawful use of Government facilities by the President. You next cite two types of events involving the President that occurred within the White House -- Democratic National Committee coffees and overnight stays by guests in the Lincoln Bedroom --and suggest that these constituted illegal solicitations of political contributions (in violation of 18 U.S.C. 607), or were benefits made possible by Act of Congress provided in exchange for political activity (in violation of 18 U.S.C. 600), or amounted to illegal conversions of Government property (in violation of 18 U.S.C. 641).
Section 607 does not apply to events occurring within the residential areas of the White House, and applies only to solicitation of so-called "hard money" contributions. Many of the events you mention may fail to meet even these preliminary requirements of a section 607 offense. Even more broadly, we are aware of no evidence, and you have directed none to our attention, that would suggest that the President requested or received a contribution within the meaning of the F.E.C.A. from anyone in the course of either the coffees or the overnight visits by his guests. Merely entertaining his supporters in the White House does not constitute a violation of section 607. There are, as you are aware, other difficult legal issues under section 607 as well, but it is sufficient for the moment to discuss only these.
Like the bribery and extortion statutes, section 600 does not apply to providing access in exchange for political contributions; rather, it provides criminal penalties only for promising "any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment or other benefit, provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress" in exchange for political activity. As broad as this statute may be, it does not cover mere access, as you assert. An elected official who decides to provide access to a political supporter is not providing a federally funded benefit such as Federal employment or a Federal contract. We are unaware of any legal precedent or legislative history that would suggest that section 600 is applicable to anything other than the sort of "benefits" expressly set out in the statute.
Section 600 was originally enacted as section 3 of the Federal Hatch Act of 1939, "An act to prevent pernicious political activities." The Hatch Act arose out of extensive hearings by the Congress into political abuses, many of which arose out of the New Deal benefit programs that began during the 1930's, and which are documented in the report by a special Senate Committee, popularly known as the "Sheppard Committee." Senate Report No. 1, 76th Congress., 1st Session. (1939). As is plain from the report, and as reflected in the language of section 600 itself, Congress was concerned with what was found to be widespread coercion of political support from unwilling citizens in exchange for employment, contract benefits, or other benefits flowing from Federal relief programs:
We have heard from the lips of our people who are working on the W.P.A., and those receiving direct relief, that intimidation, threats, and coercion have been exerted upon them respecting their vote at our elections. That in many instances the threat has been made that if the worker, or the recipient of direct relief, did not vote for the party, or the candidates, as requested the worker would be immediately discharged from the W.P.A. and the recipient of direct relief would not receive further assistance. 84 Congressional Record H9604 (daily ed. July 20, 1939)(remarks of Representative Springer).
Thus, based on the language of the statute itself and the legislative history describing the concerns that led to passage of the statute, we conclude that visiting the President in the White House is not a federal program "benefit" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 600.
Finally, you suggest that section 641, the criminal statute barring conversion of government property, was violated by the President when he used the White House for his "private use." The White House is the personal residence of the President, provided to him for his "private use" during his term in office. The mere occupancy and use of the space that has been provided to him as his home is not a criminal theft or conversion of government property. Furthermore, the law recognizes that political events may take place in the White House so long as their costs are reimbursed. 5 U.S.C. 7324(b)(1); 5 C.F.R. 734.503(a). To the extent that any of these events may have occurred in settings or been of a nature that reimbursement of expenses to the Government was required, and to the extent that there may be questions outstanding as to whether appropriate reimbursement was made, we have no evidence that the President played any role in that process or made any decisions concerning whether or how reimbursement should occur.
Thus, the facts known to me at this time do not indicate that the President -- or any other covered person -- violated any of these criminal statutes in connection with these events. If additional facts should come to light warranting a reassessment of that conclusion, I will do so.
c. Tax violations by the Vice President. You next note that the Hsi Lai Temple, in Hacienda Heights, Calif., is a tax-exempt organization and allege that by attending a political fund-raising event at the Temple the Vice President participated in a conspiracy to evade taxes owed by the Temple and to impair the lawful functions of the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.), in violation of 26 U.S.C. 7201 and 18 U.S.C. 371. The task force has been engaged in thoroughly investigating that event, and as a result has gathered considerable information concerning the Vice President's role in it. To date, we have discovered no information that indicates that the Vice President may have violated the laws you cite, or any other law, in connection with the Hsi Lai Temple event. Absent specific and credible information to that effect, I cannot initiate a preliminary investigation under the Independent Counsel Act.
Should a tax-exempt organization engage in activity prohibited by virtue of its tax-exempt status, the violation may lead to revocation of the organization's tax-exempt status and assessment of taxes due. Such matters are within the jurisdiction of the I.R.S. Of course, tax privacy laws mean that we have no knowledge of whether any such process is underway. However, if in conducting any examination involving the Hsi Lai Temple, the I.R.S. determines that the Temple or any individuals may have violated federal criminal tax law, then the I.R.S., using its normal enforcement criteria for referrals, may refer that matter to the Justice Department for further investigation or prosecution. If such a matter implicates a person covered by the Independent Counsel Act, then the preliminary provisions of the Act would be triggered. In any event, we aware of no evidence at this time to suggest that the Vice President was a knowing participant in any conspiracy to violate the nation's tax laws or to obstruct the I.R.S. in its functions.
d. Extortion of campaign contributions by the Vice President. You suggest that the Vice President's solicitations of political donations and contributions constituted illegal extortions or solicitations of a bribe. In order to constitute extortion, a solicitation of political campaign contributions must involve some threat of violence, the wrongful use of a victim's fear that economic harm would result from not providing the funds being solicited, or involve a quid pro quo bribe. 18 U.S.C. 1951(b)(2) (definition of extortion); 18 U.S.C. 872 (extortion by officers or employees of the United States). The Vice President is an elected public official and is entitled to seek the financial support of the public. A mere request by him for the assistance of potential donors is not extortion; nor is it a request for a bribe.
You do not identify any particular instances of threats or other extortionate conduct by the Vice President. The press reports quoted by you, in which anonymous individuals allegedly stated that they "felt pressure," are not sufficient to suggest a violation of law. Should any information come to light that the Vice President may have actually threatened any of the donors whom he allegedly called seeking political contributions, we will, of course, reassess our conclusions under the requirements of the Independent Counsel Act.
e. F.E.C.A. violations by the President and Vice President. Finally, you suggest, in general terms, that an independent counsel must be appointed to investigate the involvement of the President and Vice President in possible illegal conduit contributions and contributions by foreign nationals. You suggest that because the President and the Vice President were closely involved in the fund-raising of the Democratic National Committee, "reasonable people can ask" whether they participated in alleged violations of the law. While the task force is closely scrutinizing allegations of illegal fund-raising, it has to date uncovered no evidence indicating that either the President or the Vice President engaged in conduct constituting a criminal violation of the F.E.C.A. 2. Conflict of Interest -- The Act's Discretionary Provisions.
In addition to your contention that there is specific and credible information suggesting that covered persons may have violated the law, you also renew the argument advanced in your last letter that investigation of any of the campaign financing matters created a potential conflict of interest warranting my use of the discretionary clause under the Independent Counsel Act.
In urging me to conclude that this investigation poses the type of potential conflict of interest contemplated by the Act, you point to the facts that I was appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the President, and that in the past I ran for office as a Democrat. These facts are not by themselves sufficient to establish a conflict of interest with respect to investigations that do not involve alleged criminal conduct by a covered person. As I have noted before, except in extraordinary circumstances not presented by the facts known to us at this time, it is not a conflict of interest for the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of corruption and wrongdoing within the Executive Branch, even at relatively high levels. I cannot accept the suggestion in your letter and from others that merely because some of these allegations involve events that were participated in by the President or Vice President, or involve individuals known to the President or Vice President, or might have an adverse impact on the Democratic Party, there ought to be an independent counsel.
You also allege that in some instances I and the Department have provided to the White House "sensitive information" pertaining to the task force's investigation. I assure you that any such information provided to the White House has been furnished properly pursuant to my national security obligations and has not impinged in any way on the interests of the criminal investigation. My obligation to keep the President informed of matters affecting the national security has not created any conflict with the Department's conduct of the criminal investigation. Moreover, even were an independent counsel to be appointed, I would still retain my responsibility to relay to the President relevant intelligence necessary for him to exercise his responsibility to protect the national security.
You further cite as evidence of a conflict of interest my opposition to Congressional grants of immunity for what you describe as "low-level figures" such as persons who served as conduits for illegal contributions. The decision to confer immunity upon potential criminal defendants is a significant one, and making it without adequate consideration or information can have a damaging impact on criminal investigations, either by depriving the Department of leverage to secure a witness's full cooperation or by immunizing conduct that is more serious than appears. Indeed, in this case, some of the immunized witnesses revealed in their testimony that they were not mere conduits but had also destroyed relevant documents. Accordingly, the Department of Justice has always attempted to consider these decisions carefully. I am confident that an independent counsel would do the same.
As I have previously pointed out to you, there are times when reliance on the discretionary clause is appropriate, and I have done so myself on a few occasions. However, in each of those cases, I considered the particular individuals involved and the particular factual context in which the allegations against those persons arose, and concluded that it would create a potential conflict of interest for the Department of Justice to investigate the matter. Moreover, even after finding the existence of a potential conflict, I must consider whether under all the circumstances discretionary appointment of an independent counsel is appropriate. In each case, therefore, the final decision has been an exercise of my discretion, as provided for under the Act.
I have undertaken the same examination here. Based on the facts as we know them now, I have not concluded that any conflict of interest would ensue from our vigorous and thorough investigation of the allegations contained in your letter.
In conclusion, I assure you, as I have before on numerous instances, that allegations of violations of federal criminal law with respect to campaign financing in the course of the 1996 federal elections will be thoroughly investigated, and, if appropriate, prosecuted. The Task Force continues to review documents and interview witnesses in connection with many of the events discussed in your letter. If at any time in the course of the investigation we are made aware of information that a covered person, or a person as to whom the Department of Justice would have a conflict, may have violated the law I will invoke the appropriate provisions of the Act. But with all due respect for your views to the contrary, at this point it appears to me that -- with the exception only of the three specific allegations which have triggered review under the Independent Counsel Act --these matters should continue to be investigated by the Department of Justice and its career investigators and prosecutors. Should future developments require me to reconsider my decision, I will do so.

HEADLINE: Proposed Rent-Control Increases Put Off

 BODY:
State housing officials have suspended rent increases for about 55,000 rent-controlled apartments in New York City until there is a resolution of a lawsuit filed by landlords trying to preserve the rent increases.
The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Albany earlier this week, asks that the rent increases be imposed despite a law passed by the New York City Council last month that rolled them back by throwing out a disputed method for calculating rents. 
 The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal has sent notices to the tenants, many of whom are elderly, telling them to keep paying their old rents. Notices had already been mailed out detailing the higher rents.
For some, rents could rise by more than $100 a month under the proposed increases. Others could be billed more than $1,000 for back rents for 1996.
Only apartments under rent control, the more restrictive of the city's two forms of rent regulation, would be affected.

HEADLINE: It's a Far Cry From New York

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Even since William P. Bratton, New York's former Police Commissioner, visited Germany this summer to preach a gospel of zero tolerance toward crime, the German authorities have been publicly and divisively pondering a question: will what is called the New York model of combating crime work in Germany's big cities?
For years Germany's inner-city crime figures have been nudging upward. Railroad stations, once the pristine emblems of a prosperous country, have become havens for addicts, beggars, graffiti artists and homeless people. Drugs are peddled openly at Hamburg's main railroad station. In Berlin violent crime rose 15 percent from 1994 to 1996. 
 "What I am worried about is the fear of many citizens that there are lawless areas of our cities," said Franz-Josef Kniola, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state.
Klaus Eisenreich, a spokesman for the police union, said: "A lot of people, especially older people, don't dare go out on the streets at certain times. People don't let their children go out in some areas. The threshhold of violence is much lower." It was his union that invited Mr. Bratton for discussions in Berlin and Hamburg in August.
Today, Germany marked the seventh anniversary of its reunification. But the event has forfeited its onetime euphoria to a sense that this land of 80 million is faring poorly in a painful readjustment: no longer is it the prosperous and protected front-line bastion of the cold war, but a stumbling giant at the heart of Europe, prey to pressures and economic disparities once held in check.
As the German authorities seek to contain the fallout of growing joblessness and of borders open to the much greater economic dislocations of Eastern Europe -- both cited as causes of increased crime -- they also face the problem of combating lawlessness without awakening memories of the Third Reich or of Communist dictatorship.
In the former East German state of Mecklenburg, for instance, the state authorities are seeking to introduce a new law that would give the police much greater powers to question people on the street and gain access to people's personal data. Similar laws are already in force in Hamburg, Bavaria and Brandenburg.
"Where a police law like that comes into force, people no longer live in a state governed by the Constitution," said an opponent, Hans Lisken, a former senior policeman and constitutional expert.
Not only that, the notion of high-profile policing in the New York mold has raised worries among some senior German police officers that more intrusive policing will create what Dieter Schenk, the head of Berlin's plainclothes police force, called an explosive situation among "the underclass and the ethnic minorities" most likely to affected by a "zero tolerance" onslaught.
"Why didn't we have these ideas much earlier?" Mr. Schenk wrote in an article published in the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, referring to the idea of cracking down on aggressive begging, sidewalk drunkenness and other minor crimes, as suggested by Mr. Bratton. "The answer is simple: because it doesn't work as easily as that."
Mr. Schenk said the New York model put increasing pressure on individual police officers to "clean up" their cities, setting in motion a growing confrontation between the police and the public, which he blamed for allegations of widening police brutality in New York.
"The latest reports from New York of police excesses and growing protests confirm that this process of escalation has broken out mightily," he wrote.
By New York standards, the levels of crime in Germany seem modest. The murder rate in Berlin last year was 8.8 per 100,000 residents -- Germany's highest -- compared with New York's 13.4. The 350 robberies per 100,000 residents in Hamburg -- also a German record -- compared with 588 in New York. Rape in Germany was at its highest in Munich, with 16.3 per 100,000, compared with 29 per 100,000 in New York.
But for many Germans, the most telling comparison is not with a distant city across the Atlantic, but with the days before reunification.
"After reunification and the opening of the borders there was a significant increase in crime," said Claus Henning Schapper, a senior official in the Lower Saxony state interior ministry in Hanover. He said in a telephone interview that the authorities there had decided on more aggressive policing, with 200 more officers on foot patrol and an end to tolerating what he termed "bagatelle crime."
He said groups of Albanians and Romanians were responsible for break-ins, an organized market in stolen cars destined for Poland and Russia and a surge in imported organized crime.
Even though statistics show that organized crime peaked in 1993, "people believe our towns are no longer safe," Mr. Schapper said.
"The worst increase is in crime by young people," he added. "There's a lack of jobs and apprenticeships. We can only get rid of this kind of crime by giving people jobs and training."
Indeed, seven years after reunification, joblessness not only stands at record levels for all of Germany -- around 4.4 million, or more than 11 percent -- but the figures show that unemployment in the former East Germany, where Communism once subsidized full employment, is almost double that in the former West Germany.
The sense among many eastern Germans of being outsiders in the west seems almost to have grown.
Joachim Gauck, a former priest in East Germany who now heads an agency in charge of the old East German secret police files, drew comparisons between the mood in eastern Germany today and the mood in West Germany immediately after World War II. Then, he said, some Germans voiced nostalgia for Nazism's "autobahns, jobs and hardly any crime." These days, he said, eastern Germans yearn similarly for "kindergartens, full employment and hardly any crime."
Thus it is barely surprising that Chancellor Helmut Kohl should have identified crime as a central issue in the campaign for the national elections due next year.
In Germany, routine policing is the responsibility of the 16 states. A majority of them are governed by the opposition Social Democrats, making it easy for Mr. Kohl to place responsibility for growing crime on political adversaries.
At the same time, the politicization of crime puts pressure on the local authorities."They always polish the sheriff's star at election time," said Pico Jordan, a leader of the opposition Green Party in Hanover, discussing the decision in Lower Saxony to adopt a "zero tolerance" policy toward petty crime.
"This time, they want to pull out the biggest Colt .45 they can find," he said.

Auto Makers Offering Rebates as Sales Slump
The car industry saw a sales decline of 3.8 percent in September, as two of the Big Three auto makers reported their monthly results yesterday. General Motors said its sales increased 3.7 percent, while Ford Motor said sales slid 1.5 percent. 
 Ford, however, had expected results to be worse, so to revive sales it began offering buyers discounts of $500 to $2,000. The 1998 Mercury Villager mini-van, shown here, carries a $2,000 rebate. Analysts expect G.M. and Chrysler to announce new rebates as soon as next week. D2.
 
Half of BZW on the Block
Barclays, Britain's third-largest banking company, abandoned grand ambitions to build a global investment bank, announcing that the least profitable parts of its BZW subsidiary will be sold. BZW's executive resigned, and Barclays stock fell on the news, reflecting investor disappointment that no buyers had immediately stepped forward. D3.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hones Sales Pitch On Global Warming Pact

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
As it seeks a new treaty to fight the threat of global warming, the Clinton Administration has turned marketing on its head: first comes the sales pitch, and later the product will be unveiled.
Call it publicity or call it education, the results of the campaign that is now reaching full boil could profoundly affect the proposal for controlling climate change that the Administration takes to Kyoto, Japan, in December. There, the nations will try to agree on a binding treaty to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which comes mostly from burning fossil fuels. 
 The Administration wants to broaden its public support before its negotiators present specific targets and timetables for greenhouse gas emissions. The proposals will probably not be the steep and urgent cuts supported by American environmentalists and some foreign nations, but at least a meaningful first step toward someday stabilizing the levels of greenhouse gases that have been relentlessly building up in the atmosphere.
It's a tough sell.
"If anybody tells you this is not a tough issue, they are lying," said Todd Stern, a senior White House aide who is coordinating climate policy. "We have to put together options for the President that are economically viable, that are environmentally viable, and that are politically viable -- both in the international and domestic context."
"We have to stand on the rooftops and scream, because there are those who have a vested interest in not seeing action on climate change," said Kathleen A. McGinty, the chairwoman of the Council on Environmental Quality, referring to powerful opposition to a treaty, led by energy-intensive industries and their labor unions.
Ms. McGinty said the Administration hoped to present details of the United States proposal when international negotiators next met in Bonn later this month.
But even before those details are known, the campaign to build support for it comes to a climax of sorts on Monday when carefully selected greenhouse experts assemble at Georgetown University for a daylong conference.
The meeting is half a conventional policy seminar where ecologists, economists and lobbyists can have their say. But it also resembles a political convention, a chance to put Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in the best possible light as they take on a knotty political problem.
"What I want to do is to deal with the central political problem here," Mr. Clinton told a group of television weather forecasters on Wednesday. "I don't mean political in terms of party politics, I mean political in how the body politic, how our society responds to this."
He also said: "Right now, while the scientists see the train coming through the tunnel, most Americans haven't heard the whistle blowing. They don't sense that it's out there as a big issue. And I really believe as President, you know, one of my most important jobs is to tell the American people what the big issues are that we have to deal with."
To counter the Administration, its critics have mounted a $13 million advertising campaign contending that a treaty binding industrial nations to deep cuts in energy use would be unfair because it would not make the same demands on developing countries. And, they argue, such a treaty would damage the United States economy by imposing energy taxes or other punitive costs on companies that burn fossil fuels.
For its own sales pitch, the White House is deploying many tools of a classic political campaign: stump speeches and photo opportunities, the carefully staged meetings, alliances with advocacy groups, and the nearly daily events, like the meeting with the meteorologists, aimed at reaping free media coverage.
The campaign began shortly after President Clinton, under pressure from environmentalists and European nations to act more aggressively, told the United Nations in June that he would marshal American public support for a treaty.
He assigned Mr. Stern, an experienced White House aide, as a temporary climate "czar" to coordinate the Administration's efforts. Mr. Stern brought additional staff from other agencies to help out, and began laying the groundwork for Monday's high-profile public meeting.
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore also met with small groups of sympathetic business leaders, scientists and environmental advocates.
Cabinet members hit the hustings, giving dozens of speeches to push the Administration's cause.
On Tuesday, for example, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt told the Union of Concerned Scientists, which supports controls on greenhouse gas emissions, that success in the cause "depends on all of us, together, taking up the burden of advocacy."
Indeed, environmental advocacy groups have been working strenuously to influence the press and the public, to mobilize their millions of members, and to persuade the Clinton Administration to call for deeper, faster cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The scientists' group issued a call by about 1,500 scientists, including 102 Nobel laureates, more than half of all the living laureates in the sciences, urging significant cuts by industrial nations in the next few years, followed eventually by limits on the developing world. The statement called global warming "one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future generations."
In a poll conducted in August, before the industry's ad campaign began to air, about three-quarters of registered voters surveyed said they believe that global warming is a serious problem and that a treaty with deep cuts in emissions is needed. The Mellman Group Inc. conducted the poll for the World Wildlife Fund.

HEADLINE: Time for a Real Campaign

 BODY:
In a month, New York City voters will elect the mayor who will lead the city into the next millennium. Right now they have a good idea of how the incumbent, Rudolph Giuliani, has performed over the last four years, but little sense of his vision for the future. His Democratic opponent Ruth Messinger has told them a lot about where she thinks Mr. Giuliani has gone wrong, but much less about how she would run things herself. It is time for both candidates to start talking specifics.
This week Mr. Giuliani did outline what he wants to do in the area that has always been his strong suit -- crime-fighting. The Mayor's ambitious plan for reducing drug sales in city neighborhoods is, in general, a sensible mix of drug treatment, education and tougher enforcement. Ms. Messinger's plan to improve the schools promises better pay for teachers and administrators in return for more efficiency and accountability. 
 That still leaves a whole city worth of issues to be explored. One of the most critical is the unemployment rate, which hovers close to double digits. Another is the city budget, which is nowhere near structural balance. The Mayor has plugged recent gaps with windfall tax revenue but has done nothing to show how he would cover the huge deficits in the future. Both problems haunted the city long before Mr. Giuliani became Mayor. But he has not been able to deliver on his promise to fix them. It is imperative that he tell the city why he thinks he failed, and what new steps he is contemplating.
Ms. Messinger is far from presenting a full-blown program of her own, although her campaign staff promises a major speech on economic issues next week. After a brave early call for increased union productivity, she has not returned to the subject. But she has made some criticisms that Mr. Giuliani should address. One is the difficulty in managing a city work force that is protected by both union and civil service regulation. The city has long been locked in a system in which some workers accept bad conditions and mediocre pay in return for triple-plated job security. It is a losing deal for both sides, and if Mr. Giuliani wants to be known as a real reform Mayor, he will address it.
Both candidates have made promises not to raise taxes, but there are still tax-related issues that need to be addressed in concrete terms. Single-family homeowners get preferential property tax treatment over the owners of apartment co-ops and condominiums. Small and medium-sized businesses are paying more than their share compared with large companies that threaten to leave town if they are not given special treatment. Ms. Messinger has been a critic of the tax abatement program in the past. The campaign would benefit if she defined criteria to govern such tax reductions and challenged Mr. Giuliani to respond.
On the issue of health, Ms. Messinger has vowed that if she is elected she will not sell any of the city hospitals. But she has yet to explain how she would improve them. Given the fact that Mr. Giuliani's own attempt to sell some facilities has failed, he too should talk about what he will do to fix a system he seems to be stuck with.
Ms. Messinger's staff says she agrees "philosophically" with the Mayor on welfare reform, but disagrees with the way he is instituting it. Those disagreements are far from technical, since, unlike Mr. Giuliani, she believes that recipients who are required to work should be allowed to organize and bargain collectively with the city. Ms. Messinger needs to talk much more about what a workfare program would look like in her administration.
Both candidates should give the city a broad vision of how they would plan for the transportation needs of the future. New Yorkers deserve a long conversation about traffic congestion, subway overcrowding in Manhattan and Queens, troubles with the dreadful Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn and the possibility of restoring rail freight service into the city in order to cut truck traffic.
Neither has offered an opinion on how much money taxpayers should put up to keep the Yankees in New York. Both would spend money to keep the team in the Bronx. Ms. Messinger, with some quibbles, opposes subsidizing a stadium in Manhattan. Mr. Giuliani would support a Manhattan site as a last resort. But we need a better sense of how much city money either regards as a reasonable price to retain the team. The fact that Mr. Giuliani is negotiating with the Yankees now makes this delicate. But without information, the public has a right to worry about a December surprise.

HEADLINE: Aggressive Justice System in Jacksonville, Fla., Intervenes to Ward Off Juvenile Crime

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

 BODY:
After hitting a young girl in the head with a brick, 7-year-old Freddie would have had a predictable fate in most cities.
Shuffled through an overburdened juvenile justice system, he would most probably have been sent to see a probation officer a few times. Then, whatever had made him so violent so young would simmer until the next in perhaps a lifetime of violent outbursts. 
 But with his arrest here on charges of aggravated assault, Freddie entered a juvenile justice system that many law-enforcement officials portray as one of the most innovative and comprehensive in the country, one that prosecutes children more aggressively than anywhere else yet also intervenes earlier and more thoughtfully to prevent them from becoming young criminals.
It is in some ways a paradoxical approach, to lock up young people -- and sometimes parents -- at a rate that some might find Draconian and, at the same time, to pay for specially devised social and educational programs.
Inspired by the research of criminologists whose work usually gets no further than academic journals, the system -- actually a series of programs and policies put together by the local prosecutor, Harry Shorstein -- seems to have had striking success.
The premise is the "pre-emptive strike," reaching young people before they commit multiple crimes, and the office has programs intended to reach children at every age level who seem headed for trouble.
For the youngest, like Freddie, Mr. Shorstein convenes meetings with agencies that would not normally share records and, stretching his legal authority if necessary, gets parents to put the children under state supervision in exchange for deferral of court action. Junior high students are taken on tours of jails to hear young inmates talk about the hard life inside. And high school students who commit violent crimes find themselves tried, at a record rate, in adult court. Those convicted serve time in a separate wing of the county jail, where they go through special schooling and counseling.
It is hard to measure precisely what effect the program has had. But juvenile crime, which has dropped across the country in the last two years, fell earlier and far more sharply here. Mr. Shorstein, the State Attorney for the judicial district that encompasses the city, began putting his policies into place in 1993. By 1996, juvenile arrests for murder were down 72 percent, rape down 52 percent, robbery 54 percent, aggravated assault 39 percent and auto theft 58 percent.
David Rasmussen, a professor of economics at Florida State University who has evaluated the program and concluded that it has prevented more than 7,200 crimes, said the secret to its success "is the interrelatedness of the program."
"The whole, I suspect, is much greater than the sum of its parts," Professor Rasmussen said.
By appealing to both law-and-order conservatives and liberals who advocate treatment and education, Mr. Shorstein has largely managed to avoid criticism. But he is not without skeptics.
"Whenever crime goes down, politicians have a tendency to take the credit," said Bill White, the city's chief assistant public defender. "There is no way Harry can know for sure it was his work that brought the arrest rate down."
Mr. White noted that there had at first been some violent incidents and abuse in the juvenile floor of the jail. But he added that he had to give Mr. Shorstein credit.
"His intentions are good, and he is trying some things in a system that doesn't work, that have no statutory authority and no funding from the legislature," he said.
The part of the program that Freddie is involved in deals with the youngest lawbreakers. Criminologists have found that most juvenile crime is committed by a tiny number of young people whose troubles begin as early as age 6 or 7, but given the chaotic state of most juvenile court systems, the authorities usually know little about a child's background and are unable to identify the potentially most dangerous offenders.
What Jacksonville has done to remedy this is surprisingly simple. Each week, representatives of the police, the school board, the state child protective service organization and local hospitals meet under the leadership of Melissa Levy, a psychologist hired by Mr. Shorstein, to share their information about children age 6 to 15 who have committed a crime or had serious trouble at school.
In Freddie's case, with all the available records on him assembled, the group learned that he had been born addicted to drugs and with congenital syphilis to a mother who was a cocaine addict. His mother and father, who were not married, have both been reported for child abuse. Freddie had been required to repeat kindergarten.
With such a troubled background, the group decided, Freddie was likely to continue being delinquent. So the prosecutor's office got Freddie and his mother to sign a contract placing the boy under its supervision for a year, in exchange for a delay in any court action. Under the contract, Freddie must attend school and his mother attend parenting classes. In addition, Freddie receives extra tutoring and counseling to control anger. The family is assigned a volunteer mentor, who can visit the home at any time to monitor Freddie.
Syteria, 15, entered the program a year ago after being arrested on a shoplifting charge and being suspended from school for disciplinary problems.
"Instead of them sending me to jail, they tried to make my life better, visiting me at home," Syteria said. "I like it," she added. "I feel much better about myself. I was just doing stuff to get attention."
The centerpiece of Mr. Shorstein's program has been his aggressive use of a state law that gives prosecutors in Florida the most sweeping discretion of any state to try juveniles in adult criminal court.
In 1993, when he introduced his policy, Mr. Shorstein tried and won convictions against 494 juveniles in adult court, the most of any city in the United States.
But instead of sending those convicted to Florida's juvenile prisons, Mr. Shorstein arranged to keep them in Jacksonville, at the newly built Duval County Jail, where they are all housed on one floor, separate from adult inmates. There, Mr. Shorstein has installed a well-functioning school along with drug and sex education courses and counseling for returning to the outside world. For those who complete their sentences without bad conduct reports, criminal convictions are withheld, enabling them to tell prospective employers they have never been convicted of a crime.
Demetrius Davis, 18, spent 13 months in the jail after being convicted of armed robbery. Once in the jail, away from the distractions of home and his neighborhood, he found it easier to concentrate on his school work, raised his grades to A's and B's, received a high school equivalency degree and is now studying at a community college and working as a stock clerk at a supermarket.
"I thought it was kind of harsh," he said. "But the word is out on the streets. That's why there are fewer kids in the jail."
At one point in 1994, there were as many as 198 young people in the county jail; now there are 74.
In creating the programs, Mr. Shorstein, a 57-year-old former marine, has often acted without explicit legal authority or by stretching his authority.
He issues warrants several times a year for violations of a seldom-used Florida law requiring parents to keep their children in school. Then, often with television news cameras at the ready, he has the parents arrested.
But before the warrants are issued, the parents are given a chance to work things out at hearings run by volunteers who work in Mr. Shorstein's office.
One recent day, Verlean Spellman had been summoned to appear at a hearing with her three children, ages 8, 10 and 11. None of the children had ever been in school and all were illiterate.
After a prolonged argument, Ms. Spellman agreed to sign a contract with the school district to enroll and keep her children in school.
It was a neat legal trick, Mr. Shorstein acknowledged. He did not have the legal authority to force her to sign the contract, but he could enforce it once she did.
Mr. Shorstein, the only elected Democrat in his three-county district, has defied the usual political labels. "I always have to say I'm not a liberal," he said. "That is the nastiest word you can call someone in my circuit."
Mr. Shorstein decided to make juvenile justice his priority soon after he was initially appointed State Attorney to fill a vacancy in 1991, when he was stunned one day to learn that crime by young people had soared 27 percent in Jacksonville in just one year.
"Instead of trying to prevent kids in their prime crime years from committing criminal acts, we spend a disproportionate share of the resources of our criminal justice system on locking people up in their late 20's when they are in the declining years of their criminal careers.
"Three strikes and you're out is the most popular idea in history," Mr. Shorstein said. "But it costs $600,000 to $700,000 to lock a 25-year-old up for life, when he is probably going to stop committing crimes soon anyway, while if you take a 15-year-old and incarcerate him for a year, at a cost of $25,000, you will prevent more crime."
To back his commitment, he has hired assistant state attorneys to specialize in juvenile crime and has used his limited budget to hire psychologists and educators.
Some colleagues question his policies and methods.
"Some other state attorneys in Florida feel Harry is a maverick and a nut, going beyond his legal authority and usurping the jurisdiction of other agencies," said Frank Orlando, a retired juvenile court judge and director of the Center for the Study of Youth Policy at Nova Southeastern University School of Law in Fort Lauderdale. "But at least he is trying out ideas and filling a vacuum."
Under another program that needs little financing or special authority, 25 students who are regarded as severe discipline problems by their schools, and therefore "at risk" of becoming delinquents, are brought to the juvenile court each Friday to witness a trial and then to the jail to talk with the youthful inmates, often their friends or relatives.
William Isom, a tall, heavyset 17-year-old who was convicted of armed robbery, shuffled out in handcuffs and leg irons to talk with the student visitors one recent week.
"I was just chilling with my friends, drinking and smoking some weed, and down robbing people," Mr. Isom recounted. "Everybody was doing it, so I didn't think anything of it."
But now in jail, he said, "I have to get up at 4 A.M. and it's lights out every night at 7, and there's no TV."
Professor Rasmussen has calculated that this program may have averted as many as 1,500 property crimes in three years, though Mr. Isom admitted, to his regret, that it had not deterred him. "I was brought here two years ago, in the same room," he told the group, "but I wasn't listening."

HEADLINE: Making a Dry Report More Interesting

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Edward S. Seeley Jr.'s 49-page report on New York City's economy and transportation system might easily have suffered the fate of so many technical planning studies that emerge from city government -- the ignominy of being unread. The report says that New York's economy is expected to produce more jobs over the next 25 years than its transit system can handle, and that major investments must be made now to capture the potential growth. Planners and economists would find that predicament fascinating.
Mr. Seeley, long a respected voice in the transportation planning world -- he wrote the chapter on New York's transit system for a landmark study in the early 1980's that became part of the blueprint of how the system was refurbished -- was also nearing retirement age. Largely unknown to the general public, he and his work were about to pass from the scene. 
 But Mr. Seeley's boss at the New York City Department of Transportation, Commissioner Christopher R. Lynn, has now pronounced Mr. Seeley's last paper to be a "fake." Mr. Seeley, the commissioner says, is "essentially a clerk," who takes things improperly off other people's desks to write reports on his own time as a "little hobby." Mr. Lynn said his department has authorized no formal examination of how the region's network of rail and roads and subways might limit job growth in the future and that he sees no point in even reading beyond Mr. Seeley's executive summary.
"Because it's unauthorized and because it's a fake and because I haven't asked for it and because it's not on my agenda, it's not worth considering, as far as I am concerned," Mr. Lynn said.
Mr. Seeley, a 64-year-old former deputy assistant commissioner, retired abruptly this week, one day after a reporter called city officials to ask about his report.
In a telephone interview from his home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, Mr. Seeley deflected questions about whether he was forced out of his job, saying he had been intending for some time to retire. Mr. Lynn said he had never met Mr. Seeley and did not know the circumstances of his departure.
But the report, and the questions it raises, have nonetheless opened a window on the workings of this one agency, and the interplay of politics and personality in government that usually remains hidden.
Mr. Lynn conceded that it was possible that the study had been ordered before he came to the department 14 months ago. But the agency that coordinates planning in the region also had no record that the study had been formally ordered.
One transportation expert in New York who was familiar with the report and Mr. Seeley's retirement, but who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said he believed the primary reason for Mr. Lynn's reaction was that spending billions on rapid transit -- and the attendant tax increases that would likely go with it -- was simply not on the agendas of the department, or of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as he runs for a second term.
"The reality is that Ed did this study and they had a nervous breakdown when they realized somebody had read it," the expert said, referring to Mr. Lynn and his top aides.
Mr. Lynn is also no stranger to controversy. Last year, when he was Commissioner of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, he used his office to punish a cabdriver who had given poor service to his domestic partner. As Transportation Commissioner, he was forced to apologize to Manhattan residents after a novel overhaul of traffic flow on the Queensboro Bridge went badly awry, leaving much of the nearby area in gridlock.
Friends and colleagues who have risen to defend Mr. Seeley, including some major planners and transportation experts around the country, say he is an original thinker in his work and a bit of an eccentric in personal style (he wore a blue suit to work for years and told colleagues he had a closet full of identical ones), but fundamentally a gentle man.
"He was a scholar of transportation -- he was the kind of guy you could call up and he would always know everything there was to know about transportation," said Mr. Seeley's supervisor in the 1980's, David Gurin, who is now the planning commissioner for the Toronto region. "In a department where things weren't always eloquently written, Ed's were. He always wrote up his findings in a precise way, and a clear way," Mr. Gurin said. He said that describing Mr. Seeley as a clerk was "obscenely inaccurate."
Mr. Seeley, who also wrote crime novels and had worked as a film maker before taking a job with the city 26 years ago, said he thought the focus should stay on the report itself, not on him.
The report, titled, "The Transportation Implications of Manhattan's Job Growth Potential," says specifically in its introduction that it is not meant to be a statement of city or state policy, but rather an update for the department's long-range planning and is being disseminated in the interests of discussion and "information exchange."
Its core argument is that the New York City metropolitan region has the economic potential of adding about 2.5 million jobs in the next few decades, but that Manhattan in particular -- where many of the new jobs are expected to be created -- does not now have the transportation capacity to seize all of that potential.
The study, using the projections of job growth for New York City that have been accepted by the Metropolitan Transportation Council, a state agency created to coordinate planning in the region, says that routes in and out of Manhattan from the suburbs to the north and the west will have to be expanded, probably using rail, if the jobs are to be captured. That expansion of rapid transit would cost billions of dollars.
That is not a particularly new argument. For example, the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning and research group in Manhattan, said much the same thing in a major planning study of the region issued last year. The association's board was presented with a summary of Mr. Seeley's study last week.
Regina Armstrong -- an economist at Urbanomics, a consulting company in Manhattan that prepared the job projection numbers for the region that became the numerical backbone of Mr. Seeley's study -- also praised his work.
Ms. Armstrong said her main quibble was with her own projections, which have been overtaken by New York's economic growth.The job increase that she had expected by 2000 is now expected in 1998 and 1999, making Mr. Seeley's argument all the more compelling, she said.

HEADLINE: Tropical Forests Are Ravaged by Free Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 27 editorial on Southeast Asia's forests recommends that the United States respond to the deforestation crisis by banning plywood made of tropical hardwood. But such a ban is unlikely because it would be inconsistent with the Administration's goal of free trade. 
 If Congress enacted such a restriction, the United States would face a challenge of "unfair trade practices" from Indonesia in the World Trade Organization. In 1991 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a predecessor to the W.T.O., ruled that the United States could not restrict imports because of the way they are made or harvested.
Your second alternative -- requiring country-of-origin labeling on wood products -- has been challenged by some industry groups and developing countries as a "technical barrier to trade." Must free trade mean that whoever makes products most cheaply, at whatever social cost, wins? Some of us in Congress oppose "fast track" authority for trade legislation unless there are guarantees that labor and environmental issues will be addressed.

HEADLINE: Tropical Forests Are Ravaged by Free Trade;
Labels Won't Work

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Sept. 27 editorial says that to act against the fires caused by deforestation of Southeast Asian forests for production of exported plywood, the United States should either ban plywood made of tropical hardwood or require country-of-origin labeling on wood products "so consumers can refuse to buy them." The first alternative is logical, but the second is not. 
 Country-of-origin laws are based on the idea that some consumers consider origin relevant to purchasing decisions. But consumers may shun, or favor, products from particular countries for many reasons. The reason doesn't matter. No national policy objective is served except that of providing possibly useful information to the consumer. But where there is an independent national policy objective, the proper actions are diplomacy and economic sanctions. Information won't deter buyers who don't know or care about the environment or who buy on the basis of price.
The law already requires that imported products show the country of origin to the consumer. To go further -- for example, requiring labels as to the origin of product ingredients -- could raise questions of legality in the World Trade Organization.
While Government should be encouraged to combat wanton devastation of Asian hardwood forests, passing responsibility off to "informed" consumers is neither effective nor appropriate.

To call for a ban on products from a developing country as you did in your Sept. 27 editorial "Asia's Forest Disaster" will hamper the significant progress Indonesia has made in the management of some of the world's largest forest resources.

HEADLINE: Some Local Cheers for 'Creeping Socialism';
A Few Towns Build Their Own Cable Companies

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: HARLAN, Iowa

 BODY:
In an America where free-enterprise advocates have routed their critics, few people would expect local governments to plunge into competition with the private sector in the fast-evolving information industries. Yet that is what is happening in a growing number of communities.
From old mill towns like Holyoke, Mass., to port cities like Tacoma, Wash., to suburbs like Newnan, Ga., south of Atlanta, voters and local officials are telling their municipal utilities to go ahead and invade private-business turf, starting with the cable-television industry. 
 Residents of these towns are fed up with rising cable rates, lack of local control over programming and the industry's slow pace at upgrading networks, according to utility officials. Increasingly, they also worry about the economic impact of long delays in getting residents and local businesses easy access to high-speed Internet links, inexpensive video-conferencing and other electronic building blocks of economic growth.
"The sentiment is that this is just as important as offering water," said Jeff Strane, a manager at Newnan's utility. "Atlanta is a tier-one city, but things they get there take years to trickle down to Newnan."
The movement seems to be strongest in Iowa. Early this year in Alta, 88 percent of the voters supported the creation of a municipal video and telecommunications network, despite a campaign by the local cable-television company, a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., calling it "creeping socialism." The vote was 91 percent in favor in Spencer, even though the incumbent cable company, Triax Cablevision, outspent proponents 130 to 1. TCI, based in Englewood, Colo., adopted a low profile in the recent election in Muscatine, on the Mississippi River, where the vote was 94 percent in favor of public competition.
"People feel abandoned by large companies that are too busy merging and competing for business in other areas," said Robert Haug, executive director of the Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities.
TCI and other critics warn that
innovations in technology are likely to make investments like Harlan's obsolete long before the debt piled up to finance them can be paid off. They argue that only densely populated cities can generate sufficient electronic traffic for competing video networks. And they say that the local governments will inevitably be drawn into disruptive conflicts over what citizens see on the public network and how they use it.
"When they sell these things to the public, they downplay the risks," said Tom Graves, the spokesman for the Iowa Cable and Telecommunications Association, whose 230 members include the major cable-television operators and telephone companies. In some cases, Mr. Graves said, public utilities enjoy special tax and finance breaks.
Cable companies have responded to the consumer revolt by cutting rates and improving local service. In Harlan, a quiet town of 5,000 surrounded by cornfields, that makes for some lively competition. Harlan spent $3.8 million to build a fiber optic and cable network that passes every home and business. It has signed up more than 1,000 cable customers in its first year, despite TCI's opposition.
Services the town's utility says it might add in the future include local telephone competition for the GTE Corporation, teleconferencing and home-security monitoring.
Despite worries that municipal utilities are out of their depth in information technology, Harlan residents so far see only benefits. Corey Nelson, one of Harlan's early Internet customers, was thrilled at taking just three minutes to download the latest version of NetMeeting, a chat room program. It took a friend in Pennsylvania nearly an hour, he said. "And with this system, I don't use the phone line so I can still make or receive calls," Mr. Nelson added.
"This is opening up the world to our kids," said Ken Sprague, the technology coordinator for the local school district, who can now simultaneously connect 290 students at three schools to each other or the Internet. Soon, he said, Harlan's teachers will be able to arrange interactive conferencing with parents or children who are sick at home.
Allen W. Burchett, owner of Sta-bilt Construction, a road-repair company, plans to use the Internet lines to bid on Federal projects. He figures he will get the bidding results more quickly, enabling him to schedule other work he might otherwise have to pass up.
So far, though, the biggest impact has been in cable television. The residents who have signed on for cable service get more channels and clearer pictures for less money than TCI charged before competition. For the first time, shut-ins have been able to see local football games on the local access channel, town officials say. And residents say they like having a local board of citizens control what stations are offered on the service, not faraway cable executives.
TCI aims to provide "fair prices," and upgrade service regularly, according to Debora Blume, a company spokeswoman. But, she conceded, service is "definitely better" in towns where it faces competition.
Indeed, TCI chose Harlan as one of the first 30 Iowa towns to get digital service that will provide a clearer picture and raise the number of channels from 35 to 77. More dramatically, it cut the price for its extended basic service in Harlan by nearly 40 percent this summer. And it also rolled out marketing offers like three free months for returning subscribers.
"We had three TCI salesmen come to our door, each one adding another month of free service," said Cleo Anderson, who switched back to TCI in August after calculating he would save $100 this year. "But I told them I'm going back to the town if they raise their rates a dollar. I won't send a check out of town to save a few cents."
Such reactions are bad news for cable operators like TCI, which count on big profit margins from their monopoly franchises in most communities to service their heavy debts and fuel expansion. They already face growing competition from satellite-television systems and, in some populous areas, from ground-based telecommunications giants like Ameritech.
The cable operators' competitive worries do not stop at the town's limits. The equipment a community buys to receive programming by air or satellite and the computers it uses to manage the network are usually able to handle business in nearby towns that are willing to wire themselves. Harlan recently invited 19 neighbors to discuss such partnerships. Newnan already has one up and running with the public utility in nearby Fairburn, Ga. And Waterloo, Iowa, which has no public power utility, decided to create a public communications utility that could tie into the public network in next-door Cedar Falls.
"If this was terribly complicated, we wouldn't be doing it in rural Kentucky," said William J. Ray, superintendent of Glasgow, Ky. Glasgow's eight-year-old system is offering to deliver cable to Bowling Green, a city 30 miles to the west.
The financial hazards are not trivial, though. Paragould, Ark., which began offering cable television in 1991, has raised property taxes to cover its municipal utility's debts. Elbow Lake, Minn., sold its system to the local telephone cooperative, which also bought the competing private cable operator, after three years of steep losses. TCI representatives say fly-by-night consultants sometimes present towns with feasibility studies lacking such basics as maintenance budgets.
Cable companies have been the main corporate targets for the public utilities because the level of dissatisfaction with their service often runs high. Even small communities can quickly sign up hundreds of paying customers. But local phone companies may also be vulnerable, particularly if local utilities ally themselves with large private partners looking to take advantage of the 1996 Federal Telecommunications Act that deregulated the industry.
Hawarden, in Iowa's northwest corner, recently began selling both cable-television and phone service, the latter in partnership with Pioneer Holdings L.L.C., an MCI Communications affiliate. Harlan, Tacoma and many others say that they, too, will most likely compete in the phone business by leasing lines to private phone companies or in some other form of alliance, rather than managing the entire business as they do in cable television.
Even prominent backers of Harlan's investment like Mr. Burchett favor using private partners if possible to speed up revenue growth and spread risk. Harlan projects that it will take a decade to break even on its investment, far longer that the private sector would tolerate.
The uncertainties in local governments' leap into the information business are mind-boggling. A big question hanging over everyone is how much of the traffic that currently runs on wired networks will shift to wireless technology. But public utility officials note that the investments might be justified even if the new communications services never become profitable.
With deregulation nipping at their traditional business, some public utilities believe they need high-tech communications systems for remote meter reading, controlling power equipment and other operations that make energy delivery more efficient. If these systems can be designed to offer video, Internet and other services to increase revenue, so much the better.
"We went into this because we had a $1 billion investment we wanted to protect during deregulation," said Court Brickman, a spokesman for Tacoma City Light, which is planning a $95 million network capable of carrying cable television, Internet, high-speed data transfer and phone services to 140,000 households and businesses in the Tacoma area.
Still, the hope of spurring economic growth has often been a decisive factor in communities' decisions to create communications networks.
That makes it hard for private competitors to argue that it is financial madness for public utilities to compete in information services without indifference to the community's future. "The first time we dealt with this was when they voted in Cedar Falls in 1994," said Ms. Blume of TCI. "We could see there's a real fear of being left behind on the information highway."

 BODY:
No two pianos sound exactly alike, but appearance is quite another matter. Consider the classic grand -- substantial yet sensual, with a curvaceous lid and a lustrous case poised on three sturdy legs. For more than a century, this has been the standard-bearer, the masterstroke, the music-lover's version of the Model T -- available in any color you want as long as it's black.
 Not everyone yearns for a classic, however, which explains the rebirth of the art-case piano in the last few years. By strict definition, an art-case piano is a musical instrument encased in a one-of-a-kind artwork commissioned and designed for a specific site. But the term has expanded to embrace new and old pianos sheathed in decorative trappings, from a magnificently carved 1860 Victorian rosewood grand by Steinway & Sons, pictured on the previous page, to an austere, white sycamore upright with ebony inlays built a decade ago by the English furniture designer David Linley. Carvings, paintings, gilding, marquetry, ormolu and exotic wood veneers are hallmarks of the art-case piano; they can even turn up all together on a single instrument. Indeed, a piano case can flaunt almost anything, from centipede-style legs to built-in brass candlesticks to a coat of pink lacquer. 
 "People usually don't know exactly what they're looking for when they shop for an art-case piano," says Leopold Holder, whose company, The New York Piano Center, in Manhattan, rebuilds pianos. "They're just looking for character."
 Character is an option because, unlike a trombone or a flute, a piano is also a piece of furniture.
 "Part of the challenge of designing keyboard instruments lies in attractively disguising their mechanical nature," explains Laurence Libin, the Frederick P. Rose curator of musical instruments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Decorative pianos stretch back almost to Bartolomeo Cristofori's invention of the pianoforte in the early 18th century in Florence. Among the oldest decorative survivors is a charming instrument from 1767 finished in tulipwood veneer and embellished with painted flowers and a gilt-gesso scrolling border. It is on permanent exhibit at the Shrine to Music Museum, on the campus of the University of South Dakota in Vermillion.
 The art-case piano's heyday coincided with the instrument's immense popularity in both Europe and the United States in the second half of the 19th century. As sweetly carved pianos became a staple of the well-dressed Victorian parlor, wealthy people demanded splendiferous pianos, custom made for their homes. Between the 1860's and 1930's, top European piano makers, including Broadwood, Erard, Pleyel, Bluthner, Bosendorfer and Bechstein, commissioned designs and adornments from artists like the Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones and well-known European cabinetmakers -- Louis Marjorelle, Francois Linke and Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Demand was so great that Steinway established its own art department, in Astoria, Queens, at the turn of the century, replete with carvers, artists and gilders.
 Art-case pianos had no trouble showing off the prevailing fashions of their times, whether they were Gothic, Renaissance and Empire motifs or fanciful interpretations of Louis XIV, XV and XVI, Art Nouveau and Art Deco designs. Though upright pianos were often decorated, the more desirable grand piano presented a larger, flashier surface for ornamentation.
 "At a time when the piano was the entertainment center of the home, these pianos were for people who wanted to show off," says William Garlick, a Blue Point, N.Y.-based keyboard consultant for antique and contempory instruments.
 But the Depression squelched most demand for art-case pianos. By the end of World War II, the art-case piano market was dead, killed off by rising costs, a lack of skilled craftsmen and the inherent modernity of the unadorned black grand. "In the 1960's and 70's, art-case pianos were so anachronistic, people got rid of the carved legs," Garlick recalls.
 Nowadays, majestic carved legs are a significant part of the antique art-case piano's attraction. Behind the decorative piano's renewed desirability lie the current appeal of unique objects and a flourishing economy.
 "Most of my clients with art-case pianos want something you won't see everywhere," says Anthony Ingrao, a New York interior designer who recently acquired a 1920's Chinese-Chippendale-style piano trimmed in a Greek key pattern for a client. "You can build a room around a great piano," he adds.
 It certainly can cost a mere fortune to buy a quality art-case piano. In 1980, a dazzling art-case Steinway grand from 1883, displaying complex carvings, marquetry, gilding and romantic Pre-Raphaelite paintings by the high-Victorian British artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema, sold at Sotheby's for $390,000, an auction record for a musical instrument at that time. Fine rebuilt instruments in decorative cases, dating from 1890 to 1930, start at around $15,000 by a lesser-known maker, lower than the cost of a new quality piano -- a Steinway grand, for example, can sell from $29,000 to $75,000, depending on the size. But elaborate models in pristine condition with gilding, carving, marquetry and exquisite veneers easily top $100,000, as do most new art-case pianos.
 Costs are high because art-case instruments, whether antique or new, require special attention. With 12,000 moving parts, pianos consist of three basic elements: keyboard (hammers and action parts), interior (sounding board, strings, tuning pins) and case. Art-case pianos demand the same attention to keyboard and interior as any piano, but to restore or build a case requires precise, labor-intensive cabinetmaking skills like French polishing, a technique of rubbing on shellac, and gilding. At Klavierhaus, a bustling piano workshop and showroom near Lincoln Center, the owners and brothers Gabor and Sujatri Reisinger recently inspected an elaborate but worn Steinway grand from 1904 in need of restoration. The marquetry case, with eight types of woods, required stripping, repairs and a French polish; the legs had to be reinforced, and the swirling brass moldings would be sent to France for regilding. "These pianos help keep Old World craftsmanship from dying out," Gabor Reisinger says.
 Despite the allure of old pianos, new art-case ones are appearing, albeit gradually. This fall, Ibach, a German piano maker, is introducing a startling but graceful rectangular piano with a glistening black case balanced on three brushed-steel legs designed by the architect Richard Meier and costing about $116,000. Bosendorfer already offers a boldly sculptured red and black piano with 24-karat gold inlays and solid-brass legs designed in 1990 by the Austrian architect Hans Hollein. It is available for $125,000. (The mechanized, push-button lid suspends in the air when opened.) And the American art-furniture designer Wendell Castle has created five art-case pianos, including a splendid concert grand constructed with Steinway in 1994 for the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio. The piano's pale curly maple veneer case seems to float atop two enormous curved supports in dark cocobolo veneer. Of the other pianos, only one, a sycamore upright, is for sale -- $115,000 at Maximiliaan's House of Grand Pianos in New York.
 In 1988, Steinway commissioned Castle to design its 500,000th piano, an architectural concert grand with the names of more than 800 professional pianists who use Steinways inlaid like ribbons on the case. (The piano is on exhibit through the 15th of this month at Steinway Hall in New York and will then tour Japan.) This fall, to celebrate the 200th birthday of its founder, Henry E. Steinway, the company unveiled a new art-case piano based on a model from the years when Joseph Burr Tiffany, a member of the family that opened Tiffany & Company, headed Steinway's art department.
 Maximiliaan Rutten is a dealer whose jam-packed showroom, in the New York Design Center, is an art-case piano wonderland. He describes his typical client as "wealthy and sophisticated, often young professionals from Wall Street, interested in a good investment and a work of art." Interior designers visit frequently, professional musicians less so. "They're more interested in the musical than the decorative part," Rutten says. "And only a few professional pianists can afford more than one instrument."
 A new generation of piano designers is hoping to transport the craft -- and its devotees -- into the 21st century. Though known for his use of the piano curve in his architecture, Richard Meier abandoned it when he did the design for Ibach. "I love the shape of the traditional piano, but I wanted to push the design in a different direction," he says. His solution: a piano that is "more three-dimensional, with the bottom shaped, as well as the sides and top."
 John Diebboll, an architect in New York, has designed more than 60 pianos. Though all exist only on paper, he hopes to have one built soon. Witty and unexpected, his designs feature a piano shaped like a pup tent, a piano inspired by the Chrysler Building and a Murphy bed piano that folds out of a wall. His latest series of designs, on view Oct. 15 through the end of the year at Klavierhaus, honor pianists and include a jazzy black piano with red and white keys, intended for Thelonious Monk, and one with legs carved to look like wolves for the classical pianist Helene Grimaud. "Not much has been done with piano design for years," Diebboll says. "But you quickly realize the possibilities are endless."

THE FUTURE ONCE
 HAPPENED HERE
 New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate
 of America's Big Cities.
 By Fred Siegel.
 260 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $24. 
 For close to a generation now, since the defeat and discrediting of pre-civil-rights-era mayors like Sam Yorty of Los Angeles and Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia, urban politics have been the province of the American left. The absence of ideological competition in the nation's biggest cities has played an important, and pernicious, role in shaping both contemporary liberalism and contemporary conservatism. It has allowed liberals to ignore mounting evidence that their large, generally unaccountable social service bureaucracies have not improved the lives of the poor. And it has allowed conservatives, unfettered by actually having to govern cities, to turn them into a running metaphor for the cultural changes that their rural and suburban constituents fear.
In this environment, "The Future Once Happened Here" is a subversive book. In tracing the fate of New York, Washington and Los Angeles in recent decades, Fred Siegel, a professor of history at the Cooper Union for the Arts and Sciences, bitterly attacks the left-liberal consensus that has to varying degrees dominated the governance of each of the cities he examines. But he does so as a dedicated urbanite who, unlike many on the right, is not only at home with cultural diversity but also deeply attached to it. This perspective is typical of the vibrant and influential group of thinkers affiliated with the Manhattan Institute's publication City Journal, which Siegel once edited. And it is a view that has significantly influenced iconoclastic mayors like Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, John Norquist of Milwaukee and Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, whom Siegel once advised. It is, moreover, a perspective that both parties are having great difficulty coming to grips with.
Siegel argues that in the mid- to late-1960's America's cities were traumatized by riots and the threat of riots on the part of their alienated African-American residents. The liberal elites then coming into power -- defeating conservative white ethnics and ushering in the era of liberal domination of the cities -- responded, in Siegel's view, by taking an enormous gamble. Convinced that black poverty justified black anger, they abandoned the stern principles of personal responsibility that their predecessors had advocated and instead created a vast social welfare system premised on the idea that dependence on government is healthy. Siegel calls this "the riot ideology," and he blames it for two phenomena that have bedeviled cities ever since: a crime explosion that he terms "a rolling riot" and a huge government expansion that drove taxes so high that they chased out private industry and led to fiscal disaster.
Siegel's central argument is provocative, but it stretches at times awkwardly over the particularities of his three very different locales. More than half the book is about New York, and the argument seems tailor-made for that city, particularly for the mayoralty of John Lindsay. It is less convincing when applied to Washington and Los Angeles.
Siegel contends, for instance, that Mayor Marion Barry was allowed to ruin Washington because he skillfully used the threat of riots to secure white liberal support. Yet white liberalism matters much less in Washington, with its largely intra-black politics, than it does in New York. And a thesis based on white guilt doesn't offer much guidance as to why Barry won re-election in 1994, when he had no white support whatsoever, and when the memory of the 1968 riots in the District of Columbia was more than 25 years old. The riot ideology doesn't entirely fit Los Angeles, either, since its government never constructed a welfare bureaucracy as huge or as dysfunctional as New York's or Washington's. This is not to say that Siegel's chapters on Washington and Los Angeles are not valuable -- he evocatively captures the political cultures of both. But these narratives pretty much stand alone, and his occasional efforts to link them to categories and explanations imported from New York feel labored.
Even with regard to New York, however, the riot ideology thesis leaves a central question unanswered. Siegel suggests that the cities veered off track when they stopped trying to apply to African-American migrants from the South the moral standards used to assimilate earlier waves of poor immigrants. But he stops short of saying that the earlier models would have worked, given the much more profound oppression that American blacks faced. Indeed, he admits that New York's New Deal politics -- which proved so successful in assimilating Italians, Irish and Jews -- largely ignored the plight of the city's black population. Nor does he grapple with the widespread perception that black politics turned nationalist and sometimes violent in the 1960's in part because the Southern-oriented civil rights movement, with its integrationist norms, had few answers for the economic problems of blacks in the urban North.
Still, Siegel's book is a useful addition to the contemporary debate about the causes of urban decline. "The Future Once Happened Here" will unsettle liberals, who in recent years have stressed economic explanations for the decline of the inner cities, conveniently ignoring liberal policies that may have undermined the attractiveness of work and driven out private business. At the same time, because Siegel comes to his critiques from his urbanism, he diverges sharply from ideologically conservative positions. He criticizes the 1996 welfare bill for its attack on immigrant rights, and he mocks Newt Gingrich for depicting New Yorkers as dependent on the Federal Government when Gingrich's own Congressional district, like many similar districts throughout the South, receives enormous Federal subsidies.
Today, candidates and thinkers who advocate a new culturally open yet morally and fiscally disciplined politics are making cities what they have not been for decades -- competitive and dynamic realms of American governance. One can see this spirit today in New York, both in Rudolph Giuliani's reassertion of moral standards over the city's public spaces and in Ruth Messinger's call to make city garbage collectors compete with private companies. To this more hopeful story "The Future Once Happened Here" provides an impassioned prologue.

Europe Adrift
 By John Newhouse.
 339 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $27.50. 
 Europe is in worse trouble than you think, says John Newhouse in "Europe Adrift." After finishing this comprehensive and extremely well-informed book, most of his readers are likely to agree.
The analysis by Newhouse, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and a consultant to the State Department, goes beyond the conventional catalogue of woe. The problem is not just with unemployment, the welfare state or the Balkans. For Newhouse, the rot in Europe starts at the core, with a lack of leadership in Bonn, Paris and London. And the author, one of the most seasoned and well-connected American observers of the European scene, sees little hope for change.
Start with not-so-united Germany, which has yet to come to terms with new international choices. Before unification, West Germany's foreign policy was simple and clear. Its ties to the United States both reassured its European partners and provided defense against the Soviet Union. Otherwise, its ties to France were the anchor of its foreign policy. By accepting France's political pre-eminence in the European Union -- and agreeing to pay a disproportionate share of the bills -- West Germany reintegrated itself into respectable Western society and enjoyed extraordinary prosperity as a peaceful and contented country.
Now Germany is torn. Deeply worried about the potential for instability and poverty among its former Warsaw Pact neighbors to the east, Germany is a prime mover in seeking the eastward extension of both NATO and the European Union. This sets off alarm bells in Paris, where German hegemony in Europe has, in some circles, replaced United States hegemony as the perceived key threat to France's precarious place in the international major leagues.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, currently enmeshed in a series of political problems that some observers have labeled Kanzlerdammerung, or Twilight of the Chancellor, sees his historical mission as cementing Germany into a strong political union with its neighbors before European politics become renationalized. The ambitious plan to create a single European currency is part of Kohl's vision; so too were his plans, rejected by both Britain and France, for the construction of a European political union along federal lines.
Flaws in the project for a single currency and Anglo-French resistance to a federal structure for Europe mean, Newhouse believes, that Europe will miss the historic chance to bind Germany into a multinational structure. Kohl, the last German Chancellor out of the old Bonn Republic mold, will be succeeded by other, younger figures who may not share his visceral commitment to Europe.
Newhouse is bitterly critical of French and especially British leadership since German unification. Their failure to respond positively to Kohl's proposals for federalization, he fears, means that Europe will drift back toward its bad old nationalistic ways. This may be too harsh. Kohl has asked his partners to choose between a "European Germany" and a "German Europe," and this, undoubtedly, is how he sees the possibilities for the future. But is life really so simple? Kohl's ambitious program for political union -- shaped by German interests, priorities and timetables -- may not be so much an alternative to German domination of Europe as a form of it.
But if Newhouse's analysis of British and French policy toward Germany is slightly too dark, his recognition of the limits on Europe's ability to address its other major problems is right on the money. Europe does not face classic threats to its security today. No Napoleon or Hitler plots its conquest; no armed, barbarian hordes cluster at the frontiers. Yet Europe remains profoundly insecure. Its southern rim is one long arc of crisis, from instability in the Caucasus to the simmering feud between Greece and Turkey to the still-explosive situation in the Balkans to demographic explosion in North Africa and Islamic uprising in Algeria. Eastward, what some call "Weimar Russia" remains a troubling enigma, and the present members of the European Union are very far from agreement on how to expand to include even the most promising of the Central European republics.
Faced with this sea of troubles, Europe has essentially thrown up its hands in despair. Contemporary European leaders lack the vision and historical imagination to tackle problems like the poverty and political violence in North Africa. Powerful domestic forces in both Greece and Turkey prevent those two countries from compromising their bitter differences -- and meanwhile the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the costly war against Kurdish separatists slowly undermine the foundations of the Turkish state.
Grim as all this sounds, Newhouse doesn't predict imminent catastrophe. Europe may be drifting, but at the moment it isn't drifting toward disaster the way it did, say, during the decades before the last two world wars. Initially, at least, the cost of Europe's drift will be measured in opportunities lost and problems not solved. Only later, when the unattended troubles of North Africa, Russia, Turkey and the Balkans have festered for a while, and when Europe's internal politics have been poisoned by prolonged economic stagnation and the re-emergence of national rivalries, will the true cost of Europe's indecisiveness be known.
Let's hope that Newhouse is too pessimistic. Europe has muddled through before. English-speaking observers have long predicted a breakdown in the French-German partnership at the heart of contemporary affairs. A European monetary union may not look promising, but it doesn't have to end in shambles. And even if it does, Europe has overcome much worse in the past. It is a resilient place, and after surviving Genghis Khan, the Black Death and modern totalitarianism, it may even be able to endure Chancellor Kohl and President Jacques Chirac.
Still, "Europe Adrift" is a timely and important warning. One hopes that its message will be studied and heeded by national leaders and opinion makers on both sides of the Atlantic. Bad as they are, none of Europe's problems are completely past fixing, and Newhouse's always thoughtful and often brilliant descriptions of the issues will serve as a very useful guide for those looking for answers.

Feats of Clay

BYLINE: By Eric P. Nash

 BODY:
Above the heads of New York City dwellers lies a mythic realm peopled by pensive gargoyles, mossbacked mermen, dashing Mercurys and enough animal characters -- foxes, flying fish, sea horses and salamanders -- to populate a Japanese folk tale. Susan Tunick's TERRA-COTTA SKYLINE: New York's Architectural Ornament (Princeton Architectural Press, $45) is a first-rate Baedeker to the astonishing variety of terra cotta decoration in the city. Terra cotta (literally "burnt earth") is kiln-baked clay, a light, economical architectural material capable of holding high definition and rainbow hues. The rise of the terra cotta industry and the New York skyscraper are inseparable: the facade of Daniel Burnham's Flatiron Building of 1901-3 featured richly modeled masks of Greek women, and Cass Gilbert's Woolworth Building of 1910-13 was clad in cream-colored terra cotta in a flamboyant Gothic style. The use of terra cotta reached its acme in 1930-31 with the sea-colored McGraw-Hill Building (now badly chipping); fell into a serious slump with post-World War II glass and steel buildings, and is now making a small return with the restoration of such clay classics as City Center. Some technical chapters on how terra cotta is actually produced may make the average reader's eyes glaze over, but the enthusiasm of Tunick -- who is also president of the Friends of Terra Cotta, a preservation society -- for her subject is contagious. Peter Mauss's photographs are breathtaking. Eric P. Nash

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
In Seattle, the Ingredients Shine

BYLINE: By MELISSA A. TRAINER; MELISSA A. TRAINER is a food writer living in Seattle.

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to food, Seattleites are a dedicated lot. Although they expect to find the bounty of the Pacific Northwest at the city's markets, they often go so far as to grow, gather and catch many of their own ingredients.
Green thumbs tend organic vegetable gardens, berry patches and fruit trees in urban backyards. When the fish are running, hardy souls grab their rods and head for the water, and when berries are dangling from vines and wild mushrooms are poking through mossy forest floors, outdoor enthusiasts head for the hills with baskets in hand. 
 With such savvy food lovers around, it's no surprise that Seattle is a top-notch food town. Local chefs celebrate the region's abundance, using choice pickings in both traditional and serendipitous ways. King salmon is as likely to be turned into gravlax as chowder. Fresh edible flowers can be found in salads and on sorbets.
Some of the heaviest hitters on the country's culinary scene are analyzing the local market and setting up shop. Last December, Roy Yamaguchi, whose original Roy's is one of Honolulu's most popular restaurants, opened Roy's at the Westin. In January, Wolfgang Puck came to town with his wife, Barbara Lazaroff, and opened ObaChine in the downtown Meridian shopping and restaurant complex.
In mid-September, Mr. Puck launched Wolfgang Puck Cafe in the recently built Harbor Steps residential and commercial complex. In a telephone interview, Mr. Puck explained why. "Seattle is a small, but still very good market." he said. "For me as a cook, it's especially good because you have so many fine ingredients in the Northwest."
Here is a look at a few of Seattle's newer places and its tried-and-true favorites:
 
Flying Fish
Situated in Belltown, one of Seattle's hottest neighborhoods, Flying Fish has been drawing an eclectic crowd since its doors flew open two years ago. As the restaurant's name suggests, the focus is on seafood. The cooking of the proprietor and chef, Christine Keff, shows a strong Asian influence.
For a first course we chose the oyster sampler, which consisted of six Canadian oysters on the half shell, three Evening Coves from Vancouver Island and three Malpeques from Prince Edward Island. Both the raw oysters were well complemented by a mignonette ice.
The crabcake with the lemongrass mayonnaise was a very modern interpretation of an old favorite. The cake was crispy and chock-full of Dungeness crab. The lemongrass condiment was a nice alternative to the more typical accompaniments of tartar sauce and lemon wedge.
We went on to try the fried Alaskan razor clams, which were crisp and extraordinarily large, a fine rendition of what can so often be a greasy disaster. To sip while savoring, we chose Chateau Ste. Michelle "Cold Creek" Chardonnay 1995 from the Columbia Valley of Washington ($50).
For an entree, my husband, Christopher, opted for one of Ms. Keff's signature dishes -- the whole fried snapper served with spring roll wrappers, a pineapple-anchovy sauce, and mounds of mint, basil, coriander and bean sprouts. The traditional Vietnamese dish is an eye-catcher, and heads turned as our waitress presented it.
Unfortunately, the snapper had stayed in the fryer a bit too long, and was a tad dry when mixed with the herbs and wrapped in the spring rolls. My Thai curry soft-shell crabs with green papaya salad and rice cakes hit home, however. The curry was well balanced, and the Chesapeake Bay soft-shells were pleasingly petite, crispy outside, and succulent inside.
To wrap things up we chose a nectarine crumble with vanilla bean ice cream and a bowl of marionberry and raspberry sorbets. The crumble was satisfying and flavorful but a bit too heavy. The latter, which highlighted two of the Northwest's many fat and juicy berries, was right on the money.
 
Roy's
Roy's in Seattle is one of the 12 restaurants opened by Roy Yamaguchi around the world. The original opened in Honolulu in 1988, and since then this chef has expanded to Tokyo, Guam, and the Philippines, to name a few destinations.
Most of the dishes globe-trot between Asia and Europe and incorporate culinary techniques from each. The restaurant wins high marks for serving eye-catching and attractive combinations. Unfortunately, it sometimes falls short when it comes to serving well-flavored and properly prepared dishes.
While waiting briefly for our table one busy Saturday night, we admired the bright nautically inspired mural and dark hardwood floors at the entrance, which lent a warm and cheerful atmosphere. After being seated in one of the restaurant's intimate rooms, we ordered appetizers of crispy seafood potstickers with mango sauce and blackened ahi with hot mustard sauce. The potstickers, artfully arranged on top of the sweet sauce, were a bit too fishy for my taste and too chewy. The tuna was more successful, seared and still raw on the inside, and the accompanying sauce an incendiary complement.
Curious about the imu oven pizzas, we inquired. Our waiter explained that in Hawaii an imu is an underground oven. Admitting that it would be hard to replicate an authentic imu in a downtown Seattle hotel, he explained that the restaurant bakes its pizzas in a wood-fired oven. Undeterred, we ordered a grilled vegetable and feta rendition; unfortunately, the crust was not crisp and the vegetables were flat and rather soggy.
My husband's main course of duck with mashed potatoes and a star anise cranberry sauce was quite good. The tender slices of duck were fanned over a creamy potato puree, with the spicy tart sauce balancing some of the duck's richness.
My sesame-seared halibut with black bean sauce, topped with a mound of deep fried noodles, was less appealing. The fish was overcooked, and the black bean sauce so salty that I suspect someone in the kitchen incorporated the fermented beans into the sauce without rinsing them first.
For dessert we skipped Roy's melting hot chocolate souffle and opted for the Mount Kilauea. Consisting of three layers of ice cream and garnished with spicy dragon cookies, the dessert was a serendipitous take on baked Alaska.
 
Ray's Boathouse
Whenever we want to enjoy well-prepared Northwest seafood in a relaxing setting, we head to Ray's Boathouse. Smack on Puget Sound and boasting views of the Olympic Mountains, the restaurant looks out on fishing vessels, sailboats and kayakers cruising by. Although the menu features some Asian-inspired dishes, such as black cod in sake kasu, most of the food prepared by Charles Ramseyer, the executive chef, is grounded in European techniques and combinations.
We started with Nova smoked southeast Alaskan king salmon and Ray's Northwest clam chowder. Presented in three large heaps and accompanied by horseradish cream, capers, red onion and pumpernickel, the rich buttery salmon was a knockout. The clam chowder, containing small diced new potatoes, onion, and carrots, was rich and wonderfully clammy -- proof that sometimes the simplest dishes can be the most elegant.
My main course of halibut cheeks with brandy prawn sauce, wild rice and haricots verts was also very good. The chubby cheeks were moist and tender, and the sauce was velvety and slightly pink from the small tender prawns cooked in it. Christopher's pan-seared Fraser River sockeye salmon with a mushroom fume blanc was cooked rare, rich with the aromatic medley of chanterelles and shiitakes.
For dessert the chocolate raspberry torte was well executed, and the warm blueberry crisp with hazelnut ice cream a hands-down winner.
 
Rover's
About 10 minutes from downtown, Rover's offers contemporary French fare in the intimate charm of a clapboard house. The chef and owner, Thierry Rautureau, hails from the Muscadet region of France and has been pleasing Seattleites and visitors for more than 10 years. Relying on seasonal Northwest ingredients, Mr. Rautureau creates an a la carte menu daily as well as carefully developing vegetarian and nonvegetarian five- and eight-course tasting menus.
After hearing about the tasting menus and being told by our waiter that the chef was happy to mix and match according to a customer's specifications, my husband chose the eight-course tasting menu ($89.50), while I ordered a la carte.
Although our waiter offered to choose appropriate wines for each course, we simply opted for a bottle of Cameron Willamette Valley Chardonnay Vintage Reserve 1994 ($52).
To some people, an eight-course meal might seem excessive. Thankfully, Mr. Rautureau presents each course in very sensible portions and understands that such a meal should unwind at a comfortable pace.
The first course was a soft scrambled egg, its shell topped with lime-scented cream and osetra caviar. The gently cooked egg was delightfully creamy, the caviar a luxurious addition. The second course consisted of a smoked salmon tian with a cucumber salad, the crunchy refreshing slices of cucumber a pleasant contrast to the cold-smoked fish.
In the three courses that followed before our entrees, Mr. Rautureau continued to incorporate Northwest favorites, such as halibut, morels and diver-harvested scallops, in a classic and tasteful manner. Before the main course arrived, we were presented with sorbets to cleanse our palates. We found my husband's spice-infused pinot noir sorbet a bit too clovey and autumnal; my rose-scented geranium sorbet was lightly flavored and very refreshing.
The halibut with pomme mousseline and morels was our favorite. Four hefty medallions topped a silky smooth and flavorful potato puree. Tucked between the fish and puree was a decadent saute of morels. The venison with huckleberry sauce was less successful. Although the huckleberries were a lovely treat, the venison was a bit tough and the dish rather heavy for a summer evening.
For dessert the huckleberry clafouti with vanilla ice cream was a nice Northwest interpretation of a homey French favorite, the pancake-like pastry topped with a cheerful Johnny-jump-up and permeated with berry flavor. My husband's peach and apricot soup was accompanied by a fallen chocolate souffle and garnished with intensely-flavored red and white fraises des bois. The miniature berries, plucked from wild plants that are being farm-raised in nearby Mount Vernon, were simply incredible.
 
Shiro's Sushi Bar And Restaurant
Seattle's sushi lovers beat a path to Shiro's Sushi Bar and Restaurant. Shiro Kashiba, the chef and owner, buys only the freshest seafood and presents it artfully to his dedicated clientele.
The modest-sized spot in Belltown can fill up quickly. We arrived at 5:30 one Monday evening and were lucky enough to snag the last two seats at the sushi bar. Although we would have been served just as graciously at one of the restaurant's 17 tables, the sushi bar is the place to sit at Shiro's.
After ordering a round of Sapporo beer, we admired the glistening local albacore tuna, smelt and live geoducks in the case before us while Mr. Kashiba joked with everyone at the counter and thoroughly answered questions. He also speculated on when the eagerly awaited matsutake, an exorbitantly expensive and coveted wild mushroom found in forests of both the Pacific Northwest and Japan, would be arriving. (It is in now and will probably be available until mid-October.)
Feeling welcome and relaxed, we started with smelt umeshiso age. Local smelt was laid out, spread with sour plum sauce and topped with a shiso leaf before being rolled up, deep fried and sliced. It was spectacular and so good we ordered another round. Soon there was a run on smelt and Mr. Kashiba, to his dismay, was sold out for the night.
We then ordered sunomono, a traditional marinated seafood salad. The artfully arranged salad of steamed soft clams, octopus and shrimp with pickled cucumbers and seaweed salad appealed to the eye as much as the palate. The still-moving geoducks were next; when sauteed with quartered mushrooms they were tender, buttery and sweet.
Unable to resist the soft-shell crabs, we asked for a spider roll. A piece of nori was laid out and spread with rice, flying fish roe, cucumber and radish sprouts; then the deep-fried crab was arranged with its claws hanging off either end. When rolled up, sliced, and served with claws in the air, the presentation resembled a tarantula.
Before we called it quits, our congenial sushi-bar neighbors told us to order the sour plum hand roll. We heeded their advice, and were happy we did. Sour, salty, and sweet, the roll -- which had sour plum sauce, shiso leaves, rice and vegetables wrapped in seaweed -- was delightfully digestible and satisfying. With that and a cup of green tea, we were set.
 
A comfortable new cafe in the Puck empire
 Last month Wolfgang Puck embarked on his second Seattle venture, the Wolfgang Puck Cafe. (The first was ObaChine, opened in January.) One of 13 around the country, the cafe is across from the Seattle Art Museum in the heart of downtown. Offering everything from Mr. Puck's wood-fired oven pizzas to a small but carefully selected array of oysters, the restaurant is already drawing a stream of customers. The casual atmosphere and friendly staff make the cafe as comfortable for moms carting tots as for well-heeled executives seeking a high-quality nosh.
When my husband and I headed to the cafe for a midweek lunch, we brought our toughest critic, our 2-year-old daughter. We were greeted with smiles, offered a high chair and presented with a simple children's menu. We quickly chose a cheese pizza for Carolyn before perusing our own menus.
We started with the smoked duck quesadilla ($6.95). Drizzled with guajillo chili sauce and sour cream, it was quite appealing. My prosciutto pizza with pesto, Roma tomatoes, goat cheese and roasted red peppers ($9.95) was irresistible. My husband's smoked turkey sandwich on herbed focaccia ($8.75) was moist and flavorful, and the generous but not gargantuan serving made it a good midday choice.
While we had lunch, our waitress checked in from time to time and our daughter polished off her pizza without a bit of coaxing from us. For those reasons alone, we'd head back to the Wolfgang Puck Cafe in a heartbeat. M.A.T.
 
Bill of fare
Thanks to a buzzing restaurant scene and the region's thriving economy, Seattleites are dining out in droves. The flip side of such excitement is that it can often be hard to get a reservation on short notice.
While scheduling dinners at many of the restaurants included here, I called a couple of days in advance and was often told the only available spots were at 5 or 9:30. I soon learned that if I wanted to eat at the civilized hour of 7:30, I had to make reservations up to a week in advance. I suggest visitors do the same.
Flying Fish, 2234 First Avenue; (206) 728-8595. Dinner daily. Three-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine, $75. Smoking at the bar only.
Roy's, 1900 Fifth Avenue, Seattle; (206) 256-7697. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. No smoking. Three-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine, about $85.
Ray's Boathouse, 6049 Seaview Avenue, N.W.; (206) 789-3770. Lunch and dinner daily. Three-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine, $85. No smoking in the main dining room, only in the upstairs lounge.
Rover's, 2808 East Madison; (206) 325-7442. Dinner Tuesday through Saturday. Five-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine, $150. No smoking.
Shiro's Sushi Bar and Restaurant, 2401 Second Avenue; (206) 443-9844. Lunch Monday through Friday, dinner Monday through Saturday. Reservations accepted for tables but not for the sushi bar. There is a small separate smoking section. Smelt umeshiso age, $5.50; sunomono (seafood salad), $6; sauteed geoducks, $6.50; soft-shell crab spider roll, $10; sour-plum hand roll, $3.50.
Wolfgang Puck Cafe, 1225 First Avenue; (206) 621-9653. Lunch and dinner daily. Pizzas, $7.95 to $14.50 (for smoked salmon). Pastas, $8.95 to $13.95. Wine by the glass, $4.50 and up. M.A.T.

HEADLINE: The No-Complaints Generation

BYLINE: By Ian Fisher

 BODY:
"I have a dream," says julie reisman, 18, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. "To design golf clubs. I know that sounds stupid."
Not really, but Reisman is still embarrassed, as if drivers and irons were a letdown to the grandly seditious tradition of the American undergrad. Her goals may be square, but her frankness is refreshing. For most students in the 90's, rebelliousness, if it exists at all, has been largely a style statement. For Reisman it isn't even that, and judging by a recent visit to Wisconsin's sprawling, 40,000-student main campus, she's not unique in this. Today's freshmen no longer see the point of even striking the pose. 
 In fact, at a school with a famous legacy of activism, members of the class of 2001 look a lot like Chelsea Clinton, the smiling, well-behaved First Daughter who packed off to Stanford this fall. They're smart, ambitious and uncomplaining. Like Chelsea, they actually seem to like their dysfunctional parents. Unlike her, they don't know (or care) much about politics, and their main civic passions are local: jobs, families and community. Distinct from students earlier in the decade, they are less worried about the economy than about their ability to measure up to its seemingly perpetual boom. "The American ideal isn't just about living on a farm with animals," says Shannon Boden, a freshman from Appleton, Wis. "It's also about living in a $350,000 house. There's more pressure to make the six-figure salary."
This isn't to say that today's freshmen are mindless materialists -- they seem overwhelmed by the complexity of problems, like race or the environment, passed down by parents who won a round of more clearly defined battles. They're unimpressed with rebellion, in part because they're smart enough to know that it's been fully co-opted. "You can't shock anyone anymore," says Leah Olson, Boden's high-school friend.
Indeed, the entire idea of novelty has shifted: freshmen in 1997 draw on the last 40 years of popular culture to create a comfortable mix that no one bothers to call new. Hair can be short, long or gone. Most people dress somewhere along the grunge-punk-hippie continuum -- Doc Martens one day, Birkenstocks the next. Like students of every era, they say they want self-discovery while getting a good education. They want a fair amount of fun. (Madison freshmen were thrilled when The Princeton Review named their campus the nation's No. 2 party school.) Later on, they want a family -- one that doesn't start too early, but lasts.
Consider, as a random-but-typical snapshot of freshmen 1997, Adam Butler and Jeff Angarola, roommates in a huge coed dormitory called Sellery Hall, which is filled with packs of baffled 18-year-olds. They are friends from a suburban Chicago high school. Their room is jammed with every convenience: two refrigerators, a microwave, a blender, a stereo. They play in an alternative band, which once would have meant that they were alienated. But they're business majors. When asked about their goals, they talk bluntly about personal success.
Is that all there is? No. Butler talks about succeeding with "the right attitude, to live well and help people out." But success is very important, and for Butler it constitutes a sort of rebellion -- against the old "slacker" stereotype that follows late-90's kids like an unwelcome fog. "You prove people wrong," he says. "You succeed in their faces."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Wisconsin's varsity football cheerleaders teach a pack of freshmen (off camera) how to cheer for the Badgers at a postgame celebration called the Fifth Quarter. The frosh seem ambivalent about the pep lesson: cheerleaders are pretty corny. And yet, these students are not so quick to dismiss Ozzie and Harriet stuff without a fair hearing. Compromise: They hoot along with the songs -- warily.; Mike Koszuta, above left, wants to be a music teacher. He gives the floor a booming lesson in tonal appreciation, with help from Jeffrey Sauer -- his energetic friend from high school -- and a huge pair of speakers. The selections: Clutch, a heavy-metal band, then Led Zeppelin. Somehow, the guys hear the phone ring when Jeffrey's roommate's sister calls. "How's it going?" he asks. Pause. "Yes, meeting a lot of women."; Mike Gietl digs into a bowl of Cap'n Crunch With Crunchberries after a late night of partying. He's a premed student who wants to be a pediatrician like his grandfather. It's the ideal career for the late 90's: a comfortable life and a chance, as he says, to "help sick kids get better." His roommate, Dominic Bardele, responds sarcastically: "Whatta guy."; Jenna Washnieski rests in a friend's room on a lonely Sunday, missing her boyfriend back in Ashland, Wis. But what would college be without new friends like Ensley Peters (arm at left), whose grandmother sewed her a blanket of fake tiger fur? "It cheers everybody up," Peters says. "I didn't want to bring my plain boring sheets to college with me. I wanted to live it up a little."; Young women like Michelle Walstrom, above left, and her roommate, Sandi Holter, say they cannot even imagine a time when they weren't equal to men. Most say they expect little or no discrimination once they land in the workplace. "I feel I don't have to fight so much," Walstrom says.; At Tiger Rose Tattoo, a body-art shop just off campus near State Street's boho-commercial strip, Adam Butler buys a badge of individuality: a small Celtic cross, etched above his right ankle. He's worried about what his mom will say, but not very. "Cool, he says when the work is done. "It's about time I did something wild.(Photographs by Lars Tunbjork)

Cod Is Good

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
As cod goes, so go the fortunes of the working fisherman. This oft-heard sentiment is as true today as it was in 1784, when Massachusetts hung a carving of the cod in its Statehouse, in grateful appreciation.
The beef of the sea, as cod is sometimes called, was the source of New England's early wealth. It was also the first fish to be traded globally -- the Basques having perfected salt cod in the Middle Ages -- and even today, the economy of Iceland still depends on it. 
 But most of cod's larger spawning grounds -- off New England, Newfoundland and in the North Sea -- have been depleted, says Mark Kurlansky, author of "Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World." Only Iceland and Norway have managed (through severe restrictions and restocking) to maintain a stable catch, while Russia has been overfishing one of the last rich repositories -- the Barents Sea -- like crazy.
Kurlansky, who worked as a commerical fisherman in New England to put himself through college, knows of the dwindling supply firsthand. Cod, he says emphatically, is in danger. And while statistics in America, as well as in Europe, reflect this, nothing tells the tale quite as well as cod's shifting social position.
From the 11th century until the 1950's, cod was poor people's food. So abundant was the supply that cod was considered common. Salt cod had been a staple for both the French and British Navies; it was the food of slavery, and the Catholic peasant's Friday dinner.
Suddenly, however, cod is chic. Salt cod in particular has become the darling of fine restaurants in Paris and New York, where it fits right in with the fashion toward homey, old-fashioned food. Not that any cook would have reason to complain about this development, since cod, above all else, is accommodating and versatile. No culture lacks a cod repertory, and it is difficult if not impossible to maim or render inedible this firm white fish with the large, snowy flake.
If you can cook salt cod, you can cook Caribbean and Mediterranean food. If you can perfectly broil or braise a fresh cod, you can congratulate yourself on having mastered the basic tactile instincts that separate the recipe-dependent cook from the real McCoy.
Neverthless, as Kurlansky is sad to report, the array of delicious cod dishes now appearing -- and commanding steep prices in trendy restaurants -- has poignant implications. Fancy cod is emblematic of a fading feast.
 
Brandade Tante Colette
 
 1 pound boneless, skinless salt cod
 2 medium baking potatoes, peeled, cut in 2-inch chunks, boiled until tender and mashed with a fork
 6 medium garlic cloves, minced
 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1/2 cup heavy cream
 1 teaspoon kosher salt
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste.
1. The day before serving, cover the cod with water, changing water every few hours. Soak overnight. Drain the cod, cut in 4-inch chunks and cover with fresh water in a large saucepan.
2. Bring almost to a boil and remove from heat. Cover and let stand 15 minutes, then drain. When the fish is cool enough to handle, use a knife to scrape away any fatty skin, and remove any bones.
3. Place the cod, potatoes and garlic in a food processor and pulse to combine. Continue pulsing, off and on, while adding the oil in a steady stream. When the oil is completely incorporated, add the heavy cream in the same way. The idea is to incorporate the oil and cream so the mixture keeps some of its texture. Season and serve with garlic toast.
Yield: 8 appetizers.
 
Joann Coats's Codfish Balls
 (adapted from "THE Provincetown Portuguese Cookbook, " by Mary-Jo Avellar)
 
 1 pound boneless, skinless salt cod
 3 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
 1 medium onion, minced
 1 teaspoon chopped parsley
 1 pinch nutmeg
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 1 tablespoon kosher salt, or to taste
 3 eggs, separated
 4 cups vegetable oil.
1. Soak the cod overnight as above. Drain and cut into 1-inch squares, removing any remaining bones. Place the cod in a deep pot with the potatoes, cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then drain.
2. Mash the potatoes and cod with the onion, parsley, nutmeg, pepper and salt (how much depends on the saltiness of the cod). Stir in the yolks. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry and fold them into the potato mixture.
3. Heat the oil to 350 degrees in a medium saucepan. Drop rounded tablespoons of the mixture (about 8 at a time) into the hot oil and fry for 2 minutes, turning once or twice, until golden. Drain on paper towels. Allow the oil to return to 350 degrees between each batch. Keep warm in a 300-degree oven until all are done.
Yield: 8 to 12 servings.
 
Portuguese Kale-and-Salt-Cod Chowder
 
 1 pound boneless, skinless salt cod
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 1 pound linguica sausage (or chorizo), cut into 1/2-inch disks
 1 small onion, chopped
 2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
 4 quarts chicken broth
 8 ounces kale, stemmed, rinsed and coarsely chopped to make 6 cups
 2 bay leaves
 1/2 teaspoon chili-pepper flakes
 1/2 cup fresh mint, minced.
1. Soak the salt cod overnight in cold water, as above. Drain and tear the cod into bite-size pieces, removing any remaining bones. Cover the cod with fresh water and bring nearly to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Warm the olive oil in a large soup pot over high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes to lightly brown. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently until the onions are nearly soft, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and toss. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the kale, bay leaves and chili- pepper flakes. Return to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Skim the fat off the top of the soup. Add the cod, adjust the seasoning, ladle into bowls and sprinkle each with fresh mint.
Yield: 8 servings.
 
 Le Cirque's Potato-Wrapped Truffled Cod
 
 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 12 pieces
 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and sliced thin lengthwise
 2 3/4teaspoons kosher salt
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 4 8-ounce cod fillets
 1 ounce black truffle, sliced very thin
 1 bottle good Italian red wine
 3 medium shallots, minced
 1 stem fresh thyme
 1 tablespoon heavy cream
 1 pinch sugar
 2 medium leeks, white only, cut into thin strips, 2 inches long.
1. Melt 2 pieces of the butter. Toss the potatoes with the melted butter and season with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
2. Season the cod with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Lay out 4 10-inch squares of plastic wrap on the counter. On each square lay enough slices of potato to fully surround the cod. Place 1 fillet on each square and lay 3 slices of truffle on each. Wrap the cod in the potato slices, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Boil the wine, shallots and thyme together for 20 to 30 minutes, until reduced to half a cup. Strain through a very fine sieve. Whisk the cream into the reduced wine. Over a low flame bring the wine and cream to a boil. Remove from heat. Whisk 6 pieces of butter into the sauce, 1 piece at a time. Return to very low heat if necessary to fully incorporate the butter into the sauce. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 pinch of sugar and fresh pepper. Remove from heat, cover and keep warm.
4. Melt 2 pieces of butter in a skillet. Add the leeks and cook over medium heat until soft about 10 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat, cover and keep warm.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a nonstick pan over medium heat and heat the remaining butter until very hot. Add the fish and cook for 2 1/2 minutes per side, until the potatoes are browned. Bake for 5 minutes and serve on a bed of leeks with a drizzle of sauce.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
Fresh Cod Baked With White Beans And Linguica
 
 1 pound dried white beans
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 5 ounces linguica sausage (or chorizo), minced
 2 onions, minced
 4 cloves of garlic, peeled
 2 1/2teaspoons kosher salt
 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
 2 14 1/2-ounce cans stewed tomatoes, drained
 1/2 cup oil-cured black olives, pitted
 1/8 teaspoon chili -pepper flakes
 6 6-to-8-ounce cod fillets
 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary.
1. Rinse the beans and place them in a large Dutch oven. Cover with cold water, place over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside for a half hour, then drain.
2. Warm the oil in the Dutch oven, add sausage and cook for 2 minutes, add onions, garlic and drained beans, cover with cold water and cook over medium-low heat until almost tender, about 40 minutes. Drain excess liquid. Season with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
3. Pulse tomatoes, olives and pepper flakes in a food processor to combine. Arrange the cod on top of the beans. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Spoon the tomato mixture over the fillets and sprinkle with rosemary. Cover and bake in the oven until the fish is cooked and the beans are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: The New Look of Liberalism on the Court

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen; Jeffrey Rosen is the legal-affairs editor of The New Republic and an associate professor at the George Washington University Law School. His most recent article for the Magazine, about Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, appeared in June.

 BODY:
The most unguarded conversation i've had with justice ruth bader ginsburg occurred at the Washington Opera. It was two years ago, during the first intermission of a production of "Cosi Fan Tutte," and I ran into Justice Ginsburg and her husband on the stairs. "Cosi" is the one about the two lotharios who make a bet that their girlfriends will be faithful, disguise themselves as Albanian soldiers, try to seduce each other's girlfriend and find that the women aren't faithful after all. The director had tried to add a feminist twist by having the women overhear the bet in the first act, so that they were only "pretending" to be unfaithful in the second. I suggested to Justice Ginsburg that perhaps this conceit was hard to reconcile with the sexual double standards of the 18th century, which were central to the plot and reflected in the traditional translation of the title: "Never Trust a Woman."
Justice Ginsburg, as I recall, was wearing a black velvet cape, and she looked at me indulgently with her unblinking eyes. The Italian title, she pointed out, was in the third person plural. "They are all like that" would be a more accurate translation, she suggested. And so, she said, there was no reason to assume from the title that Mozart and his librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, approved of male infidelity any more than they approved of female infidelity, or that they thought women inherently more or less trustworthy than men. 
 Justice Ginsburg's elegant reconception of the 18th-century text epitomizes the vision of mainstream, equal-treatment feminism that she championed as an advocate and an academic in the 1970's. She rejected the traditional idea that women and men occupy separate spheres, in which women are naturally passive and men aggressive, and she challenged laws treating men and women differently, especially those designed to protect "the weaker sex." In June 1996, in her opinion for the Court ordering the Virginia Military Institute to admit women, she enacted this view into law. "Generalizations about the way women are, estimates of what is appropriate for most women," she wrote, "no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description."
The boldness of Justice Ginsburg's opinion in the Virginia Military Institute case may seem hard to reconcile with the sensibility that informs the rest of her jurisprudence. She is, in most cases, a paragon of judicial restraint. In her four years on the Supreme Court, she has shown as a Justice precisely the same qualities that guided her for 13 years on the Court of Appeals: an affinity for resolving cases on narrow procedural grounds rather than appealing to broad principles of social justice; a preference for small steps over sweeping gestures, and an aversion to bold assertions of judicial power. Nevertheless, Ginsburg's opinions about sex discrimination share with the rest of her jurisprudence a focus on the individual choices faced by individual men and women rather than on historical abstractions or philosophical generalizations.
As an avatar, in most cases, of judicial minimalism, Justice Ginsburg is the antithesis of Justice William Brennan, the liberal lion of the Warren Court of the 1960's, who died in July at age 91. (Ginsburg visited Brennan during his last weeks; she told clerks that he always responded best to women, and playfully asked her for a kiss.) And in the wake of Brennan's death, it seems appropriate to ask what, precisely, it means to be a liberal Justice in 1997.
In June 1993, when President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, he called her the Thurgood Marshall of the women's rights movement, self-consciously comparing her work as an advocate to that of the last Justice to be appointed by a Democratic President, 26 years earlier. The comparison of the advocacy of Marshall and Ginsburg was apt: both transformed antidiscrimination law by starting with the least controversial cases and working their way up. Yet Ginsburg's most important achievement as a Justice has been to wean liberals from the judicial sensibility that Marshall and Brennan came to embody. For more than a generation, critics of the Warren era have argued that Justices like Brennan and Marshall were too quick to short-circuit national debates that should have been resolved in the legislatures.
Imprisoned by their old paradigms, some political conservatives have implausibly attacked Ginsburg as a judicial activist. "According to Justice Ginsburg's theory of democracy, the majority gets first shot at solving the problems to the satisfaction of Federal judges but not the last word," Pat Buchanan said in an attack on Ginsburg during the last Presidential campaign. "The Court gets the last word."
In fact, Buchanan had it precisely backward: Ginsburg has proved to be a far more restrained Justice than her conservative colleagues. A recent survey by the libertarian Institute for Justice examined Supreme Court opinions between 1993 and 1996. The survey lamented the fact that the Justices least likely to strike down laws infringing civil and economic liberties were President Clinton's appointees, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, who voted to uphold Government power in two-thirds of the cases examined. But the inadvertent corollary of the study was the identification of the most activist Justices as Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas, all of whom voted to second-guess the executive and legislative branches three-quarters of the time. In the most hotly contested constitutional cases of our day, involving Congress's ability to pass affirmative-action programs, or to construct voting districts for the benefits of racial minorities or to regulate gun control or campaign finance, the conservative Justices have become the partisans of judicial activism and the liberal Justices, Ginsburg most of all, have become the partisans of judicial restraint.
Because of President Clinton's understandable inclination to promote his first Supreme Court nominee, and at the same time to appoint the first female Chief Justice in the history of the United States, Justice Ginsburg, who is 64, is increasingly mentioned as a candidate to replace Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 73, if he should choose to retire during a Democratic Administration. And the same qualities that make it very unlikely that Ginsburg will ever be a visionary leader as an Associate Justice -- her minimalism, her jurisprudential as well as personal restraint and her emphasis on avoiding constitutional conflicts rather than engaging them -- might make her an effective Chief Justice for a divided Court.
Since her nomination to the court, I've experienced with Justice Ginsburg something like what Nicholson Baker describes in the chronicle of his search for John Updike: she remains, always and everywhere, just out of reach. When Justice Byron White retired in 1993, some of Ginsburg's feminist colleagues were lukewarm about her Supreme Court candidacy on the grounds that her jurisprudence was too conservative and her vision of equal-treatment feminism not radical enough. Like some other commentators, I suggested that she might be an ideal candidate for a President who identified himself as a New Democrat and sought to wean liberals from the excesses of the Warren Court. For although her political instincts were liberal, she had been, as an appellate judge, the model of judicial restraint.
After her nomination, she sent me a generous note, fanning my hopes of becoming a judicial Boswell. ("You planted the idea," she wrote. "I'll try hard to develop it.") But grandiose visions of intimate conversations about judicial restraint over tea in the Justices' dining room were quickly abandoned, and with the exception of the encounter at the opera, I had no further contact with her until last spring, when I wrote to ask whether she might agree to be interviewed.
Justice Ginsburg replied, as she does in many of her judicial opinions, by trying to delay the decision until another day. "Like Scarlett," she wrote, "I'll think about it tomorrow." She then suggested that if I could put off the article for a little while, she would give me an exclusive interview in 2010. When I asked, in the meantime, for a tour of her chambers, she invited me to stop by on the Friday after the last day of the term, a few moments before she was due to leave for the Glyndebourne Festival in England to see "The Marriage of Figaro."
Justice Ginsburg has cloistered herself on the second floor of the Supreme Court, above the rest of her colleagues: she consolidated a set of rooms that had previously been used by retired Justices and their clerks, creating a space far larger than the first-floor suite that traditionally falls to a junior Justice. Ushered in from the antechamber, I found Justice Ginsburg standing near the desk of her cool, gray chambers. There was a black-granite table, airy beige curtains and a Joseph Albers painting, "On Tideland," a gray and red abstraction on loan from the National Museum of American Art. "Elegance is refusal," Diana Vreeland observed, and as Justice Ginsburg greeted me cautiously, it was hard not to be struck by her improbable glamour. Scarcely more than five feet tall, in a turquoise Chinese-silk jacket with matching wide-legged pants, her black hair pulled tightly back in a ponytail, she looked like an exquisite figurine.
With the unearthly self-possession of Jacqueline Kennedy conducting a White House tour, Justice Ginsburg showed me her favorite photographs. Here she is with Luciano Pavarotti at the Italian Embassy. Here she is with her dear friend Justice Antonin Scalia, after their joint appearance in "Ariadne auf Naxos" at the Washington Opera: he is wearing knee breeches and a wig; she has a silver Marschallin's dress and a lace fan. Here she is with Justice Scalia in India, sitting on top of an elephant of the maharajah of Rajasthan: she has sunglasses on and a kerchief around her head; he is wearing a jaunty Hawaiian shirt. Here is a signed photograph from President Clinton, taken on the day of her nomination. "To Justice Ginsburg," it reads. "What a day this was." We talked more about the operas she was going to see in England, which was the only topic that seemed safe to broach. Suddenly, the tour was over, and with a little wave, after inviting me to browse through her chambers at my leisure, Justice Ginsburg opened a private door near her desk and vanished.
Finding myself alone, I perused her bookshelves with some embarrassment. There were many books about civil procedure; but there were also a surprising number of popular books about contemporary feminism, including Deborah Tannen's "Talking From 9 to 5" and Anita Hill and Emma Jordan's "Race, Gender and Power in America." There was a shrine to Puccini, with Art Nouveau posters from the early 20th century. Soon Justice Ginsburg's secretary walked in. The Justice had telephoned from the car, she said, and wanted to call my attention to one photograph in particular. It shows her son-in-law with her infant grandson. That, the Justice wanted me to know, was her dream for the future.
At the time, I took the comment to be a platitude about the joys of grandchildren; but a little later, I realized that Justice Ginsburg may have been saying something more subtle about the transformation of sex roles. Soon after she joined the Court, I recalled, she had introduced herself, as new Justices traditionally do, by granting an interview to The Docket Sheet, a newsletter for Court employees. Toni House, the Court's public-information officer, asked her why she had agreed to a flexible schedule for one of her law clerks, David Post. Ginsburg replied that when Post applied for a clerkship, he was caring for his two small children during the day, so that his wife could sustain a demanding job as an economist. "I thought, 'This is my dream of the way the world should be,' " Ginsburg enthused. "When fathers take equal responsibility for the care of their children, that's when women will be truly be liberated."
Many of Ginsburg's feminist ideals seem to have been shaped by the experience of her own happy marriage to Martin Ginsburg, a tax professor at Georgetown Law School who is also a tax lawyer at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. For the past 43 years, the Ginsburgs' marriage has been one of the more inspiring advertisements for the possibility of connubial equality and mutual respect. "I hate Marty Ginsburg," Roger Wilkins, an American-history professor at George Mason University, said during a joint appearance with the Ginsburgs at a panel on balancing public and private life, held in May at Wheaton College. "It's not because in a town known for its ephemeral fashions, he's carrying on this lifelong love affair with this wonderful woman. It's because he cooks." Wilkins added: "The culture in black America is 'Why can't you be like Mike?' In my house it's 'Why can't you be like Marty?' "
Martin Ginsburg does indeed cook -- he taught himself by reading Escoffier while serving in the Army at Fort Sill, Okla. -- and he takes pleasure in challenging traditional sex roles by preparing elaborate banquets in the classical style for Justice Ginsburg's clerks, colleagues and friends. "Just before the President's State of the Union address on Feb. 4," Justice Ginsburg boasted during a recent speech, the nine Justices and their spouses "enjoyed a delectable dinner in the Justices' dining room, catered by volunteer superchefs Mary Kennedy and Marty Ginsburg." ("Justice Thomas," she added, "won the annual betting about how long the address would go.")
Sitting side by side onstage during the Wheaton forum on public and private life, the Ginsburgs played off each other with deadpan affection. "As a general rule," Martin Ginsburg announced, "my wife does not give me any advice about cooking, and I do not give her any advice about the law. This seems to work quite well on both sides." The Ginsburgs were asked how their daughter and son benefited or suffered from having dual-career parents. (Jane, 42, is a professor of copyright law at Columbia; James, 32, is a producer of classical-music recordings in Chicago.) Justice Ginsburg referred the questioner to a recent book, "Mothers and Daughters," in which she posed with Jane, sitting cross-legged on the floor of her bedroom, in gray pants and a navy blue sweatshirt that read "Super Diva!"
"When Jane was having her first child in Paris, it was a difficult birth, and she was feeling rotten," Ginsburg recalled. "And she called. And we were on the phone for hours. But the idea that she would call me, and not her best friend, to talk her out of what almost every woman goes through soon after childbirth, when you're feeling ungainly, and maybe the child isn't breast-feeding, and you feel you're getting rejected and unattractive. When she was at that moment, she called me. So I figure that I'd done something right." Ginsburg's impassive face lighted up with a small, warm smile, and her husband added the punch line. "I must tell you," he said, "that she called collect."
Justice Ginsburg's frequent public references to her husband and her children may seem unusual for a Supreme Court Justice. But the experience of raising a family in the 1960's and 1970's while distinguishing herself as a scholar and an advocate has clearly shaped her jurisprudence as well as her politics. The story of Ginsburg's own early experiences with sex discrimination has often been told. She graduated at the top of her class at Columbia Law School in 1959, after transferring from Harvard when her husband got a job in New York. Although she had been recommended for a clerkship with Felix Frankfurter, then approaching the end of his 23-year tenure on the Court, he refused to hire her when he learned, in her words, that "I was married and had a 5-year-old daughter." After clerking for Judge Edmund Palmieri of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, in 1963 she began teaching civil procedure at Rutgers Law School in Newark. With typical industry and attention to detail, Ginsburg learned Swedish and co-wrote the leading academic treatise on the Swedish code of civil procedure.
In 1972, the first year Title IX of the Education Amendments was extended to academic institutions, Ginsburg was invited back to Columbia to teach civil procedure and sex-discrimination law. At a recent Columbia event honoring Ginsburg, Diane Zimmerman, one of her protegees who now teaches at New York University Law School, recalled that the handful of women on law faculties in the early 1970's often had decided it was necessary to forgo family life. "These women were awe-inspiring, but not people we would have felt comfortable emulating," Zimmerman said. By contrast, she continued, "we had Ruth Ginsburg, who had kids she liked to talk about, a husband that she loved and admired, who was accessible to us as a model for the possibility of being a woman and not having to engage in those strategies if they weren't comfortable for us."
In 1971, Ginsburg had founded the women's rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union, for which she supervised the selection of cases and the writing of briefs, and argued six cases before the Supreme Court. As an advocate, she sought to convince the Court that legislation ostensibly designed to benefit or protect women could often have the opposite effect. She chose to represent a series of male plaintiffs who had been denied benefits earmarked for women, urging the Court to articulate a legal rule for evaluating sex discrimination that could be applied neutrally to either sex. Although Ginsburg was attacked by feminists in the 1980's as "phallocentric" and "assimilationist" for having represented male plaintiffs in the 1970's, her universalist perspective was highly appealing to male judges, who had to be educated to see the unfairness of sex distinctions that had long been accepted.
"It's the classical Jewish way of arguing against intolerance -- that you argue against exceptions from fairness not in the name of the particular exception but in the name of the general principle," says Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, who is a close friend of Ginsburg. Wieseltier recalls that once, when Ginsburg was consoling him over the death of his father, she spoke movingly of the death of her own father. She then sent him a copy of a letter written in 1916 by Henrietta Szold, a founder of Zionism in America. By Jewish tradition, only male children can recite the Kaddish, a prayer of mourning for parents. If there are no male survivors, a stranger may act as a substitute, but Szold gently rejected a male friend's offer to say Kaddish in her place after her father died. "I believe that the elimination of women from such duties was never intended by our law and custom," Szold wrote. "Women were freed from positive duties when they could not perform them, but not when they could." Wieseltier compares Ginsburg's objections to sex discrimination in Jewish law to her objection to sex discrimination in American law. "In both cases," Wieseltier says, "she was as much an aggrieved rationalist as an aggrieved woman."
One of Ginsburg's former A.C.L.U. colleagues, Kathleen Peratis, testified during Ginsburg's confirmation hearings that her restrained litigation strategy in the 1970's anticipated her restrained judicial philosophy in the 1980's. "She insisted that we attempt to develop the law one step at a time," Peratis said. "Present the Court with the next logical step, she urged us, and then the next and then the next. Don't ask them to go too far too fast, or you'll lose what you might have won. She often said, 'It's not time for that case.' We usually followed her advice, and when we didn't, we invariably lost."
Deborah Jones Merritt, a former Ginsburg clerk who teaches at Ohio State University, makes a similar point. "I've heard her say that she was a particular admirer of Thurgood Marshall's strategy for challenging segregation in the courts," Merritt told me. "He started not in the hardest case, challenging segregation in elementary schools, but in the easier cases, involving professional schools."
When she recalls her landmark cases today, Justice Ginsburg inevitably focuses on the individual stories rather than abstract questions of social justice. At a recent forum at Columbia University about sex discrimination, Ginsburg told the story of Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, the case that she said "epitomized for me all that we were doing in the 70's. It concerned a young man whose young wife died in childbirth and left an infant in his sole care. He pledged that he would be the primary caretaker of the child, and he sought Social Security benefits to aid him in that endeavor, but the benefits were for women only. They were labeled mothers' benefits."
At this point, Ginsburg's eyes began to sparkle and she became, in her regal way, passionate. "This led to a unanimous judgment in favor of claim; but the Justices divided in their reasoning," she continued. "The majority thought it was discrimination against the woman as wage earner, because she paid the same Social Security taxes but her family received different benefits. A few thought it was discrimination against the man, because he didn't have the same opportunity to give personal care to the baby as the woman would have had. And one, my Chief, thought it was discrimination against the baby." The audience laughed on cue. Ginsburg concluded by noting that "the baby in that story is today in his last year of college and has recently applied to Columbia Law School."
In cases involving women's issues in the 70's, the Court, Ginsburg argues, "largely trailed and mirrored changing patterns in society -- most conspicuously, the emergence of the two-career family." For this reason, and somewhat surprisingly, Ginsburg views her landmark victories in the 70's as an example of judicial restraint rather than judicial activism. "For the most part, the Court was neither out in front of, nor did it hold back, social change," she said in a recent speech. "Instead, what occurred was what engineers might call a positive feedback process, with the Court functioning as an amplifier -- sensitively responding to, and perhaps moderately accelerating, the pace of change."
Before her appointment to the court, Ginsburg famously criticized Roe v. Wade on the grounds it tried to lead, rather than follow, a social revolution in attitudes toward abortion, and in the process precipitated a political backlash. Legislatures in the 1970's were beginning to liberalize their abortion laws, she argued in her Madison lecture at N.Y.U. Law School in 1993. If the Court had merely struck down the extreme antiabortion restriction at issue in the case, rather than presuming to devise an elaborate trimester scheme that governed all abortion restrictions in all states, she said, the decision might have been far less controversial and the political momentum for liberalizations might have continued.
On the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg has continued to style herself as a cautious codifier of popular opinion rather than a crusader for social reform. Yet it could be argued that in cases involving sex discrimination, she has shown some crusading zeal. In a recent speech at the University of Virginia, Ginsburg herself called the decision ordering the Virginia Military Institute to admit women "a stunning change from the Court's rulings in 1873 that women could be excluded from the practice of law in Illinois without offense to the Federal Constitution and, in 1961, that women in Florida need not be placed on lists from which jurors are drawn."
How can Ginsburg's V.M.I. decision, which represents the culmination of her vision as an advocate, be reconciled with her general commitment to judicial restraint? "It just can't be reconciled," says Gerald Gunther of Stanford Law School, a former teacher of Ginsburg's and a close friend. "She clearly is a crusader on that issue." The broadest way of reading the V.M.I. decision is that it enacts the Equal Rights Amendment by judicial fiat, by declaring that sex discrimination is almost (but not quite) as constitutionally suspicious as racial discrimination. "There is no practical difference between what has evolved and the E.R.A.," Ginsburg told students at the University of Virginia, adding, "I would still like it as a symbol to see the E.R.A. in the Constitution for my granddaughter."
If the V.M.I. decision is indeed seen as the "practical equivalent" of the E.R.A., then all sorts of sex distinctions that continue to have widespread popular support, from single-sex private schools to the exclusion of women from military combat, might be called into question as well. This would represent precisely the same short-circuiting of a hotly contested political debate that Ginsburg has decried in other contexts.
There is, however, another way of reading the V.M.I. decision. Like all of Ginsburg's opinions, it resolves the question before the Court, while studiously refusing to speculate about other cases in the future. Viewed as a belated judicial recognition of a transformation in popular attitudes toward public military academies, the V.M.I. decision might be seen as more symbolic than revolutionary. If the V.M.I. case comes to stand for the proposition that public, single-sex military academies are unconstitutional while the exclusion of women from combat is permissible, it would be logically puzzling but of a piece with the rest of Ginsburg's jurisprudence, which is more concerned about case-by-case particularism than philosophical consistency. In Ginsburg's own mind, the V.M.I. decision seems to represent nothing more than the codification of a social revolution in the role of military academies that had occurred a decade earlier. When Phyllis Schlafly, who advocates a more traditional role for women, criticized the V.M.I. decision, singling out Ginsburg's "activist determination to write her radical feminist goals into the Constitution," Ginsburg, who is unusually sensitive to public criticism, jokingly responded in a speech, "The judgment was 7-1, for goodness' sake!" And when Josiah Bunting 3d, the superintendent of V.M.I., circulated several stanzas of light verse written by an aggrieved friend of the institute, Ginsburg quoted it in the same speech: "Pilloried by politics/By unjust courts denied/Now for the Institute's true sons/Its past must be their pride." Then she added, "Many of the sons have grown up, however, and I take heart from them."
Whether or not one accepts Justice Ginsburg's notion that the V.M.I. decision is an evolutionary rather than revolutionary decision, in the rest of her jurisprudence, she appears to be the most restrained Justice on the Court. In this respect, she has shown precisely the same judicial sensibility that she displayed on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. As a Justice, and as a lower-court judge, she has demonstrated a meticulous attention to procedural details. In her careful, narrowly written opinions, there are few glimpses of Ginsburg's own policy views; instead, she scrupulously describes the relevant precedents and applies them in a terse, carefully worded way.
Above all, Ginsburg is a particularist, approaching cases from the bottom up rather than the top down. "I always think of Justice Ginsburg as a very particular person," says David Post, the former clerk, who now teaches law at Temple University. "She looks at the world as a collection of particulars. In a sense, it's a very small vision. She narrows things down. She looks at a case and says, 'What's going on; why are they suing; who are the people; what's going on in the background?' She likes to look at larger questions through the lens of smaller stories of people's lives. She wants to take individuals as individuals." In this regard, her feminist vision and her judicial sensibility are of a piece: both focus on the individual choices made by individual plaintiffs and defendants.
In the wrong hands, of course, a mission to do justice between individual parties can become a license for judges to act as platonic guardians, guided by nothing more than their personal reactions to individual cases. Ginsburg's particularism, however, is more of a sensibility than an inflexible judicial philosophy. And her judicial deliberativeness and restraint mirror her personal deliberativeness and restraint. "Mother is tremendously sentimental, but she could also be somewhat austere," Jane Ginsburg told the authors of "Mothers and Daughters." "When I did something bad, which happened often, my dad would yell, but my mother would be real quiet and I'd know she was very disappointed in me."
Ginsburg's sparse, highly compressed writing style is particular, too: reading it, one can imagine the unessential words being pared away with a fine-tip pen. "Language matters more than you can imagine," David Post says. "I've seen her agonize over individual words many times. Not terms of art, but adjectives. . . .It's very important to her to get every word to say exactly what she wants it to say, with all the connotations she wants." Leon Wieseltier puts it this way: "She's not just deliberative as a matter of principle but as a matter of temperament. A conversation with her is a special pleasure because there are no words that are not preceded by thoughts."
In speeches, Justice Ginsburg has attributed her deliberative temperament to her own mother, who admonished her constantly, once she reached her teens, to "be a lady!"
"To her, the term 'great lady' was a most honorable one," Ginsburg told the graduating class of Wheaton College. "It meant hold fast to your convictions and self-respect, be a good teacher, but don't snap back in anger. Anger, resentment, indulgence in recriminations waste time and sap energy."
Ginsburg's jurisprudence clearly reflects the influence of her law-school education and early academic experience as a teacher of civil procedure. She attended Harvard and Columbia law schools during the heyday of the legal-process movement, when scholars like Herbert Wechsler argued that lawyers could best pursue the ideal of neutrality by focusing on procedural rather than substantive questions. "Professor Wechsler was twice my teacher in law-school days," Ginsburg told a recent gathering at Columbia. "He seemed to me then, as he has ever since, to combine the power and beauty of the Greek gods Zeus and Apollo. He is my teacher still. Of all the books I use in chambers, the one I consult more than any other is Hart and Wechsler" -- the great casebook about the jurisdiction of Federal courts.
More than any of her colleagues, Ginsburg often conceals or sublimates her personal views of the merits of a case by focusing on legal process. "It is an extremely revealing fact about Ruth Ginsburg that she taught civil procedure for 17 years," notes Peter Huber, a former clerk who is now a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. "It tells you something profound. Procedure is the one area of law where your outcomes are severely limited; procedures have to be neutral precisely because they apply equally to your friends and your enemies." As a result of her "almost Talmudic reverence and respect for the process of law," Huber says, "I think she is the most apolitical liberal you can be. She has this terribly old-fashioned notion that rules can get written down or can evolve through a common-law process and can build upon each other to create a decisional fabric."
Ginsburg's emphasis on procedure has no doubt helped to sustain her longtime friendship with Antonin Scalia, which dates back to their days together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. For years, the Ginsburg and Scalia families have gathered together for a black-tie New Year's dinner at the Ginsburgs' elegant apartment in the Watergate. (Martin Ginsburg and Maureen Scalia share the cooking.) "Her emphasis on process is why she's always been on such excellent personal terms with Justice Scalia and Bob Bork," says Huber, who often joins the Ginsburgs and Scalias for New Year's dinner. "You can't feel very politically antagonistic toward someone who is centered on the process rather than the politics."
It seems fair to wonder, nevertheless, whether Ginsburg's friendship with Scalia, and her emphasis on procedure above all, has caused her to sidestep some of the most important intellectual debates on the Rehnquist Court, which are largely conducted on Scalia's terms. Scalia insists that the Court should decide cases in accordance with the original understanding of the Constitutional text. There is a vigorous debate among judges and legal scholars about whether or not the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution can be meaningfully resurrected. But because of the energy with which he presses his arguments, Scalia has forced even the Justices who reject his methodology to respond to his historical claims. For example, when Scalia, writing for the Court in June, struck down part of the gun-control law known as the Brady bill, three liberal dissenting Justices -- David Souter, John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer -- had a fierce debate with Scalia about whether the views of James Madison or Alexander Hamilton should be dismissed as eccentric and whether the constitutional legacy of the New Deal should be preserved or ignored.
Justice Ginsburg did not participate in this debate; she tends to abstain from most broad historical debates, often resorting to procedural arguments to conclude that constitutional questions should be sent back to the lower courts. Consider the Agostini case last term, which involved the constitutionality of a New York City program that sent public-school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education. Five members of the Court, at the urging of the Clinton Administration, upheld the program and overturned an opinion by William Brennan, Aguilar v. Felton, that represented the high-water mark of church-state separationism.
Rather than engaging the constitutional debate, Justice Ginsburg, in her separate dissent, focused not on the substantive meaning of the First Amendment but on a question of civil procedure. She said that Justice O'Connor had misinterpreted Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which, in her view, did not allow the Supreme Court to re-examine the 12-year-old decision. A proper application of the rules, Ginsburg concluded, "would lead us to defer reconsideration of Aguilar until we are presented with the issue in another case."
Justice Ginsburg believes, however, that deciding only the case before her, and delaying related questions until they are ripe for decision, is a quintessentially restrained position because it enables citizens, legislators and lower-court judges to disagree about important constitutional issues and to resolve their differences democratically.
Because of the respect Justice Ginsburg has earned from liberals, who appreciate her feminist advocacy, and from conservatives, who recognize her otherwise restrained sensibility, she is increasingly mentioned as a plausible candidate to succeed William Rehnquist as Chief Justice. There is no reliable evidence that Rehnquist is inclined to resign after 11 years as Chief; but Court watchers and clerks have idly speculated for the past several years that he might step down sooner rather than later. In the event that he does retire, a Democratic President might be tempted to appoint the first female Chief Justice of the United States.
Ginsburg herself has done little to discourage the speculation. In her speeches, she likes to quote from a letter by Sarah Grimke, the feminist and antislavery lecturer from South Carolina, who visited the Supreme Court in 1853. In the letter, Grimke says she was invited to sit in the Chief Justice's chair. "As I took the place," she wrote, "I involuntarily exclaimed, 'Who knows, but this chair may one day be occupied by a woman.' The brethren laughed heartily. Nevertheless, it may be a true prophecy." At this point, Ginsburg pauses and looks at the audience. "Today," she says with a little smile, "no one would laugh at that prophecy."
If President Clinton were looking for a Chief in the model of Earl Warren, a gregarious backslapper with a big heart who builds coalitions by sheer force of personality, Justice Ginsburg would not be his woman. She is, in many respects, a loner, and her opportunities for informal interactions are limited by her solitary work habits. She works most efficiently alone, and at home, often staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning for long periods of concentrated writing and thinking. "She likes to sleep late, work at home and come in when she's ready to do whatever faces her there," says David Post, her former clerk. "When the Court isn't sitting, she can come into the office between noon and 6 in the evening." By late afternoon, some of the other Justices are no longer around.
Even when she is at the Court, Ginsburg is unlikely to engage in banter, because she prefers to communicate in writing. Ginsburg's desire for precision of language, and her emphasis on "getting it right and keeping it tight," as she puts it, have not always made her popular with law clerks in other chambers. The memos that she sends commenting on the opinions of other Justices often consist of small technical suggestions and the correction of typographical errors, all marked in her precise hand with a black or red pen. This attention to technical detail dates back to her days as an advocate, when she was famous for correcting the typos in her colleagues' briefs.
Ginsburg has less personal contact with her colleagues than, for example, Justice Stephen Breyer, a more expansive personality who talks frequently to Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose chambers are next to his, and to Justice Clarence Thomas, who sits next to him on the bench. Nevertheless, Ginsburg puts a high premium on cordial relationships with her fellow Justices because of her passion for collegiality. "In recent terms, the Court has been remarkably collegial, deciding cases unanimously at least twice as often as we divided 5-4," Ginsburg told the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June. "The tone of our opinions, too, has become less adversarial, with hardly a nasty comment so far this term." Ginsburg is closer to some Justices than others -- she especially admires William Rehnquist, whom she calls "my Chief," but is reportedly frostier to Justice Anthony Kennedy. Even so, her ideal of collegiality has helped to sustain her mutually respectful relationship with all her colleagues.
Asked recently at the American University about her relationship with Sandra Day O'Connor, Ginsburg replied: "Justice O'Connor provided grand aid to me when I arrived. She was like a big sister. She knows my Chief very well: they were classmates in law school and later lived in the same town. She told me many things that made my life easier that first year." Had the presence of two women changed the Court? a student asked. Ginsburg replied: "Our robing room, since the 1993 term, has a women's bathroom equal in size to the men's. But the troops are not yet fully adjusted to the change. Twice this term, distinguished advocates arguing before the Court -- a Harvard Law School professor and the Acting Solicitor General" -- Laurence Tribe and Walter Dellinger, respectively -- "began their responses to my questions, 'Well, Justice O'Connor.. . .' Last time that happened, Sandra smiled and crisply said: 'She's Justice Ginsburg. I'm Justice O'Connor." Although the academic from New York and the former state legislator from Arizona are too temperamentally different to be close friends, according to clerks, they appreciate each other's achievements and support.
It would be foolish, in any event, to select the next Chief Justice on the basis of his or her capacity to schmooze. The most important power of a Chief Justice is the power, whenever he or she votes with the majority, to decide which Justice will write the opinion for the Court. (When the Chief Justice dissents, the most senior Justice in the majority has the power of assignment.) From a purely tactical point of view, the most pressing challenge facing a liberal Chief Justice could be to use the power of assignment to win over the swing Justices, Kennedy and O'Connor, and to insure that opinions are written as narrowly rather than as broadly as possible. Because of the narrowness of her focus, Ginsburg seems well positioned to find common ground with her conservative colleagues. "It helps in building collegiality if you don't take zealous positions, if you don't write in an overwrought way, if you state your position logically and without undue passion," Ginsburg said in a recent speech. "Another way is to ask, 'Is this conflict really necessary?' Perhaps there is a ground, maybe a procedural ground, on which everyone can agree, so that the decision can be unanimous, saving the larger question for another day."
Ginsburg, in short, would most likely be far more of an impartial Chief than a crusading one. "Maintaining the kind of respect that the Court has, I think, is the greatest challenge that's facing the Court at this time," she said at a recent forum at Columbia Law School. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine her not wanting to leave her mark on the Court in some way. "She's very long term," says David Post, "and she's always considering the implications of small moves. For example, there's a little doctrine in international civil procedure. She'd say, 'In order to make sure that's shored up, we'll drop this footnote in a case that has nothing to do with international civil procedure.' Why she wanted to preserve that little doctrine, I never knew. But I was persuaded of the integrity of her vision."
In his generous eulogy at Brennan's funeral, Justice Souter said: "The life of the man is over. So is the liberal era when Justice Brennan's voice was the voice of the Supreme Court." Perhaps Justice Ginsburg's quieter and more restrained voice best represents the liberal era of the future. Or, to put the point another way, now that liberals have stopped relying on the Supreme Court to fight their battles for them, perhaps their goal, like Ginsburg's, should be a Court that is as legalistic as possible, suspicious of grand theories, deferential to the political branches and more given to small steps than sweeping gestures. This is hardly an exhilarating model for the next Chief Justice; but Ginsburg's example shows us that for better rather than for worse, the age of judicial exhilaration is over.
Just before she left me alone in her chambers, Justice Ginsburg paused before a stack of books on her desk. She wanted a judicial biography to read during her flight to London and had recently borrowed two from the Court's library. One was Joseph J. Ellis's "American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson," the story of the remote aristocrat who was so suspicious of Federalist judges that he insisted that the President had the power to appeal directly to the people, over the objections of the Supreme Court. The other was Jean Edward Smith's "John Marshall: Definer of a Nation," about the brilliant but personally unassuming Chief Justice and foe of Jefferson who won over his colleagues by intellectual force, fought against class distinctions on the bench by pioneering the use of black judicial robes and reinvented the Court in his own image. Which to choose? After a suitable pause, Justice Ginsburg said she thought she would take the Marshall. It was then, without further explanation, that she disappeared.

HEADLINE: The View From: Stamford;
From Sleepy Town To High-Rise City

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
AN often-heard plaint of Stamford residents, on returning to the city years after having moved away, is that they no longer recognize their home town. Indeed, it is not uncommon even for those who still live in the city to get lost amid the high-rise glass towers that seem to have sprung up without design, without symmetry.
But perhaps that is not surprising. No city or town in the state has changed so drastically as Stamford has over the last 20 years. And, following a respite in new construction because of the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, which sent the office building vacancy rate as high as 30 percent, Stamford seems to be on the verge of a new wave of high-rise building. 
 "Stamford was a small sleepy town, and now it's a fairly big city," said Sandra Goldstein, the executive director of the city's Downtown Special Services District. "And, overall, things are a lot better."
Not everyone would agree. While aware that something had to be done following the exodus of companies like Yale & Towne, which once employed 10,000 people, more than a few residents believe that Stamford went too far. In the process, they feel the city surrendered much of its charm.
The transformation of the city from an industrial-based economy to service-oriented companies has created thousands of jobs of a different kind. It has also enriched the city with more tax revenue, though the promises of lower taxes as a result of the development has never materialized.
And the explosive business growth has also put a strain on city services, sent housing prices skyrocketing, resulted in the demolition of thousands of structures -- many of them landmarks -- and created immense traffic problems on the Connecticut Turnpike, the Merritt Parkway and secondary roadways like High Ridge and Long Ridge roads.
Onetime graceful boulevards like Summer Street and Bedford Street are now high-speed thoroughfares designed to get cars in and out of the city as quickly as possible.
Even civic leaders and corporate boosters who exult over statistics like a 7 percent vacancy rate in office space, also concede that transportation problems are bound to get worse soon.
By next year, about 2,000 employees will have moved into the Swiss Bank Corporation's North American headquarters, under construction near the Connecticut Turnpike and the Stamford Transportation Center. More will follow when the next two phases of the project, encompassing more than one million square feet, are finished. Three developers have also said they plan to build office buildings of more than 20 stories in downtown Stamford.
"If all of these projects go through, we're talking about another 10,000 workers," said Joseph McGee, vice president of public policy and programs for the Stamford Area Commerce and Industry Association. "But all of this growth is appropriate under the city's master plan."
The continued development apparently will be an issue in the November mayoral election. The Republican candidate, Charles Klein, a relative unknown who is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Dannel P.Malloy, said last month that the city is being turned into a "concrete canyon" and vowed to stop "high-density overdevelopment."
Not surprisingly, none of the officials of the Commerce and Industry Association, the Stamford Chamber of Commerce or the Stamford Downtown Special Services District interviewed opposed increased development.
"It's the way people get to work that is the problem," said Mr. McGee, commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development before joining the Commerce and Industry Association. "It is critical that more people come to work by train and bus. As it is, 95 percent drive to work alone. If we can reduce traffic on I-95 by 5 percent, it would make a big difference. But Metro-North has to provide more frequent intrastate service. That is the key."
So, too, is an adequate supply of workers -- unemployment is just 3 percent -- frozen out by by high housing costs in Stamford and a decline in the number of rental units. (When more units are built, they are invariably luxury apartments.) Presently, about two-thirds, or 60,000, of the people who work in Stamford live outside the city, many of them more than 30 miles away.
Twenty years ago, Stamford was at a crossroads of sorts following an urban renewal program that had resulted in the relocation of about 1,200 families and the displacement of more than 300 businesses. Only one major international corporation, GTE, had built a headquarters building in the city (Pitney Bowes has been headquartered in Stamford since 1920), while one other, Champion International, was planning to build downtown.
During the next decade, scores of companies, taking advantage of tax packages, moved into the city. Some, following the lead of the Xerox Corporation, built spacious headquarters on campus-like settings in quiet suburban, and even farm, settings, to the consternation of environmentalists.
As retail business in downtown Stamford continued to decline, a new fortress-like enclosed shopping mall, known as the Stamford Town Center -- though it is anything but -- opened in the early 1980's. With more than 100 shops, it has thrived, to the detriment of many long-established and locally owned downtown stores. This was particularly evident on Bedford Street, where upscale shops shut down and were replaced by an eclectic mixture of discount stores and other nondescript shops.
In recent years, another part of downtown, around the Old Town Hall, has enjoyed a renaissance, largely because of the efforts of the Downtown Special Services District, headed by Ms. Goldstein, formerly a member of the city's Board of Representatives.
New restaurants and nightclubs have proliferated, as have new movie theaters, and the city, once dormant at night, is drawing people in from nearby cities and towns in Fairfield and Westchester counties.
The Stamford Center for the Performing Arts is also thriving at two sites on Atlantic Street: the Rich Forum and the recently renovated Palace Theater. And the new University of Connecticut Stamford branch, which will be moved next year from its North Stamford location to the former site of the Bloomingdale's store on Washington Boulevard, is expected to further enhance the downtown cultural scene.
For all the changes, something has been lost, though some neighborhoods like Springdale and Shippan have remained relatively unchanged. In the literal sense, it is 700 buildings, many of them graceful homes that lined Summer and Bedford streets for more than half century.
"It's been a cataclysmic upheaval," said Renee Kahn, the director of the city's Historic Neighborhoods Preservation Program, who has fought, mostly unsuccessfully, to preserve landmarks. "Stamford has become a town without a visible past and with no sense of community."
Among the landmark buildings that were demolished were the National Guard Armory, from which servicemen went off to both World Wars; the Roger Smith Hotel, once the city's main hostelry; the former City Hall on Atlantic Street, and the Salvation Army and Visiting Nurses Association buildings. The Old Town Hall, the Post Office and the old Advocate building "are the only landmarks left," Ms. Kahn said, "and if we lose them, we've lost everything from the past."
Even Neil Sherman, the former president of the Stamford Chamber of Commerce, while lauding the city's economic resurgence, said that the city seemed to lack a collective community spirit.
"What development has occurred has been imposed on the community," said Mr. Sherman, now the executive director of the Coastal Fairfield County Convention and Visitor Bureau in Norwalk. "And now, the largest issue for a successful Stamford is to develop a sense of community, something that is now missing."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

A New Mortgage On a Condo
 
Q. I am going to refinance my condominium. What kind of closing expenses can be eliminated or reduced if I get a new mortgage with a lower interest rate from the bank that holds my current mortgage? . . . Victor Maltsev, Rego Park, Queens.
A. Douglas F. Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said there were several ways a homeowner might be able to save money on a refinancing, regardless of whether the refinancing was with the current lender or a new one. 
 The most significant potential source of savings, Mr. Wasser said, are New York City's mortgage recording taxes. Ordinarily, he said, a borrower must pay a tax of 1.75 percent of mortgage amounts under $500,000 and 1.875 percent on mortgages over that amount when the new mortgage is recorded.
"The tax is actually one-quarter of one percent higher, but the lender, not the homeowner, generally pays this additional portion," Mr. Wasser said.
Mortgage taxes can be reduced or even eliminated, however, when a borrower and lender enter into what is known as a "consolidation, modification and extension agreement." Such an agreement, Mr. Wasser said, essentially results in an amendment of the existing mortgage to conform with the terms of the refinancing. If the refinancing is only for the existing balance of the old mortgage, he said, a new mortgage is unnecessary and no tax is due because tax is only imposed when a new mortgage is recorded.
If the borrower wants to borrow more than the balance of the old mortgage, then he or she signs a new mortgage only for the difference. The old mortgage and the new one are then consolidated, with tax being imposed only on the new amount being borrowed.
Additional savings may be available on a refinancing, Mr. Wasser said, if the borrower obtained title insurance on the property within the previous 10 years. If he has done so -- and if the borrower makes that fact known to the new title insurance company -- the company may charge a discounted premium on the new policy.
Mr. Wasser said that using the existing lender on a refinancing might lead to some additional savings on processing fees. However, he said, the borrower should insure that such savings are worth forgoing more competitive loan packages that may be offered by other lenders.
"I recommend a consultation with a good residential mortgage broker," Mr. Wasser said.
 
Giving Interest On Security Deposits
 
Q. I am subletting an apartment from a co-op sponsor. Are sponsors who have more than six apartments required to give their tenants interest on security deposits? . . . Nelson Acotts, the Bronx.
A. Paul M. Gulielmetti, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that the state's General Obligations Law requires that security deposits advanced for the rental or use of apartments in buildings containing six or more family dwelling units must be deposited in an interest-bearing account.
"I can find nothing in the case law that would exempt rentals within co-op buildings by sponsors, or for that matter, by unit owners, from that requirement," Mr. Gulielmetti said.
Accordingly, he said, an individual who owns and rents out even one apartment in a building with six or more residential units must deposit the tenant's security in an interest-bearing account. By law, he said, the owner is entitled to an annual administration fee equal to one percent of the amount on deposit. Any interest earned above that one percent belongs to the tenant.

HEADLINE: A French Director With a Taste for the Gritty and Unglamorous

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AS SHE SITS AND TALKS IN her agent's offices on an elegant boulevard near the Place de l'Etoile, the director Claire Denis is a long way from the remote French colonies and the working-class urban neighborhoods in which she has set each of her four feature films. But Ms. Denis navigates the distance gracefully.
She's an elfin woman with a shock of white blond hair, a small face that tenses with extreme concentration and a voice that's surprisingly bright and deep. She's also a daring filmmaker, who for the last decade has been breaking and remaking the esthetic and political codes of French cinema. 
 Her most recent film, "Nenette et Boni," which opened in New York on Friday, explores the troubled, inscrutable relationship between a disaffected teen-age brother and his pregnant younger sister as they move through the parallel economies and faltering social services of the port city of Marseilles. Beautiful, lost youth is the film's constant focus.
"My way of making films is tied to desire," says Ms. Denis, who is 49. "Not just the physical desire for another person but desire in general. All my films function as a movement toward an unknown other and toward the unknown in relations between people."
The power of this approach was evident as early as "Chocolat" (1988), the director's first feature. Loosely based on Ms. Denis's childhood in French West Africa, this story of colonial officials and their servants in the Cameroon of the 1950's centers on the mysterious and intimate tie between a young French girl and the African domestic who looks after her.
"Chocolat" made Isaak de Bankole, who played the servant, a star; it was the first of three films in which the director's eye focused, with passionate curiosity, on the intersection of European, African and West Indian cultures, and on the bodies of black men. (It also began the collaboration between Ms. Denis and her camerawoman, Agnes Goddard, who has worked on all her major films since then.)
In 1991, "No Fear, No Die" starred Mr. de Bankole and Alex Descas as partners who raise and train cocks for fights organized by a white entrepreneur in a deserted commercial zone outside Paris. Three years later came "I Can't Sleep," inspired by the true story of Thierry Paulhin, a black, gay transvestite who, with his white lover, murdered at least 20 elderly women in Paris during the 1980's. "The press called him a monster," Ms. Denis says. "My question was, Could I have been the mother of this monster, or his sister?"
Amid critical praise, "I Can't Sleep" earned the director vicious attacks in the right-wing news media, but she also received a flood of letters, she says, "from ordinary people, who felt that it spoke to the loss of social and affective ties that is perhaps the primary pain of our modern condition."
"Nenette et Boni" was born of Ms. Denis's collaboration with Gregoire Colin and Alice Houry, two young actors who starred in "U.S. Go Home," a short film she made three years ago for French television. That film is a portrait of a teen-age brother and sister growing up in a desolate Parisian suburb in the 1960's.
LIKE "CHOCOLAT" IT IS loosely autobiographical; when Ms. Denis, at the age of 13, returned with her family to France from Africa, she lived in the same suburb, or banlieu. (Later, she went to college, and then to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, the prestigious state-run film school, before a decade of working as an assistant to directors like Jacques Rivette, Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch.)
These and other suburban neighborhoods, abandoned by the French middle class, are now impoverished ghettos inhabited by immigrant communities; they're the subject of sociological speculation, political debate and the so-called films de banlieux, a new cinematic genre. Intimate, sensual and complex, "Nenette et Boni" is in part Ms. Denis's reaction to the stereotypes of the banlieux genre.
"It's a neighborhood film," she says. "Though I don't show postcard shots of the city, I wanted Marseilles to be present in the characters, in their language and way of being."
Boni (Gregoire Colin) drives a pizza truck around the streets of Marseilles; when he's not baking and serving pies, he's reveling in overwrought sexual fantasies that focus on his neighbor (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi), the voluptuous wife of a baker.
He lives with assorted friends in a house he inherited from his dead mother. One day, his sister, 15-year-old Nenette (Alice Houry), appears at his door. She has run away from school because she is pregnant; the child's father, she says, "doesn't exist." Their own father (Jacques Nolot) runs a lamp store and has problems with the mob; his attempts at paternity are useless. Nenette regards her growing middle with misery and stubborn lack of interest, but her predicament begins to startle Boni out of his daydreams.
Ms. Denis's gift is to integrate the characters so fully in their milieu that they emerge from it almost insensibly. "It's always been interesting for me to refuse the idea that everything in a film be organized around the main characters and their needs," she says. "I like the idea that viewers arrive as strangers in what appears to be a total mess, and little by little the main characters materialize."
Contemporary Marseilles is a place of conflict between a vibrant (and ancient) immigrant community and supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right-wing (and anti-immigrant) National Front party. In "Nenette et Boni," the actor Alex Descas has a small role as a black gynecologist. "Curiously, it's very rare to see that kind of role in French film," he says. "If you take the subway, or go into a cafe, or a courtroom, or a bakery, you'll see black people, Asians, Arabs. All that exists; why not show it in film? Well, for Claire, it's natural and normal."
Yet the roots of "Nenette et Boni" go deeper than politics. "When I was an adolescent I read Jean Cocteau's 'Les Enfants Terribles,' " Ms. Denis says. "Later I thought about the constant haranguing between brothers and sisters that exists alongside the unacknowledged desire for this bond of childhood to be their real love story, the one that binds them forever."
Growing up the eldest of four siblings, she only realized later, she says, that "the bond between brothers and sisters is troubling and mysterious, a blood tie as in ancient Greek tragedy."
Mr. Colin's performance as Boni is at once raging, sex-starved and tender. The role was written for him. "What I love about working with Claire," he says, "is that she lets the actor imbue the character with everything he is at a given moment. She never gives orders; she offers a critique of what she's seen."
This approach has much to do with Ms. Denis's faith in her medium. "Cinema has this incredible way of making us feel what psychology can't explain," she says. "You can read 15 books about serial killers, but that has nothing to do with the way you may look at people in the subway, or your own brother, or your mother, that mysterious element that makes you sense that what unites us, as human beings, is our opacity for each other. Cinema is made with light and shadow, but the beauty of light is that it delimits shadow. And that element of shadow is the part of cinema I'd like to continue exploring."

HEADLINE: ART;
Glory Days for the Art Museum

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
ROBERT P. BERGMAN IS SURE HE IS having the last laugh. Sixteen years ago, when he left an enviable post as associate professor of fine arts at Harvard to become director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, "I got a lot of pats on my shoulder from my colleagues," he recalled recently, "a lot of 'Poor Bob, there he goes to dust off the sarcophagi.' Museums were on a trajectory to be marginalized."
Not quite. "The last 15 years have given lie to that," said a beaming Mr. Bergman, who is now director of the Cleveland Museum of Art. "This is a good time for museums." 
 That is an understatement. Gaze at the crowds at the Museum of Modern Art in New York on any Friday night. Consider the multitude of corporate party planners who vie to hold events at the Art Institute of Chicago, the lines snaking outside the National Gallery of Art's recent Picasso exhibition and the $15 ticket price the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is now charging for that same Picasso show -- possibly the highest ever for an art museum -- and the picture looks better than "good." It looks as if the 90's are the age of the art museum in the United States, perhaps even the golden age.
Undeniably, there are more of them -- more than 1,200, up 50 percent since 1970. Many musems are constructing new buildings or expanding old ones: the Modern in New York, the Getty in Los Angeles, the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, to name just a few.
While dance companies, orchestras, serious theater groups and the other "high" arts -- with the possible exception of opera -- struggle to retain their audiences, American museums are setting one new attendance record after another. In the last year, an average of nearly 17,000 people walked up the granite steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York every day, about 11 percent more than the year before. Nationwide, art museums drew an estimated 100 million visitors last year.
The attractions of art museums are many, beginning with the practical. Most charge less than the price of a movie ticket. Visitors can usually go when they want and stay as long as they like. They don't have to get dressed up. Once inside, they can choose their own path, stopping to look at something -- or not. They can talk during the "show." Children are welcome.
More profound cultural changes are also at work. People are attracted to museums because American culture is increasingly visual. Image began to reign supreme over the written and spoken word once television started to dominate the national consciousness, beginning in the 1950's, a trend reinforced by the explosion in influence of movies and video. Americans, particularly young ones, learn their news on the tube and their history in the movie theater, and what interest they have in the high arts is best satisfied by the visual richness of museums.
"Young people today are lookers, with more of a visual sense than their elders," said Michael G. Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor of American history and culture at Cornell University. "They are less likely to curl up with a book than go to see art." Picasso trumps Dickens.
Museums are also in step with another aspect of American culture: we are a nation of shoppers, and shaped behaviorally by the experience. "People are used to the shopping mall, where they can walk around and stop where they wish," said Nicholas Fox Weber, a cultural historian. "And you can do that in a museum, whereas you can't in a music or dance performance." Whether visiting the mall, holding the remote control or grazing before an open refrigerator, Americans are used to picking and choosing their own course.
And what choices they have at museums! Painting, sculpture, video, installation or decorative art; blockbusters, rotating special exhibitions or permanent collections; historical themes, current ones or controversial presentations on the social issues of the day -- all are available with a minimal commitment of money or time.
As cornucopias replete with items from prehistory through yesterday, many museums easily hold more allure than their cultural brethren. "Merce Cunningham is not going to appeal to everyone -- it's just a kind of dance that will not draw everyone," said Joan Jeffri, director of Columbia University's Research Center for Arts and Culture. "But a museum with many departments can appeal to many more people."
Many museums are doing so consciously, inviting in diverse audiences with new kinds of exhibitions and programs. Critics, for example, deplored the Modern's "High and Low," a 1990 exhibition exploring the connection between avant-garde art and popular culture -- but the public loved it, and it helped spawn many exhibitions related to popular culture and to fashion. "Much more than performing arts groups, museums have come to be perceived as democratic in orientation," said Paul DiMaggio, a sociology professor at Princeton University who has long studied arts participation.
Nowadays, of course, museums are much more than great art treasuries -- and shopping malls. They also convincingly play the part of classroom, meeting place, restaurant, playground, park bench, party palace, cinema, singles bar, conversation provocateur, travel agent, lecture hall, wine bar, and -- when a particularly compelling exhibition or event occurs -- the place to see and be seen socially.
"Forget Grand Central as metaphor for milling, dashing New York. The Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the crossroads of culture, a chockablock Breughel canvas of tourists, families, even questing singles," proclaimed a recent advertisement for the Metropolitan.
That bustling Breughel, however, does not please all art world denizens, some of whom fear that exuberance may be luring museums into overexpansion. Some institutions are already getting caught in a vicious circle: the bigger they grow, the more money they require. To cope, they are plumping up their restaurants and retail shops and expending the bulk of their effort staging tried-and-true exhibitions (read: Impressionists and Picasso) to guarantee an audience.
Equally troubling to connoisseurs, the age of museums is not to be confused with the age of art or the age of art appreciation. Much museumgoing is not about art at all. It's simply social, rather like visiting a Barnes & Noble bookstore or meeting friends for a cappuccino. It's entertainment, not enlightenment or inspiration. It's a great date, a fun family outing.
"People want more activities, rather than a place for quiet contemplation," said Douglas D. Schultz, director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. "It's gotten to the point where we have to be competitive with other venues for their entertainment dollars."
 
A Lady Named Mona Lisa And Other Blockbusters
Back in what might be described as the dark ages for museums, they were places in which the halls literally were dark, designed for contemplation and existing primarily for elite visitors. Nothing changed that as much as the blockbuster, which brought ordinary people into museums.
In popular lore, the blockbuster was fathered by the King Tutankhamen exhibition in 1977, and midwifed by Thomas Hoving, who during his time as director of the Metropolitan arranged a steady stream of them.
Actually, Mr. Kammen pointed out, a lady by the name of Mona Lisa single-handedly gave birth to the blockbuster some years earlier. In 1963, Leonardo's smiling, enigmatic masterpiece was lent by the Louvre for a brief visit to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and to the Metropolitan. She was mobbed. In New York alone, more than a million people stood in line between Feb. 7 and March 4, waiting hours to file past the painting. It was the largest crowd ever for a single painting at the Met and one of the largest crowds ever at the museum, period. Museum directors took note.
Then Tut, which went on a national tour, created a spectacle -- television coverage, riches from merchandise spinoffs and huge lines of new museumgoers in several cities. Soon, museums started seeking out these special "once in a lifetime" offerings. Today, like holidays invented by greeting card companies, they come around on a regular basis. And it is the rare large museum whose annual schedule does not contain at least one such show.
John R. Lane, who recently resigned as the director of San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, explains the thinking behind that strategy with his two-audience theory. One group comes to a museum "because it wants to be challenged and to see something new," he said. "And there's another audience, a much bigger one, that is seeking a cultural experience and doesn't want to make a mistake. It won't go to the Museum of Modern Art to see a Projects show for a new artist, but it will go to MOMA to see a Picasso show."
It is no accident that at the moment, there are at least four Picasso shows: "The Dark Mirror: Picasso and Photography" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston; "Picasso: The Engraver -- Selections From the Musee Picasso, Paris" at the Metropolitan; "The Graphic Art of Pablo Picasso" at the Orange County Museum of Art in Laguna Beach, Calif., and the early Picasso exhibit in Boston. On Nov. 8, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta joins the crowd with "Pablo Picasso: Master Works From the Museum of Modern Art."
Impressionists like Monet and Renoir and Impressionism exhibitions tie or surpass Picasso's draw, and museums deploy the word whenever possible. The Metropolitan's 1994 exhibition "Origins of Impressionism," for example, was really a realist show of canvases painted in the 1860's. Impressionism officially began in 1874.
 
A Magic Bullet Called Marketing
As blockbusters grew in number, something else was happening. Well before their cousins in the performing arts, museums discovered marketing. Some of their campaigns are not yet as sleek and sophisticated as corporate campaigns, but as the millennium looms, "museums are clearly moving into the 20th century in terms of marketing," said Robert Bailey, a vice president at Audience Insight, a market research company that works for many arts groups.
They have had to. America's entertainment economy offers an exciting new experience at seemingly every turn. With only so much time for leisure, people are constantly winnowing winners from losers. Museums have taken up the challenge in the broadest sense.
The smart ones have thus capitalized on their inherent advantages by adding others. The Albright-Knox, for one, increased its family activity days, which help children explore an art theme with a short tour, a hands-on art project, a performance and a game. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art just extended its hours until 8 P.M. five days a week and 9 P.M. on Fridays to accommodate working people, even as the Modern in New York began opening a half hour earlier, at 10:30 A.M., to accommodate tourists. In Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts -- which recently started opening seven days a week -- will not close its doors until 10:30 P.M. on Fridays during the Picasso exhibition (and 9:30 P.M. on two other days).
Many museums have improved their labeling, lighting and audio guides. They've installed more seats and parking spots. They've improved the food in more restaurants with varying ambience and prices.
"Museums are becoming more and more enjoyable," said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern. "We've made an enormous effort to become open, friendly places." Museums are now what tourism experts call destinations.
With what looks like a stroke of genius, museums have also targeted Americans where they live: at the shopping mall. The once-chaste stalls that used to hold art books and reproductions now teem with T-shirts, toys, baseballs, scarfs, playing cards, jewelry, tote bags, glassware, you name it -- often in displays that would do Bloomingdale's proud. (Nelson D. Rockefeller, who was pilloried for selling reproductions in the 1970's, would probably be amused.)
In the last five years, while gallery space at nearly 120 large museums was growing by 3 percent, the amount of space they gave to museum stores jumped by nearly 30 percent -- with good reason. Besides bringing in money, "these retail institutions have helped popularize museums," said Ms. Jeffri of Columbia.
 
Worrying About a Downside To the Museum Boom
Museums may be too popular, to some.
There is nothing sinister about mounting crowd-pleasing exhibitions or selling museum replicas. But plotting marketing strategies steals management time from art. As for the blockbusters, they are expensive, and having to offer them can lead museums to neglect or diminish whole areas of the art world, like conservation. It is well known that exhibitions of contemporary art disappoint when attendance figures are added up, even in large cities. Many museums continue to plow blithely ahead with less popular exhibitions anyway, but they may come to find that they do so at their economic peril.
"The gate is dependent on the exhibition program," said Mr. Lane, who after overseeing the move to a new San Francisco Modern two years ago had to offer exhibitions to lure 600,000 visitors a year, triple the old goal. "There is a direct relation between the exhibition program and the level of attendance, and there is a direct relationship between the level of attendance and sales at the museum store, and there is a direct relationship between the rental of space and an attractive exhibition. And the choice of exhibitions has a significant impact on the size of membership, because members get head-of-the-line privileges."
Cassandras worry that letting the box office influence programming will lead inevitably to exhibitions that sate the nation's abundant appetite for entertainment, rather than inspire. "It's a danger," conceded Mr. Bergman, who is also chairman of the American Association of Museums. "Given the economic pressures, we'll be under pressure to increase revenues, and moving down is a problem."
Marketing was on many minds at April's annual meeting of the association, whose members include historical societies and science centers as well as art museums -- and high culture's archenemy, the Walt Disney Company, was invoked many times for its ability to please crowds. Typical was a speech by a museum consultant, Kathleen Brown of Lord Cultural Resources, who said, "There are pieces of the Disney experience that are clearly resonating with people, and we need to figure out which ones to pick up."
Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan, who has less reason to worry about this than his colleagues, shudders at such thoughts. He recently lamented the situation in a voice-in-the wilderness speech to other art professionals.
As museums pressed toward more marketing, more programs and more technology, he warned: "We should pause and reflect on the occurrence of an ever so subtle but real shift in emphasis on the part of the institution itself and the public alike from the work of art to the museum itself as the primary experience. When people say, 'Let's go to the museum,' increasingly they mean something rather different from 'Let's go and look at some pictures.' "
"The trouble is," Mr. de Montebello added, "that works of art, for the most part, are not fun. In fact, they can be difficult, challenging, even provocative, and they don't yield their message in the blink of an eye -- which is what is expected of people looking to have fun. Seriousness, uplift, knowledge and, naturally, pleasure are what art museums are meant to provide."
Mr. Bergman is more concerned about something that underlies museums' quandary: the shrinking, and graying, of the art-literate audience. "Kids are not getting exposed to music and art," he complained. "We worry that people will not have a visceral reaction because they are not being exposed to it." That is critical because as long as most American museums remain private rather than public institutions, "success is tied to their ability to develop sustained relations with their audience," said Mr. Lowry. That means more emphasis on converting visitors to members.
On that score, museums have mixed track records. Overall, membership is increasing slowly -- except where there is a major blockbuster. Then, once new members are through the door for a special exhibition, the trick becomes getting them to move on to the permanent galleries and thus renew -- which is where those new installations, better labels, audio guides and other ploys come in.
The alternative, or perhaps accompanying, strategy centers on special events. People -- particularly young people -- will join a museum to obtain invitations to exclusive social events. In July, for example, the Guggenheim held two Austrian wine tasting parties. Why? Well, it was also exhibiting "From Durer to Rauschenberg: A Quintessence of Drawings, Masterworks From the Albertina and the Guggenheim." It was a reach, but at least there was an art element; many museums are simply giving parties in their galleries.
These challenges do not undermine the fact that museums are on a high. But they do suggest there are tough choices to make about sustaining it.
Mr. Lowry, of the Modern, is an unalloyed optimist. Sitting in his sleek office overlooking the museum's sculpture court, he bristled when asked if these were gilded times. "Golden age implies a dark age before and a falloff in the future," he said. "I'm not convinced of the former premise or the latter. I think we're in a remarkable moment, which can be sustained over time." But it will, by common consent, take some work.

HEADLINE: The Problem: Getting There From Here

BYLINE: By JAMES LOMUSCIO 

 BODY:
OF all the projects and programs aimed at improving transportation in Connecticut over the past 20 years, the single most important event came by way of accident, a tragic one. It happened on June 28, 1983. At 1:30 A.M. that day a 100-foot northbound section of the Mianus River Bridge on the Connecticut Turnpike collapsed. Three people died and three more were injured as vehicles plunged into the shallow river in Greenwich.
Nearby residents would later say they heard some type of loud rattling days before as trucks traveled the bridge. And along with shock and outrage came endless questions. Was the Mianus River Bridge, which carried about 90,000 vehicles a day, an exception to an otherwise sound system, or was it symptomatic of a transportation system that for too long had been allowed to deteriorate? Soon, the Connecticut Department of Transportation was hurled into a crisis and put under national scrutiny. 
 "You have to look at Mianus as the single, biggest event because of the byproducts that came out of it," said Harold Harris, Deputy Commissioner of the Transportation Department. "It focused attention on the fact that we had allowed our infrastructure to deteriorate considerably."
How had poor maintenance left the state's roads and major thoroughfares dangerous? What was the role of the State Department of Transportation -- formed in 1969 to take over from the State Department of Highways in existence since 1895 -- in this life and death matter?
Actually, an infrastructure fund for transportation had been set up by the legislature around the time the new Department of Transportation was established to unite the Department of Aeronautics, the Connecticut Transportation Authority and the Commission of Steamship Terminals, as well as the Department of Highways.
But Connecticut's financial woes in the 70's refocused priorities. Dedicated transportation funds were funneled back into the state's general fund, "to pay other bills," said Mr. Harris. The situation got little attention until the Mianus River Bridge collapsed.
What followed was the General Assembly and then Gov. William A. O'Neill formulating and passing in February of 1984 a 10-year, $5.5 billion Transportation Infrastructure Renewal Program. The money was earmarked specifically for maintaining and improving the state's transportation system, including 364 structurally deficient bridges owned by towns and cities. The fund received money from a variety of sources, including gasoline taxes, Federal grants and general fund transfers.
Along with rehabilitating existing roads, the state moved ahead with new construction projects including: a flyover connector from eastbound Interstate 84 to northbound Interstate 91 in Hartford; a new Charter Oak Bridge connecting East Hartford and Hartford; the extension of Route 9, the central Connecticut expressway; the construction of high-occupancy vehicle, or H.O.V., lanes on Interstate 91 North and Interstate 84 east of Hartford; the completion of the first section of Super 7 in Norwalk, a road that has been the center of debate and legal wrangles in Wilton for more than 20 years, and the opening of Interstate 291 in Manchester in September of 1994, which marked the completion of Connecticut's Interstate system.
Meanwhile, the state's rail service got a long-overdue overhaul. In 1985 the Transportation Department and the Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York joined forces to create the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
"Again, it allowed for the targeting of resources to help what had become a very bad railroad," said Mr. Harris. "There was a time when the wheels were literally falling off some of the trains. By creating the infrastructure program, we could invest more than $1 billion in rails and buses over the last decade."
The creation of Metro-North had a significant impact on southwestern Connecticut. Today, about 90 percent of the region's commuters to New York City ride the train. In 1990 the state initiated another commuter rail service, Shore Line East, which provides service between Old Saybrook and New Haven.
But with all the changes, the biggest challenge facing Connecticut seems to remain out of the Transportation Department's control: increased intrastate road traffic.
"Since 1973, highway travel has increased by 84 percent while the total road mileage has increased by less than 3 percent," says Susan Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department.
In spite of the high-occupancy vehicle lanes, the Federal Clean Air Act and carpooling initiatives like Metropool in Stamford, Rideworks in New Haven and the Rideshare Company in Windsor, not to mention corporate initiatives for employees to find alternate means to work, more vehicles are on the road. And many of them are gas-guzzling, four-wheel-drive, truck-type vehicles.
In fact, the number of registered motor vehicles in the state has grown at a rate that has outpaced population, and transportation officials now say Interstate 95 is at 180 percent of the rush hour capacity for which it was designed. Twenty years ago, it was said to be at 80 percent. Even the elimination of tolls -- phased out after a toll booth accident that killed seven people in Stratford in 1983 -- has not accelerated the rush hour commute. At the same time, says Ms. Reynolds, "we're not building any new roads."
"In the next 25 years, I would be surprised if you'll see more than 25 miles of new highway," said Emil Frankel, Commissioner of Transportation under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. "You'll see selective improvements, but there definitely won't be a widening of I-95 or the Merritt Parkway."
Mr. Frankel noted that while the state's transportation system is now one of the best in the Northeast, the state cannot become complacent. He says his biggest concern right now is a movement to reduce the gasoline tax. He said the gas-tax cut would starve the transportation system while encouraging more people to drive. To generate more transportation revenue and to discourage more single-occupancy vehicles at drive time, Mr. Frankel even suggested reinstituting tolls.
"Not barricade tolls, but some kind of electronic toll technology," said Mr. Frankel, who is now a lawyer at Day, Berry & Howard in Stamford. "We should even consider instituting user fees to create revenue."
Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut, works with the Coastal Corridor Coalition, a group of business, civic and environmental organizations from Branford to Greenwich. The group focuses on traffic's impact on local economies and their quality of life.
Mr. Bruhl blames increased traffic over the past 20 years on a phenomenon known as "edge cities," communities such as Stamford that have burgeoned outside of New York.
"Where they are commuting now is to Stamford, not Manhattan," he says about the intrastate traffic from as far away as New Haven.
But the transportation system designed in the 1950's and 60's was for a different Connecticut, one where factory workers commuted to Bridgeport and corporate riders as far east as Westport took the train to New York.
"We can't build more lanes on I-95, and we can't build another Merritt Parkway," said Mr. Bruhl. "All of those decisions have been made for us by history, by environmental policy, by funding and by legislation. You just can't do it.
"But we can change how people use the system," he added, saying that intrastate rail service can be increased, while more commuter parking lots can be built at eastern train stations.
One such initiative under way is a $35 million Intermodal Transportation Center planned for Bridgeport. It will link trains, buses, taxis and the ferry from Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, N.Y. In addition to transportation alternatives, Mr. Bruhl said companies have to take the lead in adjusting their own work days, using technology, perhaps, to let some employees work one day a week at home.
How crowded is the Connecticut Turnpike in southwestern Connecticut? The average rush hour speed in Stamford weekdays is about 26 miles per hour, said Mr. Bruhl, as about 7,300 cars daily between 7 and 8 A.M. go over a car-counting cable in Norwalk. Just decreasing that time slot volume by 5 percent, or 500 cars, via train travel or other means would increase speeds to about 44 miles per hour, he said.
Getting a small percentage of commuters to seek out alternative forms of travel, said Mr. Bruhl, "is a lot easier than dealing with the Western world's fascination with the automobile."
"The D.O.T. sees their role as building, maintenance, safety and operation," he said. "But their responsibility now is to also change how people use the system."

HEADLINE: Reinventing Cities In a Mixed Market

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN 1977 many big city dwellers were skeptical of reports that the third largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies after Manhattan and Chicago was in Fairfield County. More than 100 companies had moved to Connecticut by then, mostly out of New York City, and 33 of them were on the Fortune 500 list, about the same number as Chicago's.
Today the county and Stamford in particular have emerged as a major financial center in the northeastern megalopolis from Washington to Boston. Within the 38.3 million square feet of corporate offices in the county are 14 Fortune 500 companies and 31 Fortune 1000's. The completion of Swiss Bank's headquarters in Stamford will add 1.2 million square feet to the total. 
 Plans for a few new office buildings in Stamford and Norwalk are on the horizon, but nothing will be built until rents, now in the mid-$20's per square foot, reach the mid-$30's.
The rest of the state has had its ups and downs over the past two decades. Hartford's record one-hundredth of 1 percent office vacancy rate in 1981 rose precipitously with the downsizing of its insurance companies. "We are starting to come out of it but vacancies are at 24 percent," said William Farley, head of Farley-Whittier Real Estate.
New Haven and Bridgeport are attempting to reinvent themselves after years of economic stagnation. Bridgeport, stung by the state's refusal to allow a gambling casino to jumpstart its economy, is banking on a $50 million state bonding package to pay for several projects, including the mixed-use development of its Steel Point waterfront site, and a baseball stadium.
Seeking a substitute for lost manufacturing and shipping industries, New Haven is supplanting them with "education, the arts, and bio-medical research," said Barbara Pearce, the owner of H. Pearce Real Estate. The average price of a house is down to $70,000.
In Greenwich the average house, according to William Pitt Real Estate, costs $1,106,806, up from $726,261 in 1991. Wall Streeters flush with profits have sent home sales to record highs along the Gold Coast, and the shortage of land has generated a trend to buy a property, tear down the existing house and build a new, larger and more luxurious one.
Credit for Stamford's metamorphosis, said Jon Smith, the city's planning director from 1973 to 1993, goes to Robert Rich, president of the F. D. Rich Company. "His urban renewal plan was reviled unfairly by people who historically react unfavorably to change," said Mr. Smith. "He was at the head of a very short list of developers willing to tackle it. Westinghouse wanted to turn downtown into one big warehouse."
"Until the late 60's there was no office demand here," said Mr. Rich. "Redevelopment was scheduled to be light industrial and research." But when the New York Stock Exchange threatened to leave Manhattan, a few corporate executives decided it was time to re-establish their companies in the suburbs where they already lived, free of crime and crowds, and at lower cost.
"American Can went to Greenwich, Pepsico went to Purchase, and Olin came to Stamford," said Mr. Rich. Later he built the Landmark Building, Stamford Town Center mall, Marriott Hotel, Biltmore Apartments and some half-dozen major office buildings, filling in most of the 130-acre urban renewal excavation where small businesses, stores and dwellings had stood. Other developers followed with office buildings in Westport, Greenwich, Darien, Fairfield, Norwalk and Shelton.
At the same time, Arthur Collins, founder of the Collins Development Corporation, was challenging the notion that quality housing must be large, custom and set on a couple of acres. He obtained approval in Greenwich to build condominium homes on small lots at the 150-acre former Lyon Farm. An eager public snapped them up at $150,000 in the late 70's. It was called "cluster zoning," and it gave the builder additional units in exchange for dedicating a third of the acreage to the town as open space.
"It allowed people to live in the Greenwiches of the world for less than half the cost of a house," said Mr. Collins. Today Lyon Farm homes list for $650,00 to $1 million.
Mr. Collins went on to build offices and 1,325 luxury condominium units in Stamford, Greenwich, Shelton and the 19th-century waterfront of South Norwalk, until speculative construction ended in the real estate collapse of the 80's, bringing near-ruin to him and the Rich organization. Both companies lost substantial numbers of properties, but they have regrouped, with their sons joining the companies.
Rental housing, scorned by many Connecticut communities as potential slums, got a makeover in 1986 when Charles Berman, former head of Trammell Crow's northeastern real estate operations and now president of his own company, Avalon Properties, built 1,000 units in Middletown.
The units were typical of Avalon's clustered New England-style villages, with swimming pools, fitness rooms and basketball courts, common rooms and landscaping, priced at market rates. Occupancy rarely drops below 95 percent among the company's 2,781 units statewide. Apartments at Avalon Grove in downtown Stamford rent for more than $2,000 a month.
But Avalon continues to battle lawsuits brought by towns opposed to its use of Connecticut's 1989 Housing Appeals law, which permits developers to build more units in exchange for setting aside 20 percent of the total number of units at rents based on a state formula. Towns must prove that a project would be injurious to the general welfare in order to reject it.
A growing number of developers have applied the concept to single-family homes of around 1,700 square feet on small lots, popular with young couples, singles and empty nesters, but neighborhood resistance remains resolute. "I don't detect even grudging acceptance of the Housing Appeals law," said Timothy Hollister of the Hartford law firm of Shipman and Goodwin. "If anything, towns are becoming more sophisticated in opposing applications for these projects."
Lawsuits are also arising in communities where the Foxwoods Casino, operated by the Mashantucket Pequots, and the Sun Casino, run by the Mohegan, are enjoying phenomenal success. Residents of North Stonington and Ledyard fear that the Pequots are acquiring too much land and that towns are losing sovereignty.
"We have not seen an increase in residential construction, except by, and for the tribes," said Richard Erickson, director of the Southeastern Regional Planning Agency, "and there hasn't been any retail or food service developing." By attracting and keeping patrons inside, anticipating their every need and desire, the casinos effectively shut out local restaurants, shops and theaters.
Beautifully rural Litchfield County, where celebrities hide away in handsomely renovated farmhouses, remains largely unspoiled, because to get there one must take narrow, winding, infuriating Route 7. But New Milford, gateway to the county, has been discovered and is developing at a gallop with new housing and businesses, road and sewer improvements as well as school construction.
Wherever people move to escape high costs and get a piece of the good life, dozens of new Wal Marts, K-Marts, Home Depots, discount clubs and designer outlet stores follow, and so have malls. Connecticut has 17 of them, with more on the way.
Rank-and-file employees of Fairfield companies who could not afford to live near their jobs gravitated to hundreds of new exurban subdivisions offering homes at modest prices. Longer commutes were an acceptable tradeoff but they have turned Interstate 95, the Merritt Parkway and Route 7 into rush-hour parking lots. Housing development has also altered agriculture. New housing, built on land sold to developers by farmers, was a major force in reducing the 26,000 farms in the state in 1910 to 3,900 today.
Mark Costello of CB Commercial Real Estate, observed that "over the next 20 years we will need a more mixed economy -- more progress in the industrial sector, and transportation for labor to get to jobs."
He is also concerned about "the attrition of independent owners and developers to Real Estate Investment Trusts" like Reckson, which now owns the Landmark Building, and Equity Office Properties, owner of several major Stamford office buildings.
"And they are on the prowl for more," he said. "REIT's view buildings as pieces of a puzzle. The question is will they be as sensitive to local issues and philanthropic causes as the F. D. Riches and other local developers were?"

HEADLINE: Pioneer in the Nuclear Age, and in Its Steep Decline

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
WHEREVER America is going, Connecticut often seems to get there first, and that includes nuclear technology. The state was one of the first to jump in, and now seems on its way to being one of the first out.
The technology once seemed a natural fit for the state, which has only two traditional energy resources: the little bit of hydropower that nurtured its earliest industries, and the technological sophistication of its work force, from engineers to technicians to mechanics. It also has a thirst for energy for its high-tech factories, offices and homes. 
 But the idea that nuclear power is dependable and economical has come and gone over the past 20 years, and the idea that power can be cleanly, cheaply supplied by fossil fuels imported from far away has gone and then come back.
The changes are stunning. Twenty years ago, Connecticut Yankee was on its way to earning the record as the largest single nuclear producer of electricity in the world, in the vanguard of a wave of reactors that were supposed to total 1,000 by the turn of the century. Millstone 1 and 2 were helping to minimize the impact of oil price shocks, and Millstone 3, under construction, promised to further loosen the treacherous noose of oil dependency.
But that was not all. Stamford was headquarters to Combustion Engineering, which built nuclear reactors and in Uncasville, another firm built nuclear fuel. Electric Boat, in Groton, turned out a steady stream of nuclear-powered submarines and the United States Navy ran a landlocked submarine reactor in Windsor Locks, for training.
Almost all of that has gone away.
"We wouldn't have predicted it," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, of the industry's withering. "Ultimately, I think it's bad." Nuclear reactors can run well, he said, even if Northeast Utilities' reactors don't. "In Connecticut the problem is basically a screw-up in the management," he said. Someday, he said, more will be built. "Not tomorrow, but probably in a decade or more -- more like two or three decades -- we will come back to nuclear power because we'll be concerned about the impact of fossil fuels on the economy," he said. In the very long term, he said, "people will start to realize we're running out of fossil fuels."
Maybe so, but Northeast, which often got more than half its electricity from reactors, got just 28 percent last and this year it will be less.
Amazingly, the system still works. Everyone can see that, because the lights stay on and because a web page (http://www.cvx.com/) gives an up-to-the-hour picture of the balance between supply and demand.
But as a technology, nuclear power seems to be withering. Combustion Engineering was swallowed by a European conglomerate, Asea Brown Boveri, in 1990, and there are no nuclear reactors to build in this country; only a few around the world. The site of the nuclear fuel plant is prospering as a casino. Of the 259 power reactors ever ordered in this country, more than half were canceled. The Navy closed its training reactor, because it sends fewer crews to sea now. That has also cut most work at Electric Boat, which is building one last big attack submarine.
And Connecticut Yankee, reliable though it was for most of its life, turned out to be not worth running. Last month the state even argued that it has been poorly run, in a way that increased contamination and the decommissioning cost.
More stunning yet, though, is Millstone 3, a multibillion-dollar miscalculation. When ground was broken it was supposed to cost $400 million. By the mid 80's the price had risen to over $3.5 billion, but Northeast Utilities said its power would be cheaper than oil-fired power as early as 1989.
The utility hired a forecasting company, then called Data Resources Inc., which said that not only would oil be expensive, but that low-sulfur fuel, the kind Northeast burned, would reach $181 a barrel by the year 2000. If that seemed outrageous, Data Resources had company; the United States Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration predicted a world oil price of nearly $300 per barrel by then, assuming continuing high inflation. There seemed no alternative to pressing on.
But for the last few years oil has sold for about $20 a barrel. And most electricity comes from something even cheaper: natural gas. Twenty years ago, Connecticut was at the end of a very long natural gas pipeline from the Gulf Coast, meaning shortages for the state; now, it is in the middle, served by a pipeline from Canada as well, the Iroquois. "The Iroquois was a signpost of things to come," said James R. Shuckerow, the director of wholesale power contracts at Northeast. "No longer will New England be at the end of the pipeline. In many respects, we are at the beginning." Gas coming over the Iroquois is mostly from western Canada, but Mr. Shuckerow and others say that newly discovered gas in the Canadian Maritimes may put New England even nearer the beginning of the distribution system.
Joel M. Rinebold, the executive director of the Connecticut Siting Council, a state agency that passes judgment on each proposed new power plant, said that today, "There are more options and alternatives, as simple as that." These include conservation and new technologies that are just becoming competitive or are expected to be soon: solar cells, wind turbines and fuel cells, the latter manufactured in the state.
Those alternatives have had a profound effect on the value of Millstone 1 and 2, because they determine the value of a kilowatt-hour, and thus the value of the plants' output and therefore of the plants themselves. The Department of Public Utilities Control asked Northeast to recalculate reactor value on that basis, and in July the company said that the value to its customers of operating Millstone 1, as opposed to closing it, was a scant $68.9 million. Millstone 2 was $488 million.
People with long experience in the energy field, nuclear and otherwise, are stunned by the changes. Paul Blanch, for example, moved to Connecticut in 1966, as an instructor at the submarine reactor in Windsor Locks, and went on to become a nuclear engineer at Northeast Utilities. He, like the state, has made a long journey since then; he found technical flaws with nuclear reactors and said the company harassed him as a result; eventually the Nuclear Regulatory Commission agreed. He quit four years ago but was rehired in February, to help fix the company's nuclear problems.
Two years ago the four reactors represented about one-sixth of the capacity the state would need on a peak day, and to Mr. Blanch and many others, the idea of the state doing without all of them was impossible. "I didn't think we could possibly survive," he said. "It's all economics right now," said Mr. Blanch. "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the nuclear industry is well aware of the non-competitive or borderline competitive situation nuclear is in." Companies have been scrimping, he said, and the government is ignoring safety problems because "they have to not impose anything significant that's going to cause economic hardship on these utilities."
At the Connecticut Siting Council, Mortimer A. Gelston, the chairman, said that in the next year and a half the state as likely to see 1,500 megawatts of new natural gas-powered electric generating capacity. That is almost half as big as the shut-down nuclear capacity.
"We're going to be pretty dependent on gas, which bothers me," said Mr. Gelston. That fuel, he said, is "nothing but a stop gap measure to get us out of this hole we're in." He and others point out that at the time Millstone 3 was being built, natural gas was in such short supply that a Federal law barred construction of new plants using it. He, too, is surprised that the state has done well with no reactors. Of Northeast's executives, he said, "they all must have gone to church every Sunday to get through this year."
The constant factor is that nothing has been constant. Mr. Rinebold, of the siting council, also teaches a course in environmental issues at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. As teaching materials he keeps the old Data Resources projections "as an example of the dynamics of our fuel supply," he said. "Even with the best projections, the best forecasts, things change."

HEADLINE: From Subs to Casinos, an Economic Upheaval

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
IF one were to compress the last 20 years of the the state's economy into just two points on a time line -- 1977 leaping directly across the years to 1997 -- the result would look as placid as the Connecticut River in October, taking its own sweet time, going nowhere in particular.
Total employment would appear to have inched up at a slow-growth pace of around 1.3 percent a year, and some industries -- like banking, which employs about the same number of people in the state today as it did during the administration of President Jimmy Carter -- would look as if they'd barely changed at all. 
 But that is not what happened, of course, and placid is the last word one should use to describe those two tumultuous decades. Like the scene in "Fantasia," when the age of the dinosaurs comes to its climactic close -- earthquakes splitting the land and new mountains suddenly thrusting themselves up -- much of Connecticut's economic landscape was reshaped over the last 20 years. The period began quietly and ended quietly, but the middle years still resonate.
Huge new industries, like casino gambling, arose from nothing. Military hardware manufacturing shuddered and fell. Once powerful cities like Hartford and New Haven stumbled, while others, notably Stamford, ascended, shifting the state's economic center of gravity to the south. New kinds of manufacturing took root, and smaller companies increasingly became the engines of job growth. Exports and connections to the world economy became increasingly crucial.
The job growth that looks so calm when stretched over decades was in fact, on a year-to-year basis, more like white water rapids. Almost all of it occurred in a burst in the 1980's, followed by a sharp fall at the decade's end. After five years of economic recovery from that last recession, Connecticut still has fewer jobs than it did a decade ago.
"Connecticut has experienced more variation in the last 20 years, economically, than any state in the nation," said William A. McEachern, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut. "We've seen it all."
Banks are perhaps the starkest example of what happened: Through the 1980's, as the industry was deregulated, Connecticut saw an explosion of growth. The number of banking jobs in the state rose by 63 percent in just 11 years, to 44,000 in 1988 from about 27,000 in 1977.
Then, with the onset of the recession, all that growth, and more, was erased. The reversal was symbolized for many residents in early 1991 when the venerated Connecticut Bank & Trust, with its classically buttoned-down blue C.B.T. signs, was taken over by Federal regulators. In the years that followed, more than 24,000 banking jobs were eliminated, according to the state's Department of Labor.
The surging economic changes in turn had political and social implications. The boom and bust cycle of the 1980's made, and then broke, the political career of one governor, William A. O'Neill, and colored nearly every act of his successor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. as he struggled to deal with a huge recession-driven deficit in the state budget. Residents saw the national image of their state transformed -- from an example of burnished, how-to-get-it-done success in the mid-1980's into a symbol of the decade's excess and bloated over-optimism just a few years later.
"The engines of growth have all changed," said Donald L. Klepper-Smith, who tracked the state's economy for 18 years at Southern New England Telephone before starting his own economic and demographic consulting firm, called DataCore Partners, last year. Mr. Klepper-Smith says he believes a key theme of the last two decades has been the breaking down of the old state economy based around a few immense pillars -- manufacturing, military and insurance -- and its replacement by dozens of smaller specialized industries that Mr. Klepper-Smith believes are ultimately building a stronger and more stable economy.
The new Connecticut economy can be seen at places like Startech, a Wilton-based company that began manufacturing this year, in association with a Canadian company, a high-tech waste-incineration system that burns at temperatures approaching 40,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hot enough to return materials to their original atomic components. The company has only 20 employees so far, but -- crucially -- has chosen Connecticut as the place where it will manufacture its machines.
The new economy can also be seen in places like Stamford, which has become an increasingly important national center in a particular niche of the insurance industry -- the reinsurance business -- even as the mainstream insurance industry's historic home along the corridor running from Hartford to New Haven has retreated and retrenched.
And the change can be seen in the state's southeastern corner, where a new economic pillar has emerged in casino gambling and tourism. Beginning in 1992 with the rise in Ledyard of the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino, and then last year of the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, entertainment and tourism jobs have surged in number even as the old military industrial empire of Electric Boat declined. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, now employs 11,400 people; the Sun employs about 5,200. That total, by sheer coincidence, is almost exactly the number of jobs that Electric Boat has eliminated in the region in recent years.
Economists say that part of what makes 1977 seem like another world entirely is that so many different business cycles found their peaks and troughs in this one period. Beginning in 1979, for example, there were two sharp back-to-back recessions, followed by an explosive period of growth that then ended with the deepest economic downturn since the 1930's, a period that Mr. McEachern, the professor of economics, has dubbed, "The Great Recession."
In the world of military contracting, the state was also entering a new cycle of procurement in 1977, as the military and the industry were, in Pentagon parlance, "ramping up," for a new generation of war machines. At Electric Boat, two whole classes of submarines for the Navy were then in the initial stages of construction that year -- The Los Angeles and the Trident -- which would both peak their production years in the mid 1980's, and keep 25,000 workers employed for years. The eighteenth and final boat in that combined series -- the last Trident sub -- was commissioned just last month.
Another quirk of the last two decades, economists say, is that for much of it, Connecticut -- in one extreme or another -- was wildly out of sync with the rest of the nation.
The chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group, Nicholas S. Perna, said he remembered driving on Interstate 84 to his office in Hartford in 1987 or 1988, and seeing motel after motel filled by construction workers from places like Louisiana and Florida who had come North for the work and the high wages, as Connecticut's own internal labor market had become overwhelmed by the surging demand. "Those were the best times that people had seen in a long time," Mr. Perna said.
Then in the recession that followed, when the state lost 9.5 percent of all its jobs -- more than New Jersey or New York state and far more than the rest of the nation, which saw only 2 percent job losses -- the downturn was compounded by forces that again seemed unusually focused in the state: the end of the cold war, a drop off in commercial aviation orders and the sudden, immense pressure to cut costs in labor-intensive industries like insurance.
But 1997 looks in many ways like an echo of 1977. The state's economy seems to have entered a period of relative calm, growing but not booming. Economists say that the restructuring of the economy over the years also put the state more with in line the national economic rhythm than it has been at probably any time in the last two decades, which could dampen the highs, but also soften the lows in the future cycles to come.
"It's back to the future," said Mr. McEachern. "In 1977 we were getting ready for the 80's -- I still remember how exciting that sounded: "the 80's," he said. "Now we're getting ready for the millennium."

HEADLINE: Those Were The Days . . .

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
AS years go, 1977 was a pretty good one in Connecticut. The economic outlook was so bright that some workers, sure they could always find a job elsewhere, went on strike to get more of a piece of the pie. Teachers in Waterbury and Greenwich walked picket lines, musicians struck the Hartford Symphony, gravediggers held up picket signs at Catholic cemeteries.
In the capitol city of Hartford, old and sometimes historic buildings were being ripped down while new office towers were rising and The Hartford Courant could report that in an era of decline in downtown districts around the country, Hartford was building "on its reputation as a rare success story." 
 The atmosphere was so heady that the most heated debate of the year was not over ponderous subjects like taxes or schools or minority rights. It was about some rocks. An artist, Carl Andre, had been hired, for $87,000, to elevate a small city green into a work of art. So he got 36 boulders and arranged them to suggest, he said, Connecticut's geological past. That was it. An uproar followed over what is, or is not, art.
The years since have seen monumental change. The economy soured. Many industries failed or went South, along with a lot of people. The state's three biggest cities, Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, became poor and agitated. It will never be identified as the state's happiest period. But it was a fascinating one, for good and bad, with an interesting cast of characters strutting and fretting across its stage.
William A. O'Neill racked up more time as governor -- 10 years, 10 days -- than any other person in that office since Jonathan Trumbull in the Revolutionary War era. And a Mayor of Bridgeport, Mary C. Moran, gained a smaller measure of fame by attempting to declare her city bankrupt.
The roof of the Hartford Civic Center, laden with ice from a wet and cold winter, fell in. It was replaced in two years for games of the Hartford Whalers -- only to see the team eventually skate down to North Carolina, amid the near hysterical wail of fans and sports writers.
The state's legal drinking age also fell, to as low as 18, and then went by steps back up to 21, causing great anguish among some young people who had to keep changing birth dates on identification cards.
Thirman L. Milner of Hartford became the first black person elected as Mayor of a New England city and the Waterbury Mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, went to prison for taking illegal payments from developers, tax evasion and embezzlement.
Nathan Hale of Revolutionary War fame became the official state hero and Prudence Crandall, who started a school for young black women in the last century, became an official state hero, both by action of the General Assembly.
A phenomenon known as Husky Mania gripped the state as the University of Connecticut's men's and women's basketball teams shot to new and dizzying heights. When the women's team became the national collegiate champion in 1995, its two aces, Rebecca Lobo and Jennifer Rizzotti, became modern state heroes, by popular acclaim if not by legislative dictum.
Benjamin J. Sisti and Jonathan Google became unofficial state villains by bilking hundreds of people out of millions of dollars in a real estate scam that really gave white collar crime a bad name.
In a supreme twist of fate, two small Indian tribes, the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans, the first nearly totally destroyed in the Colonial period and the other in peril of being removed from the state by the Federal Government in the last century, became incredibly wealthy through establishing gambling casinos on their reservations. Now the Indians are fawned over by bankers and builders and politicians, if not by neighbors of their domains, who say can't get out of their driveways because of the cars whizzing by on the way to the casinos.
The Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine, returned home to Connecticut as a permanent tourist attraction but the four nuclear plants in the state were all shut down because Federal regulators were not satisfied with the safety record of Northeast Utilities, the state's main supplier of electric power, or its treatment of whistle blowers.
One man became almost a household name because he disappeared. Victor Gerena was a guard for the Wells Fargo Armored Service Corporation until one day in 1984 when he tied up two fellow employees in West Hartford and disappeared with $7 million in cash, the second-biggest robbery in the country up to then. The government claimed the money was stolen to finance a campaign by Los Macheteros, a Puerto Rican nationalist group, to overthrow the United States presence on the island, and four members of the group were convicted in Federal Court in Hartford in 1989 for roles in the robbery. But Victor? Despite 13 years of wanted posters and a $500,000 reward, he has not been seen since.
The Hartford Board of Education hired a private company, Educational Alternatives, to run the city's schools. Then the Board fired the company, followed by the state firing the Board. People wondered why children in the city's schools were not learning much.
A hurricane named Gloria knocked out the lights of more than half the state's homes. Tornados are not given names but one that could be called Mr. Mean cut a three-mile swath through Windsor Locks and left vintage planes at Bradley International Airport scattered all about, like a scene from World War II.
Danbury State Fair, 112 seasons old and the state's biggest, gave way to a newer symbol of the times, a shopping mall.
Although Connecticut will never be taken for Mississippi, the Ku Klux Klan did make a few forays into the state, most noticeably a demonstration in Meriden in which the local police complained they did not get enough support from the State Police. At the next Klan event, a cross burning in Windham County, the police outnumbered Klansmen and spectators combined.
The state's General Assembly in 1980, should have received a most-effective-gimmick award for a last-ditch effort to avoid a state income tax. Such a tax had traditionally been a taboo subject, not even to be whispered, because legislators just knew that if the state adopted such a tax all the folks in Fairfield County who had fled the New York income tax would move back, leaving Fairfield a vast wasteland.
So the state budget was balanced by taxing gross receipts of oil companies doing business in the state. The affected oil companies noted they would simply pass the cost along to consumers in Connecticut. But by that time the legislators were in hiding.
Connecticut finally did get an income tax, in 1991, through the auspices of Lowell P. Weicker Jr. A three-term Republican United States Senator who lost his race for a fourth term and then decided he would enjoy being Governor. So he formed his own party, called A Connecticut Party, and ran, pledging no income tax. He won and changed his mind about an income tax. At an anti-tax rally on the State Capitol grounds, an estimated 40,000 cheered as the Governor was hanged in effigy. Mr. Weicker decided he wanted to spend more time with his family and declined to run again. In the last state election, John G. Rowland, a Republican Mr. Weicker had beaten, finally won the governor's job with only 36 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
The income tax remains. Like the rocks in the little park in Hartford, it may be eternal.

HEADLINE: Legacy of One-Party Rule and the 'Pledge'

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

 BODY:
WHEN Ella T. Grasso won her second term as Governor nearly 20 years ago, two basic truths prevailed in Connecticut politics: the Democratic Party called the shots, and its leaders were adamantly opposed to an income tax.
Today, those rules have been turned upside down. The Democrats lost the races for Governor in 1990 and 1994. And one year after the first defeat, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, narrowly passed a state income tax, largely with the support of Democratic lawmakers. 
 Yet, with another election coming up next year, politics in this state continues to revolve around the Democratic legacy and the income tax.
In 1998, Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, may face a challenge from United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the daughter of the state's former Democratic party boss, John Bailey. Her candidacy evokes the glory days of a well-oiled Democratic organization that was not weakened by internal strife, and it also poses a fundamental question: Are people ready to return to a Democratic Party that no longer views the income tax as electoral poison? "The public's perception has obviously changed," said Edward L. Marcus, the state's Democratic Party chairman who once opposed the income tax but now accepts it as a fact of life. "I don't doubt that Rowland will campaign again on eliminating the income tax, but people will not believe him. They will see it as strictly a campaign ploy."
Mr. Rowland, who in the 1994 contest promised to wipe out the income tax by 2000, disagreed. "The Democrats don't have a prayer," he said in a recent interview. "They can never get to where we are on tax issues," a reference to his claim to have cut the tax rate by one-third for as many as half of the state's taxpayers.
The Democrats still maintain a strong grip on state politics. They control both houses of the General Assembly, four out of the state's six seats in the House of Representatives and both seats in the Senate. If they can add the governor's office to their list next year, their hold will approach the lock on power that they enjoyed in much of the 1970's and 1980's.
But the party organization's influence has changed from the days of Mrs. Grasso, widely identified as Mr. Bailey's last political candidate, and her successor, Gov. William A. O'Neill.
Mr. Bailey, who controlled the state political party from 1946 until his death in 1975, "directed the most efficient Democratic machine of the Atlantic Coast," the journalist Theodore White wrote in "The Making of the President 1960" (Atheneum Publishers, 1961). In his heyday, no decision was made in the legislature without his approval.
Under Mrs. Grasso, who first took office in 1975, the party organization declined. "No one missed John Bailey more than Ella Grasso," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman wrote in his book, "The Legacy: Connecticut Politics 1930-1980" (Spoonwood Press, 1981). "His absence was a major reason why her first year as governor was one of the unhappiest of her life."
The General Assembly had become more independent, having established its own nonpartisan budget and research agencies a few years earlier. Legislative staff positions were no longer the sole province of the party chairmen, but either impartial civil service hires or political appointments by legislative leaders. The legislature's newfound power was demonstrated in 1988 when the state opened the $53 million Legislative Office Building to accommodate its growing workload and staff.
Also during this period, rifts within the Democratic Party became more prominent. Before Mrs. Grasso won re-election to her second term in 1978, she faced a primary fight from her own Lieutenant Governor, Robert Killian, a dispute that once would have been unimaginable. Eight years later, Mr. O'Neill, who took over when Mrs. Grasso resigned in ill health in 1980, was challenged by the Democrat and former Congressman Toby Moffett.
True, under Mr. O'Neill the party still retained clout. David McQuade, an aide to Mr. O'Neill, recalled that the governor would make no appointment without first clearing it with the party chairman from the town where the appointee lived.
Yet by the time Mr. O'Neill stepped down from office in 1990, the party was in disarray. The party lever, which allowed voters to cast all votes for the party line and made it cumbersome to split the ticket, had been dropped in 1986, meaning candidates relied even less on their parties. By 1990, unions and progressive groups that began recruiting their own legislative candidates a decade earlier, had succeeded in electing several dozen liberal lawmakers who were not beholden to the party hierarchy.
In a sign of how twisted politics had become in Connecticut, a group of conservative Democrats broke with liberals in their party and joined with Republicans in 1989 to oust liberal Speaker of the House Irving Stolberg and give the job to State Representative Richard Balducci, a moderate Democrat.
Last year, for the first time in recent history, the number of registered voters who were unaffiliated with either party surpassed the number of registered Democrats. (Democrats continue to outnumber Republicans by about 200,000, with 670,000 in 1996 to the Republicans' 470,000.)
These troubles reflect the changing political landscape that led to the Democrats' loss of the governor's office and the passing of the income tax.
Before Mr. Weicker's election in 1990, his two predecessors, Mr. O'Neill and Mrs. Grasso, had taken what was known as the "pledge," a vow to never consider an income tax. "If anybody showed up in their office demanding an income tax," said Tom Scott, a Republican who organized the 40,000-person "Repeal the Tax" rally in late 1991, "they would have shown them the door."
This arrangement fell apart at the end of the 1980's when the state fell into a deep recession. The state budget, which relied heavily on a sales tax that varied heavily with the economy, began running a serious deficit. Mr. O'Neill's popularity plummeted, and he chose not to seek re-election.
The 1990 race was a turning point. The state needed to address its fiscal crisis. The choice was either draconian cuts or an income tax. The Democratic candidate said he would put the issue of the income tax to voters in a referendum. The Republican candidate, Mr. Rowland, took the "pledge."
And Mr. Weicker, a former Republican Senator who had lost his seat in 1988 and was making the run as an independent, fudged. While he likened an income tax to "pouring fuel" on the fire of recession, he also said everything was on the table. Several liberal Democrats, who saw Mr. Weicker as their best hope for an income tax, swung behind him.
Mr. Weicker won 40 percent of the vote, defeating Mr. Rowland by three percentage points.
In August 1991, after an eight-month legislative battle that involved Mr. Weicker vetoing three budgets that did not include an income tax, he and the liberal wing of the Democratic party, joined by a handful of Republicans, passed the tax without a vote to spare in either chamber.
Today, the political ramifications are still being sorted out.
Mr. Scott, a former State Senator who ran as an independent anti-income tax gubernatorial candidate in 1994, recently said that Mr. Rowland would not have won in his second bid for the office, if he had not taken the pledge again. Mr. Scott's candidacy is widely credited with pressuring Mr. Rowland to promise to eliminate the tax, after he initally called for only reducing it.
In turn, Democrats insisted that the income tax was not a decisive issue in the 1994 election and that their defeat was an aberration resulting from the vagaries of a race that had not only a Democrat and Republican but two strong independent candidates, including Mr. Scott and Mr. Weicker's Lieutenant Governor, Eunice Groark, a strong income tax supporter who received 19 percent of the vote.
Mr. Rowland won with 36 percent, against the Democrat, William E. Curry Jr.'s 33 percent and Mr. Scott's 11.
Three years after Mr. Rowland took office, the income tax still accounts for about one-fourth of the state's revenues -- even with Mr. Rowland's cuts. And it remains a pivotal issue in the coming election.
Democrats, who now focus on reducing property taxes, will undoubtedly harp on Mr. Rowland's apparent failure to live up to his promise to eliminate the income tax.
In turn, Mr. Rowland will cast the Democrats as the party that passed the tax.
"Obviously, I've reduced the income tax every year," Mr. Rowland said. "And every step of the way the Democrats fought me on cutting it."

A Supermarket for Struggling Hartsdale Downtown

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

DATELINE: HARTSDALE

 BODY:
THE long-awaited opening of a new supermarket, a needed anchor to this hamlet's struggling downtown, is scheduled today on East Hartsdale Avenue. It promises to enliven a shopping district that has lost much of its vitality because of chronic vacancies.
The I.G.A. supermarket will occupy a 6,500-square-foot space vacated by Gristede's in 1994. Its much ballyhooed opening represents the culmination of a concerted effort by the Town of Greenburgh and the local retail community to replace Gristede's with another food operator willing to do business in a small downtown. 
 "Over the years, I turned away other potential tenants for the space," said Toby Ritter, whose family owns approximately 25,000 square feet of space in downtown Hartsdale. "I wanted to hold out for a supermarket because I felt that was in the best interest of the community."
Mr. Ritter acknowledges that his position put a real strain on the downtown and that it might have been easier to lease the space sooner. "It was a big hardship for the other merchants," he said. "Some of my tenants were really struggling and when I could provide breaks in their rents I did."
After Gristede's closed, there was a 40 percent drop-off in business, according to a study conducted by the town's Planning Department. "There was a momentum of everything going downhill," said Paul Feiner, Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh. Within the last year , he pointed out, the downtown has lost a bookstore, a Hallmark's card store and Whittaker's, a well-known local pharmacy.
The Hartsdale business district, an eighth-of-a-mile strip near the Metro-North train station, is bordered by the Bronx River Parkway on one side and a phalanx of co-op apartment buildings stretching to Central Park Avenue on the other. Like many other town centers, it has fallen prey to economic vagaries in recent years and was largely ignored in favor of the plethora of nearby shopping centers and the malls in White Plains.
But many residents, particularly those living in co-ops along East Hartsdale Avenue, valued the convenience of walking to a food store, rather than having to travel by car to larger supermarkets on Central Avenue, according to Jerry Cohen, president of the co-op board at 180 East Hartsdale Avenue, the apartment building closest to the shopping district. "We have a lot of seniors who can't easily get to the other stores," Mr. Cohen said. "Frankly I don't know what they have been doing."
To remain vacant for so long while waiting for a supermarket was risky at best, Mr. Ritter said, since supermarket chains are loath to lease downtown because of space limitations and a too-small business base.
Gabriel Scavello, the owner of the Hartsdale I.G.A., said the size of the store did concern him. "This is actually a pretty small store for I.G.A.," otherwise known as the Independent Grocers Alliance, a franchise company. "Their stores are usually 20,000 to 30,000 square feet."
Mr. Scavello said he had been interested in the location for a long time. "I love the area and wanted to be in Westchester," he explained. He said he thought the location was particularly ideal for his business because of its proximity to a wide variety of customers.
"We're near Scarsdale on one side and Central Avenue on the other," Mr. Scavello explained. "That's a very diverse group of customers and we'll be able to serve them all."
HE plans to offer an asortment of merchandise that will include fresh produce, meats and fish, as well as imported and prepared foods. "We'll have every price point, from the most expensive to store brands."
To catch the commuters who pour through the train stations in the mornings and evenings, the store will be open from 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. "People can run in to get an egg sandwich and coffee to go in the morning," Mr. Scavello said. "And they can get a prepared supper to take home at night."
Mr. Feiner considers Hartsdale the center of unincorporated Greenburgh. "It's a symbol," he said. "In the past, when people got off the train, they saw a street that had no pride. Now, hopefully, they'll see a lot of activity."
He said that he had made the improvement of Hartsdale a priority of his administration. Recently the town installed new wrought-iron lampposts and refurbished DiSanti Plaza, a little sitting park near the train station.
Mr. Feiner has also hired a planning and design team to develop long-term strategies.
"We still need to examine the underlying symptoms of why the supermarket went out," he said. "We don't want to just repeat this process in another few years."
A marketing survey has already been sent out to merchants and residents. "That's always our first step," said John Shapiro, a partner in Abeles Phillips Preiss & Shapiro, Manhattan-based planning and real estate consultants.
"Before making any recommendations, we need to know what people like and what they feel is missing," Mr. Shapiro said. "I don't think we need to reinvent the wheel here. Hartsdale is an intrinsically charming downtown, but something's off. It should be a high quality miniature shopping center."
Stephanie Bellino, president of Blum & Bellino, a real estate brokerage, said Hartsdale's troubles had been caused more by economic conditions than any failed strategy. "I wouldn't attribute the problems 100 percent to the lack of a supermarket," she said. "Even without it, we've been able to find tenants. When some businesses go under, it's their own fault."
Ms. Bellino, who recently announced her candidacy for Town Supervisor, disagrees with the need to hire outside consultants. She points to the Cheesery, a cheese shop in Hartsdale that is moving to larger quarters. "I already have someone lined up for the space they're leaving," she said.
And Ms. Bellino noted that the former Whittaker's space was the only major vacancy left in the downtown, and that Rockwell's, the pub/restaurant chain is reportedly interested in leasing it. The space is owned by Mr. Ritter, who said he was "inches away from inking the deal with Rockwell's." It would be the fourth Rockwell's in Westchester.
When word got out, there was some concern from other food operators about the competition. "But Rockwell's is such an attractive tenant and such a generator of activity, I don't think people will object too much," Mr. Ritter said.
For Mr. Feiner, it's like a dream come true. "Everything's happening at the same time," he said. "It's great, but now we've got to figure out how to make it last."

HEADLINE: Over the Years, Government Has Taken a More Visible Role

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, 2000 seemed so far away that the various government and civic groups that would later be formed to study how to prepare for the millennium had not been thought of yet.
It was a time when Westchester was obsessed with its high electric rates and prepared for a public referendum on a plan to oust Con Edison. One of the biggest issues of the day was what to do with the ever-increasing amount of garbage that county residents and businesses generated, because the Croton Landfill was under a long-standing court order to be closed in 1981. 
 In 1977, there was no significant number of the homeless in Westchester, but there was a severe shortage of what was called affordable housing. The State Legislature had not yet financed a 10-year parkway improvement plan for Westchester; there was no such village as Rye Brook, and General Motors was happily settled in the village of North Tarrytown, which had not yet been renamed Sleepy Hollow. The business story of the time was that Texaco was about to move its world headquarters to Harrison.
At the time Alfred B. DelBello could not have predicted that within five years he would resign first as Westchester County Executive and then a year later as the state's Lieutenant Governor. State Senator Joseph R. Pisani of New Rochelle contemplated running for Governor; Representative Bruce Caputo was waging a war in Congress against the latest political scandal, nicknamed Koreagate; State Senator Linda Winikow of New City (whose district included Greenburgh) was a few years away from making waves about the state's divorce laws, and Jacob Javits seemed a permanent institution in the United States Senate. Within just a few years, they would all be political has-beens: Mr. Pisani and Mrs. Winikow would be indicted and convicted, while Mr. Caputo would fade into the background after he falsely claimed on his resume to have served in Vietnam. Mr. Javits would lose a three-way election that would propel an upstart, Alfonse M. D'Amato to the Senate; one of his earliest supporters in Westchester was Andrew P. O'Rourke, then Chairman of the County Board of Legislators.
And in 1977, the county-owned Westchester County Medical Center was yet to open, and when it did a short time later it was to empty beds and amid concern -- particularly from other hospitals -- that the region did not need another hospital. There was talk about closing it entirely. The Republicans dominated countywide politics, holding 33 of the 35 judgeships in the region. (Today there are about 11 Democrats). The only countywide Democrat elected to office was Mr. DelBello. Yet to come was the first -- and only -- Democratic County Clerk, Andrew J. Spano. Back then, the Republicans outnumbered Democrats in enrollment by about 40,000; today, it is the reverse, and that major political shift has led to a near-solid political alliance between the Republican and Conservative Parties.
Government was expanding, with new departments and offices being created; the idea of downsizing and the privatization of government services -- a current controversial issue -- had not yet specifically emerged.
But a hot issue of the moment was whether the elected office of sheriff should be abolished and its functions merged with the Parkway Police. It was a different time in some ways, but Yonkers was dealing with a lawsuit that ultimately found it guilty of discrimination in housing; and the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, completed three years earlier, was crumbling.
In the last two decades, county government has been relatively free of scandal. The notable exception came to light in 1989 when the State Commission on Government Integrity held hearings in Westchester and investigated the relationship between political patronage and government jobs and contracts. In 1990 the commission criticized the overly close relationship between Republican Party leaders and county officials.
Life has changed in Westchester, and events have proved the adage that the more things change the more they stay the same. Some problems, like what to do about garbage, have been solved with the construction of a garbage-to-energy incinerator in Peekskill and the institution of recycling programs. Only when their memory is jarred, do people remember the controversy over abolishing the Sheriff's Office. In contrast, other problems, like high taxes caused in some part by social service programs, remain an issue. Still other problems, never dreamed of 20 years ago, like the housing of the homeless, have surfaced.
Evelyn M. Stock, a Scarsdale resident who is president of the New York State League of Women Voters and served as president of the Westchester Chapter from 1985-87, said: "Is the county a better place to live in? I guess the fact that it is still a good place -- with all the downsizing of companies and other economic problems -- is remarkable in itself.
"I think we've done well with welfare and workfare, with maintaining and adding to our open space, among other things. As far as I can tell, the problems of housing are the biggest ones facing Westchester. But government officials are doing what they can to try to make this a county in which you like to live. Unfortunately, it's a very expensive place."
Herman D. Geist, a Republican who was chairman of the Board of Legislators from 1970 to '73 and has remained active in various volunteer posts, said that he thought the quality of life in the county was better years ago, but that "I couldn't think of living any place else." On The plus side, he said, was the continued improvement of Westchester Community College, the cleanup of the Hudson River, the closing of the Croton Point Landfill and expansion of the sewage system throughout the county. On the minus side, Mr. Geist complained that the so-called old guard has left office and the "the new guard doesn't have the historical background."
Old guard or new guard, there has been one constant over the last 20 years, Mr. DelBello, the former County Executive, said: the county government has become more visible and more active since his tenure.
"When I ran for County Executive for the first time in 1973, the county government was basically invisible," he recalled.
"After I was elected, I introduced a series of things: bicycle Sundays, offices for senior citizens, for youth, for women and the free Philharmonic concerts. We also started attacking some very significant problems, such as solid waste and what to do about the Medical Center. All of this turned the government from a limited-purpose government to one that worked to get things done. There was a level of excitement in the 70's that doesn't seem to exist today. People were much more civically involved. We had so many volunteers, and people used to come out at night for meetings. Today, you don't get that. It seems like people are going home extremely tired, with both the husband and wife working, and have less interest in becoming involved."
Mr. DelBello, elected in 1973, was the first and only Democrat in that office. He resigned in 1983 to become Lieutenant Governor and then resigned that position two years later to take a corporate job. He is in private law practice but has come full circle in one way -- he was recently appointed the interim chairman of the Westchester County Health Care Corporation, which will govern the County Medical Center. It was during Mr. DelBello's term in office that the direction of the Medical Center was changed to specialized care -- a decision that probably saved it.
Anthony J. Colavita, who was the chairman of the Westchester Republican Committee from 1979 until 1995 and of the State Republican Committee from 1985-89, said he believed the county gets better every day.
Mr. Colavita, who is a lawyer with the State Insurance Department, said, "Obviously, the county has changed in all ways, not only governmentally but politically, with there now being close to 40,000 more Democrats than Republicans." He credited the county government, under Mr. O'Rourke, with rebuilding the County Center, opening a recycling center in Yonkers, reducing welfare costs and "cutting back on spending and taxation, which I think is the No. 1 problem facing counties like Westchester.
"People like Westchester, but they don't want to spend a lot of money to keep it that way," he added.
Those interviewed for this article agreed that the greatest challenge for Westchester in the years ahead is to find ways to keep taxes down while maintaining the services and frills that people are accustomed to having.
Mrs. Stock of the League of Women's Voters said she believes that so far the county has been able to cut spending without significantly reducing services for the needy and its support for parks and cultural programs. She predicted that such a balance would continue to be harder to achieve in the future.
She also argued that campaign-finance reform is crucial to insure the integrity of the political system. The league had supported a plan to have public financing of some Westchester elections, but the Board of Legislators last summer could not override Mr. O'Rourke's veto of a resolution that was the first step toward accomplishing that.
"The risk is more for the future, for the next 20 years," she said.

HEADLINE: Before Downsizing, Jobs Seemed Secure in a 'Golden Age'

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
IN 1977, employees of International Business Machines wore white shirts to work and were virtually dismissal proof. Westchester had only three major hotels, and the first visitors and convention bureau was organized. Companies were leaving Manhattan in droves to resettle in the county. And 500 automotive workers were on the General Motors plant payroll in North Tarrytown.
The year "was the dawn of Westchester's golden age, the prelude to the up-up-up-skies-the-limit mood of the 80's," said Thomas Spitznas, an economist based in Mount Vernon. "But over-inflated expectations brought about over building, followed by the stock market crash of October 1987, triggering seven lean years, made leaner by downsizing." 
 And in the wake of that came a new disruption.
"In measuring job growth in the private sector, the county was always better off than New York City," Mr. Spitznas observed. "That was the case until 1987, when the county started to lose jobs in the private sector at a swifter rate than the rate in New York City. One-third of the jobs in Westchester, gained in the preceding 10 years, vanished."
As did the market share of many businesses. Moreover, the economic recovery in the county in the last decade, measured by job growth, has been slow.
"Westchester lags behind New York City and Nassau County," Mr. Spitznas said. "The reason is that New York City is doing a better job of holding on to businesses, and another player has entered the arena. A newly aggressive Jersey City is proving to be a surprisingly hot competitor, stepping ahead of Westchester in the race to attract new business."
And housing, or lack of it, is a major cause of the growing labor shortage hampering business growth in the county.
"What we need and don't have, is a range of housing -- affordable to both renters and home buyers," Mr. Spitznas emphasized.
If the last decade has been darkened by downsizing and the disappearance of some of Westchester's largest corporations, on the bright side has been the emergence of new, smaller companies, which have been formed in the same period, said Lawrence E. Dwyer, president of the Westchester County Association, a private business-based civic membership organization in White Plains.
"It's a new phenomenon," he said. "Entrepreneurs are starting companies that are exerting a different pull. These are high-tech companies on the cutting edge with a global focus. For example, when 'right sizing' took place at I.B.M., those highly skilled people became consultants, and some eventually formed their own groups. We have 20 or more colleges in the county turning out a trained work force, which is a boon for the high-tech companies here."
As for blue-collar workers, Westchester cannot be competitive in that job market, Mr. Dwyer said.
"Look at General Motors," he said. "The high cost of energy is a major reason for the closing of the Tarrytown plant."
Westchester, lacking major employer sectors like manufacturing, agriculture and defense, relies on small businesses to serve as its economic engine today, said Andrew N. Karlen, head of the Small Business Council of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce in White Plains.
"According to statistics from the State Department of Labor, 80 percent of Westchester businesses employ less than 10 workers," Mr. Karlen said. "And running parallel to the decade of corporate downsizing, which I feel has finally run its course, are dramatically altered workplace values. A decade ago, it was hard to discuss being laid off, but today, it is almost a badge of honor."
Small-business incubation centers, actual tax and regulatory relief and paperwork reforms are part of a business vocabulary that was rarely heard two decades ago, he added.
Although the confluence of technology and corporate downsizing has helped create a successful new breed of business owners, other Westchester small-business owners, particularly retailers, are suffering, he said.
"National chains are campaigning to saturate Westchester in ways that were inconceivable 20 years ago," he said. "Power-box retailers like Home Depot and Sam's Club have already opened here. Others are in the planning and approval process."
The impact in communities where 'these juggernauts' have settled, has already been felt, he said. "Small local retailers have closed, causing the loss of hundreds of steady jobs for local residents," he said. "It is a matter of deep concern for every small-business owner and municipal planner."
Twenty years ago, the economic impact of tourism in Westchester was so infinitesimal it was unmeasurable, said Harold E. Vogt, chairman of the board of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau and president and chief executive of the county's Chamber of Commerce.
"If we got 10 calls a year for information regarding Westchester, it was a lot," he said. "In 1977 we decided to act and came up with the first issue of the Westchester Visitors and Convention Guide, hopefully to attract outside interest in the county."
In the years that followed, the initial efforts were expanded.
"Today in a partnership between the County Office of Tourism and the Convention and Tourist Bureau, we issue a 68-page information guide, which is distributed widely," Mr. Vogt said. "Last year, for example, we fielded 14,300 calls for information about Westchester."
Helped by the marketing efforts of the bureau, Mr. Vogt said that last year the county ranked second after New York City in the highest taxable hotel sales in the state.
"And the record highs reached by our tourism industry in 1996 will be surpassed this year," he said.
Last year the total economic impact, measured by taxable hotel sales, county tax revenue, state sales tax and annual industry payrolls was about $480 million. This year's figures will be even higher. Georgia Kalayjian, president of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the Professional Golfers' Association tournament alone, which took place over seven days in August, brought $70 million to $100 million in new dollars to the county.
"New dollars are those spent by visitors; 40 percent of them came from outside the tristate area," Ms. Kalayjian said, adding that the economic spinoffs from the P.G.A. championship will continue to benefit Westchester for years.
"Over 1,000 media representatives covered the tournament, which was seen in 110 countries," she said. "That kind of publicity is fantastic. For instance, when the P.G.A. tournament was held in St. Louis, nine companies moved to the St. Louis area soon afterward. We can expect the best, that businesses, both here and abroad, planning relocations will now consider moves to Westchester."
In 1977, Steven Cohen, currently president of the Westchester Banker Association, began his banking career. Mr. Cohen, now vice president of Republic National Bank of New York, headquartered in Yonkers, said the last two decades have been marked by vast changes in the banking industry in Westchester.
"First of all, with the change in the banking laws of 1976 came deregulation, which made it possible for New York City banks to invade Westchester's turf," he said. "For the first time, our home-grown banks were facing competition from big commercial city banks. The two largest Westchester banks in existence then, the National Bank of Westchester and the County Trust Bank, were eventually taken over by larger banks from outside the county who were expanding on every street corner. Former restaurants turned into bank branches overnight, so eager were the city banks to establish a presence in Westchester."
Eventually, Mr. Cohen said, many of the small savings and loans also disappeared, and with them, the neighborhood character of the banking industry.
"Customers used to be fiercely loyal to their bank," he said. "It was not unusual for a bank to have members of three generations of families as customers. Bankers then made what we call 'character loans' to small businesses on the strength of knowing the borrower."
He observed that lending today is more complex and difficult. "The character of lending has changed," he said. "Many small businesses are hurting because it is more difficult and expensive for them to get loans."
Banks now require detailed information submitted by an accountant, he said.
"Not only has it become more costly to make an application but because of the excesses and bad loans made during the 80's, banks have become much more conservative in their lending practices." he said. "The result is that small businesses without access to capital are suffering."
Twenty years ago, I.B.M., with 12,000 full-time employees, was Westchester's dominant employer, occupying 15 to 18 percent of all the available office space in the county, said John Rostenberg, president for the New England region of Insignia/ Rostenberg-Doern.
"Westchester caught fire in the mid-70's," he said. "I was working for Cross and Brown, the largest corporate broker in Manhattan at the time, and we could see the suburban market gaining momentum following in the wake of the Fortune 500 companies like I.B.M. and Nestle -- and AMF -- that were building new headquarters here. They established Westchester as one of the premiere office markets in the nation, and names like White Plains, Armonk and Purchase became known around the country as the home of major companies and therefore desirable areas."
Mr. Rostenberg, a pioneer in leasing suburban office space, added, "The 70's were good, and although over two decades the cycle has had its ups and downs, on balance Westchester has fared well."
Although corporate downsizings continue to hamper the office market, he said, several positive developments in the corporate sector bode well for Westchester in the long term.
"I.B.M. is nearing completion of its new headquarters facility in Armonk," he said. "Nine West Group is moving into its new headquarters on Westchester Avenue in White Plains, and Swiss Re America broke ground in June on a new 300,000-square-foot headquarters complex off Route 120 in Armonk. Looking at the availability of Class A space, it is apparent that with another deal or two in a large building we'll be out of space. By the year 2000, I predict we'll have new buildings up, older buildings will be retrofitted or torn down, and Westchester will still be the headquarters for both international companies and numbers of small-to-midsize companies that will have either moved into the county or expanded their existing operations here."
The county's original developers, the big three that built the buildings that led to Westchester's role as a premiere business location -- the Robert Martin Company, the Schulman Realty Group and Halpern Enterprises -- were all family-owned businesses in 1977 They supplied the bulk of first-class office space and industrial space, corporate headquarters and office parks, now occupied by major and minor companies.
Yet changes in the law and pressures from lenders and national developers have changed the face of family-owned businesses. By 1996 the Halpern company had merged with Reckson Realty Associates of Melville. Some years before, the Schulman Realty Group had arranged with its lenders to take over its properties on I-287, known as the Platinum Mile. And in January, the Robert Martin Company, the last of the original developers, merged with Cali Realty, a real estate investment trust in Cranford, N.J.

HEADLINE: With Maturity and Financing, the Arts Expand and Blossom

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
MANHATTAN cast a long shadow on Westchester's art scene in 1977. City venues were considered more glamorous, professional and trustworthy. Many people figured that for the price of a baby sitter and parking they were at least guaranteed the best play or concert money could buy.
Painters, film makers and writers lived in the county but met their colleagues in the city. A visit from a working artist was a rarity in the schools. County arts groups were still novices at obtaining grants and gaining recognition, and many exhibitions seemed amateurish. 
 The arts scene has matured along with other aspects of Westchester life, and today the arts permeate every community. Many municipalities have their own arts council; the Westchester Arts Council's budget has grown to $1.8 million today from $180,000 in 1977, and audiences are attending events closer to home. In 1995, 1.3 million people attended performances or exhibitions in the county, according to the Westchester Arts Council. A first-time joint study by the council and the county's Cultural Affairs Department showed that the arts make a significant economic impact on the county.
Total expenditures by Westchester's nonprofit arts organizations and their audiences in 1995 were $54.2 million. The spending supported more than 2,000 full-time jobs, provided $49.2 million in personal income to residents and generated $4.5 million to local government and $5 million to state government.
A visit to organizations like the Neuberger Museum of Arts or the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, the newly named Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains, the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill or the Katonah Museum of Art confirms the burgeoning of events and programs. "There has been a real blossoming, a lot of expansion here," said Judy Matson, director of the county's Office of Cultural Affairs. (A copy of the Economic Impact Study is available by calling 285-2922.)
Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, said music has acquired prominence among the arts, winning the largest number of grants from the council and garnering the largest audiences. Theater and dance groups were slower to develop, she said. In fact, although many new organizations have been formed in Westchester in the last two decades, theater groups have most often failed.
Among the most recent additions to the county's arts roster are the Fleetwood Stage Company, based at Wildcliff Center for the Arts in New Rochelle; the Hudson Valley Writers Center, which occupies the newly renovated Philipse Manor Railroad Station in Sleepy Hollow, and the Westchester Chamber Orchestra, based in New Rochelle. In all, 90 groups are affiliated with the Westchester Arts Council; others receive council funds through grants.
Individual artists have also benefited from the growth of arts organizations. School programs received a boost in the late 70's, when the Federal Comprehensive Employment Training Act, known as CETA, enabled artists to teach short-term projects in classrooms. As funds for school-based art and music instruction began to decline, arts organizations mobilized to help. The movement toward arts-in-education began in quiet pockets, almost as a form of self-protection. If the arts disappeared from public education, some groups asked, who would attend future performances?
Educational research dovetailed with the growing presence of community-based arts groups in the schools. Listening to Mozart improved math skills, researchers found. Dance led to improved verbal performance, while painting and mask making harnessed the energies of the hyperkenetic. "Multiple intelligences" became a new phrase, and the arts mushroomed as therapies and teaching tools.
Simultaneously, the school reform movement looked to the arts to strengthen the core curriculum. The Westchester Arts Council received a three-year matching grant of $250,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts for its program Arts Excel, which aimed to teach subjects like writing, math and history through artistic disciplines. Arts Excel is now self-supporting, Ms. Langsam said. The council's arts and education roster lists 120 artists today, compared with 60 in 1990. In addition, many museums and orchestras have their own education programs.
County government contributed $85,000 to the Westchester Arts Council in 1977; the amount last year was $470,000. Arts support crossed political boundaries, but county financing did not keep up with inflation, Ms. Langsam said. She said the county had helped in other ways, like producing highway signs leading to arts sites and paying for the economic impact study. The weakening of the National Endowment for the Arts has cast a pall over planning in the country's arts community and has led art leaders nationwide to seek new forms of financing. Public-private partnerships have shown promise in Westchester, Ms. Langsam said, as municipalities jointly obtain matching funds.
Some fear that the withering of the roots will eventually hurt the tree. "The National Endowment always gave us support whenever we tried to push the envelope," Ms. Langsam said, citing efforts to diversify audiences and take the arts to the disabled. "Who else would support that kind of risk-taking? That innovational component may be gone."

HEADLINE: It's in the Numbers: Waves of New Faces

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE last two decades have brought many changes in Westchester County. But nowhere can they be seen more clearly than in the county's shifting demographics. The most pronounced changes have taken place in the racial and ethnic makeup of Westchester. While the county for the moment remains predominantly white and wealthy, it will not be that way for long.
Once an enclave of country clubs and posh estates -- an issue of Worth magazine last year listed 20 Westchester towns, villages and hamlets among the 300 wealthiest in America -- the county now is also known for its emerging minority population and its areas of poverty. 
 "You still see signs of money everywhere," Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the County Planning Department said recently, "in the expensive cars on the street, in the upscale neighborhoods, in the boutiques in downtown areas and in the variety of businesses that cater to the rich. But also, there are more profound changes taking place. Increasingly, this is a county of tremendous diversity -- from the very wealthy to the poorest newcomers who are making their way up the economic ladder."
Just two census counts ago, whites outnumbered blacks more than 9 to 1. In 1970, there were 802,722 whites and 85,042 blacks in Westchester. By 1990, however, the ratio was less than 6 to 1: 695,738 whites and 120,388 blacks.
More changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of Westchester are in store, according to a study released in July 1995. By the year 2020, black, Asian and Hispanic residents will equal the number of Westchester's whites, according to the study by the County Planning Department.
There are broad implications for the distribution of wealth in the county, with an ever-widening gap expected between the haves and have-nots in the population, according to a 1995 report by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a regional planning organization, and other studies.
Since 1970, nearly three million immigrants have moved to the region, and half of those have been admitted under the family reunification provisions of the immigration law, which contributes to "tight concentrations of newcomers in ethnic enclaves," the council's report said. That has been reflected in the continued growth of the county's cities.
Census predictions indicate that by 2020, Hispanic residents will make up 24 percent of the county's population, up from 9.9 percent in 1990. Asians and people from the Pacific islands will constitute 10 percent of the population, up from 3.7 percent five years ago. And the number of black residents will grow to nearly 17 percent from 13 percent at the beginning of the decade.
By contrast, the white population will decrease to slightly less than 50 percent, from 73 percent in 1990.
Those figures represent only part of the shifting picture of the last two decades. The population has changed in other ways. As the Metropolitan Transportation Council's study indicated, the gap between the very rich and the very poor continued to widen. "The rich got richer and the poor became even more impoverished," Ms. Preston said.
In 1979, the top fifth of wage earners in Westchester averaged $70,736 in annual income; by 1989, that figure rose to $102,293, accounting for inflation.
The bottom fifth of wage earners fared less well, going from $5,431 in 1979 to only $6,063, accounting for inflation, a decade later, according to the County Department of Planning.
Economically in 1970, Westchester ranked fourth in per capita income, compared with 3,147 counties in the nation, according to the United States Census that year. By 1995, Westchester dropped to sixth place in that category.
Income issues aside, the county's population also grew much older -- a trend that is expected to continue as people live longer and baby boomers age. In 1970, there were 34,770 people over the age of 75 living in Westchester; by 1990, that number had increased to 56,067.
Overall, the fastest-growing group in the county is the elderly over the age of 85, with 13,794 people in the county in that age category. By 2020, that number is expected to double, according to projections from the county's Planning Department.
The county has also become better educated in the last 20 years, with the number of college-educated residents almost doubling, to 213,298 in 1990 from 111,085 in 1970.
On the employment front, the major employer in Westchester in the 1970's was International Business Machines, where 10,400 full-time workers earned their living. New York Telephone employed 4,010 workers, General Motors, 4,000 and General Foods, 3,400.
By 1995, Westchester County had become the largest employer, hiring 9,230. I.B.M. followed, but by then, the number had dropped to 7,100 -- in part because of downsizing that took place in the late 80's and early 90's. The third-largest employer was the United States Post Office with 3,900 and Nynex with 3,000. In the corporate sector, the numbers continue to change as companies downsize, rebuild and relocate.
Gone from the scene is General Motors in Sleepy Hollow, the third-largest employer two decades ago. The automaker shut down its assembly plant in the summer of 1996 after 81 years in Westchester and left town. That in turn has left county officials scratching their heads over what to do with the 97-acre riverfront site. A plan to develop the site for residential use is being considered.
Also gone are some of the larger Fortune 500 companies, being replaced in part with a variety of mid-size and smaller concerns -- creating what Planning Commissioner P. Lynn Oliva called a "more diverse marketplace," which is reflective of the many demographic shifts that have taken place. "We're not a one-industry town anymore," Ms. Oliva said, "and sometimes change is frightening, but a healthy county is one that is dynamic."
Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the New York State Department of Labor, described the changes as "a reshaping of the economic landscape."
Overall, Westchester's labor market grew by 21 percent to 387,900 workers as of July 1997, compared with 320,000 workers for the same month 20 years ago, Mr. Surdey reported.
As reflected in the departure of General Motors, manufacturing jobs declined by 40 percent, to 39,500 in July from 66,200 for the same month in 1977, his figures showed.
By contrast, the services sector grew by 79 percent, to 142,000 jobs in July from 79,700 jobs 20 years ago.
The jobs in finance, insurance and real estate also expanded, to 26,500 from 16,900 over that same period, a 57 percent increase.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped to 4 percent in July from 6.6 percent in July 1977.
Both times, Westchester fared better than New York State and the nation. In July 1977, the unemployment rate for the state was 8.7 percent, and the unemployment rate for the nation was 7 percent. In July of this year, the state's unemployment rate was 6.5 percent and the nation's was 5 percent.
Looking at population numbers, there were fewer people living in Westchester, down to 874,866 in 1990 from 894,104 in 1970, according to the census. Women continued to outnumber men, with 470,898 women and 423,206 men in 1970 and 459,586 women and 415,280 men in 1990.
Looking ahead, the population is expected to grow an average of less than 1 percent a year, and by the year 2020, it will reach 905,000. The population is not likely to exceed 910,000 in the future, based on limits determined by employment opportunities and the availability of housing, according to the Planning Department. The latest population estimate was 893,400 last year.
And while the cities to the south -- Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers -- continued to be where the greatest density of the county's population lived, the numbers in towns and villages to the north grew. Yorktown, for example, saw its population more than double to 33,467 in 1990 from 16,453 in 1960. Similarly, Pound Ridge's population rose to 4,550 in 1990 from 2,573 in 1960. And Somers' numbers grew to 16,216 from 5,468 during that period.
Looking to the future, census figures indicate that most of the county's population growth will be in the southern part, in cities like Mount Vernon and Yonkers, where members of minority groups settle.
By 2020, 46.6 percent of the county's population, slightly less than in 1990, will live in the south. Thirty percent of the county's population, slightly more than in 1990, will live in the northern part of Westchester. And about 23 percent, slightly less that five years ago, will live in the central area.
On the real estate front, the average price of a single-family home over two decades rose to $374,899 last year from $137,475 in 1981, the earliest year for which there are figures, according to the Westchester County Board of Realtors.
Looking ahead, the type of housing that will be built in the county to comply with demand is expected to change. As the racial makeup of the county changes, there will be a demand for more multifamily housing, including rental units.
Housing development is expected to be limited in the north, where the Croton watershed covers 60 percent of the area, because of New York City's strict watershed regulations.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Remaking Part of Downtown White Plains;
Mixed-Use Plan For Former Macy's

 BODY:
An ambitious public/private partnership involving the transformation of a city block in the heart of downtown White Plains has been proposed by Manhattan-based developer Tishman Speyer Properties, co-owner of Rockefeller Center.
At a recent meeting with the White Plains Urban Renewal Agency, the developer detailed its plans to buy the 352,000-square-foot former Macy's department store, at Main Street and Mamaroneck Avenue, and replace it with a residential, retail and entertainment complex. 
 "The strategy is to redevelop the site, creating a multilevel, mixed-use project," said Kenneth Narva, a principal with PEG/ Park, of White Plains, retail and architectural consultants on the project. "It would be anchored on the lower levels with entertainment and retail and have residential units above."
Tishman Speyer expects to close on the Macy's sale by the end of the year, said Steven Wise, project manager. It is also interested in acquiring additional properties, possibly an entire city block between Main Street and Martine Avenue.
"They have asked us to consider designating the entire block an urban renewal area," said Mayor Sy Schulman, "which means we could condemn property and then acquire it on their behalf by eminent domain."
Downtown merchants, especially in the area surrounding the former Macy's, have been struggling ever since the department store, a Main Street fixture since 1949, moved last year into the nearby Galleria Mall. And now Woolworth's, directly across Main Street, will close by the end of the year, leaving a handful of small discount and novelty stores without a retail anchor.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Easing the Pain in Downtown Stamford;
When GTE Walks Out, Zurich Re Will Walk In

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
WHEN GTE announced last April that it would put its 483,000-square-foot Stamford building on the market and move to Irving, Tex., by early 1999, the news was not entirely unexpected, given the volatility of corporate relocations.
But losing a $21 billion telecommunications giant and coping with a large block of empty office space was certainly cause for concern in the city. 
 There was also a psychological factor. GTE had been the first company to have a building constructed for it and then fully occupy it amid the chaos of urban renewal more than 20 years ago. The glass-sheathed inverted ziggurat that it completed in 1973 on Tresser Boulevard gleamed as an image of a new Stamford rising from the rubble.
Two months ago the Zurich Centre Group of Manhattan -- a subsidiary of the Zurich Group, a conglomerate of insurance, reinsurance and financial-service companies based in Zurich -- announced that it had contracted to buy or lease the GTE building for an undisclosed figure and renovate it for occupancy in early 2000.
"The effect was twofold," said Jeffrey Dunne, senior vice president at CB Commercial Real Estate, speaking as an uninvolved observer. "There were two developers -- Hines Interests LP and Toombs Development Company -- vying to build a new building for Zurich Re," as the Zurich Centre Group is known.
"When this huge building became available," he continued, "it stopped what would have been the first substantial new construction since 1989," except for Swiss Bank's 1.2-million-square-foot headquarters nearing completion. "It also says something about tenants. Rather than wait for a project to be built in the time promised, the tenant will take an available building if it suits his needs."
So well did the GTE building suit Zurich Re that the insurance company contacted GTE directly and the deal was arranged without a broker. GTE does have an agreement with Cushman & Wakefield and with Roger Staubach, the head of the Staubach Company, a tenants' broker, for handling its real estate activities nationwide.
But in this instance, said Ronald Kulpinski, GTE's vice president for corporate real estate, "we exercised our exclusion provision with Cushman & Wakefield when we came to an agreement with Zurich Re."
"It couldn't be better for Stamford," said Owen J. Brown 3d, senior director at Cushman & Wakefield in Stamford, "that here's a prime property that never got to market." Rents, he said, are approaching the $30 a square foot mark and will continue to rise until Hines and the others start building.
GTE's explanation for its move was a need for consolidating certain corporate and operating-unit staffs at its Texas headquarters. Construction of a 160,000-square-foot building has begun in Irving, where 10,000 people are employed by the company. GTE is also building a 400,000-square-foot suburban campus for its cellular operations on Route 400 outside Atlanta.
About half of its 650 Stamford employes are expected to move to Irving in waves through the end of 1998. A transition center has been set up in the Stamford building to help employees find new jobs if they don't want to move, or helping them adjust to a new environment if they go.
GTE pays for relocation "from soup to nuts," said J. Randall MacDonald, executive vice president for human resources and administration. "There is an allowance for everything from selling to buying a house, attorneys' fees, moving costs, spending three days looking at the lay of land around Dallas, helping hang the curtains."
Salaries, he said, are set nationwide, and are not reduced because of the cost-of-living differential between Connecticut and Texas. If people are laid off they receive a $2,000 stipend to further their education or for computer training.
Zurich Re had been searching for a location in lower Fairfield County for nine months, but could find nothing large enough to fill its needs. When it struck a deal with GTE the state informed them of a financial perquisite created by the General Assembly in 1984 to induce small insurance companies to come into the state and help revive a sagging insurance industry.
John Paul, director of business recruitment for the State of Connecticut, described the financial vehicle as "an insurance investment fund -- like a mutual fund in which wealthy individuals could invest and create capital, and the insurance company would get a dollar-for-dollar tax credit." The fund, he said, is a private, not state, entity.
Zurich Re, he said, will invest $190 million, and over a 10-year period receive that amount in corporate tax credits from the state, plus the return on its investment.
"In return, the state," said Mr. Paul, "gets a fast-growing company with over 400 employees -- a large benefit to the region and state in income, property and sales taxes." The building and six-acre site are assessed at $27.4 million; its annual property tax bill is $783,000.
Still to be decided is the manner in which the building will change hands. GTE originally leased it from the builder, the F.D. Rich Company, developers of the 100-acre urban renewal district. When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation foreclosed on the property in 1993, GTE continued to lease it from the F.D.I.C.
"By contract we can sell our leasehold," said Mr. Kulpinski, "or we will exercise our purchase option -- buy the building from the F.D.I.C. for the mortgage balance, and sell it to Zurich Re." He would not disclose the amount.
Failure of either party to complete the transaction, he said, would result in financial consequences for Zurich Re, or GTE's relinquishing title. But, he said "both parties are delighted and see nothing in our way."
A second GTE building in Norwalk, built and owned by the company, was put up for sale in July. Completed in 1983 on the 66-acre site of a former Catholic seminary, it has served as a training center for GTE executives.
FITTED out like a luxurious hotel, it contains 120 rooms, 28 meeting rooms, plus dining rooms, game rooms, cocktail lounges, a fitness room and, on its grounds, tennis courts and jogging trails. It is also used by Pitney-Bowes, GE Capital, and Champion International, among others, for a daily rate based on the rooms and amenities required.
"There is a possibility that one of those companies will be the buyer," said James Banks, director of marketing and business development for the City of Norwalk. Under zoning restrictions, the property can only be used as a training center. Edward Weiss of Cushman & Wakefield's Manhattan office said that a decision may be forthcoming this month.
A third building, which GTE constructed at the foot of Washington Boulevard in Stamford, was completed in 1986 as a home for its telephone operations. The 250,000-square-foot building cost $49 million and was completely furnished but never occupied. "The telephone operations were installed at our headquarters in Dallas instead," said Mr. Kulpinski.
A year later Stamford, needing a new City Hall, bought it for $45 million.
GTE may lease back a small amount of space from Zurich Re, and Zurich Re may lease out additional space that exceeds its requirements. The building can accommodate 850 employees.
"We will move about 400 people from our New York offices at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and 85 people from offices at Canterbury Green in Stamford into the GTE building," said Nick Carter, assistant vice president of communications for Zurich Re.
Afterward the company will retain a limited presence at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.
"We're sad to see GTE go," said Christopher Bergstrom, director of Economic Development for Stamford. "They were a major citizen, active in community schools and organizations. But from the time they changed their minds about expanding on Washington Boulevard we have been waiting for the other shoe to drop."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
The Preachers: A Test of Political Faith

BYLINE: By Brett Pulley; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The mood inside the camp of James E. McGreevey was jubilant last week after the Democratic gubernatorial candidate delivered an impassioned appeal for support from the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, a statewide group with the growing political power.
"We were electrified," said Kelli Drakeford, Mr. McGreevey's director of constituent services, who accompanied the candidate at a meeting in Trenton on Tuesday, where he answered questions posed by about 50 of the council's ministers. Each gubernatorial candidate had appeared before the ministers, who wanted to know what they would do to address the problems of the state's cities, such as deteriorating schools and disproportionately high auto-insurance rates. After Mr. McGreevey, the ministers spoke to Murray Sabrin, the longshot Libertarian Party candidate, and then to Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican incumbent. "Jim was tremendous," Ms. Drakeford said. 
 But while Mr. McGreevey and his campaign staff may have thought his description of plans to restore urban areas made for an impressive sermon, the ministers were not so sanguine. "In his passion, he didn't really respond to the questions," the Rev. Reginald Jackson, the group's executive director, said. As a result, Mr. Jackson and his colleagues refused to say whom they would endorse in the Nov. 4 election.
For McGreevey, this was a devastating blow. Anything less than an endorsement from black leaders is tantamount to an endorsement for the Governor. Mrs. Whitman has assiduously courted the ministers for the past year, and it seems to be paying off. As Ms. Drakeford said, the tepid reaction from the ministers has caused "concern" inside the McGreevey camp.
The ministers criticized both Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey. (Mr. Sabrin, who opposes government and affirmative action, was a non-starter in the view of the ministers.) "Neither one responded decisively or definitely to the questions we asked," said Mr. Jackson, who is pastor of St. Matthew's A.M.E. Church in Orange. "They were vague and non-specific." If Mr. McGreevey is to score an upset, he needs a strong turnout from black voters, and he needs about 85 percent of those who do turn out to vote for him. By refusing to speak out in full support of Mr. McGreevey, the ministers, who represent 600 churches across the state, are refusing to guarantee the Democratic candidate that they will urge their congregations to go to the polls on his behalf. Mrs. Whitman, on the other hand, knows that a weak turnout from black voters will bode well for her. In 1993, for example, only 8 percent of the 2.5 million people who went to the polls were black. Not only was the turnout among blacks weak that year, but Mrs. Whitman was able to get 25 percent, or a total of 50,000 votes, from those blacks who did go to the polls. Mrs. Whitman beat the Democratic incumbent that year, Jim Florio, by just 26,000 votes. If the turnout among blacks is low again, or if Mrs. Whitman once again gets such a large percentage of blacks to vote for her, she can probably rest assured of returning to the State House for a second term.
This is why both candidates have become so obsessed with courting the leadership of the black ministers council. For months, Mr. McGreevey and Mrs. Whitman have been treating Mr. Jackson and his colleagues as if they possess some golden passport into the political souls of black folks. Earlier this month, Mrs. Whitman received an endorsement from a much smaller group of black ministers known as S.U.P.P.E.R., or Spiritual, Unified, Prophetic, Political, Economic Revival. But the big prize for the candidates is the black ministers council, and each of them remains determined to win the support of the organization's leaders. In recent days, Mr. Jackson has been pondering numerous gestures aimed at winning his favor -- an invitation from the McGreevey camp to give the invocation at a campaign event with President Clinton when he comes to New Jersey; an invitation to sit with Democratic leaders during one of the gubernatorial debates; and an invitation from Mrs. Whitman for the ministers to join her for a gathering at Drumthwacket, the Governor's mansion.
"There's a lot of pressure on us on this one," Mr. Jackson said.
But the ministers seem to be enjoying the attention. They keep insisting that, even though they typically give overwhelming support to Democratic candidates, they are not to be taken for granted this year. "The Democrats think that automatically we're supposed to go with the Democratic candidate," Mr. Jackson said. The ministers are expected to issue a "report card" this week, grading the candidates on issues that concern the council members.
The desire to win the ministers' favor is understandable. After all, their churches organize people and get them to the polls. And even though its tax-exempt status prohibits the council from endorsing a candidate, individual ministers can make their own endorsements.
But in the end, each minister accounts for only one real vote. And in their zeal to impress the shepherds, the candidates seem to be forgetting the flock. Instead of spending so much time courting church leaders, why not spend more time actually campaigning in the cities. If the candidates have a real urban agenda, they should hit the streets and tell people what it is. Convince them that their votes will make a difference in their lives, and that they are not simply hearing stale promises.
The candidate who does that by Election Day will get an amen from the congregation, and the preacher.

A Mercedes-Benz Taxi Gets Fares and Stares

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
In almost every way, it's like all the other cabs in town, dressed in yellow with a light on top. But Branislav Kulka's taxi is a Mercedes-Benz, the only one in New York. In a city where residents are used to hailing basic Fords and Chevies, that's a difference that stands out.
"I think more people have taken a picture of this car than of the Empire State Building," Mr. Kulka, who is known as Brian, said last week. During the year he has driven it, he said, his cab has become something of a tourist attraction in its own right, receiving admiring stares from passers-by and declarations of undying devotion from passengers. He has even been featured on Japanese television, Mr. Kulka said, with his Mercedes. 
 The car is a 1996 300D. An immigrant from Croatia who has been driving taxis and limousines in New York for 30 years, Mr. Kulka says he bought the cab for his own comfort and for economic reasons. Although it cost $40,000, compared with $23,000 or so for a conventional taxi, he expects it to last at least six or seven years, double or triple the life of its cheaper counterparts.
Diesel fuel costs him about $10 a day, far less than the $25 or more other drivers pay daily for gasoline. And superior shock absorbers help preserve his back on bumpy city streets, he said, "something to think about when you spend half the day and night behind the wheel."
Of course, Mr. Kulka did not invent the idea of using a Mercedes as a cab; in Europe, cars like his are the industry standard. In New York, however, where the officially sanctioned cars are large domestic sedans like the Chevrolet Caprice and Ford Crown Victoria and, recently, a few minivans, its use is "considered experimental," said a spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Allan J. Fromberg.
"He's on the road until we decide whether his car is appropriate," Mr. Fromberg said, adding that the trial was open-ended at this point. While Mr. Kulka has the only Mercedes, he said, any medallion driver may ask for a similar test period for any car.
In the meantime, while awaiting final approval, Mr. Kulka gets few complaints from his passengers. Some, like Susan Bode of SoHo, say they think that his cab might be a little too small for a rider with a lot of packages, but she conceded that the ride was very smooth.
Others, like the Manhattan theater producer Peter Holmes a Court, think that it's simply great. "I feel honored to be here," he said last week, smiling, as he got into the taxi for a ride. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: Beyond Fairness;
Picking and Choosing Among the Truly Needy

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: CLINTON, Mo.

 BODY:
TO put a harsh light on it, everyone's a beggar at the Samaritan Center. Just off the courthouse square of this little city in the foothills of the Ozarks, the private charity is a disheveled barn of a room, stacked with food, castoff clothes and toys. It's the last resort for the city's indigent, and like them, Carolyn Kelsay, the center's director, has her hand out, a posture that makes her as queasy as she says it makes her clients.
"We could not operate here," she said, "without the generosity of the people of Henry County," of which Clinton is the seat. But her cases have grown from 450 a month in 1996 to as many as 700 a month now. And her $98,000 annual budget, 98 percent of which is raised locally, is only 5 percent above last year's. 
 "I hope I don't make the people who come feel like they're begging," she said. "I have to beg, and that is very hard for me."
Welcome to the new American welfare system, or the 90's variation on the privately supported settlement house culture of a century ago. With the Federal Government's scuttling of the old system last year, the paycheck is in and the automatic taxpayer-financed welfare check is out. Yet many states are finding that the lawmakers' go-to-work goals are unattainable. Many of the poor can't or won't go to work, states are finding, and even some of those who do find work still need help.
 
Less Trickle-Down Charity
With needs still strong and resources tight for the nation's private charities, begging has become the new imperative for both givers and takers. In the process, the Government's arbitrary, one-size-fits-all definitions of fairness are giving way to the home-grown definitions of thousands of diverse charities. Out is the capriciousness of a system built on eligibility standards that gave a $300 monthly check to a mother with a car worth up to $2,000 and denied assistance to one with a car worth $2,001. In is the capriciousness of unregulated and money-strapped charities making subjective judgments on who will get a blanket and a bed.
From former President George Bush's celebration of a "thousand points of light" to President Clinton's Philadelphia summit on volunteerism in April, the Government has been exhorting the public to take on more of the downtrodden's care and feeding. So far, however, the nation's points of light haven't seen the benefits.
The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel says that after years of little growth, charitable contributions to nonprofit organizations have risen 16 percent during the past two years, to $150.7 billion. But Ann Kaplan, the group's research director, attributed the surge to a booming stock market and a strong economy. And even with the rise, philanthropic giving remains at 2 percent of the gross domestic product, the level of at least the last three decades.
Further, Ms. Kaplan said, most of the recent increases support colleges and universities, hospitals and the arts. Much of what people give human-service charities -- $12.2 billion last year -- is spent on disaster relief, and only a small amount given to religious organizations specifically goes to the poor. "I would say less went into poverty relief last year than in 1995," Ms. Kaplan said, "and less in 1995 than in 1994." So, as any American with a mail slot knows, charities have redoubled their begging.
But the likelihood that private donors will close the gap between the needs of the indigent and diminishing Government aid is slim, says Richard Steinberg, a professor of economics and philanthropy at Indiana University. With each $1 cut in Government aid to the poor, he said, charitable contributions make up "no more than 35 cents and perhaps less."
Still, for many poor people, whether on public assistance or not, the private neighborhood charity is a cozier refuge than the welfare office. At the Samaritan Center, a family of four can pick up $100 a month in free food items and 20 items of clothing per person. Clients can also get help in staying off the street with payments of utility bills or rent.
"They're quicker, friendlier here," said Carri Gomez, 28, a mother of five. The Samaritan Center helped provide Ms. Gomez with food while she finished high school and has given her work learning clerical skills so she can get a better job.
More important, charity advocates say, the judgment calls made by organizations like Ms. Kelsay's about whom to help and how best to help them might be more effective in tackling the roots of poverty than the government's old assurance of a steady welfare check.
 
Knowing When to Say No
"Saying no when you're a church has a different meaning than saying no when you're the government," said Sharon M. Daly, the social policy director for Catholic Charities U.S.A. in Washington. The government, she said, codifies justice into rules so that all people in similar economic circumstances are treated equitably.
"But if you're a church," Ms. Daly said, "you have to go beyond justice to charity and love in trying to reach out to this person. In our tradition, we might not give a person what he's asking for. But we might give them what they need." Instead of a check, she said, "we might get you mental health treatment, or a substance program or family counseling."
Sometimes, however, charities make claims on their supplicants' souls in return for aid, said Julian Wolpert, a professor of public policy at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. "It can involve greater mentoring and greater expectations that the recipient will behave in a way that is essential to his or her welfare or salvation," he said. In return for food or a voucher, for example, a benefactor might ask a client to come along to church.
And now and then, a charity's judgment calls can be less benign, as Ms. Gomez discovered last year in San Diego, before she moved here. "They judge you by your race," she said. "I went to the Catholic church because I'm a Catholic. The English-speaking father says he doesn't have any funds. I go to the Spanish-speaking father and he gets me some help."
Ms. Kelsay said she tried hard to play fair: "You want to give them all a chance. There are people you want to cry with. There are people you want to kick out."
In today's climate, however, she must pick and choose. "I tend to help people who are trying to help themselves," she said.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Those Shiny New M.B.A.'s Get Signing Bonuses, Too

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
WHEN Eric Dunkelberg, 27, finished his M.B.A. at Emory University last spring, he chose among nine job offers. Almost all of them included a signing bonus.
Mike Kanarios, 27, received three job offers with signing bonuses while finishing his M.B.A. this year at Duke University. The job he accepted paid a $10,000 bonus. 
 Linda Carlson, 36, left a credit card company this year to work for a privately owned investment firm as a manager in software development. Her signing bonus was about 20 percent of her first year's salary.
The signing bonus, once associated with professional athletes and top corporate executives moving from one company to another, is now commonplace for many M.B.A.'s, according to company recruiters and college placement officers. With low unemployment and a robust economy, such bonuses are seen as a way to lure the best employees.
In a survey this summer of 396 companies by the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., 154 employers said they had used signing bonuses to attract desired candidates. Of those employers, 43 percent had created the bonuses within the last year, said Barry Lawrence, the society's spokesman.
"It's market driven," said Karen Odom Stephens, associate director of human resource communication at Price Waterhouse in New York. She said the company had offered bonuses with increasing frequency in the last few years.
"In the top 20 schools, it's an expectation," said Steve Backers, manager of M.B.A. college recruiting for the Intel Corporation, confirming that Intel uses signing bonuses "when it's necessary." Also, this year, Intel expanded its stock options program to include all company employees as a long-term incentive, Mr. Backers said. New hires get stock options but must stay a certain period before exercising them.
In a survey answered by 600 graduating M.B.A.'s at 11 of the nation's top business schools last year, 80 percent said they had received signing bonuses, up from 62 percent in 1995, said Dan Nagy, director of placement at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. At Duke, bonus offers of $2,000 to $42,000 were reported by the M.B.A.'s graduating this year.
At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, 90 percent of the almost 800 spring graduates received signing bonuses, with the average about $20,000.
"This is the most we've ever had," said Andrew Adams, Wharton's director of career development and placement. "It does seem to be on the incline. These graduates are in such incredible demand, and the economy is doing extremely well."
At the Goizueta Business School of Emory University in Atlanta, there has been a steady increase in the number of signing bonuses offered in the last three years; the average is $10,000. This year, more than half the 150 graduates received bonuses, the highest share to date, said Samantha Renfro, director of M.B.A. career services.
"It's a very good market out there," said Mr. Dunkelberg, who went to work for a textile company in Georgia after receiving his Emory degree. "Since people with less experience were getting signing bonuses, my expectations were to get one."
The types of companies offering bonuses have expanded. Investment banking and consulting firms have offered bonuses during the last decade, but the incentives are also popping up in the automotive, consumer goods and chemical industries, said Mr. Adams of the Wharton School.
When Mr. Kanarios graduated from Duke, he had offers with signing bonuses from Procter & Gamble, Chrysler and General Motors.
Mr. Kanarios accepted a job with G.M. as a senior financial analyst. Like Mr. Dunkelberg, he said, he saw many other graduates getting signing bonuses and expected it would be part of a package. "There's an expectation," he said. "If someone didn't offer one it could be somewhat of an insult, but it's not a deal-breaker. It does help you when you're coming out of school."
Placement officers said many students used the bonuses to pay off debt from M.B.A. programs that have usually cost them more than $20,000 a year.
Money may also give a psychological charge to the employee. "They are even more psyched up coming into the job," Mr. Dunkelberg said of the recipients. "Money creates loyalty. It's extra incentive."
Interestingly, to students like Mr. Kanarios, the bonus or even the salary is often not the most important issue in job hunting.
"You are thinking more of where you're going to be a few years down the road," Mr. Kanarios said. "You don't want to go somewhere that you'll get pigeonholed."
In his survey of 600 students last year, Mr. Nagy found that less than half accepted the job offer with the highest compensation. When Mr. Nagy and Mr. Adams have asked students to rate what is most important, money does not come in near the top.
Part of the reason, they say, is that most of the offers are fairly comparable financially, but most workers are now more concerned about the responsibilities associated with a job, its location, career opportunities, the corporate culture and life-style issues. "We meet with hundreds of students every year and it's rare we talk about weighing a decision based on salary," Mr. Adams said.
Ms. Carlson said people in information technology and software development were often most interested in "who is using the latest technologies."
"People will take a lateral move to get new adventures," she said. "These are people who are up all night because they are working on something at home. It's a passion, and more money does not fix the problem."

HEADLINE: For Guts, Glory and Absolutely Nothing Else;
The Ways of Pudgie Walsh: 41 Years of Neolithic Combat of the Semipro Fields of Brooklyn

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
NOTHING stops Pudgie Walsh. Nothing. And thus, on this drowsy, sun-splashed Brooklyn morning, he could not imagine that he would be unable to break into his car trunk. He had bagels inside the trunk and it wouldn't open. His jaw was set. His mien was determined. The man was hungry. So: he jiggled the lock. He pounded the trunk. He swore at the trunk. He beseeched the gods. The trunk was unyielding. No bagels in Brooklyn.
At least it is rarely this way on the playing field, where Robert Walsh, in the unsung world of semipro football, nearly always gets his way. Mr. Walsh, whom everyone calls by his childhood nickname of Pudgie, is the girthy, raspy-voiced coach of the Brooklyn Mariners, a semipro football team that, in a city overfed with professional sports, plays for its own muted version of football glory at Kings Bay Field in Sheepshead Bay. As the only coach the Mariners have known in their 41 years of existence, Pudgie has come to encapsulate what semipro football is all about: heart, dedication and high anxiety. The job requires that he constantly assemble fresh talent to display on the field, adroitly drum up money for equipment and bring harmony and inspiration to part-time players who operate in the penumbra of big-time athletics. 
 Already this season, his Mariners had rung up six victories against one loss and were rolling toward another shot at the national championship. A triumph over the Long Island Seahawks, a team that in various incarnations (including the Brooklyn Knights and the Brooklyn Kings) has been a bitter foe since 1963, would keep them tied for first place and secure them a playoff berth. "I'm a motivator, all right," Pudgie said, flushing from his mind any memory of his inability to motivate his car trunk to open. "I can turn it on. Believe me, I can turn it on. There's a little Knute Rockne in me. Maybe make that a lot of Knute Rockne."
Pudgie, who is 63, has known numerous sweet weekends since he got into this brutal business. His players are big, quick, strong -- and they win with a mesmerizing regularity. In his 41 years as coach, they have claimed 23 divisional titles and prevailed 16 times in the local playoffs, and in 1991 captured the national championship of the semipro universe, achieving some degree of feathery fame by edging the Palos/Orland Force, a team from outside Chicago, 14-7. By his recollection, there being no record books in semipro ball, Pudgie has endured the indignity of just three losing seasons and has won 412 games against only 85 losses. "It's not because I'm a great coach," he said. "I'm not. We run a very simple system. We don't do anything too fancy. But I'm an organizer. I'm a recruiter. I'm a motivator."
Given the almost routine success of his team, Pudgie is something of a legend in Brooklyn. When the fans rumble to their seats for a Mariners home game -- a good crowd amounts to 150 people -- they all know the familiar squat figure treading the sidelines. He made his living as a New York City firefighter, but he departed that perilous occupation in April of last year after 39 years battling hundreds of fires. Now he has plenty of time to apply his ribald virtuosity to his beloved Brooklyn Mariners.
Far removed from the overmoneyed ranks of pro football, this is sport for the sheer fun of it. The average salary on the Mariners is $0.00. In fact, the top salary is $0.00. Nobody has yet to land an after-shave endorsement. Pudgie earns nothing. ("I get my phone bill paid -- sometimes.") Only the trainer and the referees receive money, and they don't get slammed by tacklers. A photographer also gets $75 to videotape a game so that the coaches can study the action.
The team is an omnibus collection of about 55 men, most of whom played college football. They are now police officers, firefighters, house painters, stockbrokers, plumbers, sanitation workers, correction officers, salesmen -- men in their 20's and 30's with an undying love of a game that leaves them nursing sore bodies well into the workweek. Pudgie's son, John, a salesman, plays free safety and returns punts and kickoffs. A detective played 15 years before his howling body made him stop. One player was so devoted that when his company gave him an assignment in Bermuda in 1994, he flew back on weekends and suited up. "They catch the Mariners fever and they don't want to leave," is how Pudgie explains the allegiance.
Relatively few professions have been unrepresented on the team. A few years ago, two brothers were on the roster who were reputed to be drug dealers. "They weren't bad," said Anthony Pecorella, an offensive guard who works on Wall Street. "They played on the special teams. We just read in the paper that one of them got shot. As I recall, back when they were playing, one of them got shot during the season."
Some of the men were on the cusp of fulfilling boyhood fantasies and becoming the kind of football players who are paid for what they do and show up on Sunday television. A few even found their way to the pro camps; a handful lasted until the final cut, including Pudgie's current quarterback, Rob Higgins, who got to that tantalizing juncture with the San Diego Chargers. "I've had guys who played during the 1988 strike, and I've had guys who played in the U.S.F.L. and arena football," Pudgie said. "But I never had anybody who played with me who played in an actual legitimate N.F.L. game."
Pudgie eased into his car and pulled out. He spotted two men long beyond their playing days conversing on the corner. "There's my staff," he shouted out the window, beeping his horn. "I've got the oldest staff in the world."
One of the men sneered and whipped a wad of crumpled paper at Pudgie's car. "Some respect I get, huh?" Pudgie snarled. "The bums."
 
A Team That Runs On Half a Shoestring
 The Mariners Bar and Grill is an angled, wood-paneled affair, with twirling ceiling fans, on Avenue S and East 35th Street in Marine Park, one of those funky street-corner repositories of good cheer and good booze that you see in neighborhood after neighborhood. On a sun-streaked Friday morning, Pudgie Walsh sat sprawled in a chair at the table cater-corner to the entrance. He essentially looks like a fire hydrant with eyeglasses. He wore shorts and a black Mariners T-shirt saluting their 1991 national championship year. He emitted an air of bland composure.
Pudgie basically uses the bar as his office. Named after the team, the place is something of the Toots Shor's of semipro ball. The wall opposite the bar is plastered with Mariners photographs, and there is a painting of the team done by one of the players on a side wall. Pudgie is an exceptionally focused man. Even with only one somewhat attentive person across a table from him, he loves to repose here and discourse on himself and the prodigal virtues of his team.
Pudgie was born (and still lives) in Marine Park, where football enthusiasm was pervasive. His father was a police officer. After high school, where he did not play football, Pudgie joined the Navy but saw water in small doses. He was made a dental technician in Bainbridge, Md. "I should have seen the world for free," he said. "Instead, I saw a lot of mouths. And I saw a lot of blood inside people's mouths -- especially when I worked on them."
Done serving his nation's teeth, he was a runner for a Wall Street investment firm for a year and a dental supply salesman for a month. He joined the Fire Department and found something there. "When you work in the Fire Department, you have to be tough," he said. "You crawl into a burning building and reach out for a baby and the baby's arm comes off in your hand. You never get over the hurt. But there's tremendous satisfaction of doing your job."
Always enamored of football, he played linebacker and running back on assorted sandlot teams. In 1957, he signed on with the Mariners, a newly formed team named for the fife and drum corps of an American Legion post that was its original sponsor. (The post is gone now.) It competed against five other teams in the Brooklyn Football League. Before the first game was played, the coach got into a strained argument with the players over whether the team should compete on a rain-soaked field. The team wanted to; the coach didn't. He quit. The players asked Pudgie to fill in. He agreed to coach for one year, no more. The team went 9-2 and lost the championship game, 12-0. Pudgie saw his future come joltingly into focus. He has yet to yield command.
Semipro ball is a fragile universe, with teams and leagues continually succumbing to abating interest or weakened economics, but the Mariners have proved resilient. After its most recent league, the National Minor League, folded last year, the Mariners joined a new group, the Garden State Football League (three of its teams being based in New Jersey). The season began in the undulating heat of August, and the Mariners' final regular-season game is today in Philadelphia, after which, as one of the top four teams in the standings, they begin the playoffs. "We have such a big offensive line this year that we can run pretty much anything," Pudgie said of his team's stellar record. "Our line averages 6-3, 290 pounds. They're not men. They're moose."
The team runs on half a shoestring. Pudgie finds it hard to estimate a given year's operating budget, because so much depends on how many departing players turn in their uniforms. So many don't, and then Pudgie has to buy new equipment. This negligence infuriates him. He phones the players. He writes the players. He shrieks at them: Give me the uniforms! Still, many resist. "I have 25 players on a list who owe me uniforms," he complained. "It really bugs me. The nerve of the guys."
All in all, Pudgie guesses that it takes roughly $20,000 to keep the team playing for a season. That covers league fees, the rent for their home field, buses to away games (other teams in the league are in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Connecticut and Long Island), equipment, and referee and trainer fees.
Part of the revenues to meet the budget flows from the $6 admission fee to home games and from sales of T-shirts and hats. Most of it, however, accumulates from a raffle. Each player gets a book of 30 tickets to sell at $10 each. If he sells them all, he gets a Mariners jacket. The raffle winner gets two pretty good tickets to the Super Bowl, along with lodging and expenses.
Recruitment is always on Pudgie's mind, and whenever he encounters a promising football player, he unleashes his pitch. "I am one persistent Irishman," he said. "I should have become an insurance salesman. I would have been a millionaire."
A telephone repairman who plays on another team now trooped into the bar. Pudgie greeted him cordially and sounded him out about how he was faring with his team.
The phone guy frowned and said: "Last week, we only had 15 players. The coach suited up."
Pudgie turned over a thought in his head, and said: "You should play with us. We need a fullback."
After absorbing some inordinate flattery from Pudgie, the phone guy said maybe he would and handed over his number. Then he said he had to go; telephones had to be fixed.
Pudgie shouted a parting comment: "Tell Tommy I want my pants back. He's got a pair of my pants."
 
A Practice Field Of Rocks and Glass
 The cars pulled up and parked at a slant outside the Kings Bay practice field at the corner of Avenue Z and Coyle Street. It was a little after 8, and the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood was deserted and engulfed in slumberous quiet.
Practice is always on Wednesday night -- roughly 8:30 to 10 -- and excepting a police officer caught up in a shootout or a firefighter preoccupied with a flaming building, Pudgie expects most of the players to be there. The team practices only this solitary evening each week. How much can you demand of part-time players who are paid nothing?
The field is pathetic. Pudgie describes it as a horror, and it is a generous assessment. To a large extent, it is rocks and shards of glass. Getting on toward 8:30, the familiar huge '78 Buick puttered to a halt on the sidewalk, almost on the field itself.
"Hey, dress up, men," one of the players announced. "The Pudge is here. Our mentor."
The locker room was a rusted trailer rig parked permanently at the perimeter of the field. It was tight inside, so thick-muscled players changed quickly and moved out onto the field. The derisive locker room humor of football took place mostly on the scraggly grass.
"Man, that's an ugly shirt you got on. Get it out of the trash?"
"Nah, got it from your wife."
The forecast had been for rain and strong winds. The rain held off but the winds came, and the temperature plunged. It was not a night that had much good in it.
Muscle was padded and buckled. The uniforms were red and white. The team deliberately takes it easy in practice. No real hitting is tolerated at the scrimmage line. Pudgie can't risk injuries inflicted by his own players.
None of the three quarterbacks showed up, so Rich Visco, the fullback and tight end, did the passing during the receiver drills. Pudgie liked to work on the kicking game in practice, but the kicker stayed home, too. He has to drive in from New Jersey, and he doesn't always feel like it. This is how it goes in semipro ball.
The Mariners' one loss this year, to the Hartford Mustangs, came in a game when nine starting Mariners failed to make it, including John Walsh, who was getting married in California. Pudgie missed the game too, feeling obliged to be at his son's wedding. In another game, Pudgie's starting quarterback was among the absentees because he was the best man at a friend's wedding. Pudgie lectures his players to try mightily not to get married or have pregnancies culminate during football season.
Pudgie moved among the caged faces, taking in the grunts and verbal brutalities of the game, yelling at their mistakes. "I stress block, tackle, get off the ball, don't make mistakes," he said. "We pride ourselves on not making turnovers. We don't go for innovative. We can't do anything too fancy. I only have an hour and a half a week to practice these guys."
Pudgie has his crusty side, and his style for making substitutions tends to be extremely direct. "Sometimes Pudgie will walk right onto the field during a game and say to a guy, 'You're garbage, get off the field,' " said Mr. Pecorella, the guard from Wall Street. "It's totally unprofessional, but that's Pudgie."
Still, players get attached to him. "I love the guy," Mr. Visco said. "He's always there if you need him. If you lose, of course, you never hear the end of his mouth." An operations manager on Wall Street, Mr. Visco has been on the team since he was 18, and at 33 his body has been recommending that this be his final season. Pudgie tells him that he "bleeds Mariners red."
In no way is Pudgie one of those cunning coaches who devises ingenious game plans and calls every play himself. He is known for his brimstone oratory, not his X's and O's. His assistants take command of the play-calling. By and large, the only plays that Pudgie calls are inexplicable ones.
During one game, the Mariners intercepted a pass on third and long at their own one-yard line. There was a penalty on the play against the other team. Instead of declining the penalty and getting the ball, Pudgie took the penalty and gave the ball back to the other team. Mr. Pecorella remembers screaming at him: "Are you crazy? What's wrong with your head?"
The opposing quarterback was sacked on the next play. On fourth down, the punter shanked his kick. The Mariners got the ball on their 40 instead of their 1. "That was a totally weird call," Mr. Pecorella said. "Pudgie Walsh is always making these totally weird calls. And then they work out. It drives me nuts."
The players were cold. The swirling wind whipped the field. They could go now, but first they had to listen to Pudgie. It was his time to rouse them for the next game's rough action.
"Now we're doing well, and we're going to keep pounding and pounding and pounding," he said. "Because I'm going to make you. I'm not going to let you do anything but win. You will win and then you will win again. Because you're Mariners. And there's 41 years of tradition. You're Mariners and you're going to be on top of the heap. Now let's go."
With that, they all joined hands in a big huddle and yelled, "One, two, three, yeah!" into the inky sky. Sufficiently pepped up, they changed back into their mortal clothes and dissolved into the night. Other work beckoned tomorrow.
 
During a Game, 'I Become a Maniac'
 On a crisp Friday evening a week ago, the game began well for the Brooklyn Mariners. The Long Island Seahawks picked up only two yards on their first possession. The Mariners then chewed their way to a 32-yard field goal. The thuds and grunts told it was a sweaty, physical game, and the bigger size of the Mariners was having its expected effect.
Not unexpectedly, Pudgie was in the foulest of moods. Another game scheduled to precede the Mariners game ran well over, delaying the kickoff by nearly an hour. Pudgie stalked the field an emotional vortex, barking at anyone who came within a mile of him. At the start of the season, Pudgie always reminds his players that he loves them ("Actually, some of them I only like"), but he cautions that during a game "I become a maniac."
Indeed, studying Pudgie prowling the sidelines is like watching someone who has just learned his pension has been canceled the day after his real-estate taxes tripled. He literally quivers with pent-up rage. Players often weigh whether they ought to chain him to something, muzzle him or simply kill him. Pudgie considers it a miracle no player has ever decked him.
Pudgie didn't like it when a defensive back trotted off the field, vocally celebrating a tackle he had made. Pudgie positioned his face, flame-red, at most a millimeter from the player and, his voice loud enough to be heard in New Jersey, roared, "You play football and shut your mouth or you're out of here!"
He didn't like it when a player mistakenly went onto the field at the wrong time, advising him: "You are such an idiot. You are so incredibly stupid it amazes me."
Just about everyone else, including the referees, his coaches, visiting fans and his best friends, were at one point or another the unlucky recipient of unsanitized, unrestrained Pudgie vitriol.
"Pudgie is out of his mind tonight," Mr. Pecorella said. "But I've seen him worse. I'd say he's a 9. When he swallows his false teeth and starts gagging on them on the sidelines, that's when he's at a 10."
Playing before more than 200 of their boisterous, beer-nourished partisans, the Mariners rose to Pudgie's invective and the crowd's demanding chants. They began the second quarter by smartly marching almost the length of the field for a touchdown. When they put seven more points on the board early in the third, padding their lead to 17-0, the outcome seemed ordained.
Pudgie was not yet satisfied. "Dominate them," he exhorted the defense. "Dominate them." The final score was 20-7.
The victory sweetened the Mariners' record to 7-1. The opposing coach pumped Pudgie's hand and said, "Once again, Pudgie, once again." Pudgie summoned the players to the center of the field, where he told them emphatically: "That was Mariners football. You came. You wanted it. You took it." Then, as was team custom, the players knelt on one knee and recited a prayer. Out of the edge of his eye, Pudgie spied a Seahawks player who had formerly been on the Mariners and hollered that he wanted his shirt back.
Moonlight limned the players' faces. It had passed midnight and become Saturday morning. Ballyhooing fans wobbled out of the scarred bleachers. Pudgie Walsh got into his '78 Buick a contented man. Joy in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Europe Heads a Very Short List Of Foreign Investment Prospects

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
INVESTORS looking to diversify abroad from pricey American stock markets face an ever bigger quandary: The places most insulated from a downturn in this country are places you may not want to send your money.
Japan is still mired in recession. Much of the rest of the Far East is in currency or other turmoil. And while the top-performing funds this summer focused on Russia and Mexico, many people were wary of their risks. As for Latin America, markets are thin and, in any event, tend to rise and fall with those here. 
 So internationally minded investors, almost by default, keep gravitating to Europe. And while no European stock funds even appeared among the top 10 international equity funds in the spring, there were 7 among the leading 20 during the third quarter.
Merrill Lynch EuroFund A was best of the group, and sixth on the overall list, with a gain of 10 percent; the next-best European fund was Mutual European Z, up 9.3 percent, then Fidelity Europe Capital Appreciation, up 8.8 percent.
Europe is a compromise, to be sure: The chief risk, other than a strong dollar, is the huge, Wall Street-like run-ups already posted across the Atlantic. Much of that has come in anticipation of monetary union scheduled for January 1999 and the deregulation and corporate restructuring this has inspired.
"There's no question that Europe stands next in line to follow the United States on the economic growth curve," said John Boich, senior portfolio manager for two international funds sponsored by Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco.
"But this market has priced in pretty high expectations," he added, "so I'm a cautious believer."
While the casual American observer might think otherwise, judging from the unending discussion and jockeying for position, market strategists seem convinced that Europe's monetary union will come as scheduled, a prospect that has already been contributing for years to the Continent's investment appeal.
"People are looking at it pretty much as a fait accompli," said Anthony Cragg, a manager of international funds at Strong Capital Management in Milwaukee. He called the process of financial integration and the market disciplines it implies a "big impetus" for companies to become more efficient to meet new competition, both at home and on a broader, pan-European playing field.
Another important attraction for investors in Europe, according to Richard C. Pell, investment strategist for Bank Julius Baer in New York, is the fast-growing interest in stocks by individual investors there who traditionally have tended to rely on bonds and real estate. Discount brokers are springing up: Fidelity, Vanguard and other American mutual fund groups have arrived and various European companies have started to repurchase their shares and taken other steps to lift the value of their stocks.
Moreover, Mr. Pell argued, "Europe has a retirement savings crisis" that would mean heavy institutional demand for stock by companies with largely unfunded pension plans.
Integration, Mr. Boich observed, means that member countries give up the powerful fiscal and monetary levers on which they have relied to guide their economies. What fills this void, he said, are measures to adapt to the new competition -- privatization of state-owned enterprises, free rein for technology to promote efficiency and other loosening of control.
"Deregulation will be the big thing," said Marc Slendebroek, head of European research for Zurich Investment Management in London, citing recent examples like the sharply extended store hours in Germany and the Netherlands.
At the same time, powerful cultural forces still hobble European labor markets, where double-digit unemployment rates are common. But the successful United States model and the rigors of the marketplace are eroding all manner of restrictions, Mr. Slendebroek observed. "When the going gets really tough," he said, "people get a lot more friendly toward change."
Among the most appealing opportunities in Europe, portfolio managers say, are in rapidly growing Ireland, in the strengthening of the currencies of Spain, Portugal and Scandinavia, and in what Mr. Boich called the "untold story" of deregulation in air, rail and bus transportation on much of the Continent.
Italy, vying to qualify as an original member of the European Monetary Union, is seen as likely to pay off well for investors who bet on lower interest rates. Researchers at Paribas, the French-based bank, predict reductions of three-quarters of a point in Italian interest rates in December or January.
Despite Europe's understandable pull -- and the negatives attached to much of Asia these days -- some international strategists say they are alert to pounce on bargains in the Far East, particularly Japan.
"There will be a time when everybody's written it off -- and it comes back to life," said Strong's Mr. Cragg of Japan, home of the world's second-largest stock market.
Even now, when its economy is at best flat, he said, "Japan I think is oversold."
FOR American investors, it also has the advantage of being a market with very low correlation to those in this country, thereby "providing a different rhythm, a different cycle, to your portfolio," Mr. Cragg said. The Strong International Stock fund currently has 12 percent of its $220 million portfolio invested in Japan and 14 percent elsewhere in Asia, a combined share that nearly matches its 28 percent commitment to Europe.
And John D. Spears, co-manager of the two funds run by Tweedy, Browne, an investment firm that has built a reputation for uncovering individual stock bargains wherever they can be found, said he seeks out the cheapest 10 percent of Japanese stocks in terms of price-to-book value, which sell for only half as much as a comparable group of American securities.
Still, with deregulation in Japan mostly just talk for now and its interest rates already so low as to bar significant cuts, most observers remain leery of the country's prospects.
"Japan will probably reform policy just enough to skirt disaster," Rosanne M. Cahn of Credit Suisse First Boston has advised clients.
As for Japan's neighbors in Southeast Asia, few seem to find much favor.
They face "a far more challenging and competitive international climate" than that region did in its last slump a decade ago, said Joseph P. Quinlan of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. "One round of currency devaluations will not go very far in addressing and redressing the structural problems of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines."

HEADLINE: Capitalism With A Vengeance

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
BILL BROWDER started buying Russian stocks before there was a stock market here. It was 1993, the year President Boris N. Yeltsin defeated Communist hard-liners by shelling the Parliament. Industrial output was collapsing; inflation was rampant.
Investing? Russians with money were smuggling billions of dollars out of the country. There were no exchanges, no prospectuses, no earnings reports and almost no earnings. 
 But there was stock. Under Mr. Yeltsin's privatization program, shares in thousands of former Government enterprises were auctioned off or given to workers and managers. Most people thought these shares were worthless; Mr. Browder thought they were cheap. As Salomon Brothers' 29-year-old manager for Russian equities, and then later on his own, he went to places like Siberia and Tatarstan to snap up shares in oil companies, mines and utilities.
Today, that looks smart. Wearing dollar-sign cuff links and working a few blocks from the Bolshoi Theater, Mr. Browder, now 33, runs what could be the most successful investment fund in the world this year. Shares in the Hermitage Fund, which began in April 1996 with $25 million from Republic National Bank in New York, doubled in 1996 and have nearly tripled again since January. With new money pouring in from wealthy investors and institutions around the world, Mr. Browder now manages $1.2 billion in Russian stocks.
Russia is hot. Six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the land of Lenin and Stalin is suddenly gripped by stock-buying fever. Its nascent stock market has shot higher lately than any other, tripling in the last 18 months. Professional traders now swap shares over an electronic trading system. Foreign investment funds like Hermitage, often registered in tax havens like the Cayman Islands, Cyprus and Guernsey, where Hermitage is based, have channeled about $3 billion into Russian stocks. Moscow's top hotels are swarming with Western bankers, brokers and deal makers.
"Almost every major emerging-market stock fund is here," said Dirk Damrau, head of research at Renaissance Capital Group, one of Moscow's biggest investment firms. "Anyone who was in Latin America or Asia or Central Europe is now here."
The boom has been driven by two things: a conviction that Mr. Yeltsin's economic changes are making Russia safe for capitalism and, more opportunistically, the lure of incredibly cheap assets -- the upshot of privatization plans that bore little resemblance to capitalism as practiced in the West.
Russian companies control some of the world's biggest oil reserves, its biggest supplier of natural gas, its biggest nickel and platinum mines and thousands of huge if decrepit factories. Yet even today, the combined stock value of Russia's 50 biggest companies is less than $150 billion -- about the same as Exxon or Coca-Cola.
The big debate now is whether Russia is still cheap, after the tremendous run-up in stock prices. Most investors agree that the easy money has already been made. But they disagree deeply on whether the market is poised for yet more growth.
By any measure, investing in Russia is a mind-bending experience. Russian companies are in a shocking state of disrepair, needing either billions of dollars in reconstruction or outright demolition. Many managers have brazenly looted assets or ceded control to organized crime bosses. Others have manipulated profits through new holding companies, circumventing original shareholders. Only a few companies report audited financial results; many report almost nothing at all. And many stocks trade so rarely that it can take weeks to buy or sell them.
But the markets here are not filled with penny stocks and Ponzi schemes, though there have been some extremely dubious enterprises. And like most former Communist countries, Russia has had its share of blatant fraud and pyramid schemes.
Many Russian companies, though, are very real -- and very huge. The money pouring into Russian stocks has come overwhelmingly from foreign investment funds whose investors are from Wall Street, London, Hong Kong and elsewhere. While Russia remains too wild for most mutual funds or institutional investors like insurance companies, its sheer immensity has made it impossible to ignore.
Still, the stock boom here is curiously disconnected from the real economy. Most of the trading is between offshore hedge funds. Very little money has actually flowed into the companies themselves because only a handful have raised capital by selling new shares.
And Russia's economy is still a mess. Growth is essentially zero; industrial output has only begun to stabilize after five years of decline. Outside the glitter of Moscow, this remains a land of bleak poverty.
So how surreal is investing in Russia? Consider Unified Energy System, the country's main electric utility and its most-active stock. Its shares have soared nearly 600 percent this year, from 7 cents to 40 cents, after the company reported a modest profit last year on revenues of about $1.7 billion. But those revenues include several hundred million dollars in unpaid customer bills -- and investors don't yet know exactly how many millions or whether U.E.S. will be able to collect much of the money.
Or consider Avto Vaz, which makes 70 percent of all cars in Russia. Despite tough import restrictions that protect it from competition, the company lost $442 million last year and owes $500 million in back taxes. Its cars roll out of the factory with an average of 42 defects apiece and are widely loathed by Russian consumers. But the stock has climbed tenfold, from $1.60 to $16 in the last year, because no one believes the Government will shut down the company.
Some of Russia's biggest oil companies, meanwhile, have systematically shifted their profits into new holding companies -- and out of the reach of most ordinary shareholders. Indeed, many of the most successful investors in Russian stocks have been those who found ways to bet on the side of managers who were draining profits from other shareholders.
"What's important to know is who really owns the stock and whether they are on your side," said an American money manager here, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If you're fighting against the side of management, you're probably going to lose."
 
The Traders
Modern Trappings, Obsolete Methods
At first glance, the trading room at Troika Dialog, the biggest brokerage firm in Moscow, looks like a carbon copy of trading operations in London or New York. But appearances are deceiving.
Several dozen clean-cut men in oxford shirts and conservative ties sit at banks of computer screens, periodically calling out orders on the telephone. The screens flash lists of buyers and sellers for about 200 stocks: Lukoil, Aeroflot, Rostelecom, Moscow Telephone and others. Trades are entered and logged at the touch of a button.
The banter ebbs and flows between English and Russian, but the topics would be familiar in any trading room: bid-ask spreads, sports, difficult clients, night life and who is suddenly buying up 10,000 shares of XYZ stock. During lulls, the traders wolf down hot lunches from foam containers; some practice golf putts in the aisles.
None of this existed two years ago. Aslan Khalichkhov, at 29 a veteran of the Moscow market, still has trouble believing the pace of transformation. When he started in 1994, "trading" began when an armored truck would pull up to the cavernous Russian exchange building and unload several million dollars in cash.
"The truck would come at 3 P.M. every day," Mr. Khalichkhov recalled. Inside, brokers set up at long tables and waited for people to bring in bundles of the vouchers that entitled holders to shares in newly privatized companies.
"It really was 'over-the-counter,' " he said. "At the end of the day, you would change the voucher for money. Then the truck would show at 6 or 6:30, and we would hand over the vouchers."
Today, about 100 million shares trade daily over the Russian Trading System. Like the Nasdaq system, which electronically links brokers and dealers in the United States, the R.T.S. allows brokerage firms to post competing prices for stocks and execute orders electronically. It is modern, fast and so far free of scandals.
But the old Russia endures just below the surface. Except for about two dozen major stocks, most companies trade so thinly that fund managers often wait days or weeks to complete a big transaction. Reflecting the risk of holding thinly traded stocks, the gap between the prices at which brokers are willing to buy and sell a particular stock can be huge. On one recent day, the highest bid for Novosibirsk Tin Plant was $69, while the lowest selling price was $90.
Indeed, fund managers say most Russian stocks are not exchanged over the R.T.S. system at all; instead, they are bought or sold in private phone calls between clients. To find a hard-to-get stock, fund managers usually hire brokers to scour the town where a company is based.
Even if traders do buy and sell shares electronically, it usually takes at least a week before the shares actually change hands. That is because brokers must re-register the shares, a cumbersome process that often means sending documents back and forth between local registrars who may be thousands of miles apart. If glitches occur, and they do, weeks can pass before the trades are officially complete. By contrast, trades on Nasdaq are settled in three days.
The lag time worries many traders because it increases the risk that a big investor will back out of a trade and prompt a chain reaction of defaults by other traders caught in a sudden squeeze. No calamities have yet occurred, though traders say small-scale defaults are frequent. "It's a ticking time bomb," said Fred Berliner, a burly and bearded former hedge-fund manager from New York who runs Troika's trading room.
 
The Pioneers
Potential Windfalls, Financial Quicksand
Bill Browder's first epiphany about Russia came four years ago, during a visit to a fleet of fishing trawlers off Murmansk. It was the math that amazed him.
A soft-spoken M.B.A. from Stanford University who had worked for Salomon in Central Europe, Mr. Browder was advising managers who wanted to take a controlling stake in the Government-owned fleet, which was becoming a private company.
The company had 100 ships, each less than 10 years old, which cost as much as $20 million apiece when new. Yet under Government formulas, the managers were able to buy 51 percent of the company for $2.5 million. Put another way, the ships were being sold for a fraction of their real value.
"I came here, saw what was going on and said, 'This is incredible,' " Mr. Browder recalled recently.
In the helter-skelter rush to privatize some 13,000 companies, shares representing a third of Russia's industrial infrastructure were being valued at about $3 billion just four years ago. Newly private oil companies had stock market valuations that translated into pennies per barrel of oil reserves.
When Russia had a bank panic in 1995, Mr. Browder noticed that Russia's one real bank, which had 70 percent of all deposits and thousands of branches, was relatively solid. Its stock value translated to about $5,000 per branch -- bricks and mortar included -- and has since soared as the dust has settled.
Opportunity? "This was not rocket science," Mr. Browder remarked.
But this was Russia, and nothing was simple. Many Russian companies viewed shareholders with indifference or hostility, and some still do. Many managers had never asked to have their stocks trade publicly, and they had their own ideas about how to manage company profits. But suddenly their stock was "public" because workers had sold their free shares for a quick gain.
The lack of attention to "shareholder value" was especially glaring at several of Russia's biggest oil companies, where, under one approach to privatization, workers had been given preferred stock equal to about 25 percent ownership. The preferred shares had no voting power but an automatic claim to 10 percent of the company's profits as a dividend. Initially, they sold at a huge discount to ordinary common stock, but as awareness of their dividend potential spread last year, they soared in value by about 1,400 percent.
But that was not the end of the story. Many of the exploration and drilling companies had also been herded together by the Government under new holding companies. By 1996, profits in the original companies started to evaporate, and their share prices languished. The profits, meanwhile, showed up in the new holding companies, some of whose shares have soared more than 1,300 percent this year.
Others might have sued or screamed. Mr. Browder, detecting the profit shift early, decided instead to start unloading much of his preferred stock and start buying shares in the holding companies. These stocks could be acquired from managers at subsidiaries who had swapped their original stock for that of parent companies.
Not surprisingly, shareholder grievances here have become increasingly heated.
In one of the biggest brawls, a group comprised largely of American investors has battled managers at a big Russian steel company, Novolipetsk Metal Works. The Americans investors, led by an offshore fund called Cambridge Capital Management, own slightly more than half the stock but have not been able to get a seat on the board, despite winning eight court decisions. Meanwhile, the company has reported that profits plunged $493 million in 1996.
Last month, dissident shareholders led by Western investors put pressure on a subsidiary of Yukos Oil to drop a stock offering they feared would dilute their shares.
But before they could celebrate, company executives surprised them by announcing yet another reorganization that opened new possibilities for diverting profits.
Mr. Browder, who owns shares in the Yukos holding company, is not concerned. "When a company does terrible things to the subsidiary," he said, "I would rather be on the side with the power."
 
The Buccaneers
Steady Nerves, Foreign Checkbooks
Eighteen months into Russia's bull market, Russians themselves remain conspicuously absent from daily trading.
Most Russians are still struggling just to pay their household bills. And pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors are just starting here; all together, domestic Russian investment funds manage only about $24 million, according to Skate Investor Services, a Moscow stock research company.
Instead, most of the money pouring into stocks here has come from offshore investment funds like Hermitage. Such funds now manage about $3 billion, most of that from wealthy and adventurous foreign investors. And even that sum is just a tiny fraction of the money that goes into, say, Southeast Asia.
"Right now, it's still for buccaneers," said Viktor B. Sakharov, president of the fledgling Moscow Stock Exchange.
The Russian market could edge closer toward becoming a target for more conventional investors over the next two months, however.
Both Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and the International Financial Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, plan to include the stocks of Russian companies in their indexes of global emerging stock markets.
A presence on those rosters could draw considerable money from institutional investors, many of whom try to line up their global stock portfolios with the weightings of such indexes.
A big subject of debate is whether Russians who secretly shipped some $50 billion out of the country since 1992 have now begun bringing it back -- perhaps through the offshore funds.
The question is impossible to resolve with certainty, but most money managers say the answer is no.
"Foreign investment will be the key to the recovery," said Mr. Damrau of Renaissance Capital. "The flight capital will probably come back only after the more conservative foreign investors have come back."
What will draw them here to stay?
Analysts say that the Russian economy will need to show steady growth after five years of nightmarish depression.
Russian companies must begin generating real growth and profits, too, rather than relying on ridiculously valued assets to lure investors.
And money managers must gain more confidence that Russia's commitment to markets is for real.
"Russia is rapidly becoming a much more normal place," said Mark Cooke, chief investment officer at Brunswick Capital Management, an investment company in Moscow.
But, he added, "This is not going to turn into a conventional, cozy little democracy overnight."

Charts: "Bear Traps in the Russian Stock Market"
Factors that make investing in Russia wilder than in the United States:
 
AUDITS Most companies still do not produce audited financial results; hardly any produce audits that conform with American Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Accounting Standards.
 
PROFITS Profits can be shifted among companies through transfer pricing arrangements: An oil production company might sell its oil at low cost to a separate holding company for resale at much higher profit.
 
SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATION Though Russian laws theoretically guarantee shareholders proportional representation on boards of directors, some companies blatantly refuse to comply. Example: Novolipetsk Metal Works, which has blocked Western investors who control over 50 percent of its stock from getting any seats on its board.
 
FOR RUSSIANS ONLY Some stocks can be bought only by Russian investors, including much of the stock of Gazprom, the world's biggest natural-gas distributor. Gazprom American depository receipts are twice as expensive as identical shares in Russia.
 
HIDDEN TRADING More than 200 companies have stocks quoted on the Russian Trading System, but as much as 80 percent of trading is not formally reported. Brokerage firms do not have to report trades between themselves and their clients, and most such trades go unreported. Indicators of stock activity are not necessarily accurate.
 
TRADING Not over 'til it's over. Actual settlement of trades over the Russian Trading System can take five days or longer, because shares must be reregistered in a cumbersome process. If a trade is not settled within a week, an investor can legally back out.
 
"Follow the Money"
Analysts say one of the hazards of investing in Russian stocks is the ease with which profits can be shifted among the business units of Russia's complex business groups. An example is Sidanko Group, the country's second-biggest oil company. Its publicly traded subsidiaries all reported losses or earnings declines for the first half of 1997, while the parent company's earnings were tripling. Holders of certain subsidaries' shares received returns far below the Moscow market's average. (Sources: Bloomberg Financial Markets (stock performance); Brunswick Brokerage; Creditanstalt)
 
"Russia's Bargain Basement"
The big driver of the stock market has been the chase of cheap assets. Here are some current examples that suggest Russia may still be a bargain.
 
PETROLEUM
Oil for 75 cents a barrel. That is the average stock market capitalization for Russia's giant oil companies, calculated against their oil reserves, versus more than $11 for American companies.
 
UTILITIES
Power plants at one-fifth the market rate. Russian electric utility stocks price them at $201,000 for each megawatt of generating capacity, versus about $1 million for each megawatt to build a new plant.
 
COMMUNICATIONS
Moscow City Telephone's stock value is $870 for each access line, compared with anywhere from $1,000 a line in the United States to $3,000 a line in fast-growing developing markets like Brazil. (Sources: Brunswick Securities, Moscow; Hermitage Capital Management)(pg. 10)

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Behind the Roar of Stock Funds, Bonds Quietly Gain More Appeal

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
CORRECTLY anticipating that interest rates would decline this year, Steve Savage took a plunge into the riskiest type of Government bond mutual funds -- and it paid off. "When rates got down to 6.30 percent, I was up 30 percent," said the investor, who is also editor of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey newsletter.
Long-term interest rates did not stay that low, rising to 6.39 percent at the end of the quarter. But that still provided handsome profits for those, like Mr. Savage, who took big risks, and good returns for investors in the less exciting, and also less risky, normal run of bond funds. And rates fell from that level to below 6.30 percent by the end of last week, on reassuring economic reports. 
 The average mutual fund that invests strictly in United States Treasury securities returned 9.5 percent in the year ended Sept. 30, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
That is not much by some standards. Funds that invest in a mix of United States stocks were up 32 percent. But while far more money goes into stock mutual funds than into bond funds, the latter group seems to be gaining appeal after years of watching cash move to the greener pastures of equities.
Over the last couple of months, Treasury-only bond funds have seen good cash flows, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services. "Clearly, Treasury-only funds are the beneficiary of some reallocation that may be occurring from stock funds," he said.
Various industry data suggest that the third quarter will be the first one since 1993 in which Government bond funds had a net inflow of cash.
For bond investors, there are two types of risk in American bonds. The first, credit risk, is the risk that the borrower will not pay. Buying Government securities eliminates that concern.
The second is interest-rate risk, reflecting the fact that existing bonds will fall in price if rates rise. In general, the longer the maturity of the bond, the greater that risk. The flip side, of course, is that if rates fall, the value of existing bonds will rise. That is what has happened in the last year.
Stock fund investors, of course, face the risk that the entire market will melt down, as happened briefly almost 10 years ago. Watching the recent climb in stock values, some recent buyers of bond funds may be fearing a repeat of that crash.
But many fixed-income analysts say bonds are particularly attractive right now, whatever one thinks about the stock market, and Government bonds are the favorite.
"I've been in the market for 17 years, and I've never seen a better market for bonds than the one that exists today," said Robert Kapito, vice chairman of Blackrock Financial Management. "And the high-quality bonds, the Government bonds, will probably be the best performers" over the next few months.
Mr. Kapito, whose firm runs the Compass Capital mutual funds, cites four factors buttressing a market that is strong and highly likely to remain so for an extended period:
* Rate increases are very unlikely because the Federal Reserve seems satisfied that the current level of economic growth will not ignite serious inflation.
* The dollar is very strong, attracting foreign investors, who prefer Treasuries to corporate debt.
* A shrinking Federal budget deficit requires less issuance of new bonds, driving up the value of existing ones.
* Spreads to other bonds, from gilt-edged corporate to junk and emerging-markets debt, are among the narrowest in recent history, so investors do not give up much yield to enjoy the freedom from credit risk that Treasuries offer.
David Horner, a senior financial strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he would not be surprised to see rates fall below 5 percent. At just over 6 percent now, the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond is more than four percentage points higher than inflation this year. Since World War II, the spread has averaged 2.5 points.
Bond funds invest in an array of securities, from Treasuries to junk (the two extremes of credit risk) and from short-term securities to long-term zero-coupon bonds (the two extremes of interest rate risk). Most bond funds have assets in mortgage-backed securities or high-grade corporate bonds, which have relatively little credit risk but offer yields a little better than those of Treasuries.
The largest category of Government bond funds -- those that own mortgage-backed securities in addition to Treasuries -- had assets of $73.7 billion as of Sept. 24. Funds that specialize in mortgages had $42.7 billion, and Treasury-only funds had just $12.8 billion, according to AMG.
But, reflecting how unpopular bond funds have been until recently, only the last group is larger than it was in January 1994, just before the Fed torpedoed the bond market with the first of several rate increases.
The yields on bonds other than Treasuries are relatively stingy. Mortgage-backed securities yield little more than half a percentage point more than Treasuries, while high-quality corporate bonds are less than half a percentage point above the mortgage-backed securities.
BOND professionals look at duration -- a measure of how long it will take to get most of the money from a bond, including both principal and interest -- as a measure of interest-rate risk. The higher the duration, the more a bond will rise in price if interest rates fall.
"The 30-year Treasury has a duration of 11, meaning every 100-basis-point move changes returns by 11 percent," Mr. Kapito said. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) The duration of 10-year bonds is 7, so a move of 100 basis points would change the price by 7 percent. Two-year bonds have a duration of 1.3, he said.
Bonds with maturities of 5 to 10 years are called intermediate. Short-term funds own securities that mature within five years.
Most bond funds are in the intermediate category, which offer about 80 percent of the yield of long-term debt but with less risk. The largest Government bond fund, the $9.53 billion Franklin U.S. Government Securities I, has a duration of 4.2 years.
Bonds that pay interest only at maturity, called strips or zero coupons, are the most sensitive to interest-rate changes. Mr. Savage of Value Line reaped his profits from two American Century funds, Benham Target Maturity 2020 and Target Maturity 2025. The funds own Treasury zeros maturing in those years.
Not every fixed-income expert is enamored of Treasury bonds.
"Our Treasury position is relatively low," said Barbara Kenworthy, who manages several Prudential mutual funds, including Prudential Government Income. That portfolio currently has about one-third of its assets in Treasuries; the normal weighting is one-half.
"We think the market is in a trading range," she said. "There's still some upside, even at these levels, but we don't see enough to push interest rates below 6 percent." So she plans to deliver returns through the higher yields available on mortgages.

Thanks to big additions in July, Government bond funds showed a net cash inflow of $811 million in the first two months of the third quarter, and estimates for September suggest that uptick will hold. If so, it will be the first quarter since 1993 that such funds took in more cash from investors than they paid out in redemptions. Chart shows net cash flows into or out of Government bond funds.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Fed Policy On Rates Seems Tough After All

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee met last week and, again, did not raise interest rates -- a move that, for some, is evidence that the central bank is prolonging its "experiment" with inflation and growth.
Look closely, though, and you find that the Fed is not being so experimental, after all. Adjusted for inflation, the Fed's short-term interest-rate target is keeping the economy on a tighter leash than many people realize. 
 Those who are worried say the Fed, by not raising interest rates, is ignoring the traditional view that strong growth with low unemployment inevitably leads to rising wages and prices. But at the same time, analysts agree that it would be very hard politically for the Fed to raise interest rates now with no sign of an inflation threat.
In fact, though, it is the very absence of inflation that is making Fed policy more restrictive than it may appear.
The Fed's short-term interest-rate target is the Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks. At present, the nominal Fed funds rate is 5.5 percent, last increased in March, when the Fed raised it one-quarter of a point.
But interest rates adjusted for inflation are a better measure of the drag that the Fed is putting on the economy, because they reflect real costs to the borrower. And after subtracting the Consumer Price Index increase for the last 12 months, the real Fed funds rate is 3.28 percent. Between the Fed's quarter-point increase and the sharp decline in inflation this year, that is up from 2.22 percent in February. While the economy is growing faster than last year, the price index is up only 1.6 percent at an annual rate through August, half the 3.3 percent of 1996.
To see how restrictive these real short-term rates are, look at February 1994, when the Fed began a yearlong series of increases in the nominal Federal funds rate, to 6 percent from 3 percent. At the time, the real, inflation-adjusted rate was an average of nine-hundredths of 1 percent for the last 12 months -- or almost zero -- according to James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. The Fed's credit policy was very easy.
By the time the Fed finished that round of tightening in February 1995, the real Fed funds rate had risen to 3.14 percent; the average for the next 12 months was 3.01 percent. While much tighter, it was not as restrictive as this August's 3.28 percent. "It's hard to find indications that the Fed's policy is too easy," Mr. Glassman said.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the focus of speculation about a conversion in thinking at the central bank, allowed that the real Fed funds rate was pretty high last February. It "might be at a level that will promote continued non-inflationary growth," he told Congress, "especially considering the recent rise in the exchange value of the dollar."
This trust in a high real Fed funds rate was reiterated at the August meeting of Fed policy makers. In the just-released minutes of that session, they said they left the nominal Fed funds rate unchanged because the real rate was "high by historical standards and provided some assurance that the current stance of policy would not accommodate a significant increase in underlying inflationary pressures."
So because the Fed is already tight, future increases should not have to be big. And if the economy slows some, maybe there will be none at all.

HEADLINE: Winning Ugly;
Bashing America for Fun and Profit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Ugly American has a new look around the world.
The first image, drawn from the best-selling 1958 novel and the subsequent movie starring Marlon Brando, was of the meddling, culturally obtuse ambassador in Southeast Asia. Soon the archetype had metamorphosed to the overfed, camera-laden tourist, loudly demanding a cheeseburger in a Paris cafe. 
 But if you are Malaysian these days, there is nothing uglier than an American currency trader -- the breed that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad assailed recently as "morons" who triggered a 36 percent decrease in his nation's currency and shattered his dreams of building an Asian Silicon Valley. If you are French, the ugliest Americans reside in the United States Senate -- Alfonse M. D'Amato and Jesse Helms are frequently named -- and believe that America has the right to reach beyond its borders to punish companies that fail to obey American dictates about dealing with Iran and other rogue states. That explains why France, and the rest of the European Union, cheered last week when the French oil company Total said it would risk American sanctions and invest $2 billion in an Iranian gas project, along with the Russian oil giant Gazprom and -- no coincidence here -- Malaysia's state oil concern.
In Canada, where proximity can certainly make the heart grow less fond, hardly a day passes when the airwaves are not popping with denunciations of the next-door neighbor's latest insolence. The latest was the American demand for a special exemption (Korea) from the Canadian-inspired treaty to ban the use of land mines. When other nations refused to go along, Mr. Clinton declined to sign. And now the usual trade and fishing disputes have escalated into some of the nastiest political spats in years.
Casting America as arrogant -- even vilifying American power to suit a domestic audience -- is old sport around the world. But in the past few months, it has taken a new turn. From Beijing to Berlin, the complaint these days is that America's remarkable run of prosperity in recent years has made it unbearable. Its detractors complain that the United States not only wants to set the rules for the world (often in the guise of letting market forces reign); it also wants to use its power to dictate exceptions to those rules. More than a few see conspiracies at work. Fuming Asians like Mr. Mahathir charge that the real American aim is to crush rising competitors; the French see an effort to shove American-style capitalism down Europe's throat; the former President of Switzerland and one of the country's leading bankers speculated this year that the American-led hunt for Nazi gold was really an effort to destroy their country as a competing financial center.
The pushed are starting to push back. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France said last week that he "rejoiced" at the news that Total had decided to thumb its nose at the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, an extraterritorial inspiration of Mr. D'Amato's that became law last year. "No one accepts the idea the Americans can make laws that apply on a global scale," Mr. Jospin said. "If not, the planet would be a different place and we would not be the old, independent nation that we are."
President Boris N. Yeltsin could not resist joining in, saying on Russian TV, "Thank God that Russia, France and Iran are independent, freedom-loving states, and interference from any other state is not to be tolerated." It's hard to remember the last time a major leader described Iran in quite those terms.
Funny, though, the image of America the all-powerful doesn't travel well from, say, a meeting of finance ministers in Hong Kong to a Congressional hearing in Washington. You wouldn't know that everyone was talking about the same country.
Consider current arguments over extending Presidential authority to negotiate new trade accords around the world -- the "fast track" bill that has stirred a raging argument in Washington lately.
 
The Home View
In hearing after news conference, many Democrats (and some Republicans) complain that America has never signed a major trade agreement that did not end up placing American workers at a disadvantage to smaller, swifter economic rivals.
And on the far left and the far right, fear is greater than ever that the United States is giving up too much national sovereignty to newly created international tribunals like the World Trade Organization, which has the power to rule whether national laws violate trade agreements. (Here's the scorecard so far: The W.T.O. has rendered decisions on five cases brought by the United States against other countries, and Washington has won all five. It has settled another seven. The U.S. has lost three cases brought by other nations, all minor.)
"What's weird here is that people who look at the same facts come away with different conclusions," said Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, who is trying to push through the trade bill. "Our competitors see an America that is confident, aggressive, winning every contest we enter. And many in Congress see an America that keeps losing in the world economy. It boggles the mind."
Why these diverging world views? The oft-cited explanation, of course, is that such disputes have arisen with the purported end of ideological conflict. When the Communist era divided the world into two camps, rifts over trade and other grubby issues that the State Department once dismissed as "low diplomacy" (compared with the supposed "high diplomacy" of arms control) were secondary to a grander cause. Clearly, though, other forces are at work.
The spread of American-style capitalism is one. This was fine with the Malaysians, Indonesians, Thais and others when foreign capital was flooding over their borders. Banks lent with abandon, often for projects that made more political sense than economic sense. And property markets soared as everyone bought into the myth that emerging markets would always emerge upwards. Little heed was paid to the fact that speculative investment can flow out as fast as it flows in.
 
'Perception Gap'
Now Southeast Asians have gotten a taste of how speculators make their pile: finding good-sized cracks in the way a nation is managing its economy and then betting against its currency. Sometimes that adds gasoline to an economic brushfire, burning down the whole forest.
"This is where the big perception gap comes in," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and former Under Secretary of Commerce. "Most Americans feel that our brand of capitalism is either the answer to everyone's problems at best, or benign at worst. Nobody outside the U.S. shares that view. That doesn't mean they don't adopt our brand of capitalism, but they do it because they feel they have no choice.'
Or as Mr. Mahathir said recently, with much sarcasm: "We are told we are not worldly if we do not appreciate the workings of the international financial market. Obviously we are not sophisticated enough to accept losing money so that the manipulators can become richer."
Mr. Mahathir is from the old school of North-South conflict; his younger aides say they know that when it comes to international markets, American-style rules are becoming world rules. That is not the case when it comes to economic coercion toward foreign-policy ends.
 
Selective Isolation
Most of the world sided with the Europeans last week week when they argued that Congress had no right to punish non-American companies, like Total, for their activities beyond American borders. This year the same argument raged over American sanctions on foreign firms that do business with Cuba. And such sanctions are proliferating these days, the product of a Congress frustrated that other nations profit from dealing with countries America is seeking to isolate.
The problem with this approach is that America isolates only those countries it can afford to isolate. The Clinton Administration, for example, insists that the world must contain Iran, but "engage" China -- where there is a lot more American money on the table.
That's the real problem, one European diplomat complained recently: America is not only ugly again, it is inconsistently ugly.

More Work, Less Play Make Jack Look Better Off

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Census Bureau announced last week that the median income of American households rose in 1996 for the third year in a row, even after allowing for inflation. At last, the economic expansion appears to be lifting a lot of boats. Certainly the Clinton Administration says so. After years of stagnant incomes, the President said, "America's middle class, no longer forgotten, is rising fast."
But there's a less sanguine explanation buried in the Census report and in other Government data. Fathers and mothers, sons and daughters are working longer hours for roughly the same hourly pay. It is not higher wages but extra time on the job that is the main source of the rising household income. That is a precarious affluence. When the economy weakens, as it inevitably will, the extra work can disappear abruptly, as it did in the aftermath of the last recession. Raises are harder to reverse. 
 The time spent at work by members of the typical household, particularly the men, had been declining for years since the 1960's as incomes rose. The new leisure time had become a proud feature of the American life style. But starting in 1982, the trend reversed and the time devoted to work has risen ever since, apparently accelerating in the 1990's. Just why is not clear, but a major reason -- apart from supplementing skimpy raises -- may be job insecurity, according to two economists researching the trend.
Like bears gorging themselves in anticipation of winter, American workers are taking on work in these good times to offset the bad years they have been conditioned to expect. "Companies are offering the work, and people are self-insuring themselves, taking all the hours they can get because they are not sure they will have hours next year," said Barry Bluestone, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts.
Mixing data from several sources, Mr. Bluestone and Steven Rose, a senior economist at the Educational Testing Service and a former Labor Department official in the Clinton Administration, found that for workers between 25 and 54, the average number of hours worked rose to 1,980 a year in 1995 from 1,840 in 1982. That was the low point in the post-World War II period, having fallen to that level from 1,975 hours in 1967.
Census Bureau data suggest a similar trend. Women were flooding into the work force in the 60's and 70's, of course, but men were pulling back even faster. Since 1982, however, men, too, have been working more.
"A lot of people ask, 'How come the economy is doing so well, but wages are so stagnant?' " said Charles Nelson, deputy director of the Census Bureau division that issues the annual income report. "Part of the answer is that because the economy is booming, you are adding more workers and more hours for those who are working. So there is more income out there."
Such explanations don't go unchallenged. The Census Bureau data are based on surveys in which a cross-section of Americans is asked how many hours they worked in the recent past. Some researchers argue that people tend to exaggerate; when workers are asked to record their activities every half-hour or so, their diaries show much less work than they had recalled.
"The discrepancy comes about," said John Robinson, a University of Maryland sociologist involved in the research, "because you are a good American if you put in long work hours. So people claim they have put in long hours." But the diaries do not measure additional weeks of work. And Mr. Robinson does not count as work time spent on coffee breaks, personal phone calls, lunch hours, visiting a dentist -- all more common in the new service economy.
"Martin Luther got all his best ideas on the toilet; is that work?" said Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas in Austin. "Work is less structured today than it was 30 years ago, when time clocks were more prevalent, but Government data is still based on the structure of work in the old days."
Definitions aside, the 140 hours a year added to the average worker's time on the job since 1982 are coming primarily from more weeks of work. The percentage of women jobholders working "full-year, full-time" -- that is, at least 35 hours a week as well as 52 weeks a year -- rose to 54.6 percent in 1996 from 51.1 percent in 1989, on the eve of the last recession, the Census Bureau reports. Some of that is from second jobs. For men, the percentages were 70.7 last year, up from 68.3 in 1989.
 
A Better Deal
"The explanation for the rise in household income has to be that the people in most households are working more, not that their individual wages are rising," Mr. Nelson said, citing Government data on wages. The Bureau reported last week that the median income of the nation's 101 million households, the majority of them families, had risen by 1.2 percent in 1996, to $35,492, after rises of 2.7 percent in 1995 and 0.7 percent in 1994. From 1989 to 1994, household income fell, and by more than it has since risen.
Some economists, particularly Mr. Rose and Mr. Bluestone, see in the rising number of hours worked an explanation of how the unemployment rate -- 4.9 percent in September, the Labor Department reported on Friday -- can get so low without generating labor shortages and wage pressures.
Most of the extra hours, they say, come from jobholders who accept offers from their employers to work more weeks each year. Rising overtime and, for the unemployed, fewer weeks between jobs also raise the annual average. The result is flexibility for employers. During periods of low unemployment in the past, workers felt more secure in their jobs, so they pressed for higher wages rather than more hours.
"There is no question," Mr. Rose said, "that a raise is a better deal than more hours on the job, when you consider that a 5 percent raise is the equivalent of two and one-half extra weeks of work."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Working Harder to Stay Afloat"
The Census Bureau reported last week that households have recaptured the income they lost in the recession of the early 90's. But to sustain that level of income, more and more people had to work in full-time jobs, especially women. The chart shows the percentage of men and women workers with year-round full time jobs from 1970-1995. (Source: Census Bureau)

The Boris & Jacques Show

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
French President Jacques Chirac met with Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to cook up an Iranian natural-gas deal that would (1) enrich their business interests, (2) gain a diplomatic foothold in the Persian Gulf by helping terrorists obtain missiles and (3) distract their restive unemployed by sticking a thumb in the U.S. eye.
When Vice President Al Gore tried to brief his counterpart, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, on solid U.S. intelligence that Russian scientists were secretly helping the terrorist state of Iran build a 1,200-mile missile that would hold hostage the populations of Tel Aviv, Ankara and Riyadh, the American was tartly rebuffed. 
 Then Boris and Jacques sprang their surprise: a $2 billion deal undercutting U.S. attempts to hold back the spread of nuclear missiles. They accompanied this with dire warnings that the U.S. had better not enforce its laws against companies that do business with rogue states. By what right, they demanded, could the U.S. penalize European companies that flouted U.S. law?
That was "extraterritorial."
The new U.S. Ambassador to France, Felix Rohatyn, dared to point out that the recent demand by the European Union that Boeing break its deals with U.S. airlines was "extraterritorial," too. But such tortious interference was O.K. with Europe when directed at the U.S.
How will the Clinton Administration respond to this thumb in its eye and setback to its dual containment of Iran and Iraq -- a sensible, tough-minded strategy that could save tens of millions of lives? In matters Russian, our doughty Secretary Madeleine Albright is manipulated by her doughy deputy, Strobe Talbott. Figure Clinton to settle for gentle finger-wagging at Iran.
This will win the applause of the blame-America-first, business-is- business, forget-human-rights lobby such as is centered in Washington's Nixon Center for Peace Through Appeasement. James Schlesinger, Carter's Energy Secretary, leads its business-is-business charge; Maurice Greenberg, whose insurance companies make huge profits in China and who is an acolyte of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, wields the backstairs influence with the foreign-policy establishment.
Here's evidence of that influence: Greenberg, China's insurance broker, hired Frank Wisner, the disappointed seeker of our Paris embassy post, to be his vice chairman. And whom do you suppose Clinton-Gore just chose to "investigate" the Russian scientists' aid to Iran's missile-builders? Wisner, along with Yuri Koptev, Russia's suspect space bureaucrat. That'll be some investigation.
Clinton is actually trying to balance cordial relations with cocky Boris and Jacques against the safety of Israel, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Muddling through won't do; backbone is required.
Beyond urging Clinton to enforce the law, what can Congress do to see that some risk and some opprobrium is attached to those in the U.S. and abroad who flout U.S. laws?
Do not overlook the power of public oversight. Just before Russia's Gazprom (which enriches the Chernomyrdin family) and France's Total Petroleum made their $2 billion deal with Iran, Total limited its exposure to U.S. retaliation by selling its 1,600 gas stations to Ultramar Diamond Shamrock of San Antonio, Tex., taking back an 8 percent stake in that company.
Pretty shrewd way of avoiding the consequences of helping terrorists get missiles. But perhaps Congress's banking committees can bring in Joe Kerry of Merrill Lynch, who doesn't return my calls, and Total's dealmaker at First Boston and ask them publicly if they knew of the Iran deal beforehand.
Roger Hemminghaus, the C.E.O. of Diamond Shamrock, which provided the cover for Total's maneuver, tells me he had "no knowledge, to my knowledge" of the impending huge Iran deal.
A consumer boycott may be difficult against an oil company, as the sly French knew, but the average person with mutual funds can legitimately ask what institutions hold big chunks of Total's American front-company stock. According to Bloomberg News, the biggest are Brinson Partners; Equitable's Alliance Capital Management; Wellington Management, and Capital Research and Management. Divestiture is always an option.
And then, while we're at it, let's find out which mutual funds have how many billions of private American money in Chernomyrdin's Gazprom.
They took a risk. Actions have consequences. As they say, business is business.

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
$30 Billion Bid for MCI
Worldcom Inc., an upstart long-distance telephone company based in Jackson, Miss., barged in on a grand trans-Atlantic alliance with a surprise offer to buy MCI Communications for $30 billion in stock. That is $9 billion richer than the offer MCI had accepted from British Telecommunications. Analysts said MCI, America's No. 2 long-distance carrier, would be hard-pressed not to accept the higher bid unless British Telecom makes a counteroffer or there are antitrust objections. Through a relentless series of acquisitions, Worldcom has grown from obscurity into the nation's fourth-largest long-distance company and a leading carrier of Internet traffic. The takeover would be the largest in American history. The offer, appropriately, came in a phone call.
 
TOYS 'R' US
Rough Play in Retailing
Not everything is fun and games at Toys "R" Us, a judge ruled. Upholding F.T.C. charges, Judge James P. Timony said that the company, the dominant toy retailer, used its market muscle to force leading toy makers, including Mattel and Hasbro, not to sell popular lines like Barbie and Mr. Potato Head to its emerging chief competition -- warehouse clubs like Price/Costco, BJ's and Sam's Club. The company said it would appeal the ruling to the full five-member commission. F.T.C. officials said that would mean a final decision would not take effect until after the Christmas season. 

TRADE
Paris vs. Washington
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France offered total support for a $2 billion investment in Iran by the French oil company Total -- a move that puts the new American Ambassador to France, Felix G. Rohatyn, in the middle of a full-fledged crisis. Like other Europeans, French officials have made little secret of their contempt for American legislation that threatens sanctions against countries that invest in Iran. But Washington is determined to show its toughness on trade. The Clinton Administration accused South Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia and the 15-member European Union of having failed to live up to their free-trade obligations. The report could lead to sanctions against them.
 
THE ECONOMY
Fed Sees No Threat
Surprising no one, Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged. After all, the economy seems to be behaving nicely, growing enough to keep record numbers of Americans employed -- the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent in September -- but not enough to stir inflation, as the latest economic data show. Incomes rose six-tenths of a percent in August, the Commerce Department reported, and spending increased three-tenths of a percent. Orders placed with factories increased 1.3 percent in August. However, manufacturing growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported.
 
MARKETS
Upward, but More Slowly
Markets advanced in the third quarter, although the pace slowed. The Dow Jones industrial average set another closing high -- 8,259.31 on Aug. 6 -- but ended the quarter at 7,945.26, up 3.55 percent, well under the 16.5 percent surge in the second quarter. Earnings warnings by some blue-chip companies, including Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak and Procter & Gamble, inspired investors to turn to smaller stocks. Consequently, the quarter's best-performing index was the Nasdaq composite, which climbed 16.89 percent after gaining 18.04 percent in the second quarter. In the bond market, Treasury securities finished the quarter far stronger, pushing the yield on the long bond down to 6.39 percent from 6.78 percent on June 30. It ended the week at 6.28 percent. The Dow ended the week at 8,038.58, up 116.40, and the Nasdaq composite closed at a record 1,715.87.
 
SALES
Pocketbooks Stay Closed
What love affair does not have some troubled times? Now, even Americans' love of the road seems to be cooling. Chrysler's sales have slipped 7.1 percent this year from a strong performance in 1996, and they tumbled 14.1 percent last month with sales of mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks down a surprising 13.9 percent. Over all, sales of domestically produced cars and trucks fell 6.4 percent last month, with G.M. up 3.7 percent and Ford down 1.6 percent. Honda and Subaru had gains, while Toyota and Saab reported declines. Retailers had slower-than-expected sales growth in September because consumers stayed home at the beginning of the month to watch television coverage of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Telecheck Services reported.
 
US AIRWAYS
A Deal With Pilots
US Airways and the union representing its 4,700 pilots reached a tentative contract agreement after more than a year of negotiations. The carrier, which has had record profits lately, would pay its pilots 1 percent more than the average wage of pilots at its four largest competitors and create a new low-cost carrier, US2, to compete with rivals like Southwest Airlines and Delta Express. The focus is now on Stephen M. Wolf, US Airways' chairman, who pledged that if the pilots helped him reduce costs, he would buy new aircraft and expand the airline. Airbus Industrie extended the deadline for ordering up to 400 planes until the union's rank and file could vote on the contract. Separately, nearly 10,000 reservations takers, gate agents and ticket sellers at the airline voted to join the Communications Workers of America, a big coup for the union.
 
PEOPLE
The Price of an Obsession
With no apologies to Tony Hillerman, a senior vice president of the Engelhard Corporation became a thief of time. Francis X. Vitale Jr., who put together one of the world's finest collections of 18th- and 19th-century European clocks, said in Federal District Court in Camden, N.J., that he had embezzled more than $12.4 million from Engelhard to indulge his obsession. . . . Ray Ozzie, the computer programmer who created I.B.M.'s popular Notes software, has formed a new company, Rythmix, to design new software that complements Notes and that may or may not be sold by I.B.M. . . . Seeking to slash costs and rebuild its photography business, Eastman Kodak said David P. Biehn, 54, the head of its ailing consumer division, would retire. Robert Keegan, 50, who now runs the company's professional division, will replace him.
 
TRUE BLUE
The Pepsi Generation at 100
Preparing to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1998, Pepsico's look will be changing a bit. New cans for Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and caffeine-free Pepsi brands will be a bright royal blue with the word Pepsi in vertical white lettering on the can. "Coca-Cola is doing its best to own red, so the natural tendency is for Pepsi to want to own blue," said Aubrey Balkind, chief executive of Frankfurt Balkind Partners, which works on corporate identity projects.

HEADLINE: Merian L. Kirchner, 66, Dies; Inspired the Betsy-Tacy Books

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Merian Lovelace Kirchner, the little girl whose pleadings for just one more bedtime story gave birth to a beloved series of children's books, died on Sept. 25 at a hospital on Staten Island. She was 66 and the daughter of Maud Hart Lovelace, the creator of the Betsy-Tacy books.
Friends said the cause was emphysema. 
 It was her mother who lived and wrote the Betsy-Tacy life, not so much creating as copying her characters whole from her own turn-of-the-century childhood in Mankato, Minn., or Deep Valley, as it is known in the 10 main Betsy-Tacy books and three satellite volumes.
But it was little Merian Lovelace, growing up in the 1930's in Garden City, Long Island, who first demonstrated that her mother's girlhood had more than passing appeal. She pestered her mother so often for a new story about Betsy Ray and her friend Tacy Kelly that Mrs. Lovelace, who had concentrated on short stories and historical novels, decided to put Betsy and Tacy on paper.
The result has been something of a literary cult.
For although Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly have never quite achieved the stature of, say, Nancy Drew, they have spawned a 1,000-member Betsy-Tacy society and a Betsy-Tacy home page (http://virtuflex.com/ Betsy-Tacy/), and they have turned Mankato into a tourist attraction.
Aside from the fact that Betsy was an uncommonly independent young heroine, a bustle-era girl who took her own ambitious career plans for granted, the books have exerted a special appeal because unlike Nancy Drew, who was blond, perfect and 18 forever, Betsy and her friends grew older in each successive book.
When the first book, "Betsy-Tacy," covering Betsy's meeting with Tacy at age 5, was published in 1940, Mrs. Kirchner was 9. By the time she got to Smith College, she was something of a minor celebrity, letting her classmates read the proofs of the latest installment.
The last book, "Betsy's Wedding," was published in 1955, a year after her marriage to Englebert Kirchner, a German-born writer.
As the daughter of a woman who turned her own childhood into literary fodder, Mrs. Kirchner might have been expected to continue the tradition.
But except for a column she wrote for the Betsy-Tacy Society newsletter, she showed little interest in her childhood and none in fiction.
Not that Mrs. Kirchner was especially rebellious. It was just that she decided to follow in the footsteps of her father, Delos Lovelace, a Minnesota-born journalist who was once city editor of the old New York Sun. (He was also the author of the novelization of the movie "King Kong," which helps explain why he named his daughter after the movie's director, Merian C. Cooper.)
Settling in Greenwich Village as her parents had done a generation earlier, Mrs. Kirchner held a series of jobs in journalism, contributing to a book on civil rights for Newsfront Publishers, working as a freelance book editor, and ending her career as a senior writer for the magazine Medical Economics.
After her mother's death in 1980, Mrs. Kirchner helped keep the Betsy-Tacy flame alive, working closely with the Betsy-Tacy Society and campaigning for reissues of the books. Her husband died in 1992.
For all her role in the creation of the Betsy-Tacy series, Mrs. Kirchner never appeared as a character, except by implication.
At the end of "Betsy's Wedding," as her husband, Joe, is about to go off to World War I, Betsy speaks of their plans to have a little girl named Bettina, not realizing, perhaps, that in time the little girl would make her mother write it all down.

HEADLINE: Stalking Africa's Newest Game: Hostile Celebrities

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN

 BODY:
Although he hates the title, Fanie Jason is known as South Africa's only paparazzo.
Other than President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, this country does not have many faces that are recognized overseas, so he does not get rich at his job. Last year, one minor celebrity he relentlessly tailed for a British tabloid sued and nearly bankrupted him. Since then, that man has become famous as a symbol of fury at paparazzi: Earl Spencer, the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. 
 The case of Spencer v. Jason, which drew in a press freedom institute and a top constitutional lawyer, pitted two figures who inspire both admiration and disdain in others.
Mr. Jason is a quick-thinking photographer who has fought his way up, out of the poverty and despair of a black township. He stalks his targets relentlessly and admits that he has lied or played on white guilt to trick people into posing. Since Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris while fleeing photographers, he has received death threats, he said.
Earl Spencer is widely admired for the eulogy he gave at his sister's funeral and for saying paparazzi and newspaper editors had "her blood on their hands." But he was briefly a journalist himself, and speaks to gossip writers when it suits him.
Celebrity-poor South Africa became a battleground for him because he moved his family here two years ago, ostensibly to get away from the attention he was getting in Britain as Diana's brother. He was one of a handful of well-known Europeans and Americans who have vacationed or moved here since apartheid sanctions were lifted.
That influx is Mr. Jason's bread and butter, and he is not embarrassed about what he does. "I have a Toyota now, and a computer," he said. "Thanks to paparazzi."
Mr. Jason grew up in Guguletu, a black township just outside Cape Town, the eldest of six children of a mother who worked as a maid and a blind father who was unemployed.
For decades, Mr. Jason scraped by as a freelancer. He bought stolen cameras because they were cheap. He shot pin-ups for Drum, a black magazine, while working as a driver for a cosmetics company.
But he considers himself a newsman. In the 1980's, he photographed anti-apartheid protests, and was once jailed with Archbishop Tutu. Last year, covering a march against crime, he was hit by 38 pieces of bird shot, he said. In 1994, when the former black homeland Bophutatswana exploded, he traveled 20 hours by minibus taxi to get there because he could not afford a plane ticket. He says he has paid his own way to photograph the genocide in Rwanda and unrest in Hebron.
But before the London tabloids began phoning him, he often earned a pittance. He said, for example, that he had taken a picture of Archbishop Tutu opening his swimming pool to poor children and that a local paper would pay him only $3 for it.
But for other pictures, British papers have paid him as much as 6,000 pounds -- $9,000 -- for a shot. "Six thousand pounds?" he said. "That's abracadabra where I come from."
His first tabloid commission was to get a picture of the girlfriend of Mark Thatcher, son of the former Prime Minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher. Mr. Thatcher moved to Cape Town in 1995. Mr. Jason went to the woman's house dressed in overalls and, in broken English, asked for a job as a gardener.
"While I was talking to her, my cell phone went off in my pocket," he said. "She said: 'You want gardening work, and you have a cell phone? I guess this is the new South Africa.' " He told her it was a child's toy and retreated. He then followed her for a week and hid in a flower bed to shoot pictures as she picked up her children at school.
He tricked Eva Herzigova, the Wonderbra model, into posing by telling her he was a fan and asking for a picture together. He sneaked up on Michael Jackson while he was dining in Sun City. When the former husband of Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles's girlfriend, honeymooned here with his new wife, Mr. Jason phoned them from the lobby. They said they wanted nothing to do with The Daily Mail, so Mr. Jason quickly changed his story and said The Mail was a local black paper. "They came down and posed," he said, and the pictures were on the front pages in London the next day.
When Earl Spencer started building a house in the Constantia suburb of Cape Town, a British tabloid asked for a picture. Mr. Jason disguised himself as a workman, hiding his camera in a lunch box. "I was stacking some bricks, and he walked by," he said. "I said, 'Hi, boss,' and he nodded, and I took a couple of snaps a few seconds later."
He also photographed the Earl's estranged wife and children, who were living in a different house. Then, he got a big break -- a maid he knew said her employer had a bed and breakfast where the Earl was meeting a girlfriend. He paid her to get the license plates of their cars, and promised her $420 if he got a picture of them together. Then he went to the girlfriend's house and befriended the gardener, hoping to confirm the story.
He said The Mail, fearful of being sued, did not run his article for months, until the woman's devastated husband had sold his own story to another British paper.
Meanwhile, the Earl had sued him, asking for a court order preventing any photographs of him or his family without his permission. That prompted the Freedom of Expression Institute, which defends press freedom here, to step in to underwrite Mr. Jason's defense.
The first judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing him from photographing the Earl.
"That really concerned us," said Alexandra Kuhn, coordinator of the institute's legal defense fund. "A public figure should be photographable when out in public."
The judge who heard the motion for a permanent order -- during which Mr. Jason was defended without charge by Wim Trengrove, a prominent constitutional lawyer -- insisted that the two sides settle, Miss Kuhn said.
Mr. Jason agreed to stop photographing the Earl's wife and children, to photograph him only in public places and to stay 10 yards away from him and 50 yards from his house. But, before the settlement was reached, he took another photograph of the Earl and was fined about $4,800 for contempt of court.
While he was in Israel, Mr. Jason said, his furniture and computer were seized to cover the debt.
Earl Spencer's lawyer declined to discuss the case. A message left with her asking the Earl to call was not returned.
Even Mr. Jason's backers say he is ruthless about his job and, in so many words, he admits it. "It puts bread on the table," he said.
Some of the paparazzi in Paris have been accused of taking pictures of Diana as she lay dying. Asked if he would do the same, Mr. Jason said: "Sure. I've taken hundreds of pictures of dead bodies. I'd commit professional suicide if I walked away from that. But I do feel sorry for her. She was a nice person."

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts Help the Wealthy in the Strong Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In the tough years of the early 1990's, the states raised taxes that hit the poor harder than the affluent. Now that the booming economy has made the states flush with money, they are cutting taxes -- for the affluent.
Sales and excise taxes, which fall more heavily on people at low income levels, were raised $11.7 billion from 1990 through 1993, data from the National Conference of State Legislatures show. These taxes have been cut by just $200 million, or less than 2 percent of the amount of the increase, since 1994. 
 From 1990 through 1993, the states raised income taxes, the major state tax burden on affluent people, by $8.2 billion. Since 1994, the states have more than reversed these increases with income tax cuts totaling $9.8 billion. (All the figures have been adjusted for inflation.)
In other words, individual income taxes accounted for 32 percent of all state tax increases from 1990 through 1993, but 72 percent of all state tax cuts since 1993.
"In most states, these changes have made already regressive state tax systems more regressive," said Nicholas Johnson, who studies state taxes for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. A report on state taxes by Mr. Johnson and Iris J. Lav is posted on the Internet (http://www.cbpp.org/ 930sttax.htm).
Sales and other taxes that are considered regressive (because their impact declines as incomes rise) were raised by 36 states in the early part of the decade, while only 9 states have cut these taxes since 1994. But only 20 states raised income taxes in the early 90's, and 20 states have cut income taxes since 1994, the budget center found.
Elizabeth Davis, a policy analyst at the Center for the Study of States in Albany, said the budget center's report "fits with what I am finding, which is that poor people now are bearing more of the burden of state taxes.
"States in the past few years have been cutting personal income and corporate income taxes right and left," she said, "especially in New York and New Jersey, whereas they have not cut sales taxes much at all."
The National Governors' Association cautioned that a deeper analysis of the details behind the tax data might show less vivid differences.
"You have to be real careful about sales taxes and whether they really are regressive," said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the association. "A lot of states have exempted food, and many do not tax services, and so their sales taxes are designed to not be as regressive as an across-the-board sales tax."
Mr. Scheppach also faulted the budget center's analysis for not taking into account the early 1980's, when "many states raised income taxes and imposed surcharges because they had to."
But Mr. Johnson said he believed that a more detailed analysis would show that the shifting of state government tax burdens toward low- and moderate-income people was even worse than the report's figures suggested. He said many states had reduced services to low-income people in the 1990 recession and raised fees for services, like mass transit systems, that have a greater impact on the working poor.
Over all, the states count on sales and similar regressive taxes for just under half of their revenue. Individual income taxes, imposed by 41 states, produce nearly one-third of state revenue.
More increases in sales tax rates are unlikely in the near future, said Sally Adams of CCH State Tax Review, a publication for tax lawyers, "because a savvy public notices." But, she said, eight states have increased cigarette taxes, and five have raised gasoline taxes, both of which tend to fall more heavily on people with low incomes.
The techniques by which the states have cut income taxes have also tended to favor affluent people, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said.
The budget center found that 19 states had a maximum personal income tax rate of 7 percent or more in 1993, compared with 15 states today. Two more states, Maryland and Rhode Island, have enacted tax cuts that will reduce their maximum income tax rate below 7 percent in the next few years. Reducing the highest rate benefits only the residents with the highest incomes.
The report singled out Iowa as an example of a state that shifted tax burdens onto the poor. Iowa raised its sales tax from 4 percent to 5 percent in 1990, but since then, Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, has made an across-the-board decrease in individual income taxes, which tends to benefit high-income people more. New York, Ohio and Delaware used similar strategies that shift tax burdens to low-income people, the report said.
Only two states, Georgia and Missouri, have made significant cuts in sales taxes.
"In most states," the budget center's report said, "tax reductions or increases are considered without much information or debate over the extent to which various income groups would benefit or be harmed." Only Minnesota routinely makes such analyses public before tax changes are made.

HEADLINE: A Spanish Princess's Wedding Is Rich in Regional Symbolism

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Princess Cristina, the third in line to the Spanish throne, married a Basque commoner who is a professional athlete today in a ceremony that paid tribute to Spain's diverse regions.
The Roman Catholic service in the 13th-century cathedral was principally in Spanish, but also used Catalan, the regional language spoken in Barcelona, where the bride lives, and the Basque language, the groom's native tongue. Crowds lining the 10-mile procession route waved little blue flags that read "Best Wishes" in the three languages. 
 Princess Cristina Federica de Borbon y Grecia, 32, is the first member of the Spanish royal family ever to hold a salaried job; she prepares photographic exhibitions for a savings bank foundation. The groom, Inaki Urdangarin, 29, is a professional handball team player. They met last year at the Atlanta Summer Olympics.
The wedding of the middle child of King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia was in step with the royal family's efforts to strengthen links to all the country's regions. It is a style that has helped make the royal family enormously popular since the monarchy was restored in 1975 after the death of the right-wing dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco.
But the televised storybook images from the Catalonian capital of the smiling princess in a long white gown -- scenes made available without charge by state-run television to stations around the world -- did not show a growing undercurrent of political tension between Spain's regions and Madrid.
The wedding served as a weekend pause in the battle of words.
The minority conservative Government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar controls Parliament thanks to support from the Barcelona-based Catalonian nationalist coalition, which in return has extracted concessions for greater control over the regional budget.
The Catalonian political leader, Jordi Pujol, was seated one row behind the Prime Minister in the cathedral today. Mr. Pujol has been staying at arm's length from the Government, partly because of incidents like the one at a recent benefit concert in Madrid that was supported by the central Government in which a performer was loudly heckled for singing in a dialect of Catalan.
But Mr. Aznar's relations are even worse with the Basque Nationalist Party, which withdrew its support for him last month after failing to win control over regional unemployment policy. The party leader declined an invitation to the wedding.
The Catalonian and Basque regions have been the traditional economic powerhouses of Spain, attracting job-seekers from poorer Spanish regions. They are also the two regions that have voiced support loudest for independence. The Basque region has an active separatist group that for years has used bomb attacks and kidnappings to fight Madrid.
The history of the regions made the match of the Spanish Princess, who has lived in Barcelona for five years, and the tall Basque athlete all the more engrossing for ordinary Spaniards.
"Just because we have our own language and culture doesn't mean that we reject Spain," said Alicia Ruiz, 22, a waitress at a hotel near the cathedral. "It's a shame how they think of us."
The King's oldest daughter, Princess Elena, also married a commoner, in Seville in 1995. That leaves only Crown Prince Felipe, 29, unmarried. And he has not expressed any wish to hurry to follow his sisters.

HEADLINE: Freshman Democrat Is Dogged by Relentless Foe

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The champagne bubbled, balloons kissed the ceiling and Loretta Sanchez stood center stage two weeks after the election, savoring the clatter of voices at her official victory party, thinking to herself it was all finally over.
She had defeated Representative Robert K. Dornan, the brash Orange County, Calif., conservative, by 984 votes, and she had done it in her first-ever run for Congress. It was the biggest upset of the election season; an upstart Hispanic Democrat had managed to upstage Mr. Dornan, an Irish Catholic Republican stalwart, in his own Republican stronghold. 
 But nearly 11 months later, Ms. Sanchez is still trying to beat back Mr. Dornan and jam him into a dark closet somewhere, preferably one that is soundproof. Hardly a day goes by, she said, that she is not shadowed by the former eight-term Congressman, a man best known for bombast.
Twice when she has gone to vote on the House floor, there he was, glad-handing his onetime colleagues across the way. Often when she reads a newspaper, there he is, on the front page, calling her a lapsed Catholic. A scan of the radio dial turns up Mr. Dornan again, on the Oliver North show. Even in the sanctity of her office, Mr. Dornan is there, in the guise of his son's voice, booming messages into her answering machine, a charge Mr. Dornan denies.
"I thought I had seen the last of Bob Dornan," she said. "I won the election. Let's get on with it. But people won't let me get on with it."
Mr. Dornan has contested the election, charging that it was stolen from him by bad ballots cast by people who were not United States citizens, or in some cases, not legal United States residents. The Committee on House Oversight has been investigating the claim for nearly 10 months, digging through Immigration and Naturalization Service work sheets and Orange County voter rolls.
The inquiry has led to flashes of revolt among Democrats, who call it an inquisition aimed more at frightening away Hispanic voters than uncovering fraud. Republican leaders counter that evidence is mounting in Mr. Dornan's quest to unseat Ms. Sanchez. There seems little question that some bad votes were cast. The issue remains: how many? Democrats contend the number falls far short of 984.
"It puts the Republicans in a difficult position," said John Pitney, a former deputy director of the Republican National Committee and now a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. "On the one hand, they don't want a seat taken away from them by fraud. But between Dornan's personality and Democratic accusations of sharp anti-Latino bias, there is a downside to it."
There is a sense of unease, a feeling of perpetual preoccupation, about the whole affair for Ms. Sanchez, and it is clearly felt inside her Capitol Hill office. A few framed photographs sit on tabletops, and assorted inspirational messages hang on the walls. But the oversize bookcase sits forlorn, close to empty.
There is one stand-out decorating touch. A couple of model B-2 bombers sit near her door, as if to defy her opponent, the man some called "B-1" Bob for his support of the earlier B-1 bomber.
In beating Mr. Dornan, Ms. Sanchez became more than an ordinary freshman lawmaker. The 37-year-old businesswoman became a political celebrity, an icon for Democrats and underdogs alike. "She has become a symbol," said Representative Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who spearheaded the successful vote to banish Mr. Dornan from the House floor in September after an acrimonious exchange with him there.
Busboys and Capitol Hill police officers thank her for ousting Mr. Dornan. Strangers who would never recognize their own representatives stop her at airports in places like Chicago and Houston. People at the grocery store ask her for autographs. And she is a major draw at conventions and luncheons around the country.
Ms. Sanchez even managed to steal a bit of the limelight at a dinner for President Clinton. "I really just came to meet this Loretta Sanchez," she said people told her.
In the House, where Republicans hold a frail 11-seat majority, Democratic Party power brokers have made a point of rallying around their prize, making it clear that her primary mission is to endure, and, above all, get re-elected. The President has offered her a ride on Air Force One. She was seated next to Vice President Al Gore at a meeting with the Hispanic Caucus. And Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt and Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut, among others, are jumping in to help with fund-raising.
Just last week, several members, sporting orange ribbons in solidarity, delayed work on the House floor to protest the committee's investigation.
For Ms. Sanchez, however, this sudden jump from businesswoman to political symbol is a mixed blessing. Nobody much cares about her ideas on immigration, small businesses or education, despite her repeated attempts to focus on those issues. It is her battle with Mr. Dornan that captivates them.
The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Ms. Sanchez never held elective office before last November. She ran for a seat on the five-member Anaheim, Calif., City Council once and came in 8th out of 16 candidates. Her background was pure business, a degree in economics, a master's in business administration, a job as a financial analyst.
During much of the campaign, Mr. Dornan painted her as anti-Catholic because of her stand in favor of a woman's right to choose an abortion, a "pretend Hispanic" and a carpetbagger. But, she said, the charges didn't stick. Too many people knew her, knew her history, knew her parents and her six brothers and sisters.
In a county undergoing seismic demographic shifts, Ms. Sanchez seemed the perfect antidote to the divisiveness threatening Asians, those of Spanish heritage and whites, her colleagues say.
She grew up straddling two worlds, speaking Spanish at home, English everywhere else. She married a man with not a drop of Latino blood in him. Her mother, who attended school through the third grade, cooked tortillas and tamales for her children at dinner and also volunteered as a Brownie troop leader and bake sale organizer.
Every week her father, who worked at a rubber and plastics factory, chose a chapter from a book in Spanish -- "Don Quixote" was a favorite -- and made every child in the family deliver book reports.
There was little wiggle room with some of the family's cultural traditions. Dating was out, for the most part. And curfews were written in stone; on prom night, it was midnight. Some habits just stuck with her, like sewing, which she learned from her mother. On inauguration night this year, Ms. Sanchez made her own dress, a shimmery gold gown, in four hours.
When her parents first moved to Anaheim, then a neighborhood of few Hispanic residents, one "For Sale" sign after the next popped up on their street. But Ms. Sanchez said if she was ever discriminated against, she did not notice.
Ultimately, she was drawn to Congress out of disappointment with Republican views on immigration and women's issues. And her neighborhood seemed headed toward decay.
Xavier Becerra, the chairman of the Hispanic Caucus and a California Democrat, encouraged her to run. "Her tenacity, that's what I liked about her," he said. "The fact that she's still standing and has not lost her way, or her sense of humor, shows she is a strong woman."
Being the new kid on the block is difficult enough in Washington, Mr. Becerra said. Throw in a commute to California, where her husband still lives, constant requests for interviews, meetings with lawyers and, above all, Mr. Dornan's shadow, "then you have something that's a tremendous load," Mr. Becerra added.
So far, the committee's investigation has cost Ms. Sanchez about $300,000, for legal fees, at a rate that increases by $10,000 a week. What little time she has left after her Congressional duties is spent raising money. That means lots of late nights and weekends on the phone.
"I usually am always working," she said. The last movie she saw in a theater, "The English Patient," opened last year.
"My family has suffered the most," she said. "I mean, I'm Hispanic. I live 10 minutes away from my mom. I was used to having a cup of coffee with her in the morning or after work. And if I don't show up for a couple of days, there is a message on my machine saying, 'Are you still alive?"'
Democrats see the committee investigation as an orchestrated effort by Republicans to sap Ms. Sanchez's campaign fund and her energy.
"It's a diversion," Ms. Kennelly said.
Already, Republicans sense vulnerability. Ralph Reed, the Christian Coalition wunderkind turned political consultant, has accepted a Republican Councilman from Anaheim as a client in the next race for the Congressional seat and calls winning back the district "do or die."
Her critics say that Ms. Sanchez's voting record, which seldom strays from the Democratic Party line, will contribute to her undoing in a district that is still strongly conservative. And her inexperience sometimes shows. She has committed a few public gaffes, pretending, for example, to be a staff member when she picked up the telephone in her office late one evening in front of a Los Angeles Times reporter or scolding Mr. Gephardt on C-Span for not returning her calls.
Mr. Reed calls her an "accidental Congresswoman," who won because Mr. Dornan was too busy running for President to focus on his Congressional seat.
But Ms. Kennelly, the veteran lawmaker who will run for governor of Connecticut next year and who took Ms. Sanchez in as a roomate for five months, disagreed.
"You don't get to Congress as a woman unless you are successful in other areas," she said.
Ms. Sanchez copes by trying to blot out distractions. Or by exercising. In good weather, she jogs three miles along the Mall in the morning. If not, she puffs away in the House gym, sometimes next to Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip in the House. She does not care that she is the only woman who uses the gym. She has been busy making a strong suit of armor for herself.
"I know the truth," she said. "The truth is, I went against a system that was stacked against me. I worked very hard to change the system, and it worked."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You are right to oppose President Clinton's cheerful interpretation of the latest Census data about the rise in median income by stating that "even a healthy economy leaves the poor firmly in a depressing place" (editorial, Oct. 2). You are also to be commended for publishing William Greider's Oct. 1 Op-Ed article, in which he asks, Who is going to buy the excess output produced by the global economy, whose workings "erode the worldwide consumption base"? 
 But your editorial regrettably accepts the popular rationalization of mainstream economics that "sluggish productivity gains produce sluggish income gains." How so, given all the downsizing and computerizing in progress for so many years?
Much more plausible is the explanation to be derived from Henry Ford's wisdom -- if you want to have paying customers, make sure that they are adequately paid as producers.

To the Editor:
It is misleading to suggest that stagnant median incomes can be entirely explained by sluggish gains in productivity (editorial, Oct. 2). You do not mention that this slow growth has been accompanied by the highest corporate profits on record. 
 This apparent paradox was explained by Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley, who pointed out that the present economic recovery is a "labor-crunch recovery" -- one that flourishes only because corporate America has dramatically reduced its cost by putting "unrelenting pressure on its work force" (Op-Ed, Aug. 24).
Both high corporate profits and stagnant median incomes can mostly be attributed to the same cause: out of the stream of income (productivity) that the economy has been generating during this recovery, a larger flow than usual has been diverted from the nation's workers to its major stockholders.

To the Editor:
"The Tide Is Not Lifting Everyone" (editorial, Oct. 2) correctly pinpoints the fact that the current recovery has yet to produce a prosperity that includes working-class and poor families. However, you argue that the reason the 1990's recovery has not produced income gains commensurate with the 30 percent rise in the 1950's is that productivity today is rising at a tepid 1 percent clip. 
 This argument would lead one to conclude that worker income should be rising at that same modest rate. In fact, it is only in the last year that wages have begun to creep up. Moreover, overall productivity growth is up for each year of the recovery. Following your argument, this improvement should by now have produced median family incomes higher than the 1989 peak. But, as the recent Census Bureau data show, median family income is still 2.7 percent below the 1989 level.
The causes of the disjuncture between family income and economic growth are many. But one major cause is the decline in worker bargaining power -- unionization -- at the same time that employer power has strengthened in the wake of technological change and globalization.
Until workers are able to enhance their bargaining power, we will see a long-term erosion in real median family income, even in the face of productivity growth.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Smiling on Smaller Stocks

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
CALL it the revenge of the small stocks. In the third quarter these stocks not only outperformed their larger brethren -- a rare event in itself recently -- but by a margin not seen since the fourth quarter of 1992.
The small stocks began their ascent in the spring, and in the most recent quarter they nearly doubled the return of the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large stocks. In recognition, four of the five professional money managers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times are adding funds that own smaller stocks. 
 "Over the last few years, large-cap funds have done extremely well, and we want to take advantage of the fact that small- and mid-cap funds haven't participated in this rally," said Eric M. Kobren, president of Insight Management and editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass.
"We've started to see that market percolate over the past few months, and we think there's a lot more room to grow," he said. His portfolio of Fidelity funds rose 11.65 percent, to place first in the quarter.
Because he has become concerned about his exposure to large stocks through Fidelity Dividend Growth, Mr. Kobren is selling that position and buying shares in Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock, whose portfolio has a weighted median market capitalization of about $3 billion. And while the fund's manager, Katherine Collins, likes growth stocks, Mr. Kobren said, "we like the fact that she is not a momentum-type investor who will invest in emerging growth-type companies selling at infinite multiples."
He also sold Europe Capital Appreciation and bought Fidelity International Value. The move "gives us a little more diversification, as Europe has seen interest rates rise and their currencies, after bottoming out, appear to be rising again." International Value will also provide exposure to Japan, where Mr. Kobren said he expects growth to pick up.
THE domestic market has reached a turning point, agreed Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who builds portfolios of "socially responsible" funds. "I think that, at this point, large-cap stocks have leveled out and the smaller stocks will be back in favor," said Mr. Brill, whose portfolio rose 9.28 percent, placing third.
As a result, he is reducing his position in Domini Social Equity to 20 percent of his portfolio, from 25 percent. The fund aims to mimic the sector distribution of the S.& P. 500 but to do that and still own only stocks that meet social criteria, it picks from both the S.& P. 500 and the 500 next-largest stocks. He is also shrinking his position in MMA Praxis Growth, a large-cap value fund, to 10 percent from 15 percent.
He is using the proceeds from those sales to buy Ariel Appreciation, a socially responsible fund that buys small- and mid-cap stocks. It "holds no technology stocks, has a low turnover rate and caters to the patient investor," he said.
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers with a gain of 116.21 percent since the contest began more than four years ago, on July 7, 1993. The five portfolios have risen an average of 94.84 percent, compared with 136.01 percent for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500.
The performance of the hypothetical portfolios, tracked each quarter by Lipper Analytical Services, excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The managers can choose any fund open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, but the portfolios were intended to grow for 20 years.
All five portfolios made money in the third quarter. Still, none beat the 11.82 percent average for diversified domestic stock funds as calculated by Lipper.
The portfolio constructed by John Rekenthaler, formerly of Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund research firm, was taken over by Susan Dziubinski, editor of Morningstar Investor. (Mr. Rekenthaler has joined John Nuveen & Company.) Ms. Dziubinski said the portfolio, which rose 9.53 percent in the quarter to earn second place, was quite conservative, and she began making changes to lift its potential return.
She replaced Templeton Global Smaller Companies with Small Cap World, saying she thought its managers were better domestic stock-pickers.
She also sold Fidelity Trend because its manager, Arieh Coll, "is definitely a rising star at Fidelity, and I can see the company moving him onto a bigger fund at some point." She replaced it with the Yacktman Fund. "Don Yacktman's growth-at-a-reasonable-price approach works over the long haul," she said. "And while his concentrated style can be risky -- the most recent portfolio holds just 36 names -- I have a long time horizon."
Finally, Ms. Dziubinski added Colonial Newport Tiger, noting that its focus, the Pacific region, has been one of the worst-performing market segments over the last few years. "I want to be there for the rebound, and Colonial Newport Tiger is the Cadillac" of Pacific funds that exclude Japan, she said.
Mr. Jacobs, who placed fourth this quarter with a gain of 9.27 percent, is adding Hotchkis & Wiley Small Cap to increase exposure to small stocks. He likes its size, just $41 million in assets, and its value orientation.
Mr. Jacobs eliminated Vanguard Emerging Markets Index. Given the recent jolts to the emerging markets, he said, some countries may take considerable time to recover. As a result, he said, "I now prefer an actively managed fund, which can dramatically change its country weightings." His pick is Montgomery Emerging Markets because of its performance and the fact that it is diversified among up to 32 countries. The Vanguard fund owns stocks in just 14 countries, he said.
Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., placed last in the quarter with a gain of 4.42 percent. But he plans no changes other than rebalancing his portfolio back to its percentage allocations at the start of the last quarter.
"Once again, overall performance has been dragged down by our international allocation," Mr. Evensky said. "The safety provided by diversification is not a free lunch. The benefit is never having all of your investments in the wrong place at the wrong time. Diversification may not make you rich, but it will not make you poor."

 CORRECTION:
A table last Sunday with an article in the Mutual Fund Quarterly Report about the performance of five hypothetical retirement portfolios misstated the third-quarter return of the Vanguard Emerging Markets Index fund in the portfolio prepared by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y. The fund's 9.3 percent change was a drop, not a rise.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE -- In 2 Corners of City, a Surge in Hispanic Power;
Brooklyn Area May Put Puerto Rican on Council

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Watching Angel Rodriguez enter the Sunset Park Senior Citizen Center is something like witnessing the second coming of Elvis. Men shout and offer handshakes; women swoon and demand besos, or kisses. Mr. Rodriguez, 40, circulates, giving hugs, besos and advice, even joking about his bulging belly with a group of women.
This, said Mr. Rodriguez, the Democratic nominee for the 38th Council District, is his base: the elderly who know struggle and know him, a "regular guy trying to help the community." 
 Mr. Rodriguez's larger base is Sunset Park, the heart of the district and his home for 20 years. If, as expected, he wins in November, he will be the district's first Councilman from Sunset Park and the first Hispanic to represent a district whose contours were drawn for just that purpose.
The 38th begins at the south end of largely working-class Sunset Park, cuts a fat swath north to take in the middle-class blocks of Windsor Terrace and a slice of Park Slope, moves into Red Hook with its dense public housing, turns sharply right, narrowing, then broadens to take in Boerum Hill's brownstones and the Gowanus and Wyckoff housing projects.
Its contorted shape was sketched in 1991, part of a redistricting plan intended to give minorities greater political representation. In the 38th, the goal was to give Hispanic voters a greater chance to win the seat, although the district has significant white, black and Chinese populations. But Joan Griffin McCabe won in 1991 and in 1993. She did not run again this year.
Mr. Rodriguez, a self-employed management consultant and accountant, was encouraged to run by Felix W. Ortiz, the State Assemblyman from the 51st District. Mr. Rodriguez campaigned door to door and won 2,204 of the 6,708 votes cast, avoiding a runoff in the five-way primary.
Mr. Ortiz said he admired Mr. Rodriguez: the son of a Puerto Rican mother who herself moved from welfare to sweatshops to factories, he put himself through school and started his own business. He became heavily involved in the community, from coaching youth sports teams to establishing a nonprofit group to offer computer training in Sunset Park.
But Mr. Rodriguez's only political experience has been as a Democratic district leader, and some critics question a political novice's ability to maneuver successfully within the Council's sophisticated land-use and budget processes. Mr. Rodriguez said his priorities included bringing a high school to Sunset Park, increasing housing for the elderly and pushing a plan to replace the Gowanus Expressway with a tunnel.
Critics say the creation of the 38th points up the flaws in redistricting: it did not guarantee a Hispanic election, but did string together geographically distant and culturally and economically disparate neighborhoods.
But the president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, Angelo Falcon, pointed to the tripling of Hispanic Council members since 1990, and said redistricting had provided political parity. It had not, he noted, proved a panacea.
"The question now," Mr. Falcon said, "is how do we hold these representatives accountable, make them more effective voices?"
The district will likely be redrawn in 2001 because the United States Supreme Court has ruled that districts cannot be shaped to enhance a racial or an ethnic group's political prospects.
"I don't think we'll see districts that look like that," said Esmeralda Simmons, head of the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College, who helped create the 38th. AMY WALDMAN

HEADLINE: Stalking Africa's Newest Game: Hostile Celebrities

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN

 BODY:
Although he hates the title, Fanie Jason is known as South Africa's only paparazzo.
Other than President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, this country does not have many faces that are recognized overseas, so he does not get rich at his job. Last year, one minor celebrity he relentlessly tailed for a British tabloid sued and nearly bankrupted him. Since then, that man has become famous as a symbol of fury at paparazzi: Earl Spencer, the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. 
 The case of Spencer v. Jason, which drew in a press freedom institute and a top constitutional lawyer, pitted two figures who inspire both admiration and disdain in others.
Mr. Jason is a quick-thinking photographer who has fought his way up, out of the poverty and despair of a black township. He stalks his targets relentlessly and admits that he has lied or played on white guilt to trick people into posing. Since Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris while fleeing photographers, he has received death threats, he said.
Earl Spencer is widely admired for the eulogy he gave at his sister's funeral and for saying paparazzi and newspaper editors had "her blood on their hands." But he was briefly a journalist himself, and speaks to gossip writers when it suits him.
Celebrity-poor South Africa became a battleground for him because he moved his family here two years ago, ostensibly to get away from the attention he was getting in Britain as Diana's brother. He was one of a handful of well-known Europeans and Americans who have vacationed or moved here since apartheid sanctions were lifted.
That influx is Mr. Jason's bread and butter, and he is not embarrassed about what he does. "I have a Toyota now, and a computer," he said. "Thanks to paparazzi."
Mr. Jason grew up in Guguletu, a black township just outside Cape Town, the eldest of six children of a mother who worked as a maid and a blind father who was unemployed.
For decades, Mr. Jason scraped by as a freelancer. He bought stolen cameras because they were cheap. He shot pin-ups for Drum, a black magazine, while working as a driver for a cosmetics company.
But he considers himself a newsman. In the 1980's, he photographed anti-apartheid protests, and was once jailed with Archbishop Tutu. Last year, covering a march against crime, he was hit by 38 pieces of bird shot, he said. In 1994, when the former black homeland Bophutatswana exploded, he traveled 20 hours by minibus taxi to get there because he could not afford a plane ticket. He says he has paid his own way to photograph the genocide in Rwanda and unrest in Hebron.
But before the London tabloids began phoning him, he often earned a pittance. He said, for example, that he had taken a picture of Archbishop Tutu opening his swimming pool to poor children and that a local paper would pay him only $3 for it.
But for other pictures, British papers have paid him as much as 6,000 pounds -- $9,000 -- for a shot. "Six thousand pounds?" he said. "That's abracadabra where I come from."
His first tabloid commission was to get a picture of the girlfriend of Mark Thatcher, son of the former Prime Minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher. Mr. Thatcher moved to Cape Town in 1995. Mr. Jason went to the woman's house dressed in overalls and, in broken English, asked for a job as a gardener.
"While I was talking to her, my cell phone went off in my pocket," he said. "She said: 'You want gardening work, and you have a cell phone? I guess this is the new South Africa.' " He told her it was a child's toy and retreated. He then followed her for a week and hid in a flower bed to shoot pictures as she picked up her children at school.
He tricked Eva Herzigova, the Wonderbra model, into posing by telling her he was a fan and asking for a picture together. He sneaked up on Michael Jackson while he was dining in Sun City. When the former husband of Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles's girlfriend, honeymooned here with his new wife, Mr. Jason phoned them from the lobby. They said they wanted nothing to do with The Daily Mail, so Mr. Jason quickly changed his story and said The Mail was a local black paper. "They came down and posed," he said, and the pictures were on the front pages in London the next day.
When Earl Spencer started building a house in the Constantia suburb of Cape Town, a British tabloid asked for a picture. Mr. Jason disguised himself as a workman, hiding his camera in a lunch box. "I was stacking some bricks, and he walked by," he said. "I said, 'Hi, boss,' and he nodded, and I took a couple of snaps a few seconds later."
He also photographed the Earl's estranged wife and children, who were living in a different house. Then, he got a big break -- a maid he knew said her employer had a bed and breakfast where the Earl was meeting a girlfriend. He paid her to get the license plates of their cars, and promised her $420 if he got a picture of them together. Then he went to the girlfriend's house and befriended the gardener, hoping to confirm the story.
He said The Mail, fearful of being sued, did not run his article for months, until the woman's devastated husband had sold his own story to another British paper.
Meanwhile, the Earl had sued him, asking for a court order preventing any photographs of him or his family without his permission. That prompted the Freedom of Expression Institute, which defends press freedom here, to step in to underwrite Mr. Jason's defense.
The first judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing him from photographing the Earl.
"That really concerned us," said Alexandra Kuhn, coordinator of the institute's legal defense fund. "A public figure should be photographable when out in public."
The judge who heard the motion for a permanent order -- during which Mr. Jason was defended without charge by Wim Trengrove, a prominent constitutional lawyer -- insisted that the two sides settle, Miss Kuhn said.
Mr. Jason agreed to stop photographing the Earl's wife and children, to photograph him only in public places and to stay 10 yards away from him and 50 yards from his house. But, before the settlement was reached, he took another photograph of the Earl and was fined about $4,800 for contempt of court.
While he was in Israel, Mr. Jason said, his furniture and computer were seized to cover the debt.
Earl Spencer's lawyer declined to discuss the case. A message left with her asking the Earl to call was not returned.
Even Mr. Jason's backers say he is ruthless about his job and, in so many words, he admits it. "It puts bread on the table," he said.
Some of the paparazzi in Paris have been accused of taking pictures of Diana as she lay dying. Asked if he would do the same, Mr. Jason said: "Sure. I've taken hundreds of pictures of dead bodies. I'd commit professional suicide if I walked away from that. But I do feel sorry for her. She was a nice person."

HEADLINE: A Spanish Princess's Wedding Is Rich in Regional Symbolism

BYLINE: By The New York Times By The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Princess Cristina, the third in line to the Spanish throne, married a Basque commoner who is a professional athlete today in a ceremony that paid tribute to Spain's diverse regions.
The Roman Catholic service in the 13th-century cathedral was principally in Spanish, but also used Catalan, the regional language spoken in Barcelona, where the bride lives, and the Basque language, the groom's native tongue. Crowds lining the 10-mile procession route waved little blue flags that read "Best Wishes" in the three languages. 
 Princess Cristina Federica de Borbon y Grecia, 32, is the first member of the Spanish royal family ever to hold a salaried job; she prepares photographic exhibitions for a savings bank foundation. The groom, Inaki Urdangarin, 29, is a professional handball team player. They met last year at the Atlanta Summer Olympics.
The wedding of the middle child of King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia was in step with the royal family's efforts to strengthen links to all the country's regions. It is a style that has helped make the royal family enormously popular since the monarchy was restored in 1975 after the death of the right-wing dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco.
But the televised storybook images from the Catalonian capital of the smiling princess in a long white gown -- scenes made available without charge by state-run television to stations around the world -- did not show a growing undercurrent of political tension between Spain's regions and Madrid.
The wedding served as a weekend pause in the battle of words.
The minority conservative Government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar controls Parliament thanks to support from the Barcelona-based Catalonian nationalist coalition, which in return has extracted concessions for greater control over the regional budget.
The Catalonian political leader, Jordi Pujol, was seated one row behind the Prime Minister in the cathedral today. Mr. Pujol has been staying at arm's length from the Government, partly because of incidents like the one at a recent benefit concert in Madrid that was supported by the central Government in which a performer was loudly heckled for singing in a dialect of Catalan.
But Mr. Aznar's relations are even worse with the Basque Nationalist Party, which withdrew its support for him last month after failing to win control over regional unemployment policy. The party leader declined an invitation to the wedding.
The Catalonian and Basque regions have been the traditional economic powerhouses of Spain, attracting job-seekers from poorer Spanish regions. They are also the two regions that have voiced support loudest for independence. The Basque region has an active separatist group that for years has used bomb attacks and kidnappings to fight Madrid.
The history of the regions made the match of the Spanish Princess, who has lived in Barcelona for five years, and the tall Basque athlete all the more engrossing for ordinary Spaniards.
"Just because we have our own language and culture doesn't mean that we reject Spain," said Alicia Ruiz, 22, a waitress at a hotel near the cathedral. "It's a shame how they think of us."
The King's oldest daughter, Princess Elena, also married a commoner, in Seville in 1995. That leaves only Crown Prince Felipe, 29, unmarried. And he has not expressed any wish to hurry to follow his sisters.

HEADLINE: Freshman Democrat Is Dogged by Relentless Foe

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The champagne bubbled, balloons kissed the ceiling and Loretta Sanchez stood center stage two weeks after the election, savoring the clatter of voices at her official victory party, thinking to herself it was all finally over.
She had defeated Representative Robert K. Dornan, the brash Orange County, Calif., conservative, by 984 votes, and she had done it in her first-ever run for Congress. It was the biggest upset of the election season; an upstart Hispanic Democrat had managed to upstage Mr. Dornan, an Irish Catholic Republican stalwart, in his own Republican stronghold. 
 But nearly 11 months later, Ms. Sanchez is still trying to beat back Mr. Dornan and jam him into a dark closet somewhere, preferably one that is soundproof. Hardly a day goes by, she said, that she is not shadowed by the former eight-term Congressman, a man best known for bombast.
Twice when she has gone to vote on the House floor, there he was, glad-handing his onetime colleagues across the way. Often when she reads a newspaper, there he is, on the front page, calling her a lapsed Catholic. A scan of the radio dial turns up Mr. Dornan again, on the Oliver North show. Even in the sanctity of her office, Mr. Dornan is there, in the guise of his son's voice, booming messages into her answering machine, a charge Mr. Dornan denies.
"I thought I had seen the last of Bob Dornan," she said. "I won the election. Let's get on with it. But people won't let me get on with it."
Mr. Dornan has contested the election, charging that it was stolen from him by bad ballots cast by people who were not United States citizens, or in some cases, not legal United States residents. The Committee on House Oversight has been investigating the claim for nearly 10 months, digging through Immigration and Naturalization Service work sheets and Orange County voter rolls.
The inquiry has led to flashes of revolt among Democrats, who call it an inquisition aimed more at frightening away Hispanic voters than uncovering fraud. Republican leaders counter that evidence is mounting in Mr. Dornan's quest to unseat Ms. Sanchez. There seems little question that some bad votes were cast. The issue remains: how many? Democrats contend the number falls far short of 984.
"It puts the Republicans in a difficult position," said John Pitney, a former deputy director of the Republican National Committee and now a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. "On the one hand, they don't want a seat taken away from them by fraud. But between Dornan's personality and Democratic accusations of sharp anti-Latino bias, there is a downside to it."
There is a sense of unease, a feeling of perpetual preoccupation, about the whole affair for Ms. Sanchez, and it is clearly felt inside her Capitol Hill office. A few framed photographs sit on tabletops, and assorted inspirational messages hang on the walls. But the oversize bookcase sits forlorn, close to empty.
There is one stand-out decorating touch. A couple of model B-2 bombers sit near her door, as if to defy her opponent, the man some called "B-1" Bob for his support of the earlier B-1 bomber.
In beating Mr. Dornan, Ms. Sanchez became more than an ordinary freshman lawmaker. The 37-year-old businesswoman became a political celebrity, an icon for Democrats and underdogs alike. "She has become a symbol," said Representative Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who spearheaded the successful vote to banish Mr. Dornan from the House floor in September after an acrimonious exchange with him there.
Busboys and Capitol Hill police officers thank her for ousting Mr. Dornan. Strangers who would never recognize their own representatives stop her at airports in places like Chicago and Houston. People at the grocery store ask her for autographs. And she is a major draw at conventions and luncheons around the country.
Ms. Sanchez even managed to steal a bit of the limelight at a dinner for President Clinton. "I really just came to meet this Loretta Sanchez," she said people told her.
In the House, where Republicans hold a frail 11-seat majority, Democratic Party power brokers have made a point of rallying around their prize, making it clear that her primary mission is to endure, and, above all, get re-elected. The President has offered her a ride on Air Force One. She was seated next to Vice President Al Gore at a meeting with the Hispanic Caucus. And Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt and Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut, among others, are jumping in to help with fund-raising.
Just last week, several members, sporting orange ribbons in solidarity, delayed work on the House floor to protest the committee's investigation.
For Ms. Sanchez, however, this sudden jump from businesswoman to political symbol is a mixed blessing. Nobody much cares about her ideas on immigration, small businesses or education, despite her repeated attempts to focus on those issues. It is her battle with Mr. Dornan that captivates them.
The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Ms. Sanchez never held elective office before last November. She ran for a seat on the five-member Anaheim, Calif., City Council once and came in 8th out of 16 candidates. Her background was pure business, a degree in economics, a master's in business administration, a job as a financial analyst.
During much of the campaign, Mr. Dornan painted her as anti-Catholic because of her stand in favor of a woman's right to choose an abortion, a "pretend Hispanic" and a carpetbagger. But, she said, the charges didn't stick. Too many people knew her, knew her history, knew her parents and her six brothers and sisters.
In a county undergoing seismic demographic shifts, Ms. Sanchez seemed the perfect antidote to the divisiveness threatening Asians, those of Spanish heritage and whites, her colleagues say.
She grew up straddling two worlds, speaking Spanish at home, English everywhere else. She married a man with not a drop of Latino blood in him. Her mother, who attended school through the third grade, cooked tortillas and tamales for her children at dinner and also volunteered as a Brownie troop leader and bake sale organizer.
Every week her father, who worked at a rubber and plastics factory, chose a chapter from a book in Spanish -- "Don Quixote" was a favorite -- and made every child in the family deliver book reports.
There was little wiggle room with some of the family's cultural traditions. Dating was out, for the most part. And curfews were written in stone; on prom night, it was midnight. Some habits just stuck with her, like sewing, which she learned from her mother. On inauguration night this year, Ms. Sanchez made her own dress, a shimmery gold gown, in four hours.
When her parents first moved to Anaheim, then a neighborhood of few Hispanic residents, one "For Sale" sign after the next popped up on their street. But Ms. Sanchez said if she was ever discriminated against, she did not notice.
Ultimately, she was drawn to Congress out of disappointment with Republican views on immigration and women's issues. And her neighborhood seemed headed toward decay.
Xavier Becerra, the chairman of the Hispanic Caucus and a California Democrat, encouraged her to run. "Her tenacity, that's what I liked about her," he said. "The fact that she's still standing and has not lost her way, or her sense of humor, shows she is a strong woman."
Being the new kid on the block is difficult enough in Washington, Mr. Becerra said. Throw in a commute to California, where her husband still lives, constant requests for interviews, meetings with lawyers and, above all, Mr. Dornan's shadow, "then you have something that's a tremendous load," Mr. Becerra added.
So far, the committee's investigation has cost Ms. Sanchez about $300,000, for legal fees, at a rate that increases by $10,000 a week. What little time she has left after her Congressional duties is spent raising money. That means lots of late nights and weekends on the phone.
"I usually am always working," she said. The last movie she saw in a theater, "The English Patient," opened last year.
"My family has suffered the most," she said. "I mean, I'm Hispanic. I live 10 minutes away from my mom. I was used to having a cup of coffee with her in the morning or after work. And if I don't show up for a couple of days, there is a message on my machine saying, 'Are you still alive?"'
Democrats see the committee investigation as an orchestrated effort by Republicans to sap Ms. Sanchez's campaign fund and her energy.
"It's a diversion," Ms. Kennelly said.
Already, Republicans sense vulnerability. Ralph Reed, the Christian Coalition wunderkind turned political consultant, has accepted a Republican Councilman from Anaheim as a client in the next race for the Congressional seat and calls winning back the district "do or die."
Her critics say that Ms. Sanchez's voting record, which seldom strays from the Democratic Party line, will contribute to her undoing in a district that is still strongly conservative. And her inexperience sometimes shows. She has committed a few public gaffes, pretending, for example, to be a staff member when she picked up the telephone in her office late one evening in front of a Los Angeles Times reporter or scolding Mr. Gephardt on C-Span for not returning her calls.
Mr. Reed calls her an "accidental Congresswoman," who won because Mr. Dornan was too busy running for President to focus on his Congressional seat.
But Ms. Kennelly, the veteran lawmaker who will run for governor of Connecticut next year and who took Ms. Sanchez in as a roomate for five months, disagreed.
"You don't get to Congress as a woman unless you are successful in other areas," she said.
Ms. Sanchez copes by trying to blot out distractions. Or by exercising. In good weather, she jogs three miles along the Mall in the morning. If not, she puffs away in the House gym, sometimes next to Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip in the House. She does not care that she is the only woman who uses the gym. She has been busy making a strong suit of armor for herself.
"I know the truth," she said. "The truth is, I went against a system that was stacked against me. I worked very hard to change the system, and it worked."

HEADLINE: Deterring Immigration

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Sept. 29 editorial suggests that the solution to illegal immigration is to deter entry at the border. There is a misconception that illegal immigrants typically sneak into the United States from Canada or Mexico. In fact, a larger number of them enter the country legally as visitors or students, but they become illegal by remaining beyond their authorized staying period. Strengthening border security will only go so far. 
 A better solution would be to increase penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants. If employers feared a heavy prison sentence, a substantial fine and the threat of losing their businesses as punishment for hiring illegal immigrants, this would more than neutralize the economic benefits of cheap labor.
As immigrants found it increasingly difficult to get work, there would be less incentive to come here illegally.

HEADLINE: At the U.N., a New Voice Stresses Balance in Approaching Human Rights

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Government leaders who flock to the United Nations every autumn to make speeches, drink toasts and dabble in back-room diplomacy found something new on their appointment calendars this year: human rights and Mary Robinson.
Mrs. Robinson, who resigned a largely ceremonial post as President of Ireland last month, has been the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for barely three weeks, but she has already been busy: soothing China, upsetting Algeria, reacting calmly to Afghanistan and warning the Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire. 
 "She is at ease with difficult issues and confident in dealing with them," said Stephanie Grant, program director at the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
Mrs. Robinson, 53, a human rights lawyer, has become the world's official conscience at a time when human and civil rights issues have moved nearer to the center of debates on international security or global trade.
"It is only a moral voice if you have real credibility," she said in an interview. Credibility, she said, grows from impartiality, not neutrality. "I need to be seen to be fair and impartial," she said.
Toward that end, she has tried to stress a sense of balance: weighing a country's social and economic gains as well as its progress in civil and political rights. That approach played into her discussions here with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, one of many officials she met in recent weeks.
"By this measure, more credit would be given to a very large country like China with its huge progress in the right to education, food, shelter," she said. "It is phenomenal what they have achieved. And they feel, I think, more than irritation. They feel a sense of lack of respect, a lack of recognition."
This emphasis on economic and social rights as well as "cultural and spiritual values" may eventually create friction with American human rights groups and officials who want to focus primarily on political and civil freedoms. But such concerns have been muted so far, and her appointment drew wide praise in the United States.
But last week, she already came under attack from Algeria for what it called an infringement of sovereignty after she said the country's violent confrontation with Islamic militants had become a matter of international concern.
There were also those in the poorer countries who opposed naming a European to the post. Mrs. Robinson said she deals with such opposition by talking with developing nations about "my Irishness."
The history of her country, she tells audiences, was one of imperial exploitation, violence, famine and poverty, and thus it has much in common with many countries today. To Asian leaders, she promises open debate about Western and Eastern values.
Discussing the Taliban, the militant Islamic movement that has taken control of most of Afghanistan, Mrs. Robinson does not align herself with those demanding reduced United Nations assistance because of the Taliban's harsh treatment of women.
"I intend to try to get more informed Islamic legal thinking than I've had so far," she said. "I think the problem, particularly in Afghanistan, is that this is not a village culture growing up from the communities. Village cultures are in fact very accommodating of different viewpoints. This is young men being prepared to fight a fight, and part of that is their militant sense of the Islamic law.
"We're not going to make real progress for women in Afghanistan unless we can do it within their culture," she said.
The office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, based in Geneva, was created in 1993. The first High Commissioner, Jose Ayala-Lasso, an Ecuadoran diplomat, began work in 1994.
Mr. Ayala-Lasso, who resigned this year to become Foreign Minister of Ecuador, took office under a cloud of criticism from human rights groups wary of his association with a former military government. He also faced the task of consolidating a messy collection of human rights offices at the United Nations. By the time he left, Mr. Ayala-Lasso was credited with giving the office some substance and order.
Mrs. Robinson said that she now has an opportunity to build on those achievements. She expects to name a deputy in the coming months to further strengthen her small team working in Geneva and New York on a very limited budget. Diplomats expect her to chose someone from Asia, Africa or Latin America.
Human rights groups are hopeful that under Mrs. Robinson the High Commissioner's office will have real authority.
She wants to create a human rights network within the United Nations and to support local rights groups operating in countries like Cambodia, where an expensive United Nations effort to build democracy is threatened, or in Congo, where the Government of Laurent Kabila has resisted United Nations investigations of reported massacre sites.
"As High Commissioner I will probably have uncomfortable meetings over the coming years with every Government," she said, adding that she would have to take international politics into account without becoming entangled in it.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court to Consider Major Case Concerning Race in the Workplace

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The new Supreme Court term opening Monday brings the Justices their most important affirmative action case in years, an employment dispute that could rewrite the ground rules for taking race into account in both public and private workplaces.
This case, an appeal by a New Jersey school district that dismissed a white teacher to preserve a black teacher's job, is one of 59 cases the Court has agreed so far to review. The Justices added 10 of those cases to the list just last week and will continue accepting new cases through January. For that reason, the new term, which runs until late June or early July, is not yet fully in view. 
 It would be hard for this or any term to match the fireworks of the Court's last session, during which the Justices struck down three major Federal statutes and made a huge amount of law in the course of handing down 80 decisions.
But if there are few potential landmarks on the docket so far, the cases present interesting and even unusual issues ranging from sex discrimination in Federal immigration law to the First Amendment implications of excluding minor-party candidates from campaign debates on public television to the dispute between New Jersey and New York over Ellis Island. The Justices announced last Monday that they would hear arguments between the two states over where to draw the boundary of their respective jurisdictions.
Much of the initial discussion about the new term centers on the New Jersey affirmative action case, Piscataway Board of Education v. Taxman, No. 96-679, which will be argued in January. The case gives the Court its first chance in a decade to apply Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the principal Federal law prohibiting employment discrimination, in the context of affirmative action. During that decade, the Court has moved to the right on questions of race and the country is engaged in an unresolved debate on affirmative action.
While Title VII, taken literally, appears to bar all race-conscious decision-making in employment, the Court in the past has interpreted the law more flexibly to permit some voluntary affirmative action beyond what might be strictly necessary to remedy past discrimination.
But in the Piscataway case, a Federal appeals court ruled broadly that any consideration of race is illegal under Title VII unless undertaken as a remedy for actual discrimination. Applying that analysis, the court awarded damages to a white teacher who lost her job when a New Jersey school board, trying to shrink the high school business department by one teacher, invoked its affirmative action plan to preserve the job of a black teacher with equal seniority who was the department's only black member.
The school district's appeal gives the Court the opportunity to rule either narrowly or broadly: narrowly on the validity of the particular layoff decision, which the Court will almost certainly find to have been improper, or broadly on the appeals court's theory of Title VII, which would eliminate most voluntary affirmative action plans.
The possibility that the Court might take that further step is what has elevated the Piscataway case to the term's front rank. The Clinton Administration, which has shifted its position in the case over the years, now urges the Justices to rule narrowly that the white teacher's rights were violated but to avoid a ruling on the "extraordinarily broad issue" on the validity of race-conscious employment decisions in general.
A second Title VII case presents a novel issue: whether the law, which the Court has interpreted broadly to protect against sexual harassment on the job and sexually hostile environments in the workplace, also applies when the offensive behavior involves people of the same sex.
In this case, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, No. 96-568, a man accused his employer of tolerating a hostile environment on an offshore oil rig where, the man said, he had been harassed and sexually attacked by other male workers. The Federal appeals court in New Orleans dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Title VII does not apply to same-sex harassment. The Justices agreed to review the case because other courts have disagreed.
A third discrimination case challenges a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act that makes it more difficult for a foreign-born illegitimate child of an American parent to acquire United States citizenship if it is the father rather than the mother who is the American.
If the mother is a United States citizen, citizenship for the child is essentially automatic. But a child seeking to establish citizenship through an American father, as in this case, is barred by the law from doing so unless the father had established evidence of paternity and agreed to provide support before the child turned 18.
The case, Miller v. Albright, No. 96-1060, was brought by a Filipino woman, now in her 20's, whose American father obtained a paternity decree in the Texas courts too late to meet the deadline. The State Department denied her citizenship application in a decision that the Federal appeals court here upheld and that the Clinton Administration continues to defend.
The Administration asserts that Congress has the right to insist that children born in this situation have a close tie to the United States as a prerequisite for automatic citizenship. A child's relationship with a mother is likely to be closer than the relationship with an absent father, the Administration says, adding that Congress "is not constitutionally required to ignore real differences in the situation of citizen mothers and fathers."
Of several important business cases on the docket, one is being described by antitrust specialists as the most important case in that field to reach the Court in 20 years. The question in State Oil Company v. Khan, No. 96-871, is whether manufacturers or wholesalers can place ceilings on the prices that retailers can charge for their products without automatically violating Federal antitrust law.
Under a 1968 precedent that prohibited a newspaper from limiting the prices its independent carriers could charge for home delivery, setting retail price ceilings has been regarded as price-fixing, which is automatically illegal under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Court has made no distinction between the collusive maintenance of high prices among competitors, an illegal practice that is not at issue, and a manufacturer's effort to limit the retail markup its own dealers may take.
The Clinton Administration and several major manufacturers' groups, reflecting recent trends in antitrust analysis, are urging the Court to revisit the question on the ground that limits on retail markups bear little economic resemblance to classic price-fixing, do not suppress competition, and tend to be beneficial to consumers. Retailers' groups and most state attorneys general disagree, however, asserting that the 1968 precedent, Albrecht v. Herald Company, protects small dealers and franchise owners from undue pressure from their suppliers.
Another high-stakes business dispute finds credit unions and banks, which compete in a growing number of consumer financial services, on opposite sides. The question in National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank and Trust, No. 96-843, is the appropriate definition, under a Depression-era law, of modern credit unions, many of which have expanded far beyond the small employee or community-group structure that marked their beginnings.
Under the law, membership in Federal credit unions is limited to "groups having a common bond." In 1982, the National Credit Union Administration reversed a longstanding policy and permitted credit unions to take in unrelated groups of members as long as each group had its own "common bond."
A group of banks sued to challenge the new interpretation, and the Federal appeals court here found it to be invalid in a ruling that threatens the membership base of thousands of credit unions. Whichever side loses at the Supreme Court is likely to seek help from Congress. As an initial matter, the Court must first decide whether the banks were proper parties to challenge the policy.
An important First Amendment case asks the Court to decide whether government-operated public television stations have the same editorial discretion as other stations, or whether they are essentially public forums in which the normal rules of journalism do not apply.
The question in Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, No. 96-779, is whether all legally qualified candidates have a right to participate in a debate sponsored by a public station, as held by a Federal appeals court, or whether the station may make a journalistic judgment to exclude minor party or independent candidates who have little chance of electoral success.

HEADLINE: L. T. Johnson, 91, Plaintiff Who Helped Integrate U. of Kentucky

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Lyman T. Johnson, the plaintiff in a lawsuit that led to the integration of the University of Kentucky in 1949, five years before the Supreme Court paved the way for the desegregation of all public schools in Brown v. Board of Education, died on Friday in Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Ky. He was 91 and lived in Louisville.
Mr. Johnson, a native of Columbia, Tenn., was the grandson of slaves. He held a bachelor's degree from Virginia Union University and a master's degree in history from the University of Michigan, and had been teaching at Central High School in Louisville for 13 years when he applied for the University of Kentucky's 1948 summer session. He said he hoped to do graduate work toward a doctorate in history and political science.
The university's registrar said in March 1948 that its policy, state law and the Kentucky Constitution would not allow Mr. Johnson to be admitted. Mr. Johnson said: "If I am not admitted, I want to know the reason why. I have no apology to make for being a Negro. I stand on my rights as an American citizen."
He sued, and in March 1949, Federal District Judge H. Church Ford ruled in Lexington, Ky., that Mr. Johnson was entitled to attend the university's graduate school. Judge Ford said that the defense had failed to prove that Kentucky State College for Negroes at Frankfurt provided opportunities equal to those at the all-white university in Lexington.
Later in 1949, Mr. Johnson and about 30 other blacks matriculated at the university. But his entry led to the burning of crosses on the campus. He left school the end of the 1949 summer session without obtaining a degree, saying that his motive in suing had been simply to help black students gain entry to the school.
He went on to teach -- mainly history, but also economics and mathematics -- for a total of 33 years at Central High and to become an assistant school principal at three other Louisville schools and to serve on the school board of Jefferson County, which includes Louisville.
Mr. Johnson also was president of the Louisville branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was prominent in successful struggles to achieve parity in salaries for black teachers with white teachers in Louisville, to forge open-housing laws and to integrate public housing throughout Kentucky.
In 1991, he contended that a proposal to end the mandatory busing of elementary school children in Jefferson County would mean a swift return to separate and unequal education for blacks.
His wife, Juanita, died in the 1970's. He is survived by a son, Lyman Morrell Johnson, of New Jersey, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Black-Owned Bookstores Defend Niche

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.

 BODY:
When Coretta Scott King visits here on Oct. 12 for her only Southern California stop in a speaking tour in the West, the event is expected to draw 10,000 people to a minor-league baseball stadium and bring the city center to a standstill. Church choirs are rehearsing for a performance, and a special section is to be set aside for local residents who helped establish a City Hall memorial to Mrs. King's husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Such fine-tuned planning, intended to elicit support from image-conscious city officials and community groups alike, has become the trademark of the Phenix Information Center, a tiny bookstore here that specializes in black authors and is responsible for Mrs. King's appearance. 
It is a survival strategy being put to the test by independent booksellers, including the estimated 300 black bookstores nationwide. These stores have recently benefited from a resurgence of black authors and an abundance of titles.
But some suggest that the zenith has been reached. Now, cautious publishers are pruning their book lists as hardcover sales decline. Independent booksellers fear their business could suffer, with fewer literary celebrities to draw crowds and generate sales momentum. The new publishing economics means a forced course in self-reliance for booksellers, who must depend less on publishers and more on their own ideas for events.
That is the stock in trade of Joann and Feron Roberts, both 41, who modestly began Phenix in 1992 with $5,000 in savings, their Christian faith and a corner in an art gallery. The couple have built Phenix into one of the nation's top 10 black bookstores by regularly drawing high-profile black writers. Manie J. Barron, who sells books by black authors to retailers for Random House, estimated the store's annual sales at $250,000, about average for a specialty bookseller.
The success of Phenix has been no easy feat. Since 1990, the ranks of independent booksellers have declined nationally by a third, a time that parallels the expansion of superstores like Crown Books, Borders and Barnes & Noble and the emergence of discount chains like Price/ Costco and Dayton-Hudson's Target Stores as big booksellers.
Other black bookstores, like Esowan in Los Angeles, Black Images Book Bazaar in Dallas and Hue-Man Experience in Denver, have successfully competed against low-cost chains using their depth of selection, investments in new authors, book clubs and customer loyalty built through involvement in community affairs.
In 1995, when Colin Powell was weighing his Presidential aspirations, Phenix was one of only two black-owned bookstores to lure the retired general to a book-signing during a 20-city tour to promote his memoir, "My American Journey." And unlike the other, Afrocentric Books in Chicago, Phenix helped set up a speaking engagement as well: General Powell wound up addressing an overflow crowd that filled the civic auditorium.
"What Joann and Feron have been able to achieve in such a short time is phenomenal," said Mr. Barron of Random House, the Advance Publications unit that published the Powell book. "The word is out on them among black authors."
Other well-known black authors have also ventured 70 miles east from traditional Los Angeles literary venues, coming here to an old railroad and citrus town. Now a city of 174,000, San Bernardino is struggling with urban problems like downtown blight and the fear of crime. About 17 percent of the city's population is black, more than twice the percentage in the state, while the median income is $33,000, a third lower than the California median.
Phenix is one of a half-dozen black-owned businesses in the city's historic district, many of them drawn by city officials trying to woo pedestrians back to an area emptied by a nearby enclosed mall. "We didn't realize there was such a cultural need," Mrs. Roberts said.
Phenix has turned out big crowds for well-known authors like Maya Angelou and Walter Mosley, and celebrity writers like George Foreman, Johnnie Cochran and Christopher Darden. Pumpkin-colored walls and lofty ceiling fans give the 1,400-square-foot store a library's warmth and airiness. The store also sells used paperbacks by black authors, along with greeting cards, wrapping paper and wedding invitations with ethnic graphics.
Unlike most big Phenix events, Mrs. King's visit is not a result of a publisher's promotional tour but comes from the Robertses and their wish list of hard-to-get black luminaries. "We put together very good proposals," Mrs. Roberts said.
For Sunday's event, this meant adding to the stadium address a $65-a-ticket reception with Mrs. King, who will hand out autographed copies of "My Life With Martin Luther King," a book usually available only at the King Center in Atlanta.
Despite the couple's marketing flair and record of selling hundreds of books at signing events, Phenix still struggles for credibility with some publishers, who may steer authors clear of specialty stores for fear a book will lose mainstream appeal. "What is it you have to do?" asked Mr. Roberts, who was disappointed when Phenix was rejected as a possible itinerary stop for Anita Hill, whose memoir, "Speaking Truth to Power" was just published by Doubleday, a unit of Bertelsmann.
"This battle between the bookstores is very real," said Oren Teicher, a spokesman for the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y. "It's independents versus chains, but it's also a lot of new players. For the first time, the independents and chains represent less than 50 percent of book sales."
W. Paul Coates, publisher of Black Classic Press in Baltimore, said that most major publishers and chain booksellers recognized the importance of the black market. "But they don't know how to market to the black community," he said. That has benefited small black publishers and bookstores, he added.
Mr. Coates warned that publishers' efforts to rein in returns of unsold copies will change the business of specialty booksellers and strand some writers. "Those hard decisions are going to affect all authors, black authors included," he said.
Phenix, which has competition from two national chain outlets in nearby malls, serves as a resource for black history for academics and as a cultural hub. The Roberts give workshops on subjects from Kwanzaa to credit repair, hold poetry readings for unpublished authors, show their wares at community events and distribute fliers in their store for black cultural activities.
"It's more than a bookstore," said Patricia Rodgers Gordon, a career development officer at a local college, who stopped at Phenix recently to pick up a pair of King tickets and unexpectedly ran into old acquaintances. "It's for fellowship."
Even so, Mr. Roberts is readying for a sea change. He thinks Phenix's reputation for personal service and community involvement will sustain the store. "If they stop sending black authors, we'll go back to our roots," he said. "We'll adapt."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Advises Caution On New Rules for Banking

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called today for an overhaul of Federal rules so that banks could keep pace with technological changes.
But he also cautioned that Congress and regulators should move slowly in making changes so as not to upset the banking system and the economy. 
 If the rules are changed drastically now, "we may well end up doing more harm than good," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to the annual convention of the American Bankers Association.
Addressing the gathering of 2,200 bankers and regulators, Mr. Greenspan said he sympathized with bankers who want a freer hand to compete with other financial institutions domestically and with foreign banks that are increasingly snapping up banking business in the United States.
Innovations in telecommunications and computer technology have blurred the lines between banks and other types of financial companies and have made the banking industry far more global. But Mr. Greenspan called on regulators and lawmakers to proceed with "caution and humility," saying their record of accurately predicting changes in the industry is not good.
In recent years, regulators have eased restrictions on banks wishing to underwrite securities and to sell insurance and investment products. But lawmakers have moved more slowly: banking legislation became stalled this past summer in the Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives.
At the bankers' gathering, Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, warned that the underwriting standards of banks, especially for commercial lending, had continued to slip, adding that the fast pace of innovation and competition had seduced banks into making bad loans. The trend, he said, is worst in commercial lending but also apparent in retail banking.
Mr. Ludwig said that while banks had tightened their credit card lending standards and in many cases cleaned up their credit card portfolios, examiners have reported an increase in credit risk in almost every other category of retail loans.
Mr. Ludwig, the top regulator of 2,800 federally chartered banks, announced several steps examiners would take to correct the slippage. They will review credit underwriting standards with senior management of every national bank and meet with the chief executive of any bank where they find lending problems.
At the same gathering, Andrew C. Hove Jr., the acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that rapid technological changes and globalization of the banking industry had forced his agency to question the role of deposit insurance. Mr. Hove called for an F.D.I.C. symposium in January to "explore refinements to the current system."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Is the Latest Target of Nader's Consumer Crusade

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation, which has so far fended off accusations from competitors that it holds monopoly power over the computer software industry, has now drawn a new adversary, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
Mr. Nader and several of his public interest organizations are preparing a national campaign against the growing economic power of the Redmond, Wash., software publisher, contending that Microsoft is a craftier and more potent force than many monopolists of an earlier era. 
 Mr. Nader's very name is evocative, given the number of consumer crusades he has undertaken. But those activities may have diluted his influence in Washington, where he first made his name with a crusade against another consumer giant, General Motors, more than three decades ago.
And perhaps his most widely noted campaign in recent years was not against anything, but rather, for himself. His run for President in 1996, however, did not get far.
Still, Mr. Nader met earlier this month with top officials of the Justice Department's antitrust division, urging them to take action against Microsoft.
"Recently, people in many different kinds of businesses have been expressing fear and criticism about your company's business practices and strategies," Mr. Nader wrote in a letter sent on Thursday to William H. Gates 3d, chairman of Microsoft.
Mr. Nader and Essential Information, one of his organizations, are planning a conference in Washington on Nov. 13 and 14 to discuss Microsoft's strategy and its influence on the software market.
Speakers will include longtime Microsoft opponents like Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, and Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has battled Microsoft on behalf of a number of its competitors.
Mr. Gates has been invited, but a spokesman for him said he doubted that the Microsoft chairman would attend and that the software publisher made a poor target for a public interest campaign.
"The ironic thing about this is that personal computer software is one of the most competitive markets of any industry," said Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. "Consumers are benefiting from this trend toward more powerful computers and less expensive software."
But Mr. Nader said executives with whom he had discussed Microsoft had objected to its business practices, which have frequently leveraged the company's dominance in the operating system market into new software application areas.
He said that he believed that the antitrust issues raised by Microsoft's control of personal computer operating systems were different from those that have traditionally arisen in other industries. "This is a strange type of monopolistic practice," he said. "It doesn't immediately move to monopoly price. But there is a lot at stake here in terms of control of content and innovation."
The Justice Department is continuing to investigate a variety of Microsoft activities, including its acquisition of Vxtreme Inc., a Silicon Valley developer of technology for sending audio and video over the Internet. In July, however, the Federal Trade Commission rebuffed a request from a group of senators and declined to open a new inquiry into the company's business practices.

HEADLINE: Nationwide Phone Directory Assistance, on the World Wide Web

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
For some users of the World Wide Web, calling telephone directory assistance at 411 or 555-1212 may become a thing of the past if a partnership of two companies catches on.
Who Where Inc., a provider of on-line E-mail address directories and other information services, and Directory Net, which sells computerized telephone directories to big corporations, plan to jointly announce today a fee-based Web service intended to give small businesses and individuals computer access to the same telephone directory data bases that the nation's regional Bell companies use to process local 411 calls. 
 Having access to all this local data will offer the equivalent of a continuously updated on-line national telephone directory, Directory Net executives said.
The service, called Who Where Connect Now, which will be available beginning today, is priced to be competitive with local 411 calls, and lower than long-distance directory inquiries, company officials said. The monthly fee is $9.90 for the first 22 requests and 45 cents for each additional request during that month. The site's address is http:// wwcn.whowhere.com.
There are already many sites on the World Wide Web, typically supported by advertising, that offer a "white pages" search service for phone numbers. But the data typically come from printed versions of local telephone directories and can quickly become outdated.
"People are disenchanted with calling 411; you routinely get wrong phone numbers," said Bill Doyle, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
The new service will allow users to find a phone number by typing in a person's or business's name and the city -- or even just the state. It will also allow a search based on simply typing in a telephone number to disclose the name and address linked to that number.
Directory Net currently offers a similar service for large businesses and organizations that may need to find hundreds of phone numbers an hour, but it requires the use of Directory Net's own proprietary software and can cost thousands of dollars a month.
Big clients of this service include the Internal Revenue Service and the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, as well as various credit-checking companies. That service competes with a similar offering, called Find America, from AT&T.
"This is a great way for Telstra to try to figure this market out," Mr. Doyle said, referring to Directory Net's parent company. "However, the economics of the deal aren't that great. It's really hard to get people to pay for information on the Web."
Who Where is based in Mountain View, Calif. Directory Net has its headquarters in Alpharetta, Ga.
The two companies would not disclose the financial details of the deal, other than to say they planned to share any revenue generated.

HEADLINE: Over the Din of New Media, a Voice for the Audio Arts

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
"Sound matters!" Elizabeth Cohen preached to the audience of 600 audio experts. "No longer will we be the bastard child to pictures!"
The assembled group was the Audio Engineering Society, meeting last spring in Seattle, and the speech was part of Ms. Cohen's one-year campaign as the organization's president to bring more attention to the audio arts. 
 In a world where images are king, Ms. Cohen wants to bring more attention -- and respect -- to the universe of sound technology.
After all, she pointed out, sound effects and music make up a huge part of the emotional experience of, say, going to the movies. And the Internet, the new generation of compact disks known as DVD, and the coming era of digital television all represent new frontiers for audio, and new territory in which the audio-engineering profession will need to stake its claim.
"We have at least 50 percent of the multimedia experience and less than 12 percent of the bandwidth," Ms. Cohen said in a recent interview. "Bandwidth," of course, refers to an information system's carrying capacity, and in the audio profession's view, sound typically gets too small a share.
As the elected head of the nation's largest organization of audio professionals, an eclectic 12,000-member society of audio technicians, inventors, consumer electronics marketers, theater operators and even Hollywood movie producers, Ms. Cohen, who is 43, may be in a better position than just about anyone else to point out the crucial role sound plays in everything from movie studios to movie theaters to home movie cameras.
With a Ph.D. in audio engineering, she represents a new generation of audio professionals who take for granted the digital language of computers, and who point to the Internet as the next big challenge for the audio profession.
In her term as president, Ms. Cohen has also represented another significant transition for the Audio Engineering Society, which recently held its biannual convention: she is its first female leader. And in that capacity, her peers say, Ms. Cohen brings a unique perspective to a field in which women are drastically outnumbered.
"Elizabeth has less traditional ways of approaching audio," said Marina Bosi, vice president of technology, strategy and standards at the film-sound company Digital Theater Systems, who will be the society's second woman president when she takes office later this year.
Perhaps Ms. Cohen's greatest contribution, Ms. Bosi said, will be her energetic promotion of new media, such as the Internet and DVD, to a profession that has often appeared resistant to change.
That Ms. Cohen has risen to prominence in the boys club that is the audio profession is no surprise to Ms. Bosi and others who know her. While an undergraduate at Bennington College in the early 1970's, she worked at Bell Labs, then the incubator of the nation's first communications satellite, as well as many of the other most significant audio accomplishments of the era.
"It was the best toy store in the whole planet," Ms. Cohen recalled.
But unlike most acoustics engineers, whose love for the subtleties of sound started with a penchant for tinkering with electronic equipment, Ms. Cohen attributes her early interest in sound to a more broad-ranging curiosity, as well as a love for music and the cultural milieu in which she came of age.
For Ms. Cohen, it all started in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where as the daughter of Maxine Duberstein, a New York State Supreme Court justice, and as a student at the Brooklyn Quaker Friends School she was introduced to a musician named Mickey Hart, the grandson of a family friend, who would eventually become the drummer for the Grateful Dead. Little did Ms. Cohen know then that the introduction would set the stage for her career.
"It was not a conscious connection, but it gave me access to a constant stream of creative people," Ms. Cohen said.
After Bennington, while living in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Cohen found herself part of the inner circle of the Grateful Dead, and she collaborated with Mr. Hart on two books. She now says her association with the band helped prepare her for the audio world in which she would eventually work -- perhaps even more so than her doctorate in acoustics engineering from Stanford, where she still holds the title of consulting professor of electrical engineering.
She never did much work as a recording engineer, but she has spent a lot of time in recording studios, testing the acoustical impact of new technology. In addition to teaching and presiding over the Audio Engineering Society, Ms. Cohen owns a consulting firm, Cohen Acoustical Inc., in Los Angeles, which specializes in room acoustics.
Five years ago, she oversaw the acoustical redesign of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Performance Hall in Los Angeles, and her services are in such demand that the two archrivals in digital movie sound technology -- Dolby Laboratories and Digital Theater Systems -- each hired her to design their screening rooms.
But it has been as president of the Audio Engineering Society, with its 75 chapters internationally, where Ms. Cohen said she had had the greatest impact.
The current focus in audio standards, as in the PC industry, is to insure they are "open" -- that is, not favoring one particular vendor's approach but allowing for many compatible approaches.
"Standards should be things that nurture new ideas, not inhibit them," Ms. Cohen said.
The group was influential in the development of standards for digital video disks, or DVD, which are expected to have a huge impact on the growth of the video, audio and multimedia industries. And the society's standards committee is working on a technology called Fire Wire, to make it easier to connect the components of a home theater system, among other applications.
These days, of the many huge challenges facing the audio business, there is none as profound as the Internet, Ms. Cohen said. The technical issues involve network bandwidth and other factors that affect the quality of sound as it moves in computer code through the sometimes narrow maze of the Net.
The organization is helping with the Internet 2, a project by higher education, government and industry to develop a more advanced -- and higher-performance -- successor to the overburdened Internet. The Internet 2 is expected to operate at transmission speeds 10 to 100 times that of today's Internet, opening opportunities for audio, she said.
With such high speeds, music students around the world could play together as if they were in the same room. A live concert could be enjoyed by millions, regardless of where the musicians were, without loss of quality.
And this time around, Ms. Cohen vows, sound is going to get its fair share of the network.
"We have met the challenge of performance in the limited bandwidth, but we're not going to take it anymore," she said. "We're trying to be one step ahead of the game this time."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Down With Chips!

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I'm starting a new political movement. It's called "Americans Against Voice Mail."
Why? Because the main reason so many people have lost jobs, been forced to change jobs, or been able to upgrade their jobs in the last tumultuous decade is not a lowering of U.S. trade barriers. It's technology. A Mexican working at 75 cents an hour didn't take the job of our office receptionist; a microchip did -- the one that operates the voice mail device in all our office phones. A Chinese making 75 cents an hour didn't take that auto worker's job; a robot did. A Brazilian making 75 cents an hour didn't take your neighbor's grocery job; a supermarket scanner did. 
 So I want you to get up now, unplug your phone, go to your window, throw your phone out and shout: "I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE! SAVE AMERICAN JOBS! BAN VOICE MAIL! POTATO CHIPS, YES. MICROCHIPS, NO!"
Sounds crazy, I know. But it's not half as crazy as the Mad Hatter's tea party going on in Congress today, where lawmakers are telling you to throw the Mexicans, Chinese and Brazilians out the window instead. They are doing that even though every serious economic study indicates that the bulk of job loss (and creation) today is produced by technological change and deregulation and only 20 percent can be attributed to freer trade. But railing against microchips won't get you elected; railing against Mexicans will.
And that's why despite the passage of Nafta and the GATT global trade accord, and despite the fact that the U.S. economy is the envy of the world, Congress is on the verge of denying the President the "fast track" authority he needs to sign free trade agreements with the rest of South America -- on the argument that free trade is responsible for killing jobs.
This is really sad. And it's all Bill Clinton's fault. He began his Presidency by declaring that health care reform was the critical issue for America today. Wrong. The critical issue for America is that we have entered this period of incredibly rapid change, in which the technology revolution and the integration of global markets are combining to transform everyone's workplace, market and community -- eliminating old jobs and churning new ones. And for the U.S. to thrive in this world it needs a new, integrated approach to health care, welfare, education, job training and free trade.
Mr. Clinton talked about each of these individually, but never put them into a single, comprehensible framework. As a result, says the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, "the connections and complementarities in all these areas got lost in the public debate and it allowed ideologues and extremists to gain the upper hand in each of these areas."
Mr. Clinton thought it was enough to just be right about the economics of free trade. It's not. Even if trade really does account for only a small part of job-churning in our economy, politically and psychologically it looms much larger. If Mr. Clinton had been smart, he would have defused this anti-trade angst by accompanying his "fast track" bill with a "Rapid Change Adjustment Act." It could have included pilot projects for public employment for displaced workers, tax breaks for severance pay for displaced workers, and an extension of the Kassebaum-Kennedy act, so that laid-off workers could keep their health insurance longer. And $2 billion in U.S. assistance to the Asian, African and Latin American development banks to promote training of women, anti-child-labor programs and environmental cleanup in countries we trade with.
If Mr. Clinton's fast-track request had been combined with such a package, and put into a framework that defined for people the revolution we are going through right now, his opponents would be having a much harder time. Mr. Clinton could have satisfied those who really care about the labor and environmental strains that accompany rapid change, while marginalizing the Neanderthals in Congress who just want to build walls of protection or pander to trade unions.
The frustrating thing about Mr. Clinton is that he really gets it. He understands the information economy and trade, and the need to cushion them with training, safety nets and community-preserving programs. He's got all the pieces, but he never puts them all together in a sustained way. So there's a hole in the heart of Clintonism, and Dick Gephardt is driving a truck right through it.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Mr. Clinton and Global Warming

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR. 

 BODY:
The debate over global warming has taken on all the characteristics of a political brawl, complete with spin doctors and aggressive advertising. A badly confused public is told one day that only a quick and dramatic reduction in energy use can avert meteorological disaster, then warned the next that any such prescription would send energy prices through the roof and the economy through the floor.
If he is smart about it, President Clinton can turn this increasingly polarized argument to his advantage. Most Americans are at least vaguely aware that rising atmospheric temperatures pose real if remote threats. They are also eager to know whether there are ways to address that threat that are both effective and affordable. It is here that Mr. Clinton can make a difference, positioning himself as a moderate in a debate that has so far shed more heat than light. 
 Between now and December, when the industrialized nations will meet in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate a treaty controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Mr. Clinton must devise a specific American proposal. He has already committed himself to "realistic and binding" limits on carbon emissions, but has not said what these targets should be and how to reach them. He is unlikely to be any more specific today in his remarks to a White House conference on global warming, a gathering aimed mainly at sharpening public awareness of the issue. But he has already sketched out four principles that will guide his Kyoto proposals.
First, he believes, along with most mainstream scientists, that man-made gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil are contributing to warming and that unless these gases are reduced, bad things -- coastal flooding and widespread droughts -- are likely to occur late in the 21st century. Second, he believes that no global emissions-control system can succeed without the leadership of the United States, which produces one-fifth of the world's greenhouse gases with only 5 percent of the world's population.
Third, he is convinced that developing countries like India and China, which are projected to throw off huge greenhouse emissions, must be part of any global warming agreement -- if not right away, then soon. This is a contentious subject. The Europeans argue that these countries need more time to grow and cannot now be forced into an international regime. The Senate, however, has said that it will not ratify a treaty that does not bind developing countries to enforceable targets.
Fourth, Mr. Clinton wants a system that will not impose intolerable strain on the American economy. He has already rejected as disingenuous (and much too expensive) a European proposal to reduce emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. He clearly prefers a more gradual approach, and seems also to have ruled out new gasoline or carbon taxes (neither of which would fly in Congress anyway) and strong new regulations. His preferred approach is to set firm national limits on emissions and then let individual industries meet those targets using the cheapest means possible, either by switching to cleaner fuels or by making far more efficient use of energy.
There is one other element to Mr. Clinton's strategy that he has not talked about, but which may well be his ace in the hole in Kyoto as he tries to draw developing countries into the mix while providing flexibility for American industries. Devised by the Environmental Defense Fund, this is an emissions-trading scheme in which rich nations that cannot meet their assigned targets without crippling taxes or investments would be able to "buy" pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies are so inefficient that even the tiniest adjustments can achieve big reductions in greenhouse emissions. That money, in turn, would help developing countries invest in cleaner technologies.
This may not satisfy the Europeans, who find Mr. Clinton's faith in technology and efficiency touching but unrealistic, or those economists who believe that anything short of a stiff tax on carbon-based fuels will not get the job done. But Mr. Clinton has two constituencies, one in Kyoto and the other in the Senate. If he means to win over both, a modest course may be his only course. ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.

HEADLINE: Rejuvenated Yale Marks Bountiful Fund Drive

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
When Yale embarked on its $1.5 billion capital drive in May 1992, the largest ever announced by a university at the time, the mood on campus could not have been more strife-ridden. Yale was running a $12 million deficit and expected the red ink to increase. Buildings were in growing disrepair. A strike had closed classes and dining halls. Faculty members protested a plan to shrink their numbers by more than 10 percent. And there was a general loss of confidence in the president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who announced his resignation less than a month later.
But Yale plunged ahead. And with the fund drive's completion, announced Oct. 1, the university is celebrating its own turnaround. 
 "It's kind of like going through a riptide, with currents moving in two or three directions at once," said Gaddis Smith, a Yale history professor who is writing a history of the university for its 300th anniversary in 2001. "And then suddenly you're through it and in smooth water. That's what happened to us."
The campaign, which raised $200 million more than the goal, was helped by the robust economy and a runaway stock market that prompted alumni to open their wallets. But there were moments during the campaign -- including Mr. Schmidt's departure, the resignation of the campaign chairman and the highly publicized return of a $20 million contribution to the Texas billionaire Lee M. Bass -- when it seemed more like the perils of Pauline.
"If I were totally honest, I would have said I didn't think we would succeed, and if we did, we would only get to the finish line limping and exhausted," said John J. Lee, a Yale trustee and chairman of the fund drive.
Instead, Yale is on a rebound. Competition for admission is up. The budget is balanced for the first time in six years. The endowment is $5.8 billion, third highest among American universities after Harvard and the University of Texas. New buildings are going up, and old ones are being repaired. Long-troubled relations with New Haven are improving.
There is still restiveness among faculty members, who have absorbed years of cuts; given the prosperity, they assert that Yale can now afford to lift its hiring freeze, which they say allows only very slow change in academic emphasis. "It is a system that moves at about the speed of a glacier," said Donald M. Crothers, chairman of the chemistry department.
Still, others are quick to say that Yale should not go overboard. "We should not spend like drunken sailors," said Sabatino Sofia, a professor of astronomy.
Yale's fund-raising campaign looked none too steady when it was announced in May 1992. The university's provost and the dean of the college had just resigned, and Mr. Schmidt followed shortly. The chairman of the campaign, Vernon R. Loucks Jr., a longtime trustee and chief executive of Baxter International Inc., resigned the next year, after his medical supplies company agreed to pay a fine for violating Federal law by cooperating with an Arab boycott of Israel.
Enter Mr. Lee, a business turnaround expert and former Ivy League basketball star. In the beginning, he said, persuading people to give "was a very hard sell, because the level of credibility was very low." Still, the low point was yet to come: the announcement in 1995 that Yale would return $20 million to Mr. Bass because it could not agree on how his donation to pay for professors of Western civilization would be spent.
"The potential damage of the Bass matter was not the absolute dollars, although $20 million is obviously a lot of money," Mr. Lee said. "It was the potential for creating an incorrect image of Yale as a place that was stressed from within, with conflicting political agendas -- the potential to pollute the political environment for raising the rest of the money."
Yale scheduled meetings around the country, Mr. Lee said, to assure alumni that the episode was "not a manifestation of a political correctness," but a lack of administrative continuity as the university went through three presidents and provosts in just a couple of years.
A major theme of the sessions was that the administration would stabilize under its new president, Richard C. Levin. After a year under an interim president, Howard R. Lamar, Yale reached for Mr. Levin, a soft-spoken economist and consultant, who was briefly dean of Yale's graduate School of Arts and Sciences and was known for his ability to bring factions together. Mr. Levin came to Yale for his Ph.D. in 1970 and stayed on as a professor, specializing in deregulation and antitrust.
Mr. Levin has not significantly altered the strategy set by Mr. Schmidt -- to spend money on buildings, to contain faculty growth and other costs and to try to improve conditions in New Haven. But he is credited with pursuing it in a more conciliatory manner than Mr. Schmidt, who was criticized for being an aloof, absentee president who did not understand the institution.
Mr. Levin, on the other hand, has managed to pursue much of Mr. Schmidt's agenda, but without the turmoil. To raise Yale's contributions to New Haven, for example, he created a grant program for faculty and staff who buy homes in the city, encouraged course work in the city and touted it to prospective applicants as an ideal location for students interested in urban affairs.
"We see a real sense of engagement, not just at the top of the university, but pervading the whole university," said New Haven's Mayor, John DeStefano Jr.
There have also been visible improvements on Yale's campus. On Science Hill, there is the new Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Center for Molecular and Structural Biology, with its modern laboratories and open corridors to encourage collaboration. Down the hill is the handsome new Henry R. Luce Hall, housing the Center for International Studies, with large open spaces, huge arched windows and expanses of light wood. At the center of the campus is the renovated reading room in Sterling Memorial Library, where leaks have been stopped and computer ports added, giving a modern twist to an old Gothic building. "We took something enormously important to the entire community and fixed it," Mr. Levin said. "It's almost a metaphor for our whole program."
Yale is now planning the rehabilitation of the remaining science laboratories, the renovation of the undergraduate houses, and construction of a new dormitory to accommodate students as it renovates the houses, one by one. Yale's capital spending has quadrupled from four years ago and now tops $250 million a year. Its $1.1 billion operating budget was balanced in part by cutting faculty slots about 5 percent and by increasing spending from the growing endowment.
Even with a balanced budget, Yale administrators understand they have much left to do. They have bought a modicum of labor peace with six-year union contracts, but charges that the university is unfairly preventing graduate students from organizing have yet to be resolved. Faculty members are impatient for growth, fearful that without it departments will fall behind. And New Haven, though on the upswing, remains a city with many poor neighborhoods whose manufacturing base has largely disappeared.
Yale's provost, Alison Richard, reflected these pressures and the mood among Yale's administrators when asked about the capital campaign. "With the end of a campaign, you pause and you celebrate -- but not for long," she said. "We have great ambitions and great needs. We need to go on from here, and we will."

HEADLINE: Seeing Politics, and Mirrors, In the Coverage of Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Sandy Hume, the star reporter of The Hill, a weekly paper, is among a new breed of correspondents burrowing so deep inside Congress that legislation itself has become largely beside the point. And a proliferation of the news he calls "the juicy inside stuff" is making this corner of the world more insular than ever.
A growing number of news outlets offering almost instantaneous updates to and about Congress have quickened an already frenetic pace. Two highly competitive newspapers -- The Hill and Roll Call -- several faxed newsletters and new on-line publications cover politics and personalities. 
 But much of the resulting mountain of reportage both originates and is consumed on the Hill, and some of it reads like in-house messages from one lawmaker to another. Often it is so site-specific and ephemeral that it becomes outdated within hours and never leaves the environs of the Capitol.
"I can spend all day on the Hill and not know what a single vote is about," said Mr. Hume, the 28-year-old son of the television journalist Brit Hume. "Almost everything they vote on is irrelevant to our mission. What we do is even more inside baseball than what the vote's about."
Several heavy consumers of Capitol news say this increased focus on not just inside-the-Beltway but inside-the-building news makes lawmakers more isolated.
"It creates this looking-glass world of mirrors reflecting more and more off one another and less and less of the outside world," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
With shortened news cycles requiring ever faster reactions, some legislators and staff members say the House in particular, which has never been considered a contemplative institution, has become even less so.
"These newsletters and daily operations have sped up the game and intensified the political nature of the place by making people respond almost instantly," said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin. And the growing emphasis on insider gossip, he said, focuses too much attention on "government as entertainment."
On the other hand, some readers point out that the extensive coverage also makes it harder to hide pork or plain misbehavior.
The expansion has already gone well beyond what was thought the market would bear, with advertisers -- sometimes the same lobbyists who serve as news sources -- willing to pay relatively high rates to appeal to readers who make laws. The Federal Government is shrinking, the cold war is over, and Americans apparently find news from Washington less compelling than ever. But on Capitol Hill, self-described news junkies still cannot get enough.
Tony Rudy, press secretary for Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, describes a typical week: "Of course on Wednesday you get in early to see what The Hill wrote, and on Monday and Thursday it's Roll Call. At noon you get on the Internet for Hotline -- Hotline is like the Bible. Then Congress Daily at 3 o'clock, which gives you what happened at all the press conferences up to 2 o'clock."
Roll Call, a twice-a-week newspaper that has about 40 staff members, has been around since 1954. The Hill, with a staff of 28, came on the scene three years ago. The newsletters, all founded in the last decade, include CQ News Monitor, a 24-page sheet that focuses on floor action; Hotline, a newsletter available on line that does no original reporting but summarizes the top political stories of the day, and Congress Daily, a 12-page newsletter offering news twice a day on the people and politics behind lawmaking. Among the more recent entries in the field are on-line products like National Journal's Cloakroom, CQ News Alert and Allpolitics, sponsored by CNN and Time.
All of these and more are considered must-reads in a phenomenon that David Rapp, executive editor of Congressional Quarterly, calls "information paranoia."
 Howard Wolfson, chief of staff for Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said: "You're afraid to miss something because information is the most important commodity. The more you have, the better off you are, so it just becomes a time-management issue that you have to do other things other than read newspapers. You budget the best you can."
A favorite sport of Congressional staff members during the time that is not spent reading inside reports, several of them said, is guessing who gave which unattributed quotations, then dissecting and rating them.
Recent fare included a story in The Hill that the chief of staff of a Republican opponent of same-sex marriage, Representative Charles T. Canady of Florida, had announced that she was a lesbian and had quit to work for a gay-rights group. An article in Roll Call noted that two House Republicans visited Cuba during the August recess but had not been criticized by their colleagues.
Some stories, like Mr. Hume's July report breaking the news of the unsuccessful Republican rebellion against Speaker Newt Gingrich, do get picked up by larger papers and television, and these local publications are widely used by Congressional staff members to get the attention of the wider media. (Mr. Hume's editor in chief, Martin Tolchin, brags that that story "did for us what Watergate did for The Washington Post.")
Sometimes, bigger papers only come around after someone else has published and thus legitimized a story -- and made yesterday's unconfirmed speculation today's conventional wisdom. But there are some complaints that this kind of pickup lowers the standard for publication of scandalous gossip.
In-House messages are commonly traded through these publications. Mr. Wolfson said his boss, Ms. Lowey, and other Democrats who support abortion rights recently used Congress Daily to send a message to Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican. They wanted him to know that they would try to vote down the spending bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services unless he changed language that they feared would have prohibited health maintenance organizations from receiving Federal money if they offered abortions. (The two sides have reached an understanding that kept but did not expand a ban on abortions paid for with Federal money, Mr. Wolfson said.)
Advertisers are sending messages, too. In a recent edition of Roll Call, ads urged Congressional support for American Indians, for a $32- billion-a-year highway improvement program and for giving President Clinton "fast track" negotiating authority for trade agreements. Advertisers in the Congress-centric press include big trade associations like the Made-in-the-U.S.A. Coalition and policy lobbyists like Citizens for State Power and the America Smokers' Alliance, as well as companies like Northwest Airlines and AT&T. The Hill charges $7,200 for a full-page color ad, Mr. Tolchin said.
Some local ads also focus on staff members who are apparently working late to keep up with their reading. "Tired of late-night greasy take-out?" one ad for a restaurant in The Hill began.
With low costs and relatively high ad revenue, Roll Call's reputation as a cash cow for its owner, the Economist Group, has drawn many of the newer competitors into the fray. "I don't think we've even scratched the market yet," said Jerry Finkelstein, chairman of The Hill, who said the paper would more than break even this year. In September, both The Hill and Roll Call reported record ad revenues.
The Hill, owned by Mr. Finkelstein's company, News Communications Inc., says it has "the largest circulation of any Capitol Hill publication." Mr. Tolchin put the circulation of The Hill -- which is mostly distributed free -- at 21,000. Roll Call has a circulation of about 17,500: 5,000 paid and 12,500 free. The annual subscription rate for Roll Call's paying readers is $225.
Profit margins at Roll Call are often as high as 40 percent, say people who know about the publication's finances. And even owners of less profitable publications said they thought there was room for virtually all comers. And there are rewards other than money for peddling your papers to some of the most powerful people in the world, they suggested.
"You have a lot of growth, not a lot of people making a lot of money," said John Fox Sullivan, publisher of the scholarly National Journal, which generally operates closer to the bone and was recently sold by Times Mirror to David Bradley and a group of investors including members of senior management. 'But people are building up very valuable assets because we're major players in the capital of the entire world."
And many of the newer entries in this corner of the market are spinoffs of established publications. The National Journal, for example, owns Congress Daily and Hotline, which sells for a pricey $4,200 a year. Its World Wide Web service, Cloakroom, began operation in July, and another newsletter, Daily Energy Report, is due this month. National Journal inaugurated a new look with a redesigned magazine last month.
Congressional Quarterly, which has been getting some competition from Congress itself since the institution began posting roll call votes on the Internet, is likewise designing several new services in addition to CQ Monitor and the on-line CQ News Alert, which is scheduled to expand in December.
At the other end of the spectrum, a glossy new competitor for Washingtonian magazine, Capital Style, hit the streets last month. Its editor, Bill Thomas, said the monthly, also owned by The Economist, would cover Washington "as a show-business town." He described Congress as "535 lounge acts all struggling to be Johnny Headliner."
Is there any limit to the hunger for inside Washington news -- if only inside Washington? "There's constant expansion," said John Morton, a media analyst who also publishes a newsletter on the newspaper industry. "There probably is a limit, but it hasn't been reached yet. There does seem to be an unending appetite for this stuff."

HEADLINE: Doubts on Cost Are Bedeviling Climate Policy

SERIES: THE WARMING WORLD: Confronting Climate Change

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
With President Clinton having accepted the dominant view among scientists that global warming is a serious matter, the increasingly urgent debate over what to do about it has largely shifted to the question of how restricting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide may affect the nation's economy. And there, perplexity reigns.
The future severity of climate change is uncertain enough, and its future physical impact on particular countries and regions is more so. The uncertainty multiplies yet again when people try to calculate the costs and benefits of taking action to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
 "There's a lot more uncertainty about the economics than about the climate," said Dale W. Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard University who specializes in environmental questions.
Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, which are the energy foundation of the modern economy. Some players in the debate, notably industries that produce fossil fuels or use lots of them, argue that serious economic damage would result if use of the fuels were significantly cut. Others, like environmentalists and advocates of alternatives to fossil-fuel energy, say the economy as a whole would gain because it would use energy more efficiently.
In between is a range of estimates, typically based on uncertain assumptions about how various aspects of the economy would respond to cuts in the use of fossil fuel and how strategies for cutting emissions would actually work.
All of this will be under the spotlight in Washington today at a daylong conference on climate change sponsored by the White House. Mr. Clinton, who plans to take part in the meeting, supports legally binding international action to cut emissions, but not at the price of harming the United States economy.
He is under intensifying pressure to come up with a specific proposal for reducing emissions. The United States proposal is generally seen as critical to efforts by the nations of the world to negotiate cuts at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December. It is widely expected that Mr. Clinton's proposal will be announced later this month, either just before or at a pre-Kyoto negotiating session that begins on Oct. 20 in Bonn.
But as the moment of truth approaches, even some leading members of the Clinton Administration have all but thrown up their hands over the difficulty of obtaining clear answers to some crucial economic questions. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told Congress in July that it was futile to try to develop a set of economic models that can "give us a definitive answer as to the economic impacts of a given climate change policy." Computerized models are the main analytical tool economists use.
"If anybody tells you that he or she has the definitive answer as to the costs and benefits of particular climate change policies," Dr. Yellen said, "I would suggest that you raise your collective eyebrows."
Can anything useful be said that might aid the search for a solution creating the least economic strain?
There is general agreement that reductions of emissions would come at some cost to the economy and that the size of the cost depends largely on the size of the cuts and how rapidly they are carried out.
Energy costs would very likely rise, at least for a time, and some industry sectors, it is generally agreed, could be hit hard if they were not able to adapt quickly enough. Chief among these is perhaps the coal industry; coal burning emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy, and the nation's utilities depend heavily on it.
But many economists also say there are a number of ways to cut the costs substantially, through policy measures. One is by imposing a tax on fuels in proportion to their carbon content. The revenues from the tax would be used to reduce other Federal taxes, thus pumping money back into the economy. Many economists see a carbon tax as the most economically efficient way to reduce emissions. But any sort of energy tax is likely to face deadly opposition in the Republican Congress.
So attention is focusing on another possible cost-reducing mechanism: emissions trading. In this arrangement, the Government sets an overall cap on emissions and issues permits to companies to emit carbon dioxide within that limit. Companies that find it more difficult and expensive to limit emissions could buy permits from those that find it easier and cheaper. The price of the permits is set in an open market.
Proponents of this plan, now in use for industrial sulfur dioxide emissions, say it cuts overall costs significantly. But many economists argue that unless the permits are initially auctioned by the Government and the proceeds used to reduce other taxes, much of the cost-cutting benefit to the economy would be lost.
The United States also favors extending the cap-and-permit idea to the international arena. Richer countries, which emit lots of carbon and would find cuts relatively expensive, could pay poorer ones, partly in technological assistance, to reduce some of theirs. Proponents of this idea say that since it would be cheaper to make cuts in developing countries, the cost both to the United States and the global economy would be lower.
A third way to reduce costs, some economists say, is to allow some flexibility in the timing of reductions. They argue, for instance, that forcing industries to replace their physical plants with more energy-efficient ones before their natural economic life is over would be very expensive.
A fourth cost-cutting idea, cited by environmentalists and advocates of alternative energy sources like solar and wind energy, is for government to aggressively promote the adoption of more fuel-efficient technologies. These are myriad, and range from small things like devices making it unnecessary for television sets to use power when they are off, to large things like automobiles that deliver 60 or 70 miles a gallon to ways of burning coal more efficiently.
A recent study by five of the Government's national laboratories concluded that vigorous promotion of such technologies could reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010 while saving enough energy to at least offset the cost of putting the technologies in place. It was the latest in a long line of studies that have come to similar conclusions; some have found, in fact, that the energy savings from new technologies would increase gross domestic product, which is the total of all goods and services produced, by 1 or 2 percent a year over the long run.
Other economists, principally those who model the economy's overall operations, dispute this optimistic assessment, while acknowledging that some gains are possible through new technology.
"Virtually all analysts believe that there's some low-hanging fruit out there," said Richard Richels, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, a research organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry. The disagreement, Mr. Richels said, is over how much technological fruit can be easily picked.
A recent study by Robert Repetto and Duncan Austin of the World Resources Institute, an independent research group in Washington, found that such "bottom up" assessments as the five-laboratory study, which try to add up the expected impact on the economy from a wealth of new technologies, probably overstate the potential energy savings.
But the World Resources Institute also found that some conventional "top down" models, which analyze the economy's overall performance, tend to overstate the costs. Typically, the top-down models say reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 would trim gross domestic product by 1 or 2 percent, with some predicting much greater losses.
Mr. Repetto and Mr. Austin examined 162 estimates from 16 models and found that 80 percent of their differences could be explained by what they assumed about economic uncertainties.
For example, the prediction turns out more optimistically if one assumes that the economy responds relatively easily to changes in policy, that noncarbon fuels are readily available and easily adopted and that damages from air pollution and climate change are averted as a result. Opposite assumptions produce more pessimism.
Predictions that a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade policy would seriously harm the economy are unrealistic, the two researchers wrote, because "they stem from worst-case modeling assumptions."
Assessing the damages of climate change, and therefore the benefits of averting it, is perhaps the chanciest task of all, and relatively few economists have tried it. One who has, William D. Nordhaus of Yale University, says his best guess is that benefits to the overall market economy of the United States may just about balance costs over the next century. But that guess, Mr. Nordhaus said, comes "with big uncertainties."
The most important uncertainties, said Mr. Jorgenson of Harvard, have to do with how much economic growth will take place in future decades even in the absence of any climate problem. Unlike some industry leaders, who argue that the uncertainties warrant doing nothing about emissions, Mr. Jorgenson says they are an argument for taking preventive action in the interest of future generations. But he also says he believes that the cost of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 would be too high and advocates a more modest policy.
But if the policy is too modest, say many involved in the pre-Kyoto international talks, it risks losing credibility with developing countries, which have refused to undertake binding reductions until the richer nations show that they are serious.
What's more, the Administration and the Senate, whose ratification would be required on any Kyoto agreement, have refused any deal that does not in some way include the poorer countries. Then there are the Europeans, who have proposed cutting emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels and are increasingly at odds with the United States over the issue.
However things turn out, flesh-and-blood political realities are likely to overshadow uncertain science and economics in the diplomatic endgame at Kyoto.

HEADLINE: Putting Politics Aside

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
By choosing to convene a religious revival meeting of Christian men on Saturday in the nation's political capital, the leaders of the evangelical men's movement called Promise Keepers were forced to spend much of the day forswearing any political motivation.
The men who attended the event say they committed their lives to Jesus, not to the Republican Party, and they say they should be taken at their word. 
 However, this massive mobilization could have political and social repercussions in an era in which conservative evangelical Christians are feeling increasingly vulnerable as the nation becomes more and more religiously and culturally diverse. What will it mean when hundreds of thousands of men go back to their homes, energized by speakers who pumped them up on Saturday to "take back our country for Christ"?
Skeptics immediately envision a Christian army marching in lock step. But more likely the impact will be so local as to be felt household-to-household or man-to-man.
These men tend to steer away from talk of political issues; instead, they talk about "relationships," and that is where the Promise Keepers will try to make their mark.
Most of the attention to Promise Keepers focused on what the group has to say about relationships between the sexes, but at Saturday's event the leadership clearly signaled that what now tops their agenda is relations between the races.
At the rally, Bill McCartney, the former University of Colorado football coach who founded Promise Keepers seven years ago, announced what amounted to a deadline for Christian churches to end their own racism. Mr. McCartney, who still goes by the nickname "Coach," told the crowd that his goal was to gather a multiracial rally of Christian men outside every state capitol at noon on Jan. 1, 2000, to pronounce that the church has eradicated racism within its own ranks.
"That's brave rhetoric," said the Rev. Robert M. Franklin, president of the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, the largest predominantly African-American seminary in the country. Mr. Franklin traveled to Washington on Saturday to observe the Promise Keepers rally, and said he was impressed at the way black and white men intermingled there. In a survey of rally participants, The Washington Post found that 1 of 7 of the men who attended was black.
"But there's so many problems facing the black church," Mr. Franklin said, "particularly problems related to poverty alleviation and crime that I think the effort at racial reconciliation will only garner support from the black church if it is linked to problem solving in urban poor black communities. If they get that, I think this could be quite a hopeful development." But, he added, "I haven't seen evidence of it yet."
Mr. McCartney also directed the men to form closer relationships with their local churches and their ministers. "Pastors," Mr. McCartney said on Saturday, "you have been working with half a squad. You have been working with mostly women. But that's going to change. These guys are coming back."
Churches do tend to be "predominantly female enclaves," said William Dinges, associate professor of religion at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, also attended the rally as an observer. Whereas Promise Keepers' goal of ending racism in the church is "political naivete, which is probably their Achilles' heel," Mr. Dinges said, the goal of infusing male energy in the church is realistic.
"They are preaching to the converted," Mr. Dinges said. Polls show that a majority of the Promise Keepers are already active members of churches. Indeed, many who traveled to the rally did so on chartered buses, planes or trains with other members of their church groups.
Promise Keepers drew on this church infrastructure to mobilize the numbers it summoned to Washington. Neither Promise Keepers nor government agencies are making any official crowd estimates, but it is safe to say the gathering numbered in the hundreds of thousands.
Six years ago, Promise Keepers drew 4,200 men for its first event in a basketball arena in Boulder, Colo. Since then, the group has drawn, by its estimate, about 2.6 million men to 61 stadiums in cities around the country. Historians call it one of the fastest-growing religious revivals in American history.
The Washington Post poll found that 46 percent of Saturday's participants considered themselves Republican, (28 percent said they were independent, and 15 percent Democrat) and 61 percent considered themselves either conservative or very conservative. Eight percent said they were liberal.
Some conservative groups and members of Congress took advantage of the event to try to marshal support. The Family Research Council, a conservative lobby headed by Gary Bauer, distributed a pamphlet and built its mailing list by fielding workers offering free aerial photographs of the event to those who signed up for it.
Critics on the political left and in feminist groups warn that Promise Keepers is a "Trojan Horse" for the religious right. And certainly many in Promise Keepers oppose abortion and homosexuality.
But in interviews, Promise Keepers participants characterized themselves as largely apolitical because, they said, they did not believe in political solutions to what they see as spiritual and moral problems. The Washington Post poll found that while 6 in 10 men said they had a favorable impression of the religious right, only 26 percent said they considered themselves members.
Over coffee on Saturday night, four friends from the Detroit area who drove to the rally together said that for them the Promise Keepers event was a spiritual "pep talk" for leading righteous Christian lives.
"We can't change people through politics," said Vito Mazzara, 36, a United Parcel Service driver from North Branch, Mich., who brought his 11-year-old son to the rally. "Our job is to have a lifestyle of integrity. I do it with my customers on my route, with my bosses. I don't call in sick if I'm not sick. My bosses know that."
It is not possible for people or political systems to change things like economic inequality, injustice and prejudice, the four men agreed.
"It's never going to be fair," said Tim Laden, 49, a real estate appraiser from Redford, Mich.
The only answer, they said, is "changing hearts" to persuade people to accept Jesus Christ as their savior. The men said the rally had inspired them to share their faith with non-Christians. But outright proselytizing rarely succeeds, said Darrell A. DuBay, 36, an account executive for a building automation business. "Before I became a Christian I had people try to force religion on me, and nobody likes that."
Much of the media coverage of Promise Keepers highlighted men who were looking to rebound from serious problems, like addictions, divorce or abuse. But the four men from Michigan are probably just as typical in that they are husbands and fathers in what they characterized as intact, traditional families.
Nevertheless, they said, Promise Keepers served to remind them to be more responsive to the needs of their wives and children.
"My wife runs a part-time business, and I tend not to give her enough time off," said Ignacio Gneco, 36, a carpenter from Redford. "She dresses all the kids, and I could do that. I don't even know where the clothes are."

HEADLINE: Pesticides Contribute to Food Safety Problem;
Growing Your Own

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Sept. 29 front-page article on the dangers of importing food into the United States suggests the need for all of us to learn where to get wholesome food locally and to grow our own food. 
 Community Supported Agriculture farms allow city dwellers to purchase the crops grown by a local farmer. Subscribers get fresh food that is harvested in a timely manner and trucked to their homes dozens instead of thousands of miles.
A few fruit and nut trees planted in a courtyard and a community vegetable garden in a vacant lot can supply the food needs of dozens of families. Bean sprouting can be done in a small kitchen all year round. These ways of taking responsibility for our food supply will also prove to be economical and beneficial to the environment.

HEADLINE: The Eve of Construction;
Refugees From City Fear They've Started a Boom

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

DATELINE: COLD SPRING, N.Y.

 BODY:
By moving from a Hoboken, N.J., brownstone to Putnam County, Aegis Frumento, a New York lawyer, and his family found what seems impossible in the region these days: a house on a 5 1/2-acre plot of wooded land for $270,000, good schools, relatively low taxes and a community where crime is almost unheard of.
Mr. Frumento and his wife, Jane Vagnoni, bypassed Westchester County altogether in settling here with their three children. "You can't find anything like this in lower Westchester for less than a million dollars," he said. 
 The couple is representative of many families who, whether unable to afford Westchester or wanting to get more for their money or seeking a more bucolic setting, have discovered Putnam and made it the fastest growing county in the state. Putnam's population grew by about 7,000, or 8.4 percent, between 1990 and July 1996, according to the United States Census Bureau.
New residents are lured by the county's good schools, rural character, affordability and low rates of crime and unemployment. "We've been called one of the best-kept secrets in the metropolitan area," said Edward Heelan, a real estate broker and developer.
But Putnam's growth is rapidly transforming an area that a generation ago was a rural retreat for New Yorkers. Many people who moved to Putnam in search of a simpler way of life feel threatened by the accelerating growth.
Complicating matters is that much of Putnam is in the New York City watershed. Fearful that unbridled development is also threatening the purity of water carried from reservoirs here to the city's residences and businesses, the city's Department of Environmental Protection is enforcing the first new pollution rules for the watershed in 44 years, some of which could dictate where development can take place. One indication of the bitterness of that fight is that 100 developers and landowners, 98 of them from Putnam, have sued the city for the value of their lost property and development rights.
As Putnam expands, many fear that it will go the way of southern Westchester County, once a haven for those fleeing the ills of the city, but now faced with urban problems like traffic, crime, pollution and poverty.
"New Rochelle and Mount Vernon once called themselves the city of homes," said Elizabeth Fuller, librarian for the Westchester County Historical Society. "They were residential places, where you built nice parks and had fresh air, but then they got large."
Up until the 1940's, much of Westchester consisted of farmland, summer resorts and large estates, Ms. Fuller said. In the 1950's, the county became a bedroom community and major corporations started moving their headquarters into Westchester.
In Putnam County, with subdivisions and office buildings cropping up on what was once farmland and a community of lakeside second homes, there are fears that the county may lose its rustic beauty, the very thing that attracted many people here in the first place.
Drawn by the combination of a bucolic atmosphere and easy access to urban centers, William Clare, 36, and his wife, Shawn, 42, moved almost five years ago from Port Chester, a largely working-class village in Westchester, to the Putnam town of Southeast, where they bought a town house. Mr. Clare, a court officer, and Mrs. Clare, a secretary, both work 45 minutes away, in White Plains.
"We have all the major arteries right here," he said. "Danbury is 10 miles away for shopping. And we had hoped to start a family and we thought the schools would be better. The taxes are much lower than in Westchester."
In Putnam, the median sales price for a single-family home was $172,500 in the second quarter of this year, compared with $306,000 in Westchester, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In 1995, Putnam, home to Gov. George E. Pataki, ranked 61st out of the state's 62 counties for both violent crime and property crime, according to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. The median household income in 1993 was $54,939 -- the highest in the state. In 1996, only 4,167 of its 90,983 residents, or 4.6 percent, were below the poverty level, the lowest percentage of poor people of any county in the state. The unemployment rate was 2.9 percent in June -- tied with Albany County as the lowest in the state.
Most of Putnam's residents commute to jobs in New York, Connecticut, Westchester or Dutchess Counties. Mr. Frumento has a 70-minute ride into Manhattan, much longer than the trip from Hoboken. "But it's a quality commute," he said. He always gets a seat on the Metro-North train and with his laptop computer, cellular phone and briefcase, he finds that his ride is often the most productive time of day.
The Putnam County Executive, Bob Bondi, thinks the environment is a major reason many people are drawn to the county. "There are no cities in Putnam, so there's no urban blight," he said. "And there are plenty of trees."
But one factor that mitigates against development is that much of the county is in the New York City watershed, and all of the 11 reservoirs in the county are owned by the city. With tougher watershed regulations in place, there are those who say there is little chance that the county will become overdeveloped. Still, more than 7,100 acres of land that drain into reservoirs are slated for development or have new construction under way, according to Nell Keeler, an environmental analyst. Depending on whom you talk to, the regulations are either too strict or too lax.
Judith Jones, a philosophy professor at Fordham University who moved from Yonkers to Mahopac earlier this year, thinks the restrictions are not tight enough and that development is out of control. "Every parcel I pass is for sale," she said. "Before you tear down the ecosystem, you should ask yourself if it's good for humans or for the rest of the ecosystem."
One of the biggest projects planned for the county is a 450,000-square-foot retail outlet center in Kent. Mr. Heelan is the broker and consultant for the project. Putnam has very little retail. "If you want to buy a dress, you have to go to Danbury, Poughkeepsie, White Plains or Mount Kisco," said Ross M. Weale, president of the Putnam County Economic Development Corporation.
Joseph L. Belvedere, the town supervisor of Kent, is one of the retail center's biggest supporters. "Our tax base has been shrunk by the watershed requirements," he said. "The town needs an economic taxpayer besides homeowners. A lot of the costs, which the watershed regulations put on the town, are not reimbursed and the amount that is set aside for reimbursement is hardly enough."
In the town of Southeast, a huge multiplex cinema has been planned by Hoyts Cinema Corporation. It has drawn opposition, even though the county has no movie theaters. The site for the proposed cinema is across the street and downhill from the East Branch reservoir and it borders the watershed.
"The parking lot is blacktop and impervious," said Michael Caputo, a member of a civic group opposed to the multiplex. "In addition, the project will increase traffic tremendously. It's a quiet road, and by Hoyts's own estimate, there would be 745 cars during the peak hour."
Mr. Bondi thinks there is room for the county to grow and still maintain its attractiveness. But some residents think that if Putnam is not careful, it could become like nearby Danbury, Conn., where malls and heavy traffic abound. "I like a place where there's not a traffic jam every 100 yards or so," Ms. Jones said. "I like a nighttime that's actually quiet. Thousands of people feel like I do, and that's the reason we have the growth. Everybody tries to get the same thing, and no one ends up getting it."

HEADLINE: Trash Disposal System Is Fragmented by a Court's Ruling

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Waste collection and disposal in New Jersey have never been simple matters, although there have long been two constants: that the state's disposal costs were the highest in the nation and that the state controlled where the garbage ended up.
Whether household trash was separated and recycled locally and then burned in an incinerator to produce electricity, or bundled together at huge transfer stations and taken by truck to landfills in the state or elsewhere, state law has for more than two decades regulated it like a public utility. 
 The state directed county officials how to dispose of the garbage and gave them the exclusive right to borrow millions of dollars to finance those arrangements. The counties then passed the costs to homeowners and businesses through local taxes or the fees paid to private carters.
But in New Jersey, which generates about 10 million tons of trash each year, the constants can no longer be relied upon. Last May, a Federal appeals court found the disposal arrangements to be anticompetitive and unconstitutional. The state has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, but most officials expect that the court will turn down the request during its new term, which begins Monday.
As a result, arrangements that have existed for 25 years are being questioned. From Gloucester County in the rural south of the state to densely populated Bergen County in the north, communities have been altering their garbage disposal plans in the hope of lowering their costs.
In the process, those communities are calling into question the financial arrangements that have long secured some $1.6 billion in bonds issued around the state for a range of waste-disposal operations. At the same time, the state has sent letters warning municipal officials that the state's system remains in effect until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling, and communities that alter their arrangements may face fines.
Eric Wisler, a partner with the law firm of DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick & Gluck, a specialist in waste disposal that is representing 10 of the state's 21 counties, said that "there is no 'one size fits all' anymore" and different communities are striking off in different directions.
"The fallout of the decision is that things are falling apart," said Michael Hogan, counsel to the State Environmental Commissioner, Robert C. Shinn Jr. Mr. Hogan said the state had already published for comment the outlines of a replacement plan in the event that the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stands.
"We are troubled by what is happening, and each county seems to be adopting a different approach in anticipation of the state plan finally falling," Mr. Hogan said. "There is a whole menu of options for them, but litigation seems to be a side dish with most of them."
In Essex County, for instance, officials have gone to court to break a contract they have with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built and owns the Essex County incinerator in Newark. County officials said they could cut their disposal costs to $63 a ton from the current $73 a ton by using out-of-state landfills.
In Gloucester County, officials have sued to reopen their local landfill and to break the decades-old agreement with Wheelabrator-Frye Company not to compete with the company's incinerator. If the county is successful, its disposal costs would plummet to $57 a ton at the landfill from $99 a ton now at the incinerator, county officials said.
For New Jersey residents like Cindy Calotta of Maplewood, the fragmentation of the state system is likely to force them to pay attention to something that they rarely think about. Ms. Calotta pays $300 a year to a private hauler who must take the town's trash to the incinerator owned by the Port Authority. "After living in New York City and paying nothing, it's a lot of money," she said. "But we have gotten used to it."
Caught in the middle are agencies like the Bergen County Utilities Authority, which in 1988 borrowed more than $110 million to build a transfer station and signed a contract to deliver all of the county's waste to the incinerator operated by Union County. Three Bergen towns have struck out on their own since the court ruling in May. They have contracts to dump their trash at New York and Pennsylvania landfills at rates 30 to 40 percent less than what the county authority must charge to pay off its bonds and honor its contracts.
"We're just holding our breath," the chairman of the authority, Fred Criscuolo, said. With the defection of three towns so far, the county authority is falling short of the revenue it needs to meet debt payments and has had to tap into reserve funds.
With an average disposal fee of $87.97 a ton, New Jersey has the highest waste disposal costs of any state, according to Solid Waste Digest, a trade publication. The national average is $37.76 a ton. New York's average cost is $76.58 a ton, while Connecticut's is $65.36, the digest said.
The state's system went into effect in 1970 and was aimed at curtailing illegal in-state dumping. But it was expensive, resulting in $110 million annually in what the courts have called "excess tipping fees" for New Jersey residents. Local agencies spent millions of dollars to develop and build transfer stations, landfills or expensive waste-to-energy incinerators.
Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority, noted that protecting the environment was a "desperation issue" for communities at that time. Incinerators like the one in Newark were seen as investments in economic development. But perhaps more important, the Port Authority had the money to build the incinerator, thereby freeing local governments from having to raise taxes immediately to pay for the project.
But Mauro Tucci, the chairman of the Essex County Utility Authority, said that the county is now locked into contracts with the Port Authority, signed in 1990, that require it to pay $73 a ton, even as the Port Authority's incinerator is taking in waste from New York City for only $40 a ton. "It may have been groundbreaking at the time, but this deal is no longer a good one for Essex County," he said.
In Camden, the county waste authority issued $220 million in bonds to build an incinerator and then turned over the plant to a private company, Foster Wheeler, to operate. The county agreed to pay $94 a ton to dispose of its waste in the incinerator. Now, though, said Mr. Wisler, the lawyer representing Camden and a number of other counties, Camden wants to abandon the incinerator and find cheaper landfill disposal.
Mr. Wisler said that the county was willing to pay the debt on the plant, even if it goes unused, because the county feared the impact a default would have on its credit rating.
"Camden is one of those counties which has worked hard to get their bond ratings up from the lowest investment-grade rating," said Mr. Wisler. "After a lot of sacrifice, they are on strong financial footing and don't want to risk losing that."
By contrast, in nearby Mercer County, Princeton Borough officials filed suit on Sept. 16 to block a county waste disposal plan that would require the municipality to continue to dispose of its waste with the county at a cost of $109 a ton.
David Goldfarb, a Princeton City Councilman, said the borough contends that the Federal court ruling last May not only banned the state from commanding where waste should go, but banned the county from doing so as well. Therefore, the county cannot force residents to make good on a $110 million debt for planning an incinerator that was never built, Mr. Goldfarb said.
"It's time for the improvement authority and the state to pay the price for what they have done and stop crossing their fingers and hoping lightning will strike and save them," he said.
When private haulers began challenging the state system in 1994, state officials expressed fears in court papers of an apocalyptic fragmentation that they said would "wreak havoc on the financial and environmental well-being of New Jersey." What has happened instead is a slow hemorrhaging that will eventually change the face of waste disposal in the state.
John Rooney, the Mayor of Northvale in Bergen County and a longtime opponent of the state system, was the first to take his community out of the system after the court ruling. He has nevertheless been putting aside some of the savings his town is realizing from cheaper disposal to help pay the debt the county has incurred for its transfer station. "I don't think the money was spent wisely over those years, but that is a different issue," he said. "I'll pay for the debt, but I won't pay for them to stay in the garbage business."

The Mariners Fall Short of Raised Expectations This Year

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
IT has come to this with the Seattle Mariners: Once upon a time they skulked about in the soft underbelly of the American League, but now they trudge in the nether world of good teams with high hopes that never quite won a World Series, or even reached a World Series.
They have the best player in baseball and the best left-handed pitcher in baseball and possibly the best designated hitter and the best young shortstop, too, but they were eliminated by the Orioles, 3-1, yesterday, in the first round of the playoffs. 
 There is reason to wonder if time and realignment and expansion and economic decisions will alter this team before it ever reaches the promised land.
"Our season's over, we all go home, in different directions," Ken Griffey Jr. said yesterday. "We all think about spring training."
Spring training does not sound like a lot of fun for a glamour team that has become one of the best draws in baseball. Griffey hit 56 home runs this season and Randy Johnson won 20 games, but in this four-game series, Griffey hit no home runs and batted only .133, and Johnson lost the first and the fourth games, even though he struck out 13 batters yesterday.
"What, you think I didn't pitch well today?" Johnson replied to somebody who brought up the defeat much too soon in the interview session.
The Mariners had reason to be defensive and sad. They came of age in 1995 by stunning the Yankees three straight times in Seattle, in one of the great recent post-season series, and they saved baseball in Seattle and charmed the voters into going for a new ball park in 1999. But will a pennant and a world championship banner ever flap in the brisk Puget Sound breeze?
"We won 90 games for the first time ever here in Seattle," said Lou Piniella, the manager. "We drew over three million fans. We won our second division title in three years. I told our kids after it was over that they had nothing to be ashamed of."
"They played their hearts out all year," Piniella said. "We fell short in our goal, but when you get to this level of competition, that can happen."
A team can erode from within, for one reason or another. The Pittsburgh Pirates were that team in the early 90's, reaching the league championship series three times and losing, once in heartbreaking fashion to an Atlanta pinch-hitter named Francisco Cabrera, and then the Pirates could not pay their stars, and free agency killed them.
Realignment could be the villain for the Mariners. The sport that spends millions of dollars on utility infielders is trying to save money on airplane fuel, so the Mariners are lusting to be switched over to the National League, which does not employ the designated hitter. If the Mariners change leagues, they may not have a spot for Edgar Martinez, merely one of the fearsome hitters of his time, but who has not played a position regularly in five years.
"Yeah, it kind of makes me angry," Martinez said as red-eyed teammates hugged each other. "I could play a position if they told me to prepare. But I don't think this is the end of the Mariners. They still have good players." The saddest player in the clubhouse was Jay Buhner, the shaven-headed power hitter who became a regular in 1991, the first time the Mariners ever reached mediocrity with 83 victories.
"I'm proud of being a Mariner," Buhner said, his pale eyes burning. "I remember us reaching .500. What's so frustrating is that we had chances to go further but we haven't done it. I don't know what's going to happen. There's so much up in the air. If there's realignment, who's in your division?"
"It only lasts so long," said Buhner, who is 33. "We've got guys signed for one more year. If we lose Edgar, we lose a quiet leader. We can't afford to lose a dominating guy like him. My God."
This year the Mariners set a major league record with 264 home runs, but they traded Jose Cruz Jr. to Toronto for two relief pitchers who did not help. Jose Cruz Jr. is still only 23 years old, but the season is over for the Mariners.
"You can't say you had a bad season if you don't win the World Series," Griffey said. "Houston didn't have a bad season. San Francisco didn't have a bad season. If you go out there and have good years, you see what happens afterward. Are you saying that only one team has a good season every year?"
No, that is football mentality, that everybody but the Super Bowl winners are craven sissies. The problem is perspective. Once the Mariners bashed the Yankees in 1995, they raised hopes they may never fulfill.

Bucs Find Trouble Playing From Behind

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE 

 BODY:

BUCCANEERS 16
PACKERS 21
GREEN BAY, Wis., Oct. 5 -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been built for close, grind-it-out games, and the Bucs enjoy themselves most when they get a lead. That way, they can pound the other guys in the fundamentals of football. 
 But what happens when the Bucs drop far behind?
That had not happened this season, which was one reason Tampa Bay opened with a 5-0 record. But today the Green Bay Packers made sure Tampa Bay played from behind, and the defending Super Bowl champions showed the Bucs, before 60,100 fans at Lambeau Field, that they can play the game any way you choose. Fast or slow. Ahead or behind.
Green Bay was up, 21-3, at halftime. And though Tampa Bay won the second half, 13-0, and had the ball at the Green Bay 42-yard line with 1 minute 52 seconds to play before stalling, it was Green Bay that showed a champion's ability to win.
Green Bay triumphed, 21-16, and improved its record to 4-2. Tampa Bay slipped to 5-1 though it had 10 more first downs than Green Bay, 138 more total yards and 153 more rushing yards, ran 16 more plays and finished with nearly 9 minutes more of possession time.
"Yeah, nice numbers for them," Packers safety Eugene Robinson said. "But we won the game."
Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy could not argue. "Usually the best team wins," Dungy said. "They showed their character, but I think we showed ours, too. Those are the defending champs, though. There is a lot of talk about them being dead, but I don't think so."
That talk has been eating at the Packers. After their slow start -- including a loss at Detroit last week -- the pressure and criticism had begun to mount from the outside and within. Reggie White gathered his teammates before this game, moved the cameras and microphones away and privately told them that the fans do not play the game. The news media does not play the game. The Packers do, White said, and it was up to them to turn the team's fortunes around.
So, though Tampa Bay took a 3-0 lead in the first quarter, Green Bay bounced back with a 21-point second quarter. Brett Favre hit Antonio Freeman on a 31-yard scoring strike early in the quarter, and then, with 44 seconds left, Favre found Freeman again on a 6-yard scoring pass. But the play of the game happened between those two touchdowns.
Green Bay was up, 7-3. Favre fumbled at his 18 on a quarterback sneak: Tampa Bay ball. On the next play, Buccaneers quarterback Trent Dilfer tried to throw a screen pass to fullback Mike Alstott, but Packers end Gabe Wilkins wound up the receiver instead. Seventy-seven yards later, including some nimble running and a major leap over Buccaneers by the 295-pound Wilkins, the Packers were ahead, 14-3.
"It happened so fast, I don't remember every little detail," Wilkins said. "I could see them coming to my side of the defense, and then the ball was right there in my face."
Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn rushed for 125 yards, and it was his 2-yard run with 10:11 to play that made the score 21-16. Then the Bucs got sacks from Regan Upshaw and Chidi Ahanotu to force Green Bay to punt. Tampa Bay was ready for its final gasp.
The Bucs started at their 4 with 4:59 left and moved quickly and efficiently to the Green Bay 42, but on third-and-6 and fourth-and-6 Dilfer could not complete passes to Dunn, who was isolated against linebacker Wayne Simmons.
Favre said: "It was like a playoff game. It had that atmosphere, the intensity was there. I assume Tampa Bay will be there at the end."
We can assume that Green Bay will be there, too.
 
SAINTS 20
BEARS 17
Da Coach 20, Da Bears 17.
Mike Ditka got revenge in his first game against the franchise that fired him almost five years ago, as his New Orleans Saints defeated Chicago on Heath Shuler's 89-yard touchdown pass to Randal Hill with 5 minutes 39 seconds to play last night.
Moments after a livid Ditka screamed at an official for what he felt was a bad penalty call, the coach was pumping his fist in celebration of Hill's leaping catch over Tom Carter.
Ditka, who coached the Bears to victory in the 1986 Super Bowl, spent much of the game agonizing over his team's poor play. The Saints blew a 13-3 fourth-quarter lead, committed three turnovers and failed to convert a single third down.
In the end, however, New Orleans won for the second time in three games while Ditka's former team fell to 0-6.
"We didn't do anything, we made a couple of plays and got fortunate," Ditka said. "We got lucky on a play and that's all I can say."
But it was not all he could say. He was animated all night.
"I yelled at everybody," he admitted. "I should yell at myself."
Was the yelling worth it?
"Yeah, I'm going to do it until I die," Ditka added.
The Bears must defeat Green Bay next week to avoid matching the worst start in their 78-year history. They lost their first seven games in 1969, when they finished 1-13 for their worst season.
During pre-game warm-ups, Ditka strolled to the center of the field, talking with his successor, Dave Wannstedt, for several minutes. And when the team left after the warm-ups, several hundred fans cheered Ditka, who walked with his head down into the locker room.
Ditka came back for the start of the game to a warm reception.
Ditka was fired after a 5-11 season in 1992, finishing with a 112-68 record with the Bears. (AP)
 
LIONS 13
BILLS 22
Barry Sanders came into the game looking to find the end zone on a running play. Unfortunately for him, Buffalo found him in the wrong end zone yesterday.
Sanders, without a rushing touchdown this season, was tripped by Bruce Smith and tackled by Phil Hansen for a safety, breaking a 13-13 tie with 2:12 left.
"I bet that doesn't happen very often," Hansen said. "There was just no place to run in there. We had back-side pressure, front-side pressure. It was just a great defensive effort."
Sanders finished with 107 yards for his fourth straight 100-yard game. It was not enough for the Lions. "We held him in check," said Bills linebacker Chris Spielman, who started his career with the Lions. "I've seen him for eight years, and I know what he can do. I think we did an admirable job." (AP)
 
VIKINGS 20
CARDINALS 19
Yes, the Cardinals lost another close one.
Minnesota's Eddie Murraykicked a 38-yard field goal with 10 seconds left as the Vikings came back from a 9-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat luckless Arizona.
Minnesota had taken over after the Cardinals' Kevin Butler missed a 31-yard kick wide left with 52 seconds to play.
Brad Johnson took the Vikings 62 yards in 37 seconds to get within range of the winning kick. His final completion was a 43-yarder to tight end Andrew Glover open over the middle that carried to the Arizona 20.
All I knew was I was going to catch it, because it was an excellently thrown ball, Glover said.
Murray's winning kick, sent the Cardinals to their fourth defeat by a total of 11 points.
Last week, Butler missed two field goal attempts in the fourth quarter in a 19-18 loss to Tampa Bay.
Murray also kicked his 234th consecutive extra point, tying the N.F.L. record set by Tommy Davis of San Francisco from 1959 to 1965. He had to make it from field-goal length because of a 10-yard holding penalty on his first try.
The Cardinals put together a strong drive to the Minnesota 6 before their hard luck struck.
LeShon Johnson was thrown for 1- and 7-yard losses on consecutive plays, leaving Butler to try the 31-yarder.
I don't care what happens, Cardinals quarterback Kent Graham said.
We've got a good team. We're going to stay together, and we're not going to finger-point, because this team could be 5-0, and it ticks me off that we're not. (AP)
 
BENGALS 13
JAGUARS 21
The play developed like so many others for Mark Brunell and the Jacksonville Jaguars. He rolled to his left, found his receivers covered and saw room to scramble.
For the first time since tearing ligaments in his right knee, Brunell never gave it a second thought. He ran. Brunell was back to his old self, throwing for three touchdowns and showing his potential as a scrambler.
Brunell's 14-yard scramble in the fourth quarter set up his 12-yard touchdown pass to Willie Jackson. The score put the Jaguars in control for good.
"I've got a tired team," Bengal Coach Bruce Coslet said. (AP)
 
STEELERS 42
RAVENS 34
In the first half, after his third interception, Kordell Stewart stood on the field with his hands on his hips. Then his shoulders sagged as he let out a huge sigh.
In the second half, after his second touchdown pass, Stewart hopped like a kid and skipped off the field. He had rallied the Pittsburgh Steelers from a 21-0 deficit to a 28-24 lead.
Stewart had come up with a new variation of Slash -- inept in the first half and infallible in the second -- as the Steelers tied a team record for best comeback victory. The Steelers also rallied from 21-0 down in a 30-24 victory on Dec. 15, 1985, against Buffalo.
"It's about trust, man," said Stewart, who strained a quadriceps late in the game. "You throw three interceptions, guys can go in the tank. It's not over until there's three zeroes left in the fourth quarter. Anything's possible when you believe."
After setting up three Baltimore touchdowns with interceptions before halftime, Stewart threw three touchdown passes after the break and appropriately capped the day with a 74-yard scoring run.
The Ravens blew a second-half lead for the 11th time since they came to Baltimore last year.
"After the game, guys are saying that we have to learn from this," Baltimore's Vinny Testaverde said. "But I thought we learned from it last year. If we don't give it the extra effort, we're always going to be a .500 team." (AP)
 
OILERS 13
SEAHAWKS 16
Steve Broussard burst 77 and 43 yards for touchdowns in the second half, rallying Seattle from a 10-point halftime deficit.
Broussard, the Seahawks' third-string running back, came off the bench to put some zip into Seattle's running attack after it was held to 19 yards in the opening half. I haven't run like that since 10 years ago when I played at Washington State, he said. (AP)
 
CHARGERS 25
RAIDERS 10
A castoff and a fill-in turned into heroes for the Chargers, who smothered the N.F.L.'s top offense.
Gary Brown, who did not play in the N.F.L. last year after being released by the Oilers, ran for 181 yards. Greg Davis, released by Minnesota two weeks ago, and signed by the Chargers to fill in for their injured kicker, John Carney, kicked six field goals. Davis probably will be unemployed again soon; Carney is expected back from a strained ligament in his knee before San Diego's next game, on Oct. 19.
San Diego held the Raiders, who entered the game with the league's top-rated offense, to 241 total yards, and only 13 on the ground.
Brown kept in shape last year by lifting weights at the Y.M.C.A. in Williamsport, Pa. (AP)

HEADLINE: Death Penalty Is Posing Test For Prosecutor

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, facing the biggest test yet of his personal opposition to capital punishment, must decide by Wednesday whether he will seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a police officer in May.
Gov. George E. Pataki, the police union and the victim's parents have all publicly and vigorously urged the District Attorney to argue for the death penalty. When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani named a street after the officer, Anthony Sanchez, earlier this month, he said the case was "precisely the reason the death penalty was established in New York." 
 "I have urged the District Attorney," the Mayor said, "to seek the death penalty in that case. It is our view that the death penalty would be appropriate, considering that Officer Sanchez was murdered by someone fleeing another crime."
The facts of the case are simple. Officer Sanchez, a decorated officer with an unblemished, 10-year record, responded to an armed robbery call on May 19. Climbing the stairs of the apartment building in Chelsea, he intercepted a gunman and was shot once in the neck. Police officers searching the area found Scott Schneiderman cowering in the basement with superficial bullet wounds and Officer Sanchez's service revolver.
The police charged that Mr. Schneiderman, a failed stockbroker, had gone to the building intending to rob his wealthy father. But, they said, he botched the job and ended up killing Officer Sanchez during his escape.
Mr. Schneiderman has yet to come to trial, but the debate over the case began almost immediately after his arrest. Mr. Morgenthau, seen as the leading prosecutor in New York City and probably the most influential law enforcement figure in the state, is a longstanding opponent of capital punishment and has so far not sought execution in any case. Most of the other political groups involved in the debate, from the police union to Governor Pataki, are in favor of the death penalty.
The Governor, in particular, has been willing to intervene when he thinks a district attorney will not enforce the law. Soon after the death penalty was reinstated in 1995, District Attorney Robert T. Johnson of the Bronx announced that he would not seek the death penalty in any case. After he declined to seek capital punishment in the case of a murdered police officer, Governor Pataki ordered the State Attorney General to take over the case. Mr. Johnson sued, but the courts upheld the Governor's right to intervene.
Taking on Mr. Morgenthau would probably be a much more difficult task. For one thing, Mr. Morgenthau, who has been District Attorney for 23 years, has more political weight than Mr. Johnson. And the Manhattan District Attorney, while making his personal views known, has carefully avoided any sweeping pronouncements on the death penalty and has said he will abide by the law and consider each case on its own merits.
In fact, Mr. Morgenthau has established a capital offense committee, including some of his most senior prosecutors, to advise him on cases that could involve the death penalty. The six-member committee includes his first assistant, James M. Kindler; the trial chief, Nancy Ryan, and the office's top homicide prosecutor, Peter Casolaro. The committee members, who declined to speak about the case, have varying opinions on capital punishment, and an average experience of more than 20 years.
The committee has met repeatedly to evaluate the Schneiderman case and has visited the crime scene more than once. In making a recommendation, the members are expected to consider the facts and circumstances of the crime as well as any pertinent data about Mr. Schneiderman's background or his state of mind at the time. Whatever the recommendation, it will not be binding. The final decision will remain the District Attorney's.
One question will be whether Mr. Morgenthau, who is 78 and running unopposed for another four-year term, wants to cap his career by seeking a punishment that he has consistently opposed. He has declined to discuss specifics of this case but answered questions about the death penalty with an array of arguments about efficiency and public safety.
He produced a recent survey by Quinnipiac College showing that a majority of New Yorkers -- ranging from a slim majority in the suburbs to a strong one in the city -- oppose the death penalty. Crime statistics show that murder in Manhattan is now at the level of 1937, and since Mr. Morgenthau took office in 1975, the number of murders in Manhattan has fallen from 648, to 200 in 1996. Then there is the economic argument. According to Mr. Morgenthau, a 1993 Duke University study showed that it cost the state of North Carolina $2 million more to execute an inmate than to imprison one for life.
Writing in a 1995 article for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, Mr. Morgenthau labeled the death penalty "a mirage that distracts society from more fruitful, less facile answers."
"It exacts a terrible price in dollars, lives and human decency," he wrote. "Rather than tamping down the flames of violence, it fuels them while draining millions of dollars from more promising efforts to restore safety to our lives."
Both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani have spoken with Mr. Morgenthau about the Schneiderman case. The Governor declined to talk about the conversation, except to say, "This is precisely the type of case for which the death penalty was passed."
The Governor said it was his duty to insure that the state's laws were upheld. He said that if Mr. Morgenthau makes a decision based on the particulars of the Schneiderman case and according to the guidelines of the law, he will have no cause to replace him in the case.
"My decision," Mr. Pataki said, "will be based on my belief as to whether or not his decision is made on professional as opposed to philosophical grounds. I have enormous confidence in the integrity of District Attorney Morgenthau. In the event he does seek a particular course of action in a case, he will be honest enough to truly state the reason."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 7, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the pending decision by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, on whether to seek the death penalty in the killing of a police officer referred incorrectly to Mr. Morgenthau's re-election effort this year. He is not unopposed; Harry Kresky is running on the Independence Party line.

HEADLINE: A Taste for Catfish Lands a Bird in Trouble as Farmers Seek to Arm

BYLINE: By LES LINE 

 BODY:
HARDLY anybody loves the double-crested cormorant. Least of all fishermen, who since Colonial days have tended to view these large, greenish-black water birds with hostility in the belief that they consume tremendous quantities of commercial and game fish. Until the early 1960's, fishermen on the Great Lakes in Canada, with official acquiescence, destroyed cormorant colonies by killing the adult birds with shotguns and smashing their eggs.
The double-crested cormorant, also known as the crow-duck, is a protected species in the United States. But in a new twist to an old conflict, the fairly recent popularity of catfish on the American restaurant menu and dinner table has led to a proposal by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service to allow fish farmers in 33 states to kill unlimited numbers of the birds. 
 The service is expected to make a decision on adopting the proposal later this year.
The soaring demand for catfish fillets has created a fish-farming boom in the South, where double-crested cormorants migrate in winter. In Mississippi alone, more than 100,000 acres of Delta land is dedicated to catfish production. These large, shallow ponds, crammed with up to 60,000 catfish an acre, are highly visible from the air and are magnets for fish-eating birds, especially cormorants.
Biologists say this catfish cornucopia has contributed significantly to a cormorant population explosion in recent years, which has in turn led to increased predation on fish stocks. Growers say they are losing millions of dollars' worth of catfish each year to the birds, and they demand relief.
"Nobody is in favor of massacring the birds," said Louie Thompson, who raises catfish fingerlings on 350 acres of ponds near Thornton, Miss. "But we want a little more latitude to protect our crops." Mr. Thornton, who is president of the Catfish Farmers of Mississippi, said that several thousand cormorants roosted in cypress trees on an oxbow of the Yazoo River near his farm. "We've been able to reduce our losses by harassing the roosts," he said, "but it's expensive to keep running them off all winter long."
Because the species is protected, catfish growers currently need permits from the Fish and Wildlife Service to shoot a limited number of cormorants -- a maximum of 50 a year in Mr. Thornton's case -- and they must report the number of birds killed. Those requirements would be lifted by the proposed order.
From 4,000 to 8,000 cormorants are shot every year by fish farmers in the South with no noticeable impact on the wintering population, said Dr. John Trapp, a biologist with the Migratory Bird Management Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service. He wrote in The Federal Register that the rule change "is expected to result in only a modest increase in the number of double-crested cormorants taken at aquaculture facilities."
Mr. Thornton agreed with that. "They're smart birds," he said. "They get wary of people and guns pretty quickly."
The highest take of cormorants under the relaxed rules, Dr. Trapp projected, would be around 92,000 birds a year, or 5 percent to 10 percent of the continental population. "This will be more than offset by the recruitment of young birds into the population," he said.
In a letter to the Fish and Wildlife Service, Jim Ekstrom, president of the National Aquaculture Association, said programs "at the farm level are inherently limited in their ability to control burgeoning cormorant populations." Mr. Ekstrom, who owns a striped bass farm in El Campo, Tex., said the agency also "must implement or supervise a program of roost dispersal and even the destruction of cormorant nests and eggs."
But conservation groups say the depredation order would set a dangerous precedent. It is intended, in large part, to ease an administrative and budgetary burden for the fish and wildlife agency, which keeps track of the permits and the number of birds killed, the groups say.
Kathleen Rogers, the wildlife counsel for the National Audubon Society in Washington, said: "We recognize there is a problem in five states, but to issue aquaculturists a blanket permit to kill as many cormorants as they want, everywhere but in 15 Western states, is a strange solution. The punishment doesn't fit the crime."
Ms. Rogers said the problem could be addressed by issuing local permits that were limited to months when cormorants were likely to cause abnormal economic losses to catfish growers.
The bird at the center of the dispute is the most common of six species of cormorants that breed in North America, and it is the only one found around inland freshwater lakes and rivers. Named for the tufts of white feathers that appear on its head in spring, the double-crested cormorant is typically seen perched on rocks or pilings with its wings spread to dry, or riding low in the water, with its head and neck exposed like a submarine's periscope.
In North America, the double-crested cormorant nests from the Pacific coast of southwest Alaska to the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland and south to the Gulf of Mexico, but 61 percent of the breeding population is concentrated in the northern prairie states and provinces, especially the large lakes of Manitoba, and along the Great Lakes. About 26 percent of the population breeds in Canada's Maritime Provinces and Maine. In fall, thousands of birds from this 1,860-mile-wide expanse of breeding range funnel into the heart of the catfish farming industry, at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers.
Relentless persecution and the loss of natural wetlands to agriculture kept double-crested cormorant numbers low until laws protecting the birds were passed early in this century and the Federal Government went on a dam-building binge, creating huge lakes stocked with fish. The interior cormorant population began an eastward expansion through the Great Lakes in 1913 and reached the upper St. Lawrence River by 1945, only to be devastated by the effects of DDT and other toxic chemicals after World War II.
But in the 1970's, with DDT banned and the catfish industry expanding in the birds' wintering grounds, the number of cormorants exploded. The population on the Great Lakes alone increased 300-fold between 1973 and 1993, a period when the number of catfish farms in Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana grew to 1,193. In 1982, there were 794 such farms. (In 1993, 496 million pounds of live catfish, worth $353 million, were delivered to processing plants.) Recent estimates of the total double-crested cormorant population in North America range from one million to two million birds.
An adult cormorant weighs about 4 pounds and will eat a pound of fish a day, but studies have repeatedly shown that in natural circumstances, the birds feed largely on small, noncommercial species like alewives. But a Mississippi Delta catfish farm with as many as 1,000 acres of ponds is a decidedly unnatural environment. The typical catfish pond is a 20-acre rectangle side by side with other ponds, and Dr. Trapp, of the Fish and Wildlife Service, wrote that "the practice of using large ponds developed in the 1970's, when cormorant numbers were low."
Because the ponds are large and close together, Dr. Trapp explained, it would be difficult to cover them with nets to keep out the birds.
Dr. Trapp said cormorants consumed an estimated 18 million to 20 million catfish, mostly fingerlings, on the Delta in winter, or about 4 percent of the total. But he emphasized that a number of factors influenced the level of cormorant predation, like the abundance of natural fish populations in the area.
"It is not uncommon for many fish farmers in a region to suffer little or no economic damage from cormorants, while a few farmers experience exceptionally high losses," he wrote.
Mr. Ekstrom, of the National Aquaculture Association, said the proposed order to allow the killing of cormorants by fish farmers -- as well as by growers of other food fish, bait fish and decorative species, like koi -- "is vital to our industry."
But conservationists contend that the proposed order would discourage fish farmers from investing in long-term solutions to the problem of bird predators. Ms. Rogers, of the National Audubon Society, said, "Farmers who are investing in new facilities should design ponds that can accommodate net structures, and the Fish and Wildlife Service should work with aquaculturists to develop non-lethal control methods."

Schools as a Path to Political Power

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Tonight we meet Donna Mengel, a school board member in a Philadelphia suburb, as she is denying charges that she made a remark about "Jews burning in hell." But "New School Order" is not essentially a report on anti-Semitism. Ms. Mengel turns out to be leading a campaign in the North Penn School District in Lansdale, Pa., to save money and shape the curriculum by scrapping plans to build a high school ("Kill that project!") and seeing to it that teachers concentrate on the basics instead of giving attention to sex education, art, music and the like.
The ominous title of this nine-month inquiry by Gini Reticker suggests that the Mengel forces represent an ideological movement that is establishing itself in communities around the land, with the Christian right asserting its values and flexing its muscle in public schools as a path to political power. 
 The hourlong program tells its story mainly through heated moments at school board meetings and interviews with pro-Mengel parents ("It's a war to protect our kids") and her beleaguered opponents. It's a rout. Abetted by conservative Christian churches, Ms. Mengel becomes president of the board. The high school principal leaves. The longtime personnel director resigns, charging that "mean-spirited and vindictive" board members have destroyed morale. Several thousand residents petition to secede from the district.
The restless camera (no narration) catches the high pitch of the controversy but leaves the details vague. The report is tantalizing enough to make you want to know more. Is North Penn an extreme case? Are similar battle lines -- political and economic conservatives allied against more liberally inclined elements -- being drawn so harshly in many other places? Is "New School Order," with its connotation of totalitarian movements past, just a scare phrase or a realistic glimpse of things to come? There's plenty here for further investigation.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 61 as Broader Indexes Set Records

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Declining interest rates on the bond market moved stocks higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining more than 60 points. And though other major stock market indexes had more modest point gains, those moves were enough to push those indexes to new closing highs.
Financial service companies like J. P. Morgan, Travelers Group, American Express, BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan, which tend to benefit from falling interest rates, posted strong gains. 
 Energy stocks also rose, even as crude oil prices retreated as concerns about tensions in the Persian Gulf eased. Exxon, Mobil and Chevron were among the sector's biggest gainers.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.64 points, or nearly eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,100.22. The Dow is now less than 160 points from the closing high it set on Aug. 6.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 972.69, up 7.66 points, setting a new closing high for the fourth consecutive trading session. The Nasdaq composite index also reached its fourth consecutive new high, adding 6.04 points, to 1,721.91.
As larger issues moved higher, the Russell index of 2,000 small-capitalization stocks also inched up 2.18 points, to 461.70, to set a closing high for the seventh consecutive session.
Yesterday, stocks took their cue from the bond market, where the yield on 30-year Treasury bond slid to 6.26 percent, from 6.28 percent on Friday. In addition, analysts said that after the release on Friday of the September employment report, the market had returned its focus to third-quarter corporate earnings.
As gauged by companies' expectations of earnings, the quarter is still on track to produce double-digit percentage gains in the S.& P. 500, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.
So far this quarter, about 64 percent of companies making such announcements have said that earnings could falter, Mr. Hill said. That level is in line with previous quarters, he added, but "we're pushing the envelope in being able to say 'business as usual.' "
After earlier waves of corporate warnings about warnings led to analysts' reducing their third-quarter forecasts, some strategists began to predict that earnings could actually come in stronger than expected.
Still, investors yesterday continued to punish companies that said their earnings might fail to meet expectations. Silicon Graphics, La Quinta Inns and Kulicke & Soffa all fell after reporting that earnings could weaken in the third quarter.
Silicon Graphics plunged 8 13/16 a share, to 18 1/16; it was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than 16.7 million shares changing hands, and its 32.8 percent decline was by far the the biggest drop.
La Quinta tumbled 4 7/8, to 18 1/8, and Kulicke & Soffa, which makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, dropped 8 1/8, to 39.
"That just shows you that the market is fully priced," said Jim Benning, a vice president at BT Brokerage in New York. "Everything has to be exactly right. Any company that misses its expectations by even a small amount is going to get hurt."
Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, suggested that investors penalized Silicon Graphics, La Quinta and Kulick particularly because each company was in a sector that had been performing well. Thus, their problems were largely unexpected, he said.
"There wasn't a lot of suspicion that these were places to look for trouble," Mr. Herrmann said.
"If the market is fully valued, it tells you level, it does not tell you trend -- and the trend is higher," he added. "But because valuations are so poor, if you have an accident, then you are going to fall."

Treasuries Up In Optimism On Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Faced with reduced prospects of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve after a benign employment report on Friday, and with few economic reports due early this week, investors bought Treasury securities yesterday amid optimism that economic growth was slow enough to keep inflation at bay.
The 30-year bond gained 10/32, to a price of 101 19/32, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, at 6.26 percent, down from 6.28 percent on Friday and a 19-month low. 
 Last week, at the central bank's monetary policy meeting, Federal Reserve officials kept the Federal funds target rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, unchanged at 5.50 percent. The employment report, like other recent economic data, hinted that growth had moderated, which has cheered bond market participants, whose investments are eroded by inflation.
The market's rise yesterday was also attributed to buying from overseas and by investors covering short positions -- that is, buying back borrowed securities to cover failed bets that the market would fall. For foreign buyers, the United States bond market remains the most attractive in the world.
Ken Logan, managing analyst at Technical Data of Boston, said the market was aided by the apparent calming of tensions in the Middle East, which let oil prices settle to levels that the bond market was more comfortable with.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said he, like other analysts, believed that bond yields were dropping because market participants were not concerned about inflation and because they also felt that the economy could not sustain its rapid rate of growth.
"Until now people have not accepted the notion that inflation is really under control and demanded an excessive premium" of more than four percentage points in the difference between inflation and bond yields, he said. Historically, he added, the premium has been three percentage points or less. That means there is considerable room for the yield on the 30-year bond to drop, even below its low of 5.79 percent in 1993.
Standard & Poor's MMS International, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said that while professional Fed watchers remained split on when the next rate increase would come -- with six out of 21 surveyed on Friday now expecting a tightening in November and 11 of 21 expecting one in December -- "the market has voted even more clearly, pushing the chances of a tightening out to nine months."
Yesterday, in an address to the Rockland County Business Association in New York, the New York Federal Reserve Bank president, William J. McDonough, said the Fed's policy continued on the tight side, with a bias toward increasing rates.
Rates at yesterday's Treasury bill auction were in line with expectations, but with limited investor interest now that the three-month rate is below 5 percent. At auction yesterday, the three-month bill remained at 4.93 percent, unchanged from last week, while a six-month bill was sold at a rate of 5.01 percent, or about 7 basis points less than a week ago. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Silicon Graphics Expects A Loss, and Its Stock Dives

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Shares of Silicon Graphics lost a third of their value today after the company said it expected to report a loss for its first fiscal quarter.
The loss, which the company attributed to unexpectedly weak sales in the quarter ending on Sept. 30, came after a surprisingly strong fourth quarter, in which Silicon Graphics said it had successfully put product-transition issues behind it. 
 But the recent quarter was only the first time in two years that Silicon Graphics had met, let alone exceeded, Wall Street analysts' estimates, and for many investors today's announcement appeared to shatter whatever credibility the company retained. As of late last month, Silicon Graphics executives were still telling analysts that they would meet Wall Street expectations.
"They don't have a chief financial officer; they demonstrably do not have good internal controls or a coherent forecasting and planning process," said Doug van Dorsten of Hambrecht & Quist. "They are $120 million under my revenue forecast, and I was at the low end."
The disappointing sales were particularly hard to understand during an economic boom, when the company has a fresh product line and when its major rival, Sun Microsystems, has continued to report robust results. Some analysts say Silicon Graphics seems to be following the example of Apple Computer, staking out the high ground in technology even as prosaic but more aggressively managed competitors grab ever-greater shares of the market.
Silicon Graphics shares closed today at $18.0625, down $8.8125, on volume of 16.7 million shares on the the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said its business model, which required both high profit margins and high growth, might no longer be sustainable. Although the company still offers the highest-performance work stations and servers, especially for niches like the graphics market, it is not addressing broader areas of high-growth potential, which are increasingly served by Sun and Hewlett-Packard.
The company said today that it expected to report revenue of approximately $760 million, compared with $765 million in the comparable period a year earlier. It expects a net loss of about 20 cents a share, excluding the effect of charges associated with the acquisition of Paragraph International. Silicon Graphics had a net loss of $22 million in its first fiscal quarter last year.
"We anticipated a seasonally weak September quarter, especially after record revenues in the June quarter," Edward R. McCracken, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "But the results were significantly lower than our expectations."
Mr. McCracken said the sales of servers -- larger computers shared across networks, which had accounted for significant growth in recent periods -- were disappointing, especially in the United States.
"In hindsight, our strong June quarter, coupled with longer selling cycles associated with the enterprise business, affected demand in the September quarter to a greater extent than we anticipated," he said.
Best known for building the computers used to create special effects like the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park" and its sequel, "The Lost World," Silicon Graphics supplies high-performance computers for such diverse purposes as oil exploration and aerospace. For a time, the market's appetite for Silicon Graphics' dazzling machines seemed insatiable, and the company maintained an annual growth rate exceeding 40 percent. But growth slowed in 1995, and quarter-to-quarter results have varied.
Although the company has been believed vulnerable to an onslaught from high-powered personal computers using the Intel Pentium processor and the Microsoft Windows NT operating system, analysts said such machines had so far had only a minor impact. The real competition is from other work station vendors, as Sun and Hewlett-Packard have progressed in overall system performance, and more specifically, in graphics applications.
New personal computer-based work stations from Compaq, Dell Computer and Gateway 2000 present a challenge at the low end of the market, but that has never been a major part of Silicon Graphics' sales.

HEADLINE: 10 Bosnian Croats Surrender to War Crimes Tribunal

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Oct. 6

 BODY:
After several months of intense negotiations between Washington and Croatia, 10 Bosnian Croats, including one of the most-wanted war crimes suspects in Bosnia, turned themselves in to the international tribunal in The Hague today.
The surrender of the group -- which included Dario Kordic, a powerful Bosnian Croat political leader accused of engineering an "ethnic cleansing" campaign -- was a major step in Croatia's effort to improve its standing with the United States. 
 Mr. Kordic was charged in 1995 with expelling and murdering scores of Muslims from the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia in 1993, virtually emptying the valley of its Muslim inhabitants. One of the best known massacres in the valley took place in the village of Ahmici in April of that year. Many Muslim families, including children, were said to have been burned alive in their homes in Ahmici. All 10 men taken into custody today were charged in connection with the Lasva incidents.
In Washington, the State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today that Croatia's cooperation signaled "a new determination" by President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Bosnian Croat leaders to comply with the Bosnia peace accords.
The pressure from Washington was applied to Croatia, which wields considerable influence over the ethnic Croatian portion of Bosnia, where many of the suspects were living openly. Mr. Kordic was living in an apartment owned by the Croatian Government, according to Croatian press reports.
While Mr. Rubin stopped short of promising that Washington would ease the pressure it put on Croatia when it blocked loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, he said the cooperation would be taken into account when loans for Croatia were reconsidered.
Mr. Rubin and others also reiterated warnings to Bosnian Serb suspects and said the Croats' willingness to turn themselves in "is an example that other indictees would be well advised to follow."
United Nations and American officials who have investigated what happened four year ago in the valley created by the Lasva River say Mr. Kordic and the others who surrendered today set off a stream of murder and terror designed to wipe the area clean of anyone who was not a Croat.
At the time, Mr. Kordic was the head of the Bosnian annex of the nationalist Croatian party led by President Tudjman.
The Croatian nationalists said the Muslims and the few Serbs who lived in the Lasva Valley were enemies of the Croats and had to be removed so that Croats could live in peace.
In fact, the officials say, the attacks ordered by Mr. Kordic were intended to give Mr. Tudjman's political party control over a strategic part of Bosnia.
Today, most of the area remains substantially under the control of leaders who follow instructions from Mr. Tudjman's party. Few of the original residents who survived have been able to return.
Military forces said to have been under Mr. Kordic's authority reportedly went on a rampage of killing and pillaging in 14 villages and towns. They are accused of crimes against humanity for persecuting Muslims on religious, ethnic or political grounds.
The indictment charges that they murdered detainees, attacked undefended towns, murdered political leaders and professionals, and plundered homes and businesses.
The arrival of the suspects in the Netherlands today doubled the number of war-crimes suspects in the tribunal's custody, accounting for a large part of the indicted Bosnian Croats and Muslims. Only Belgrade and the Serbian leadership in Bosnia continue to ignore the international warrants.
According to Western diplomats, however, NATO commanders are considering a plan to arrest the two top Bosnian Serb suspects -- Radovan Karadzic, the former political leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former military leader -- but not until after the Bosnian Serb parliamentary elections on Nov. 23.
Robert Gelbard, the senior American envoy to the Balkans, vowed tonight in Belgrade that Dr. Karadzic would end up in The Hague.
"Until people such as Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, Veselin Sljivancanin and Milan Martic and others get to the Hague for justice and fair trials, we won't rest and others won't either," he told reporters.
Before the 10 suspects departed today, Mr. Kordic read a brief statement saying that Croats had been "subject to tremendous unjust pressure from the international community."
"We shall endure all this as we have endured everything so far, and return with our heads up high," Mr. Kordic told an emotional group of friends and supporters, many of whom were weeping openly.
The suspects, all dressed in dark suits, flew out of the Croatian city of Split this morning on a Dutch military transport plane.
When the men landed in the Netherlands around midday, they were escorted to the tribunal's detention center at Scheveningen, a suburb of The Hague, to join 10 other suspects in custody, including two Bosnian Croats, Gen. Tihomir Blaskic and Zlatko Aleksovski. General Blaskic, who was charged in the same incidents as Mr. Kordic, gave himself up to the tribunal in April 1996.
Shortly after the indictments, President Tudjman named General Blaskic to a senior post in the Croatian Army. Last December, while he was awaiting trial in the Hague, General Blaskic was awarded a medal by Mr. Tudjman.
Though about one hundred Bosnian Croat soldiers assigned to two elite units were directly involved in the terror campaign, there was only enough evidence to indict the 10 who surrendered today and General Blaskic, according to American officials.
The other nine suspects who surrendered today are Mario Cerkez, Drago Josipovic, Marinko Katava, Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic, Dragan Papic, Vladimir and Ivan Santic, and Pero Skopljak, according to The Associated Press.
According to United Nations and American officials, the men who surrendered today could well offer important evidence against senior Croatian political leaders who are thought to have overseen not only the crimes in the Lasva Valley but also the strategy of terror for political ends in much of the rest of Bosnia.
The group that arrived today agreed to go to The Hague after receiving assurances that their cases would go to trial in three to five months.

HEADLINE: The Battle For Hearts And Tonsils;
Hospitals Specialize To Enhance Profits

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: EDINBURG, Tex.

 BODY:
As traditional hospitals with more offerings than Macy's decline, a new type is taking their place: the specialized hospital or clinic, designed to conquer a profitable niche.
Profit-making hospital chains are leading the way in opening category healers like heart hospitals, cancer centers and rehabilitation facilities. But many general hospitals, for profit or not, are also choosing to become more specialized. More alert than ever to where they are making and losing money, these hospitals are expanding and marketing their most profitable services. 
 Here in South Texas, Universal Health Services, the nation's third-largest hospital chain, bought Edinburg Hospital, an outdated general hospital, from the city three years ago. Universal Health built a new hospital, which opened on Aug. 1 with a traditional range of services but also a focus: delivering babies in a women's pavilion with its own wing and a colonnaded entrance as prominent as the main one. The company is meanwhile guiding the older building through its own recovery, as a specialized hospital for rehabilitation and long-term care.
At its McAllen Medical Center, however, 20 minutes to the south, Universal Health is competing against someone else's specialty hospital. Just down the street there lies the new McAllen Heart Hospital, with a revolving red heart mounted on the roof. By agreeing to share profits with doctors, it lured five McAllen Medical Center cardiologists. McAllen Medical rushed to expand its own heart program before its rival opened last year, advertising itself on television as a "state of the heart hospital for cardiac care."
Often, the huge number of patients the category healers handle leads to improved quality and lower costs. Salick Health Care's cancer centers at nine hospitals, soon to include St. Vincent's in New York, please health maintenance organizations with low costs and chemotherapy patients by staying open 24 hours a day, with valet parking always available. The Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, having opened a Center for Women's Health on the East Side of Manhattan three years ago, offering one-stop shopping for specialists, is considering another at the hospital's Washington Heights campus. And the Healthsouth Corporation's rehabilitation hospitals throughout the country boast of lowered costs and shortened stays.
"There's a transformation from a health care system organized primarily by the providers to a system organized by the needs of the patient," said Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School expert on hospitals. "A hospital that does everything for everybody just won't be as efficient as a focused provider." In her new book, "Market-Driven Health Care" (Addison-Wesley), she cites McDonald's as an instructive example of "focused factories" that can deliver consistent products or services at lowest cost.
But having hospitals behave more like purveyors of french fries can have untoward consequences. Traditional hospitals accuse their new competitors of draining away the most profitable services, leaving more complicated or money-losing treatments to them. While the McAllen Heart Hospital's emergency room caters largely to cardiac cases, the McAllen Medical Center gets the car-crash and shooting victims.
Larger hospitals are finding it more difficult than ever to support costly services like emergency helicopters, neonatal intensive care and trauma centers for gunshot wounds. "If the services to generate positive income wind up getting taken out of institutions like this," asked Michael Israel, chief executive of Duke University Hospital, "how do you find the funds to provide the services society needs?"
When overburdened public hospitals in Los Angeles and Chicago had to limit the number of trauma patients brought in by ambulance, private hospitals reduced their services so they would not receive a costly deluge. Federal laws prohibit patient dumping, but hospitals are not obligated to handle accident victims whom they cannot capably treat.
Many hospital administrators acknowledge that specialized competitors have forced them to become more cost-conscious and focused themselves. Hospitals have improved enough to lift their profits or surpluses to 5.7 percent of revenues in 1995, according to the most recent figures. The gain was the highest since 1986. Many hospitals are also receiving higher payments from Medicaid to compensate those with large shares of uninsured patients.
Competition, stingier Government payments and the dictates of H.M.O.'s have closed more than 700 general hospitals in a decade, leaving 5,200 in 1995, according to the American Hospital Association. But in the same decade, the nation gained almost 100 rehabilitation hospitals, for a total of 171. A catch-all category of other specialty hospitals, including cancer and heart, rose to 110 in 1995 from 74 in 1989.
Many that remain general hospitals have still become more specialized. The chains try to buy clusters of hospitals in a region, then economize by parceling out specialties. Tenet Healthcare Inc., the nation's second-largest chain after Columbia/HCA Healthcare, has 12 hospitals in South Florida. It steers most heart surgery to just three, whose open-heart operations have risen one-third in four years. "You do not need," said Michael Focht, Tenet's president, "to have two open-heart programs within five miles."
Hospitals find surgery especially profitable. In heart and orthopedic surgery most of all, even routine procedures still pay well and require elaborate scans and tests. Delivering babies, unpopular until a few years ago because of the liability risks, has become a money-making activity because of high Medicaid reimbursement.
Medcath Inc., based in Charlotte, N.C., pronounces itself so pleased with its heart hospital in McAllen that it opened another one in Little Rock, Ark., last March, with others starting business in Tucson, Ariz., this month, Phoenix next spring, Austin, Tex., late next summer and then Bakersfield, Calif., and Dayton, Ohio.
In Texas, where managed care has taken hold only recently, Denton Cooley's Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Hospital is one of the busiest surgery centers in the nation, with 2,400 operations a year -- costing about 20 percent less than those offered by most competitors, with measurably better outcomes.
Among those newer to the game, the Heart Institute at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., more than tripled its open-heart surgery volume over five years. The Long Island hospital's publicity campaign includes mailing calendars to every household in its area, with more frequent bulletins to the elderly.
Healthsouth takes marketing much further in trying to endow its 135 rehabilitation hospitals and thousand or so clinics with a brand name as recognizable as Wal-Mart. Sports figures helping to publicize the brand include Michael Jordan, Tom Glavine and Emmitt Smith. Healthsouth has become especially profitable by figuring out how to offer rehabilitation for everything from sports injuries and birth defects to strokes and some surgery for much less than general hospitals can.
In trying to hang on to their more profitable departments, some hospitals are finding themselves defenseless against the new, specialized breed. From Houston's Methodist Hospital, the city's largest, a group of about 18 orthopedic surgeons left with dozens of nurses and aides two years ago for Columbia/HCA's new Texas Orthopedic Hospital nearby.
At Methodist, they had to compete for beds and operating rooms. At Texas Orthopedic, the 10 operating rooms, 46 hospital beds, 43 day-surgery recovery beds, physical therapy rooms and new doctors' offices are exclusively theirs.
" 'All the beds are mine?' the doctors said," according to Marsha Casey, a former Methodist executive. " 'Wow. I'm there.' "
Several of the doctors became hospital co-owners, sharing in the profits. Texas Orthopedic, handling only a limited range of injuries, can offer its services more profitably than less specialized hospitals. If a patient has a heart attack, she will be whisked to another hospital, maybe Methodist.
This summer, Columbia/HCA also announced plans to turn a former general hospital in Houston into a children's hospital, and the company is considering new children's hospitals elsewhere. The ability of such Columbia/HCA hospitals to attract and keep their staffs is likely to suffer, however, because of plans by the company's new management to avoid having doctors as investors.
To attract medical stars, hospitals can wind up bidding against each other, sometimes into the millions, threatening the cost savings that set them apart. The Salick cancer centers build new operations and offer much higher pay.
The company might soon face a very familiar rival. Earlier this year, Zeneca P.L.C., a British drug maker, bought control of Salick Health Care, forcing out Bernard Salick, the founder. Mr. Salick pondered his next move for all of a day, then formed a new company to open AIDS centers. He soon hired David Ho, the researcher who developed the drug "cocktail" now preferred in AIDS treatment. Mr. Salick plans his first AIDS center in New York, opening in perhaps a few months, with others in Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco. He also plans to return to cancer care.
Salick Health Care, meanwhile, is trying to specialize even further by opening breast centers for detecting and treating breast cancer and other ailments. The first breast center opened in Manhattan on East 61st Street between York and First Avenues earlier this year. With construction set to begin on its first cancer center in New York, at St. Vincent's, by the end of the year, Salick Health Care hopes to have four or five more hospital sites around the area.
But not every specialty pays off, making some niche programs just as vulnerable as many mainstream operations.
On the East Side of Manhattan, Lenox Hill Hospital closed its New York Pain Treatment Program in February. While the program never had a loss, said Norman J. Marcus, the program's director, it was not as profitable as areas like orthopedic and heart surgery, in which Lenox Hill is expanding.
The pain program will survive only as a much smaller, independent entity with 5 doctors instead of the former 30.
In a prepared statement, Terence M. O'Brien, Lenox Hill's chief operating officer, said that the hospital evaluates programs based first on its patients' needs. But, he added, "Our programs must also prove to be economically viable and consistent with our strategic plans and mission."
Dr. Marcus put it differently. "You want to do things," he said, "that bring in the greatest amount of money in the shortest period."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Chief Says Iran Gas Deal Won't Hurt Ties With France

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said today that whatever action the United States took in response to a French oil company's decision to invest $2 billion in Iran would not undermine close relations between the United States and France.
The statement followed several hours of talks here between Mr. Cohen and the French Defense Minister, Alain Richard. The United States has objected to the privatel French oil company Total S.A.'s decision to put $2 billion into exploitation of an Iranian natural gas field, with Russian and Malaysian partners. 
 "We believe that transaction will substantially enhance Iran's ability to acquire the revenues necessary to acquire missile technology and weapons of mass destruction," Mr. Cohen said today. "What action will flow from that remains to be determined, but we intend to maintain a close relationship with a very good ally."
"We both want to see Iran end state-sponsored terrorism and end its efforts to acquire missile technology and weapons of mass destruction," he added.
Mr. Richard said that all 15 European Union countries had withdrawn their ambassadors from Teheran after a German court finding that Iranian leaders had ordered the killing of three Iranian Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin cafe in 1992.
"When there is a terrorist action that is proven, we will draw the consequences," Mr. Richard said. He declined to say whether France agreed with American assessments that Iran was trying to acquire the technology to build nuclear weapons, and missiles to carry them, from Russian and other experts.
Mr. Richard said the French Government had told officials of Total that there was no reason, in international or French law, for them not to go ahead with the investment in Iran. An American law, the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act authorizes the Clinton Administration to impose sanctions against American subsidiaries of any company that invests more than $20 million in Iran.
American officials said in recent days that they are still assessing the Total transaction and have yet to decide whether the Clinton Administration will impose sanctions.
"The United States has not decided what action to take, but will enforce the law," Mr. Cohen said. Later, he added: "I understand the position the French have taken. It is my hope that Minister Richard understands the position the United States Government has taken."
Unlike Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who said last week that he personally "rejoiced" in Total's decision, Mr. Richard also appeared determined to play down rather than highlight differences between Washington and Paris over the step.
"We stand very vigilant over Iran," he said. "We observe with interest the ongoing changes in Iranian domestic politics, with the hope that they will someday yield resolve to build a more peaceful relationship with neighboring states."

U.S. Experts Dispatched

WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (AP) -- The Clinton Administration is sending legal experts to Malaysia, Russia and France to investigate whether the Iran deal violates United States law.
The United States wants to make sure that any sanctions it might impose against the companies involved in the deal will stand up to a court challenge, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said today. He said legal scrutiny of the contracts could take some time.

HEADLINE: Banks Take On Credit Unions Over the Limits of Membership

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Two fierce competitors for the consumer banking dollar banks and credit unions -- battled before the Supreme Court on its opening day today in arguments over the validity of a Federal regulation that has permitted credit unions to expand far beyond their traditional base among employees of a single company or members of a single occupation.
The question in the case is the proper interpretation of a 1934 law, the Federal Credit Union Act, which brought credit unions under Federal regulation and required them to limit their membership to "groups having a common bond of occupation or association" or to groups within a particular community. 
 For 48 years, the Federal regulators read that language as requiring that credit union members share a single "common bond," typically a common employer. In 1982, however, the National Credit Union Administration reversed course and issued a new interpretation, under which a credit union could include unrelated groups, as long as each group was defined by its own common bond.
The agency wanted to expand the membership base, and thus preserve the viability, of small credit unions suffering from the collapse of small businesses during the recession of the early 1980's. The impact of the new interpretation was dramatic. Credit unions, which are nonprofit, tax-exempt cooperatives financed by shares bought by their members, expanded in all directions.
Today, 3,600 of the 7,000 federally chartered credit unions have members from multiple occupational groups, including many of the biggest credit unions, with 32 million members and 79 percent of all credit union deposits. Credit unions now offer most of the services offered by banks, from checking accounts to home mortgages, often at a lower cost because of the credit unions' tax-sheltered status and reliance on volunteer labor.
Last year, the American Bankers Association and a group of North Carolina banks convinced the Federal appeals court here that the 1982 interpretation was invalid. The bankers challenged the expanded charter of the AT&T Family Credit Union, in Winston-Salem, N.C., which was opened in 1952 to serve employees of the Western Electric Company. It now has 300 separate employee groups, including employees of a Coca-Cola bottler and the Duke Power Company. The appeals court said that "common bond" in the 1934 law meant a single common bond. Still unresolved, and not part of the case now before the Supreme Court, is whether multiple-group credit unions will have to divest themselves of their new members -- some 158,000 employee groups -- if the Justices uphold the appeals court.
Arguing the Government's appeal today, Seth P. Waxman, the acting Solicitor General, told the Court that the 1934 law was, at the least, ambiguous in its reference to "groups having a common bond." Mr. Waxman said there was "no way to tell from the statute" whether credit unions were limited to a single group or whether they could serve multiple groups, each with its own common bond.
Mr. Waxman's emphasis on ambiguity was at the heart of the Government's defense of the 1982 regulation. Under the Court's precedents, administrative interpretations of ambiguous Federal laws are entitled to deference from the courts as long as those interpretations are reasonable.
Michael S. Helfer, arguing for the banks, said the statute was not ambiguous.
"There has to be one common bond per credit union," Mr. Helfer said, adding that Congress would not have written a limiting definition at all if it meant that credit unions could expand infinitely by adding additional groups.
The Court actually spent little time today on the merits of the case, National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., No. 96-843. Most of the hourlong argument was spent on whether the banks were the appropriate parties to challenge a regulation that was not addressed to them.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in 1996 that the banks were "suitable challengers" because their interests were at stake as competitors of credit unions.
Mr. Waxman urged the Justices to find that the bankers lacked the standing to challenge the regulation because, despite their interests as competitors, the banks did not fall within the "zone of interests" addressed by the statute. He said that when Congress included the common bond provision in the credit union act, its intent was not to shield banks from competition but to strengthen the fledgling credit unions by making sure that members had a connection with one another.
Mr. Helfer, arguing for the banks, urged the Justices to take into account that "legislation is almost never passed with one purpose" but usually has multiple purposes.
Although arguments over standing tend to be obscure, the question of competitors' ability to challenge regulations that affect their economic interests is a basic and surprisingly unsettled issue in administrative law.
Whatever decision the Court makes in this case, the competition between banks and credit unions is likely to shift to Congress. A bill already introduced in Congress would enact the 1982 regulation into law. If the Court rules against the credit unions, the unions and their members will push for this legislation, and the banks can be expected to oppose it.

HEADLINE: A Warm Climate Prevails as Experts Study Ecological Problems

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton today convened a daylong conference on climate change that produced a series of optimistic discussions about harnessing technology, ingenuity and the entrepreneurial spirit to save the planet from global warming.
Mr. Clinton peppered experts with questions and ruminated aloud on how to prod the most energy-intensive economy in the world to break its addiction to fossil fuels, and how to negotiate a treaty by the end of the year that will bind the rest of the world to do the same. Vice President Al Gore and Cabinet members were on hand, and the balcony at Georgetown University was packed with appreciative students from Mr. Clinton's alma mater. 
 There was almost no talk of energy taxes, heavy-handed regulations or other unpopular measures to make swift, deep reductions in the use of energy and the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and threaten widespread ecological damage in the next century.
Instead, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena held up solar roofing tiles and said they are on the verge of economic feasibility. Mary Good, an investor who is a former Administration official, spoke of the potential to grow algae and convert it into clean fuel. And Tom Casten, president of Trigen Energy Corporation, said that the deregulation of the utility industry would help double the efficiency of electricity plants.
E. Linn Draper, president of American Electric Power, a major utility company, said Americans would be more likely to invest in energy conservation if the Administration would create a system of pollution-permits trading to encourage cost-effective reductions in emissions.
Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group that favors market-based incentives to reduce pollution, said that greenhouse gas emissions could be brought below 1990 levels by 2005. The Administration has been leaning toward establishing a less-ambitious target, with emissions leveling off at 1990 levels by 2010.
Only at the end of the day, after Mr. Clinton left, did a panel of economists inject a somewhat more dismal tone to the proceedings, warning that it would not be painless to cut energy use so deeply.
"As I listen to all this, I am concerned that we are greatly underestimating the size and complexity of the undertaking," said William Nordhaus, a professor of economics at Yale University. "We are not going to introduce these wondrous technologies unless we increase the cost of energy."
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers who has been counseling caution as the Administration debates its negotiating position, was more sanguine in public. "The question is not whether we can respond effectively to this threat," he said. "We can and I believe we must."
Mr. Clinton encouraged the attendees to accentuate the positive as they discussed what is described as a serious global problem.
But Mr. Clinton seemingly recognizes that there is no easy solution to the steady growth of greenhouse gas emissions.
Groping for alternative policies that would encourage consumers to buy energy-saving products, he mentioned four alternatives: raising the price of energy, lowering the price of new technologies, creating market-based incentives for people to invest in saving fuel, or increasing the public's awareness of the problem.

HEADLINE: Women at Helm of New Hampshire Politics

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

 BODY:
Walk down the long, silent halls of the New Hampshire State House, and self-important looking old men with names like Styles Bridges, Huntley N. Spaulding and Henry Quinby peer down at you from their oil portraits in musty complacency.
But enter the offices of the most powerful politicians in New Hampshire today, and suddenly, that old world is turned most resoundingly on its head. 
 For this granite-faced state is fast becoming the closest thing the country has to a political matriarchy, run by the first tandem in American history of a female Governor and a female Speaker of the House. The deputy speaker is a woman to boot, and 31 percent of the seats in the Legislature are filled by women.
Even though politicians here shy away from sex stereotypes, they say that the style in the 178-year-old State House has become decidedly Venusian of late, with a new emphasis on listening, inclusion and compromise emanating from the Governor's office. That could be why things are running so well, they say, because by the usual political measures, they should be a mess.
Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, whose auburn hair and virtuous demeanor call to mind the revamped torch-raising lady of Columbia Pictures, is a Democrat. The Legislature is two-thirds Republican. And Donna Sytek, a House Speaker known to unstintingly speak her mind, disagrees deeply with Mrs. Shaheen on issues like abortion and taxes.
But although there have been wrangles, they have been civil ones, both sides say. In her first nine months in office, Mrs. Shaheen has managed to get enough done, from new public money for kindergartens to a generally acclaimed budget, to earn the highest approval rating of any politician in the state. She won with 57 percent of the vote, and recent polls show that she is more popular now than she was then.
"I believe in consensus building," Mrs. Shaheen, the first woman to be the Governor of New Hampshire, said in an interview. "I think women tend to view decision-making in that way. So that's certainly been a focus for me.
"I think most people would agree I'm less confrontational than some of my predecessors have been," she said.
Some of her predecessors would go even further than that.
"The fact is, Jeanne Shaheen has had a much easier time than I did," said former Gov. Stephen Merrill, the popular tax-cutting Republican whose place she won after he chose not to run again.
"She says, 'I'm the Governor, they're the Legislature; we're working together for your best interest,' " he said. "When I was Governor, I said, 'I'm Steve Merrill, I fight these people every day for you.' "
Of course, some, including Mrs. Shaheen herself, point out that with lawmakers so stacked against her by party affiliation, she had better find ways to get along with them or she is sunk. But she also firmly believes, she said, that "no one party has a lock on the best answers."
Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus in Washington, said that Mrs. Shaheen's style and substance largely conformed to what national studies have reported about women in political power: that they tended to focus on "service" issues, like health care and education, and that budgets in those areas tended to grow when they were in power. When women rule, she said, "communication and dialogue become less combative."
At this point, Mrs. Shaheen is doing so well that she is almost universally expected to be re-elected next year, though former United States Senator Gordon J. Humphrey and several others are expected to run against her. New Hampshire, which chooses its Governor every two years, has never denied a second term to a sitting Governor who wanted it.
But politicians and analysts caution that her success does not necessarily reflect any deep change in the traditional Republican domination of New Hampshire. Nor, they say, has New Hampshire's new status as the state where women have unusual power occasioned much eyebrow-raising among its crusty Yankees.
New Hampshire's House of Representatives, with 400 members who each get a measly $100 a year, has long been a training ground for women in politics, they note. Governor Shaheen herself served three terms in the 24-member State Senate.
When those close to her or opposed to her explain the Jeanne Shaheen phenomenon, they tend to focus on her personal qualities, her diligence and natural political talent, and her disciplined ability to fashion a well-defined set of messages and then remain "on message" through thick and thin.
"She is the most disciplined campaigner I've ever seen," Mrs. Sytek said. "I've never seen a politician stay on message as she did."
Furthermore, averred Mrs. Shaheen's irrepressible husband, Bill, an entrepreneur and lawyer who quit his district judgeship to help her campaign, "There's not a dishonest bone in her body."
"Honesty goes a long way with people here," he said. His wife is so honest that, at 50, she doesn't even dye her hair, he said, adding that it has not gone gray because he is the one who does all the worrying.
When she was running, Mrs. Shaheen focused on four and only four main issues. She stressed education, and she has since moved the state toward providing public kindergarten for all children and overseen a 40 percent increase in investment in local-level education. She called for lower electricity rates, which she has been fighting intensely to achieve through deregulation.
She also called for broader access to health care, which she has pursued, and good jobs for all. (She cannot take credit for it, but the New Hampshire economy is going at such full tilt now that unemployment is at 2.7 percent and employers tell tales of bringing in homeless people and training them, less out of altruism than pure desperation.) She also took "the pledge" that New Hampshire voters traditionally require, to impose no broad-based new taxes.
By the time she ran for Governor, Mrs. Shaheen was already a consummate political strategist who had learned from campaigns she had managed for others. As she and her husband reared their three daughters in the last 20-odd years, they also became some of the most accomplished Democratic political operatives in the state.
Mr. Shaheen -- who is called Billy, as his wife is called Jeannie -- helped lead Jimmy Carter's come-from-behind New Hampshire campaign in the 1976 season, and Mrs. Shaheen performed similar magic for Gary Hart in the state in 1984.
Last fall, as the Republican candidates savaged one another during primary season, Mrs. Shaheen serenely ran a textbook campaign.
"Here she is surrounding herself in loveliness, and our guys are killing each other," Mrs. Sytek recalled ruefully. "We had a whole summer of Jeannie in pale blue, Jeannie in green, Jeannie in pink. It worked."
In recent months, Mrs. Shaheen's conciliatory style and legislative know-how have continued to work. There have been fights over issues like how big a tobacco tax there should be, but no blow-ups, all agree.
"We're both practical politicians, both much more interested in getting to the goal than in who did what," Mrs. Sytek said. "We're both more interested in governing than grandstanding."
Mrs. Sytek disparages some of Mrs. Shaheen's work, commenting that she seemed to have set up more task forces and study committees than the last four governors combined and that her budget had been so well received because she "kidnapped" the Legislature's best budget analyst and avoided any major moves.
"She ruled out any ambitious new initiatives and stuck to her knitting," Mrs. Sytek said. But she nonetheless called their relations "cordial, productive and constructive."

HEADLINE: Sex Complaint Surfaces Against Whitman Official

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Just after Christine Todd Whitman became Governor of New Jersey in 1994, a woman accused one of her Cabinet choices of making unwanted sexual advances. After an investigation by the Attorney General substantiated the complaint, the Governor kept the man, Gualberto Medina, in office and sent a reprimand to his file.
The complaint is described by confidential state documents obtained by The New York Times from a person who has worked for Democratic officials. The incident began when a woman who was then a reporter for The Philadelphia Business Journal tried to interview Mr. Medina, who had been selected as Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development. Mr. Medina, a lawyer and accountant, made "inappropriate, offensive physical and verbal sexual advances" to her, according to the documents signed by the Attorney General. 
 With Mr. Medina's swearing-in ceremony two weeks away, Mrs. Whitman took swift action to settle the matter, and kept it from becoming public.
Mr. Medina was ordered to seek counseling and was given a written reprimand, which was signed by Mrs. Whitman and placed in a confidential file in the State Division of Criminal Justice. The reporter, Diane Mastrull, was informed of the Governor's action and was assured in a letter from the Attorney General at the time, Deborah T. Poritz, that if Mr. Medina's improper conduct recurred, "swift and appropriate action" would follow. Mr. Medina was sworn into office on March 30, 1994.
Becky Taylor, the Governor's communications chief, said that the documents about the complaint are "legitimate." She said that the Governor had tried to keep the matter confidential to protect the reporter. "My impression is she does not want any publicity," Ms. Taylor said.
Mr. Medina, who was out of the country on state business today, released a statement, but refused a request for a telephone interview. "I recognize my behavior was perceived as being offensive," his statement said. "In retrospect, I realize I exercised poor judgment. The matter was resolved to the satisfaction of all parties without a formal complaint being filed."
Ms. Mastrull now works for The Philadelphia Inquirer and was out of town on assignment today. She did not respond to phone messages left for her asking for comment. Her former editor at The Philadelphia Business Journal, Jack Roberts, who was aware of the situation, said that she continued to cover the State Commerce Department until she left the publication about a year ago. He refused to discuss the specifics of the complaint against Mr. Medina. "This was a personnel matter involving confidentiality matters with my reporter," he said.
The revelation of the complaint against Mr. Medina and the effort by the Governor's office to keep it from becoming public come as Mrs. Whitman is facing a re-election challenge from James E. McGreevey, a Democratic State Senator and the Mayor of Woodbridge Township.
The issue of sexual harassment has become troublesome for the Whitman administration. In recent weeks, Democrats have criticized the Governor for spending $175,000 to settle a case brought by a state employee who said that she was sexually harassed by the state Republican Party Chairman, Chuck Haytaian, when Mr. Haytaian was the Speaker of the State Assembly. Democrats have suggested that Mr. Haytaian, who is heavily involved in Mrs. Whitman's re-election campaign, should have to the pay the settlement costs and legal fees back to the state.
Mrs. Whitman has defended the state's handling of the Haytaian matter, saying that it is the state's responsibility to defend its employees in such situations. Mr. Haytaian has vehemently denied that he harassed his accuser, Beth Herbert, an administrative assistant at the State House, but in July the state agreed to the settlement.
Noting the timing of the story -- four weeks before the Nov. 4 election -- Ms. Taylor expressed concern that the Medina case would help Governor Whitman's critics. "This is obviously the silly season, and clearly somebody is out to really hurt the Governor," she said. "If you have to write something like this, is there any way you can hold it until after the election?"
The Whitman administration's effort to resolve the Medina matter is detailed in letters written to the woman, and to her lawyer. In one letter, dated March 14, 1994, Ms. Poritz concedes that "our investigation substantiated your allegations."
Ms. Poritz, who is now Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, assured the woman that in addition to the written reprimand, the Governor and her chief counsel at the time, Peter G. Verniero, would meet with Mr. Medina "to discuss his conduct." Also, she wrote, "Commissioner Medina will participate in counseling as directed by me."
Ms. Taylor said that the Governor had decided to go forward with Mr. Medina's appointment despite the complaint because the woman had specified that she was not seeking his dismissal. Also, Ms. Taylor said, no tax dollars were used to settle the matter, but Mr. Medina "paid a small amount" to cover the woman's legal fees.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vetoes 38 Military Items, Drawing Many Lawmakers' Ire

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton used his new line-item-veto power today to pinpoint and strike from a vast military construction law more than three dozen projects across the country, angering home-district lawmakers who had won Congress's support for them as essential to the national defense.
Interfering in the time-honored ritual of pork-barrel budget politics for the second time this year, Mr. Clinton deleted a total of 38 spending provisions worth $287 million. The projects affected were as varied as a new aerial gunnery range at Fort Drum, N.Y., and a new Air Force paint shop in Texas. 
 "The old rules have, in fact, changed," Mr. Clinton said before exercising the veto in front of reporters in the Oval Office. "The use of the line item veto here will insure that we focus on those projects that will best secure our strength in the years to come."
While vetoing some new projects, Mr. Clinton left intact 107 others, worth more than $500 million, that Congress had added to the Administration's request in passing the Military Construction Appropriations Act, signed into law by the President six days ago.
And he made no deletions among $36 million worth of extra projects in Mississippi, home of Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, or among extra projects in Alaska, home of Ted Stevens, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The President said that in trimming the $9.2 billion that Congress had decided to spend, he was guided by Pentagon priorities and service personnel's needs, not politics.
"The projects I have canceled are all over the country, in the districts of lawmakers of both parties," he said. "These are tough calls involving real money and hard choices."
Of the projects canceled, 25 were in Republican Congressional districts, only 13 in Democratic districts. But White House aides argued that some of the affected Republican districts abutted those of Democrats, who had also wanted the projects, or were in states represented by at least one Democratic senator.
Congress can now pass legislation to restore the projects that the President vetoed today. But if he vetoed them again, it would take two-thirds votes of both houses to override him.
It was the Republicans who supplied Mr. Clinton his extraordinary new veto power, by which the President may reject individual items of spending or tax legislation within one week of signing the legislation into law. The line item veto was unsuccessfully sought by Presidents for more than a century before the Republicans included it in their 1994 Contract With America and then enacted it in 1996. Although a court challenge to the line item veto's constitutionality is widely expected, no suit has been filed since Mr. Clinton first exercised the power in August.
While his own state was spared, Senator Stevens, of Alaska, attacked the President's action. He said that during the budget negotiations earlier this year, Congressional Republicans and Mr. Clinton agreed to almost all the provisions that the President struck today.
"This was an arbitrary political decision to make the President look good," Mr. Stevens said of the veto. "This is not what the line item veto was intended for. These are not pork projects, these are things the military wanted and needed."
He noted that even with the Congressional additions, the total military construction bill amounted to $600 million less than last year's.
Like other Republicans, however, Mr. Stevens said he continued to support the line item veto.
Mr. Clinton and his aides were careful to emphasize today that they did not consider the vetoed projects to be worthless pork. Indeed, Mr. Clinton said there was simply disagreement over which military needs were immediate.
"Many of the projects I have chosen to cancel have merit," he said, "but should be considered in the future."
Mr. Clinton said he had used three criteria in evaluating each project. He said he was vetoing those that "were not requested by the military, cannot make a contribution to our national defense in the coming year and will not immediately benefit the quality of life and well-being of our men and women in uniform."
Mr. Clinton's aides argued that beyond its immediate savings, his use of the line item veto would deter excessive spending down the road.
"If you want to have real fiscal discipline for the future, the President and members of Congress have to be willing to make those tough choices and live by them," said Gene Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council.
Mr. Sperling predicted that lawmakers would ultimately understand that Mr. Clinton was seeking to instill fiscal discipline, and would not punish him by torpedoing his legislative agenda. At present, for instance, Mr. Clinton is locked in a tough fight to win enhanced authority to negotiate international trade deals.
Not every Republican criticized the President's decisions, and at least one, Senator John McCain of Arizona, applauded them.
"After careful review," Mr. McCain said in a statement, "I believe the President's list of items on which to use the line item veto is fair and balanced."
Nor were all Democrats pleased.
Mr. Clinton struck a $5.2 million Army National Guard support center in South Dakota, the home state of his ally Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader. Mr. Daschle told The Associated Press that he did not object to the President's criteria, but added: "That doesn't mean I'll accept the consequences in the long term. Ultimately, I believe in this project."
Others who saw projects killed in their districts or states used words like "outrageous" to describe the President's action.
"The problem with this Administration's defense policy is that there is no long-range military strategy," said Representative John M. McHugh, Republican of New York, whose district was to have received a new aerial gunnery range at Fort Drum.
And Representative John Hostettler, Republican of Indiana, said, "It's unfortunate that the President has put politics above the health and safety of our men and women in uniform, especially with regard to my project."
Mr. Hostettler was referring to a $4.1 million item for a chemical and biological warfare detection center at the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center in his district.
But like Mr. McHugh, Mr. Hostettler said he still believed he had been right to vote last year for adoption of a line item veto.
"I still think in the hands of a person of integrity, this would be a good process," he said. "So hopefully someday we'll have someone like that."
Some other Congressmen noted that vetoed projects in their districts were in the military's long-term plans, even if the Pentagon had not requested money for this year. Therefore, they said, their disputes with the White House may prove to be merely a disagreement over timing.
Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of New York, saw a $2.1 million construction project at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, in his district, canceled today. He said in a statement that "the project is part of the Air Force's five-year budget plan, and I will therefore continue to push for its funding."
Mr. LaFalce added that he considered the line item veto's constitutionality to be "dubious at best."
"I would not be surprised if there is a successful court challenge to the line item veto," he said.
But Franklin D. Raines, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, suggested that a court challenge based on today's vetoes was unlikely, since they generally affected military bases.
Because no private individuals have an interest in such bases, Mr. Raines said, "for most of these projects it would be difficult" for any plaintiffs "to establish that they had a personal interest in the outcome of the President's decision."

Fictional Fame for Wahoo
 Business has been booming in Wahoo, Neb., since the late-night talk show host David Letterman decided last year to move his fictional home office from Grand Rapids, Mich., to the town of about 4,000 people. "We actually have tourists now," said Helen Sloup. She manages her son Bob's downtown surplus store, which sells T-shirts imprinted with a caricature of Mr. Letterman with a big cigar and toothy smile along with Letterman bumper stickers. Sales have been in the thousands. A must-see site is the official home office: A phone booth on the corner of Fifth and Broadway. The town's Economic Development Director, Jane Daufeldt, said the Mayor recently sent Mr. Letterman an invitation to visit. The star can travel by limousine or John Deere combine.

Out of the Past 
 He wrote under names like Antosha and Man Without Spleen. But his real name was Anton Chekhov, and the November issue of Harper's Magazine will feature nine so-called lost stories by the Russian playwright and novelist that have never been published in English. The stories were unearthed by Peter Constantine, a poet, multilingual translator and Chekhov expert while poring over yellowed volumes of late-19th-century Russian literary journals, where he recognized the bylines as Chekhov pen names. All nine stories were written when the author was in his early 20's. The November issue of the magazine goes on sale on Oct. 21.
 
Day of Laurels
The winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature is to be announced early tomorrow in Stockholm. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the recipient of the prize of about $1 million would be named at the ornate headquarters of the Swedish Academy, which selects the annual winner. Last year's winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska.
 
Bright History
Greece's Culture Ministry announced yesterday that 12 ancient landmarks would be lighted at night beginning next year. Only the Acropolis is now illuminated. It will be joined by sites like the temple of the oracles at Delphi and the monastery of Daphne in Athens. The Olympic Academy, on the site where the games were held in ancient times, will also be illuminated. The night lighting, to be installed by the spring, is part of an attempt by the Culture Ministry to safeguard and enhance historic sites.
 
Yen for Entertainment
Miramax Films says its release "Shall We Dance?" has become the highest-grossing Japanese film in United States box office history. With $7.333 million it has surpassed the $7.318 million for "Ran," Akira Kurosawa's version of "King Lear," which was released in 1985, when ticket prices were lower.
 
From Page to Screen
Andrew Morton's book based on interviews of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, is to be turned into a major film about the breakdown of her marriage to Prince Charles. Martin Poll Films said it had acquired motion picture rights to "Diana: Her True Story" and would search Britain for an actress to play the Princess.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Mark Is Up Amid Doubt About Italy's Joining the Euro

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-month intraday low against the mark yesterday, reflecting demand for the German currency amid signs that Italy's budget crisis threatens Italian participation in the euro.
Traders said the euro, the European common currency set to be introduced in January 1999, would be stronger if Italy did not participate. Signs that the euro will be strong have tended to strengthen the mark. 
 The dollar recouped some losses, though it still ended down against the mark. The late dollar rally also helped awaken what had been quiet trading against the yen, giving the dollar a lift in that market.
A struggle in Italy's Parliament over the 1998 budget has led to speculation that Prime Minister Romano Prodi could resign and has left Italy's participation in the common currency in doubt, traders said.
"If Italy's not in the euro, it produces a strong euro," said Jeremy Fand, foreign exchange strategist at the Bank of Boston.
After the dollar dropped to 1.7443 marks, the weakest since late June, it rebounded to settle late in New York at 1.7571 marks, down from 1.7583 late Monday. The dollar cost 122.56 yen, up from 122.00. The British pound cost $1.6176, up from $1.6155.
Traders said the turmoil could keep Italy from meeting economic criteria for joining the euro. That brightened the outlook for the euro, as some European governments have feared that Italy might not control its spending after joining, thus undermining the integrity of the shared currency.
Later in the day, the dollar erased much of its declines because of bargain-hunting and worries about escalating tension in the Middle East, a situation that usually strengthens demand for dollars. The Pentagon said yesterday that Iraqi aircraft were violating the "no fly" zone in Iraq.
A rally by the mark against the yen also bolstered the dollar against the yen, said Alan Kabbani, senior trader at First Union National Bank.
Earlier in Asian dealings, the Malaysian ringgit rallied for the first time in three days and the Indonesian rupiah gained for the first time in 10 days after central banks of both countries intervened to buy the currencies and halt their steep declines.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Aid Plea By Indonesia Appears Near

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Struggling to defend its beleaguered currency, Indonesia appears on the verge of asking the International Monetary Fund for financial help, American officials and Asian diplomats said today.
If Indonesia requests aid from the I.M.F, it will become the third country in Southeast Asia, after Thailand and the Philippines, to declare that its financial troubles have forced it to seek some kind of rescue package. But the final decision to seek such help, officials say, will hinge on a decision by President Suharto, the longest-serving national leader in Asia, whose family is deeply involved in many of Indonesia's biggest ventures. 
 "It is a complicated issue, and I don't think it is certain that Suharto has made a decision yet," an American official said today.
Part of the complication is that Indonesia's financial condition is far better than Thailand's was this summer, when the I.M.F. put together an emergency package of loans to stabilize that nation's suddenly teetering economy. While Thailand depleted its foreign-currency reserves in a last-ditch effort to prop up its currency, the baht, Indonesia still holds foreign reserves of about $27 billion.
Over the next few months, however, the Indonesian Government and Indonesian companies must repay tens of billions in dollar-denominated, short-term debt, and the recent currency devaluations have left companies scrambling to find dollars to make those payments.
One of the mysteries surrounding Indonesia's currency crisis is a basic question no one seems able to answer convincingly: Why is it happening now?
This summer, when Thailand was still reeling and its currency's value was falling, there were widespread fears that Indonesia would suffer from "contagion effect" -- the situation when a currency crisis in one country spills over into others. That threatened to happen in 1995 when Mexico suffered its devastating peso crisis, but an American-led bailout stopped the problems from spreading.
The Thai situation, though, more or less stabilized six weeks ago. That led to a widespread assumption that there would be little contagion. The assumption proved wrong; the Indonesian rupiah has lost roughly 35 percent of its value since Jan. 1, most of that in the last few weeks.
"This could just be the work of speculators looking for another target," another American official said recently. In that case, he added, the I.M.F.'s entry might be largely symbolic, intended to send a message to the markets that Indonesia had the resources to prevent a further fall. But in return for any loans, Indonesia may have to agree to terms set by the I.M.F. -- and the fund's major underwriter, the United States -- and this could prove politically difficult.
Mr. Suharto, for example, has protected Government-backed projects -- including an effort to build a national car -- in which members of his family are big investors. Dumping some of those projects might become a condition of any loan.
Other austerity measures could spark domestic unrest, which has become an increasing problem throughout Indonesia. Last weekend, President Suharto warned that the Indonesian military might soon be called upon to put down further protests.
National bailouts are becoming more common these days, and at the I.M.F. and the World Bank there are teams of experts monitoring Indonesia's financial health on a daily basis, officials at the two institutions say.
"Both institutions are, of course, working with the Government very closely," said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But at this point, there is no package on the table yet."
While Indonesia runs a current account deficit, it is of a manageable scale, the officials said. Last year, that deficit was 3.5 percent of Indonesia's economic output, less than half the size of Thailand's. Moreover, Indonesia continues to benefit from strong export growth, running about 9 percent a year, while Thailand's exports were flat.
Should the crisis continue and force the Indonesian Government to raise interest rates to help halt the currency slide, it could expose weaknesses in the country's banking and financial systems, officials said. But they also said that unlike Thailand, where financial institutions were overexposed to risky real estate ventures, Indonesia's banks seemed relatively stable.
"In a way, the situation is very puzzling because there are no concrete new facts to justify the market's behavior," said an official who is tracking the situation for an international aid agency. "It does seem that the amplitudes of the exchange-rate movements are exaggerated by the thinness of the market."

Just in time for the millennium: an issue of 1,000-year bonds.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WILL Republic National Bank still be around in 2997?
It appears that bond investors are confident it will. Lehman Brothers said yesterday that it was offering $250 million in 1,000-year bonds for Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a European subsidiary of the New York bank holding company. A Lehman official said the offering was going well, but was not yet sold out. 
 The bonds were sold with a coupon of 7.125 percent, and priced to yield about 92- to 94-hundredths of a percentage point more than 30-year Treasuries now yield, or about 7.21 percent.
If all goes well for bondholders, they will get that amount of interest each year for the next 1,000 years, and then will get their money back. Given that no currency in the world has yet endured for 1,000 years, it is not easy to estimate what a dollar will then be worth.
There is no guarantee that the bonds will stay outstanding for anything like that long. The bonds can be bought back by Republic at any time, Lehman said, but that call provision is a relatively harsh one, with Republic having to buy back the bonds at a price that would give the investors a yield of 25 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at the time of the call.
In essence, Republic sold a security that will be viewed by investors as similar to a preferred stock, which has no stated maturity date. And it is likely that banking regulators will view the bonds as equivalent to preferred stock when assessing the company's capital structure.
But Republic will be able to deduct the interest payments it makes from its taxable income, as it can deduct any interest payments. Dividend payments on preferred stock are not deductible.
The Clinton Administration, worried about a number of 100-year bond issues by corporations, proposed last year that interest not be deductible on bonds with a final maturity of more than 40 years after issuance. But Congress rejected the proposal. Still, many lawyers believe the Treasury would reject deductions by an American company on bonds with a maturity of more than 100 years.
Republic, the American company, has only a minority interest in the European subsidiary, which is based in Luxembourg. And it believes that under Luxembourg law the interest payments will be deductible.
The fact that the bonds did not sell out on the first day shows that investors needed some persuading, as they did a few years ago when 100-year bonds returned for the first time since the late 19th century. Those old 100-year bonds were sold primarily by railroads, with investors taking comfort in the fact they were sold in "gold dollars," which guaranteed that investors would be compensated if the dollar was devalued relative to gold.
Alas, that promise was outlawed by Congress in the 1930's, an act that was upheld by the Supreme Court on a 5-to-4 vote, and those 100-year bonds proved to be exceedingly poor investments, as interest rates rose well above the low rates at which they were issued.
In the late 1970's and early 1980's, owners of 30-year Treasury bonds suffered big losses if they sold their bonds, because rapidly rising interest rates had driven down the value of existing bonds. Those bonds carried the assurance that investors would get their money out, in nominal dollars, in three decades, a fact that helped to hold down the losses. These bonds will take 100 decades to mature, and thus would be expected to perform even worse if rates did soar.
It is obvious that no buyer of 1,000-year bonds will be around at maturity, and institutions that buy bonds tend to assume that they will be able to sell the bonds in time if it appears that interest rates are soaring, as would be likely to happen if inflation were to recur. At the moment, inflation is quiet, and few expect it to revive in the near future.
In the early 1980's, investors would have laughed at the idea of such bonds. Now, the fact that such bonds can be issued is yet another indication of how little worry there is that inflation could ever come back.

Bond Prices Drift Higher in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities drifted higher yesterday in light trading, with yields still at their lowest levels since early last year. Investors remain cautiously optimistic that the economy is not expanding at a pace fast enough to heat inflation.
The 30-year bond rose 12/32, to a price of 101 31/32, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, at 6.23 percent, down from 6.26 percent on Monday. 
 Traders said price gains were muted by several factors. Among them, corporate borrowers, who compete with Treasury securities for investor cash, are lining up this week to sell about $6 billion of debt in the public market as borrowing rates have come down recently.
Corporate debt issues offer higher returns, but also higher risk, than Treasury securities, and securities firms managing corporate bond sales often sell Treasury securities from their portfolios to protect themselves against losses if rates rise before the issue is sold. After the deal is done, they go back to buy Treasury securities.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities in Boca Raton, Fla., said there was some central bank buying, which helped lift prices. But primarily, he added, investors were growing comfortable with bond prices after the recent gains, particularly with no interest-rate increase by the Fed expected in the near future.
"In my opinion, what we're seeing is an affirmation to the new price levels in the market," he said.
"Further gains, however, may be difficult without more proof that the economy is slowing," he said. "It takes a while to get over the sticker shock, and the new trading range."
Mr. Pugliese said he did not expect Friday's report of the Producer Price Index for September to be a problem for the market, because producer price data have been benign for months.
With trading in Treasuries subdued, activity in the corporate market caught many investors' attention, particularly a novel security issued by Safra Republic Holdings S.A., an affiliate of the Republic New York Corporation. The banking company, run by Edmond J. Safra, sold $250 million in 1,000-year bonds to Lehman Brothers, which will try to sell them to investors with an interest-bearing coupon of 7.125 percent.
But Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of the fixed-income department for Barnett Capital Advisors, called the 1,000-year bond a "misplaced security."
"It's really an equity-like security in the bond layer of the capital structure," he said. "I don't think it will appeal to bond investors here, necessarily, because of its perpetual maturity. However, European buyers are more likely to buy a perpetual instrument."
Today, the Treasury plans to sell $8 billion of inflation-indexed five-year notes, by reopening an issue it first sold in July. With few signs of inflation in the economy, there is a chance that demand for the securities, which compensate for inflation during the life of the notes, will be limited.

HEADLINE: How Hot Is Hot?

BYLINE: By Bill McKibben; Bill McKibben is the author of the forthcoming "Maybe One: A Personal and Environmental Argument for Single-Child Families."

DATELINE: JOHNSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
History can be made in subtle ways, almost without anyone noticing. This happened on Monday at President Clinton's conference on global warming. The meeting was intended to build national support for some effort to reduce carbon dioxide output in the United States, a pep rally before our team heads off in December to Kyoto, Japan, for the negotiations on a treaty regulating global emissions of greenhouse gases.
But behind that cheerleading, Mr. Clinton seemed to move the goalposts of the climate game in dangerous ways. Here's how the scoreboard changed: 
 Before the Industrial Revolution, the world's air contained about 275 parts per million of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas. By now we've burned enough fossil fuel to reach 365 parts per million. We can already see the effects: higher temperatures, increased rainfall and glacial melting.
But when scientists warned about the really scary probabilities -- coastal flooding, widespread drought and so on -- they always said these would happen if we didn't keep carbon dioxide from doubling, to 550 parts per million. That level was what all the greenhouse fuss was about.
By Monday's gathering, however, holding carbon dioxide to a "mere" doubling seemed to have become our unofficial national goal. On one chart that the President's advisers kept returning to, the path of doubled carbon dioxide showed up as "the green line" in the graph's center -- implying that holding emissions to this level had become the new target. The line of greatest danger had shifted to 700 parts per million. In other words, the President seems to be resigned to the fate scientists once feared.
It's not that the scientists have decided that a world with doubled carbon dioxide will be more benign than they thought. In fact, their predictions have grown more frightening.
But holding atmospheric concentrations below a doubling would require swifter action than the President seems to back. It could still be done. Computer models show that strong global action by 2005 could stabilize the carbon dioxide level below 450 parts per million, which is still quite high but not as dangerous. But Administration economists predict such action might harm the economy as much as the oil shocks of the 1970's.
Forced to choose between the chance of a recession in the next few years and the near certainty of drastic environmental change 50 years away, Mr. Clinton seems ready to side with the economists. Politics may leave him no choice. But it's a tragic change. He will no doubt claim to be choosing the middle path, but until the last few weeks that was the very route we were pledged to avoid.

HEADLINE: Borrowing Pace Slowed During August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by United States consumers increased at a slower-than-expected pace in August, further evidence that the economy is cooling, Federal Reserve figures showed.
Consumer credit rose by $4.3 billion for the month, to $1.229 trillion, after rising a revised $6.0 billion during July, the Fed said in a report released today. 
 Previously, the Fed said July borrowing increased $6.5 billion. Before today's report, analysts had forecast an increase of $4.6 billion in August.
Analysts watch the Fed's credit statistics because it helps them gauge changes in consumer spending, which accounts for a majority of overall economic activity.
The Fed's subdued reading could signal households are paring back on purchases and growing more cautious with their finances. It also could reflect efforts by banks to toughen lending standards after a record one million personal bankruptcy filings last year.
Today's report follows Labor Department statistics Friday that showed job growth -- a major influence on consumer spending -- slowed in September from earlier in the year. Also pointing to a more subdued economy, domestic auto sales dropped 3.8 percent in September from a year earlier.
Still, a slowdown in consumer credit growth might not be entirely caused by restrained spending or tougher lenders. Many consumers have turned to lower-interest, tax-advantaged home equity loans, which are secured by real estate holdings and are not included in the Fed's credit statistics, to refinance other debts.
Despite the evidence of a slowdown, Alice Rivlin, the Fed vice chairwoman, today gave a optimistic assessment of the economy.
"We really are having a period of good news," Ms. Rivlin told a regional conference on the Community Reinvestment Act sponsored by the Fed's Cleveland branch. "We have an economy which seems to be growing as fast as it can without generating inflation."
The Fed report showed credit was expanding at a 4.2 percent annual rate during August, down from the 5.9 percent pace of borrowing in July.
By category in August, revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased $3.0 billion; auto loans fell $600 million, the first decline since March, and other types of installment loans increased $1.8 billion, following two months of declines.

HEADLINE: Whitman Is Criticized For Handling Of Complaint

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
A group of Democratic legislators, all of them women, criticized Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today for her handling of a 1994 sexual harassment complaint against her Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, Gualberto Medina.
In a letter to the Governor, the legislators asked for "full disclosure" of the details of the sexual harassment complaint, which was filed shortly after Mr. Medina was confirmed in January 1994 as Commerce Commissioner. 
 At the time, the Governor's office substantiated the complaint that Mr. Medina made "inappropriate, offensive physical and verbal sexual advances" to a female reporter. But Mrs. Whitman chose to keep Mr. Medina in office, filing a formal, though confidential, reprimand against him and ordering him to seek counseling.
"Your administration's handling of this incident and related matters sends a strong signal to all women employees that their legitimate grievances about sexual harassment will not be fairly addressed," said the letter, which was signed by State Senator Wynona Lipman and Assemblywomen Barbara Buono and Loretta Weinberg. All three of the women are playing leading roles in the campaign of James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for governor.
With just one month to go before the Nov. 4 election, Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, has found herself in the unusual position of being an incumbent woman defending her administration and her party on the issue of sexual harassment. Democrats have also criticized Mrs. Whitman in recent weeks for spending $175,000 in state funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against another top Republican official, Chuck Haytaian, the former speaker of the State Assembly.
In the Medina case, there was no lawsuit filed, and according to the Governor's office, no taxpayer money was spent on the settlement.
Mrs. Whitman today defended her handling of the sexual harassment complaint against Mr. Medina, and urged her Democratic opponents to move the focus of the campaign on to "the real issues."
She also raised questions about the disclosure of the sexual harassment case. It was first reported today in The New York Times after confidential documents about the case were provided by a person who has worked for Democratic officials. "It is now clear that the Democrats will do anything to distract voters from their failed record of job killing and high taxes," Mrs. Whitman said. "The fact that this story was driven by a person identified as having worked for Democratic politicians speaks volumes about its motives."
Mrs. Whitman defended her administration's handling of the matter, saying she was following state guidelines while trying to protect the identity of the woman who filed the complaint. She said that even though Mr. Medina's official swearing-in did not take place until March 30, 1994 -- after she had learned of the complaint against him -- he was already serving as Commissioner, and therefore the state's guidelines on investigating sexual harassment complaints had to be followed.
She said that documents describing the complaint and the reprimand were placed in confidential files in accordance with the state's procedure for protecting victims in such matters. "The tragedy is that in the report that appeared today that woman's name was made public," Mrs. Whitman said.
The woman, Diane Mastrull, who at the time of the incident was a reporter for The Philadelphia Business Journal, is now a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer. She is out of town, and has not returned telephone messages seeking comment. Mr. Medina, who is in Puerto Rico on business, has refused requests for interviews. He did issue a statement on Monday, saying, "I realize I exercised poor judgment."
On March 14, 1994, after the incident occurred, the Governor's Attorney General at the time, Deborah T. Poritz, wrote to Ms. Mastrull and explained several steps that were being taken to discipline Mr. Medina. "These steps are being taken to insure that this unacceptable conduct by the Commissioner does not recur," Ms. Poritz wrote. "It is our understanding that you are comfortable with these steps and that you do not feel that termination of the Commissioner's Office is appropriate or necessary."
Mr. McGreevey did not attend any public events today, but his spokesman, Richard McGrath, seized the opportunity to criticize the Governor's handling of sexual harassment complaints. "This latest revelation of sexual harassment by high officials in the Whitman administration displays a disturbing trend," he said.

HEADLINE: Cuba's Communists Likely to Hold Line

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Revolutionary banners and slogans are posted everywhere, and some 1,800 delegates have already arrived in the capital. After months of preparation that have emphasized ideological discipline and "socialist values" over change, Cuba's Communist Party begins its first congress in six years on Wednesday.
The three-day meeting, sandwiched around the 30th anniversary of the death of the Communist icon Che Guevara, is expected to ratify some changes in the composition of the 225-member Central Committee and the smaller Politburo, the subjects of perhaps the most curiosity to ordinary Cubans and to foreign diplomats and academic specialists. 
 But all indications are that the party intends to hold the line on vital and vexing political and economic issues.
"Everything suggests that the leadership does not want this congress to examine fundamental policies," said Jorge Dominguez, a professor of government at Harvard University who is an expert on Cuban politics. "That does not necessarily mean that nothing of substance will occur, but I am expecting more of a cheerleading effort than a serious discussion."
But at a news conference here today, Esteban Lazo Cardenas, a member of the Politburo and party First Secretary for the capital, argued otherwise, saying, "This is going to be a historic congress, not just because of the moment, but because of what is going to be discussed." He added, though, that "there can be no change of principles."
The tone for the congress, which is closed to the foreign press, has been set by an eight-page platform, made public this spring, that reaffirms Cuba's commitment to a one-party state, saying that "the party is in a better position today than ever to perfect its role as society's guide."
It also calls on Cubans to "strengthen our unity and will to resist" the United States, which it says seeks to "liquidate the Cuban nation and enslave its people."
"In Cuba, there will be no return to capitalism, because the Revolution will never be vanquished," the document says. "The nation will continue alive and will continue to be socialist."
The last party congress was held in October 1991, a time of severe economic dislocation and ideological uncertainty, coming as it did as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Then, more than half of the Central Committee was replaced, with many pre-revolutionary Communists and former guerrilla combatants giving way to younger, less proven people.
Since then, President Fidel Castro has grudgingly allowed the creation of a parallel dollar-based economy and opened Cuba to foreign investment and tourism, initiatives that would have been ideologically unacceptable in the past, to keep the economy afloat. The congress is expected to ratify those changes, but to proceed with great caution regarding further advances.
The Chinese Communist Party, during its own just-concluded party congress, moved decisively to reduce the role of the state in the economy and force government enterprises to stand or fall on their own. At a news conference here Monday, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Minister of the Economy, made clear that no such reforms were in the offing for Cuba.
"Ours continues to be a socialist model, in the sense that the state is not only responsible for the general welfare, but has a leading role" in the economy, Mr. Rodriguez said. Though there is a limited place for private initiative and enterprise, he added, Cuba does not view them as "an essential element to the development of our country."
Like the 770,000 members of the party, ordinary Cubans will also be looking to the conclave for clues as to who will be leading them in the next five years. No changes are expected at the very top, of course: Mr. Castro will remain in charge of both the party and the Government, with his younger brother Raul as his designated successor.
But Mr. Castro, who is 71, has appeared thinner and pallid in public in recent months. As a result, popular interest in who might be groomed for future responsibilities has intensified.
Many diplomats and academic specialists are predicting an enhanced role for Vice President Carlos Lage, who is regarded as a pragmatist.

HEADLINE: G.O.P., Eye on '98, Builds Education Plank

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Stealing a technique from President Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich was using an inner-city school as a backdrop to promote proposals with which Republicans hope to cut into the Democratic advantage on the vote-rich education issue.
In the cheerful yellow library of Hine Junior High School here, Mr. Gingrich posed with teen-age girls and members of the House Republican leadership, then highlighted a series of education bills making their way to the House floor. 
 "We're here today to say we believe the real learning occurs in the local community," he said, his setting a school that has shed its reputation as Horrible Hine to become an education success story. "It's the local students, the local teachers, the local parents."
Mr. Gingrich's appearance at the school, on Monday, was a vivid display of how the Republicans have had to readjust their strategy since the days when their education policy amounted to little more than calling for the abolition of the Department of Education.
When Mr. Clinton, campaigning for re-election last year, suddenly unveiled an array of education initiatives ranging from his support for uniforms in the public schools to his proposal for tax credits for college tuition, the Republicans initially scoffed. But here was Mr. Gingrich promoting an education agenda that the Republicans could call their own, and staging precisely the kind of photo opportunity that Mr. Clinton has made a staple.
"The bind Republicans put themselves in for a while was with the rhetoric 'Let's close the Department of Education,' " said Ed Goeas, a Republican consultant. "If you lead with that, it closes large segments of the public off from thinking you care about education."
That perception is a particular problem for Republicans looking toward the 1998 Congressional elections. Polls show that education is becoming a leading public concern as other issues recede with the continuation of economic prosperity and the end of the cold war. And Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, recently warned his party in an advice manual that in education, "politically and rhetorically Democrats have left us in the dust."
In his State of the Union Message in February, Mr. Clinton called education "my No. 1 priority for the next four years" and proposed a 10-point plan that included plugging classrooms into the Internet, adopting national tests to measure children's performance in reading and math, and increasing Federal assistance to college students.
Riding this agenda during the negotiations that led to the balanced-budget agreement this year, Congressional Democrats portrayed themselves as the defenders of education programs. And every few days they stage another education event, whether it is the showcasing of computers for the classroom or announcement of a drive to create a Federal construction fund for decrepit public schools.
Congressional Republicans are now countering with proposals of their own.
To some extent, their program involves political repackaging. At the heart of their agenda are several proposals for school tuition vouchers, long advanced by Republicans as a way to allow students to opt out of public schools and create competition that would force bad schools to improve. The idea is also thought to have appeal among swing Roman Catholic voters who pay to send their children to parochial schools.
In addition, Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, has tacked on to a spending bill a measure that would turn Federal education aid into block grants free of regulation by the Education Department.
And Congress is expected to vote later this month on another bill, sponsored by Senator Paul Coverdell, Republican of Georgia, that would allow parents to establish special savings accounts that they could use to pay expenses -- as varied as private school tuition and computer purchases -- related to their children's elementary and secondary education. Under the bill, a family could put as much as $2,000 a year into this special account, and all interest would accumulate tax-free.
But it is vouchers that remain the centerpiece of the Republican program. And with some strategists warning that the party could leave itself vulnerable if it appeared to be favoring private schools at the expense of public schools, the Republicans are also putting forth in the next few weeks spending measures that would benefit public-school children. One, for example, would provide grants for reading teachers, and for parents to buy tutorial assistance, a counterpoint to a Clinton proposal to train students in the national service program to act as reading tutors.
Still, the terms of next year's campaign debate over education are already becoming clear, and to a large extent they involve vouchers. Mr. Clinton has accused "some in Congress" of working to "diminish our country's commitment to public education by siphoning badly needed funds away from our public schools into a voucher program that would support private academies" with a "very limited number of students."
Mr. Gingrich has countered with an echo of the old attacks on limousine liberals.
"I think anybody who is going to vote no should send their child to the worst school in their state," the Speaker said. "Don't tell us you have the right to move to the suburbs, you have the right to move to a very small town with a good school system, you have the right to send your child to a private school, but by the way, if you're poor and in public housing, you have no hope."
Although Senator Daniel R. Coats, Republican of Indiana, failed last week in trying to attach a $7 million tuition voucher program for the District of Columbia to a District spending bill, he fell only two votes short of the 60 needed to break a Democratic filibuster. That was a high-water mark for the years-long effort. Republican leaders are vowing to keep the program alive in the House, and it may be passed there later this week.
But the most interesting test for the Republican program may be whether Mr. Coverdell's proposal for education savings accounts can get the extra two votes needed to get past a Democratic filibuster. In July, Mr. Clinton issued a last-minute threat to veto the entire balanced-budget agreement unless the provision was removed. The President's aides say the Coverdell measure is a cousin of tuition vouchers, because the tax revenue lost by the Government might wind up paying for private school tuition.
Mr. Coverdell counters by saying that although parents could use the money in the savings accounts to pay private school tuition, in most cases they would simply supplement their children's public school education, by buying computers or paying for tutors. "If 9 out of 10 students are in public schools today," the Senator said, "then I guess I would assume that 9 out of 10 savings accounts are going to be in support of a public-school child."
Such debates are expected to grow in intensity as Congress pushes to end the session in November. The White House has issued a string of education-related veto threats on spending bills, hoping to fend off voucher programs and push adoption of Mr. Clinton's plan to give school districts standardized tests on fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math.

HEADLINE: New TV Ad For Rowland Shows Voters His Soft Side

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 7

 BODY:
After cultivating a reputation as a conservative Republican who slashed welfare benefits, pushed for a broader death penalty and took on state employee unions, Gov. John G. Rowland today began an effort to highlight his softer side: he cares about children.
More than a year before the gubernatorial election, Mr. Rowland has started to broadcast a television commercial that Democrats are calling the first ad of his campaign. In the 30-second spot, he is shown playing with Legos with youngsters in a nursery school setting and touting his plan to provide health insurance to 90,000 poor children. 
 "To me, there's nothing more important than our children," Mr. Rowland says in the commercial. A subtitle flashes on the screen urging viewers, "Help Our Kids: Support the Husky Plan," a reference to Mr. Rowland's proposal to provide subsidized health insurance to children who are not eligible for Medicaid.
The advertisement started running a day after Mr. Rowland, with the support of Democratic legislators, called for a special legislative session to pass the new plan.
Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, denied that the commercial was politically motivated. "The ads are not directly linked to his re-election campaign," he said. "I'm not denying that it could have some political impact, but it's not part of the strategy."
Mr. Rowland has described the commercial as an effort to build support for his initiative. Yet no one is opposing the Husky Plan, and Democrats supported a similar initiative in March that Mr. Rowland largely ignored.
"If ever there was a clarion call to a nonbattle, this was it," State Senator Kevin Sullivan, the leader of the chamber's Democratic majority, remarked today. "I don't think people have to look too far to understand this is a campaign ad."
Although Mr. Rowland has not officially declared his candidacy, his campaign committee has raised more than $1 million and paid for the commercial.
The commercial seems like a page out of President Clinton's campaign book -- advertising early in the contest so the candidate defines himself before his opponent can.
An incumbent who has cut taxes, restricted welfare benefits and presided over an economic comeback, Mr. Rowland appears to be a strong candidate for re-election. But polls this summer have shown him to be vulnerable, and one Democratic opponent, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, was found to be in a virtual dead heat with him. The polls showed that Mrs. Kennelly did substantially better with women than Mr. Rowland did.
Education and children's health care are likely to be among the top issues for Democrats, and in her opening salvo last month, Mrs. Kennelly repeatedly emphasized her commitment to families.
Connecticut's bid to increase the number of insured children is not singular. Earlier this year, Federal legislation allotted $24 billion to the states to extend health insurance to more children over the next five years. Mr. Rowland's plan would cost about $55 million annually, with $36 million coming from the Federal Government.
Mr. Rowland's proposal includes three initiatives. About 37,000 poor children who do not qualify for Medicaid would be eligible to join a state-subisidized private insurance plan, similar to one offered state employees. The plan would step up efforts to reach another 37,000 children who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled. Mr. Rowland's plan also would accelerate the eligibility of thousands of 17- and 18-year-olds who otherwise would not be able to enroll in Medicaid until July 1.

HEADLINE: Closing of Helium Reserve Raises New Issues

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: AMARILLO, Tex.

 BODY:
Of all the Federal programs that have ever come under attack, perhaps none has been more ridiculed or more reviled than the national helium reserve, here on the high plains of the Texas Panhandle. It is a collection of pipelines and pumps and vats and, most of all, a seemingly staggering amount of helium: 31 billion cubic feet, enough to supply current Federal needs for 100 years.
"Amazingly stupid, even by Government standards," P. J. O'Rourke, the conservative humorist, said of the program, which forces Federal agencies to buy helium at inflated prices from the reserve. "The poster child of Government waste," said Christopher Cox, the California Congressman who led the fight to get rid of this veritable Fort Knox of helium. 
 But now that President Clinton has signed a bill that will get the Government out of the helium business and sell off the nation's helium reserve to private industry, which has long claimed that it can supply helium more cheaply to agencies like NASA, the issue is turning out to be more complicated. In a vivid demonstration that cutting the Federal budget is rarely as easy or as simple as it seems, some experts are even daring to say it: maybe the helium reserve wasn't such a dumb idea after all.
The jury is still out on just how much money will be saved by closing the operation near here, in part because the new law, for reasons that might prove daunting even for a Nobel laureate in economics, still requires the Government to pay an inflated price for helium. In some of the first contracts signed for privately supplied helium, irritated National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials note that the price, around $70 per thousand cubic feet, is roughly the same that they paid for helium from the reserve.
The American Physical Society, a prominent group of physicists, warns that getting rid of the nation's helium stockpile is profoundly shortsighted. Though most people may think of helium as the thing that fills balloons and blimps, it is essential in all kinds of scientific pursuits, including the space program. For future generations, scientists say, it will be vital in the development of superconducting power lines, magnetically levitated trains, new kinds of generators and motors, and technology not yet even dreamed of.
No one is predicting that the Government's helium operation, in tumbleweed country about 25 miles north of Amarillo, will be magically revived. "Everything you see here -- it's all going to go," said Robert Robertson, an operator in the plant's control room. "The death warrant has been signed."
Nonetheless, even a cursory examination of the privatization of the Federal helium program, which the President set into motion when he signed the law a year ago, suggests that so far, instead of saving money, it has led to a messy accounting quandary in which the benefits are not yet clear.
Because the stores here are so large, the law requires that the helium, stored in a massive underground dome, be sold off slowly, over the next two decades, so as not to disrupt prices in the growing world market for helium. And in what, in effect, creates a secondary market in which Government agencies will bid for helium at above-market prices, the helium must be sold at prices that will fully pay off the $1.4 billion "debt" the helium conservation program has accumulated since President John F. Kennedy helped begin it in the 1960's so the nation's space program would have a reliable supply.
But because the debt is actually money that is owed by one Government agency to another, paying it off is basically a paper transaction intended to clear the helium reserve's ledger. The Congressional Budget Office has already ruled that paying off the helium program's debt will not do anything to reduce the national debt, currently at $5.3 trillion or so.
The bottom line, of course, is just how much money the Government will save by buying helium from private suppliers like the Exxon Corporation. Even the Helium Advisory Council, the industry group that has lobbied vigorously for privatization, says it is not easy to calculate the saving, partly because the new law has not yet cleared the way for the true privatization of the helium program, which would mean selling at market prices.
Carl Johnson, chairman of the council, predicts that the closing will save money. But when he was asked just how much taxpayers would save annually and when they would start seeing the saving, he said, "It's a very difficult question, and I don't even know how I would begin to answer it."
Representative Cox, a Republican from Orange County, Calif., who led the crusade to kill the helium program, was more definitive, saying the saving would eventually amount to about $24 million a year: $20 million from the greater efficiencies at private plants, compared with the antiquated complex here, and $4 million from lower helium costs.
But NASA, the main Federal recipient of helium, has yet to save any money because of the privatization.
"We were all in favor of helium privatization, but we missed something here," said Steve Parker, a procurement official at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. "Your question is, are we getting the savings we were promised? That's a no. We're still paying inflated prices for the accrued debt."
Meanwhile, because nobody knows what will happen to the world market price for helium in coming decades, no one can say for sure whether selling off the national reserve is a good idea in the long run.
"What it really boils down to is this: Do you think this is true debt that is costing the American taxpayers, or is it a cost of a strategic decision to conserve crude helium?" said Timothy R. Spisak, general manager of operations of the helium program here. "Remember, you've still got an asset out here, 30 billion cubic feet of helium. If you sell it off, you don't have it anymore."
Colorless, odorless and largely inert, helium is unique among Earth's 100 or so elements because it remains liquid even at just above absolute zero, which is roughly 460 degrees Fahrenheit. That makes it extremely useful as a pressurizer and a coolant.
Robert L. Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and the director of the Washington office of the American Physical Society, said that helium would have vastly increased uses in the future and that selling off the Federal reserve might one day be seen as a catastrophically heedless decision. He urged Congress to find some way to mandate an increase in the size of national reserves, even if they are held by private industry.
The supply-and-demand equation involving helium, which is nonrenewable, is extremely complex. The problem is that helium is a byproduct of natural gas and that it is not always economical for companies to extract it. Currently, only about half of the 6.7 billion cubic feet of helium taken out of the earth each year is separated from natural gas and saved. The rest disappears into the atmosphere.
But critics of the Government reserve program say concerns about the current loss of helium are overblown. They say there is no reason that the future demand for helium cannot be met by private industry, which already supplies 90 percent of the helium used in the United States.
"The physicists are right and more expert on the value to science of helium than any source you could consult," Representative Cox said. "But the physicists are not experts on economics and markets. And a great deal of what's at stake here is the latter and not the former."
In the Texas Panhandle, where the helium operation's staff of 165 will be whittled to a skeleton crew of about three dozen in the next few years, there has long been a sense of local pride in the program and outrage over the national scorn heaped upon it.
"The public's been misinformed," said Trooper Barker, a worker at the plant. "They think it's all some big joke about putting gas in blimps. Well, I've never once had a blimp fly out here and say, 'O.K., fill 'er up.' "
Mr. Barker said that once private industry took over the helium, it would find ways to raise the price, an opinion widely shared in Amarillo.
"If NASA calls tonight and says, 'We need 20 tank cars,' we'll get it out of our plant tonight," said Terry Byrd, the production and maintenance manager, during a tour of the site. "Private industry might charge a premium to do that."
The helium program has had its defenders over the years, but the widespread national criticism has often made them seem to be voices in the wilderness. In a column two years ago, Gregory Curtis, the editor of Texas Monthly magazine, said that the derision was undeserved and that the helium conservation program was "in fact an example of government working at its best." Mr. Curtis said workers and managers at the helium program were "intelligent, efficient and proud of their work, exactly the opposite of the thick and lazy bureaucrats Federal workers are often said to be."
The program has often been on the verge of elimination. In 1993, Bill Sarpalius, a Democrat who was Amarillo's Congressman, persuaded President Clinton to keep the program alive. The President, struggling to gather a majority for his budget bill, spoke to Mr. Sarpalius four times on the day of the vote.
"Sure I talked to the President about helium," Mr. Sarpalius, who was later defeated for re-election, said at the time. "I talk to everyone I can in the Government about helium. And when I had the opportunity to explain to him that this was not really a billion-dollar loss, that this is a program that makes money for the Federal Government, that there's another side to this picture, he was fascinated by it. He was really interested in helium."
Mr. Sarpalius voted with the President, and the program was spared another year.
But in 1996, with a conservative Republican Congressman, William M. Thornberry, now representing Amarillo and sentiment rising against the program, its gradual elimination was approved. Sometime around 2015, all the helium now in the Federal reserve is expected to be owned by private industry.
"There will be savings," said Representative Cox, who is the father of 3- and 4-year-olds. "We won't know how much until my kids are out of college."

Upkeep of a Star

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
In the inflationary battle to hold onto top talent, Disney's ABC has just agreed to increase the paycheck of Tim Allen, star of "Home Improvement," to $1.25 million per episode next year, which will be his and the show's eighth season.
That puts Mr. Allen, who had been making $750,000 per episode, in the same income bracket as Jerry Seinfeld, who makes more than $1 million (it is unclear how much more, because some of his pay comes in NBC stock options). The next highest earners are said to be Mr. Seinfeld's co-stars, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards, at about $600,000 each per episode. 
 Salary envy has spread to the inspirational drama "Touched by an Angel," where Della Reese, the senior angel on the show, says CBS failed to keep a promise to double her current salary (reported to be under $50,000), the way it had doubled the pay of Roma Downey, who though she plays the junior angel is the show's biggest star.
CBS replied in a statement that it was "puzzled" because the network had reduced Ms. Reese's work hours so that she could devote more time to her church (she is an ordained minister) and had offered "to raise her salary by a significant percentage," and that the network hoped to negotiate with her in "good faith" soon.
Meanwhile, the well-paid David Duchovny, the co-stars with Gillian Anderson on Fox's "X-Files," has begun telling people he won't return for another season unless the show transfers to Los Angeles from Vancouver, where it has been produced for all its five years.
He wants to spend more time with his wife, Tea Leoni, whose NBC sitcom "Naked Truth" is produced in Los Angeles. LAWRIE MIFFLIN

HEADLINE: New York Grind

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
"LOOK, I'll be honest with you," Albertina Fiumano was saying one evening recently, standing in her 25th-floor apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, gazing at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. "I'm 100 percent American. This is a great country."
She wasn't talking about the view, the Constitution, the economy, the President or even Columbus Day. She was talking about something equally -- peculiarly -- American: her garbage disposer. 
 Mrs. Fiumano, 78, who calls herself "very particular," was one of more than 200 New York City residents to receive free garbage disposers in a 21-month study of their impact on the municipal sewerage system. On Saturday, this city of tough nuts -- which, by the way, are not recommended for disposers -- officially legalizes this quintessential postwar appliance, this "hunk of better living," as it was once called, for apartments and houses.
The sell is on, as plumbing industry executives and disposer companies, armed with peekaboo kitchen sinks and transparent pipes, try to persuade New Yorkers -- collectively, this week, the archetypal 1950's "Mrs. Consumer" -- to get in synch with modern American civilization.
But some are reluctant. Standing by the shrink-wrapped watermelons at the Fairway market on Broadway, Anne Larsen, the editor of Kirkus Reviews, summed up the city's do-without machismo. "I don't care if they are in New York or Des Moines," she said of disposers. "I don't own a car, a dishwasher, an apartment. Nothing!"
A sort of Tilt-a-Whirl for food, garbage disposers ("Disposall" is a General Electric brand name) grind eggshells, chicken bones and other food to bits. Prone to make gargling sounds -- or thumps when a melon rind comes along -- they must be fed with care. Fibrous foods like celery, artichokes and corn husks are no-no's, though ice cubes and lemon cleanse and scour disposers' palates. (The effects of New York staples like chayote, creme brulee and baby white asparagus are unclear.)
Disposers typically cost $300 to $700 when installed, as required, by a licensed plumber. High-priced designer icons, including a $950 Viking model, are already emerging.
Disposers have been banned in most of the city since the 1970's, owing less to the Glad bag and Hefty lobbies than concerns about the city's aging infrastructure, particularly in neighborhoods with sewer systems that combine sanitary wastes and storm water.
The city's study concluded that disposers would have minimal impact, said Charles Sturcken, chief of staff in the Environmental Protection Department, but the long-range effects will also be monitored. Meanwhile, one company, In-Sink-Erator, is marketing its product as good for the environment, the "safe, sanitary and environmentally sound way to eliminate biodegradable waste."
But some sanitation specialists disagree. "It adds more solids to the system, which makes treatment facilities work harder," said Peter Sattler, an environmental planner for the Interstate Sanitation Commission, which urged the city to keep the ban. "We're talking 13,000 tons a day of household garbage. Unless there is beneficial re-use" -- recycling -- "humans will always contribute to the waste stream."
The boundless promise of the disposer -- "your sink will be clean every minute of the day" -- reflects a throwaway ethos of a bygone era. In the 1920's, similar devices were tested at municipal waste sites, but in the 1950's, they were promoted as the darling of the dream kitchen.
By then, the disposer "symbolized middle class America's obsession with cleanliness and convenience," Suellen Hoy, a historian, writes in her book "Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness" (Oxford, 1995). It reflected postwar prosperity, a belief in the limitlessness of natural resources. (Interviewed by telephone, she was quick to add, "I love my disposal.")
Disposers are nearly unheard of in Europe, noted Susan Strasser, a social historian, who wrote "Never Done: A History of American Housework" (Pantheon, 1982). In 1927, John W. Hammes, a Racine, Wis., architect, began to tinker with tin snips and a soldering iron after watching his wife carry out garbage. He founded the In-Sink-Erator Company in 1938, but his contraption reached few kitchens until after World War II.
As Ms. Strasser put it, "It suited a culture of consumption based on both ever-increasing desires for household appliances and on casual attitudes about throwing things away."
Ruth Schwartz Cowan, a historian at the State University at Stony Brook, N.Y., notes that the labor saved has tended to be of the male variety. "In the stereotypical division of household chores," she said, "it has been the man who takes out the garbage." Which in New York apartments can mean merely strolling down the hall to the chute.
But disposers have insinuated themselves into the affections of some New Yorkers. Wilson Cabrera, who is from Ecuador, sat at his dining table in Bay Ridge with his wife, Susan, who is from Trinidad. They make baby food from scratch for their 6-month-old son and cook goat the Ecuadorean way, in beer.
Mr. Cabrera recalled that in Ecuador, people disposed of their garbage "the natural way": the animals ate it. "It was a poor country," he recalled. "Things were made of what was around. Aluminum foil was re-used, and children rode on big wooden spools used to wrap telephone cable, instead of bicycles."
"At the beginning I was a little skeptical," he said of the disposer he received free as a study volunteer. "But this is a big city, and life is full of garbage."

Greenspan's Comments Push Dollar Lower Against Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the mark yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, roiled financial markets and a report raised concern that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, might soon raise interest rates.
The dollar also fell against the yen in Asian trading after Japanese officials proposed tax cuts aimed at stimulating the economy. 
 In testimony before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that the economy might be unable to keep growing at its current pace without stimulating inflation. Following those remarks, stocks in American markets suffered their worst one-day drop in almost a month and bonds registered their biggest decline in two months.
The selloffs raised concern about global investors shedding assets denominated in dollars.
"Greenspan's comments are having a negative effect on the dollar," said Stephen Gallagher, an economist at Societe Generale. "There are global flows out of the dollar."
The dollar extended its losses against the mark after the German daily Handelsblatt said it would report today that a majority of the Bundesbank's policy makers are prepared to raise interest rates. The Bundesbank council members are scheduled to meet today.
"Until we hear different from the Bundesbank, the report leaves a mystique in the marketplace about a rate rise," said Domenick Presa, chief currency trader at Dresdner Bank. "That adds to what happened after Greenspan's comments. A lot of people bought marks today."
The dollar settled at 1.7485 marks in New York trading, down from 1.7571 marks on Tuesday. The dollar cost 121.05 yen, down from 122.56. The British pound strengthened to $1.6223 from $1.6176.
While most traders did not expect German central bankers to raise rates today, many said they expected an increase by the end of the year. Higher rates would strengthen demand for the mark, which has fallen almost 12 percent against the dollar this year.
The dollar's weakness against the yen reflected remarks in Japan by senior members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, who called for a significant cut in income taxes to stimulate the economy.

Coffee Prices Rise as a Storm Threatens Mexico's Harvest

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices rose yesterday on speculation that a hurricane approaching the Pacific coast of Mexico could cause damage and shipping delays of the country's crop at a time of low inventories and strong demand.
The hurricane "could disrupt the harvest for a couple of weeks," said Carlos Knoepffler, president of the Miami Coffee Merchants Corporation, a coffee importer. 
 Among other commodities, gold -- a traditional hedge against inflation -- rose after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that the economy might be growing rapidly enough to spur inflation. Corn also rose.
The hurricane is expected to bypass Chiapas, home to 32 percent of Mexico's coffee, though it could damage crops in Oaxaca, which produces 19 percent of the crop of four million to five million bags. Mexico is the largest supplier to the United States market, representing more than 20 percent of coffee imports.
Coffee for December delivery rose 4.85 cents, or 3 percent, to $1.67 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. Coffee prices are up 43 percent so far this year.
Gold rose after Mr. Greenspan suggested that a low unemployment rate could push wages and prices higher, creating a setting for inflation. Some investors buy gold when inflation, or the threat of inflation, reduces the value of fixed assets like bonds.
Gold for December delivery rose $2, or six-tenths of a percent, to $335.30 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Corn jumped to a four-and-a-half-month high amid expectations for strong domestic and export demand in the months ahead.
Cattle, hog and poultry populations all are larger than a year ago, according to the Department of Agriculture. As a result, the Government expects domestic demand for feed to rise 4.7 percent, to 5.55 billion bushels during the marketing year that began Sept. 1 from a year earlier. Corn is the primary ingredient in livestock feed.
Corn for December delivery rose 3 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.8275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest for a contract closest to delivery since May 20.

Europeans Reject U.S. Plan On Electronic Cryptography

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The European Commission has rejected proposals by the United States aimed at insuring that police agencies can crack coded messages over telephone and computer networks.
In a lengthy report released today, the European Commission said the American approach could threaten privacy and stifle the growth of electronic commerce and that it might simply be ineffective. 
 The report appears to all but doom efforts by the Clinton Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to establish a global system in which people who use cryptography would have to deposit a "key" for unlocking their codes with an independent outside organization. As envisioned, the police or intelligence agents would be able to use this key once they got court approval to carry out a wiretap. The plan has been vigorously opposed by the computer industry, which fears that it would jeopardize sales to foreign customers.
Because of the Internet's borderless nature, American officials have long acknowledged that their plan is workable only if most other countries adopt similar systems. If not, people could simply route their communications through countries with no restrictions.
The White House had already run into heavy opposition from civil rights groups, the computer industry and Congressional Republicans. And earlier this year, the United States failed to muster any support for its plan from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium backed by more than 40 countries.
But the European Commission's blunt opposition, reported today in The Wall Street Journal, went considerably further, raising a slew of objections to "key recovery" and "key escrow" systems. Among them were these:
*Hackers could find new ways to breach security. "Inevitably, any key access scheme introduces additional ways to break into a cryptographic system," the report said.
*The systems could weaken European data-privacy laws. "Any regulation hindering the use of encryption products," the report said, "hinders the secure and free flow of personal information."
*Even with a "key escrow" or "key recovery" system, criminals cannot be entirely prevented from using strong encryption.
More broadly, the European Commission said, any kind of key-based system could jeopardize the rise of electronic commerce. "If citizens and companies have to fear that their communication and transactions are monitored with the help of key access or similar schemes," the report said, "they may prefer remaining in the anonymous off-line world."
American officials did not disguise their disappointment, and challenged the Europeans to come up with better alternatives.
"I am a little surprised," said William Reinsch, Deputy Secretary of Commerce in charge of export administration. "My question to the European Commission is, where do they think the market is going? Our sense is that corporations engaged in electronic commerce want key recovery in some form, because they want to recover their own records and to monitor their own employees."
Beyond high-minded policy issues, European officials quietly acknowledge that they have political and economic concerns. For one thing, several countries do not like the idea of deferring to an American system that might allow American companies to dominate the next generation of security products.
The German Government, meanwhile, is worried that American authorities might have improper access to data on German users -- possibly violating Germany's tough new laws on data protection.
But the European Union is far from united. Britain has generally sided with the United States in supporting an international system for regulating data encryption.
Indeed, the European Commission remained vague about what alternatives to the American system it might actually favor, nor does the report attempt to block member countries from setting up key-based systems if they want to.
American computer and software companies greeted the European policy declaration as a victory.
"Even the hard-line Governments, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, have said that any cryptography restrictions have to be internationally coordinated because otherwise you can just download material from another country," said Chris Kuner, a lawyer in Frankfurt who represents Netscape Communications and other networking companies in Europe.
"This shows that Europe does not agree with the idea of mandatory key recovery. This idea that that is the only possible regulatory framework for the world has been clearly rejected."

Loading the trade agenda with divisive issues could backfire.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE politics of free trade used to be simple. Exporters and the international-minded political establishment were for it. Unions and industries vulnerable to imports were against it.
Now, you can't tell the players without a scorecard. Organized labor is still manning the barricades. But by shifting the focus from old-fashioned protectionism to new-fashioned concern with human rights and the environment, unions have sown dissension among the free traders. 
 While President Clinton may be inclined to meet the unions halfway, any significant tilt to the left is likely to alienate the Congressional Republicans he needs to win the "fast track" authority critical to negotiating further trade liberalization. Indeed, even academic economists, who give free trade lobbies their intellectual imprimatur, are threatening to jump ship if Mr. Clinton compromises.
Last week some 50 academic trade specialists -- a who's who led by Robert Baldwin of the University of Michigan and Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia -- warned that overloading the trade agenda with divisive new issues could "halt the opening up of world markets."
Mr. Bhagwati was blunter. "Linking human rights and the environment to trade is the lazy man's solution to extremely difficult problems," he argued, "and a recipe for failure all around."
Presidents have had fast-track authority -- that is, discretion to negotiate trade agreements that Congress must vote up or down without amendment -- for the last two decades. And for good reason: without fast track, there can be no effective bargaining with foreign governments since any tentative deal would be subject to death by a thousand amendments in Congress.
That is why those who oppose extending the North American Free Trade Agreement to include other Latin American economies or to another round of global trade liberalization also oppose renewal of fast track. But with a Republican majority in Congress and an open trader in the White House, protectionists don't have the muscle to kill fast track by direct assault.
The politically astute alternative, favored by the House minority leader, Representative Richard Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, is to make common cause with human rights and environmental groups. Mr. Gephardt wants to condition fast-track authority to include minimum labor and environmental standards in any new treaty.
So what's wrong with insisting, say, that Indonesia bar child labor, or that East African farmers leave grazing room for elephants? Some economists argue national sovereignty must be respected at any cost short of turning a blind eye to slavery or genocide. But most oppose burdening the trade agenda on more pragmatic grounds.
For one thing, many Congressional Republicans will not go along because they fear America would have to change its own labor standards -- notably state "right to work" laws -- to conform to the European approach. For another, it would complicate the already difficult problem of piecing together agreements with dozens of interest groups. The Asian tigers, for example, would probably balk at interference in their labor laws.
More important, many economists argue, activists are putting the cart before the horse. Open trade, they say, is the key to rapid income growth in developing areas, and high income leads to adoption of tough social and environmental rules.
Gene Grossman, an economist at Princeton and a signatory to the economists' statement on fast track, has documented this process. Pollution typically rises during early stages of economic development, just as it did in 19th-century Europe. Later, it declines as economies become rich enough to afford clean air and water.
In any case, Mr. Bhagwati argues, there are already escape hatches under World Trade Organization rules for boycotting imports from countries with particularly objectionable social policies. Two-thirds of the members may collectively obtain a waiver from nondiscriminatory import obligations. Or a single nation can just say no to foreigners' practices, blocking imports and accepting limited retaliation by the trade group.
The hard political question here is whether the economists' effort to get the President to stand up to protectionists on labor and environmental standards will make further trade liberalization more or less likely. Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, did not sign the economists' statement because he wanted to give the White House flexibility to cut a deal that allows Congressional Democrats to save face. "A reasonable effort at compromise should be attempted," he concluded.
But Mr. Bhagwati and company fear that fast track has become an end in itself -- that President Clinton will give away the substance to claim political victory. A compromise that advances neither the cause of free trade nor elevated social standards, Mr. Bhagwati argued, "is unworthy of a great nation known for leadership on both."

U.S. Official Assails China On Trade Gap

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, apparently trying his best to sound angry, today attacked China's growing trade imbalance with the United States.
Visiting Beijing for trade talks, Mr. Daley said he tried to pressure China's leaders to open their markets further or do anything that would reverse the widening gap between what China sells to America and what it buys. 
 "The trends have just got to change," Mr. Daley said after meeting President Jiang Zemin. "It's just unacceptable for them to continue this way."
His words, however, essentially repeated complaints that United States officials have made over the last 10 years with little discernible effect, since the imbalance has enlarged. The Commerce Department estimates the trade gap will reach $44 billion this year.
With his trip aimed partly at laying groundwork for President Jiang's meeting with President Clinton in Washington at the end of this month, Mr. Daley was also engaged in some multisided diplomacy that reflected the Clinton Administration's tricky position in China.
On one side, acting as American business's biggest booster, Mr. Daley encouraged Chinese officials to buy American and, more specifically, commit to a pending deal for up to $2 billion of Boeing aircraft.
At the same time, with the Clinton Administration sensitive to accusations it is capitulating to Chinese demands to make sales here, Mr. Daley went out of his way to sound tough, attacking Beijing for keeping out American goods.
"When they're growing at the pathetic pace that they are today," Mr. Daley said, referring to United States exports to China, "we need to see significant change."
China's market is hardly open -- Mr. Daley pointed to distribution controls, import licenses and special product standards as typical barriers -- but as a poor country, it is debatable how many Chinese could afford American products.
Chinese officials contend that the imbalance comes mostly from the huge American demand for China's cheaply made goods, like shoes and toys and electronics, and less from Chinese Government policy. As China's Trade Minister, Wu Yi, put it this week, the imbalance comes from "historical inevitability."
To appease the United States side a bit, Ms. Wu announced today that China would soon send a buying mission to the United States to sign what she called "substantial economic contracts." Failing to identify the timing, value or kind of goods involved, however, suggested that the announcement was largely symbolic.
Mr. Daley acknowledged that the trade dispute was so brittle that neither side could even agree about how to compile trade statistics: The United States counted $40 billion more in imports from China than exports in 1996; China said it only sold $10 billion more than it bought.
Many economists say the true figure lies in between, because each side fudges figures with the trade that passes through Hong Kong. Asked about the discrepancy today, Mr. Daley said trends were important, not specific figures.
But he insisted the Clinton Administration would pursue more trade and cooperation with China.
"Ignoring reality by retreating from the global economy and China's expanding role in it is not an option," Mr. Daley said.
Washington supports China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Mr. Daley said, but only on terms acceptable to the United States and other members. Chinese officials have demanded "developing nation" status that would allow them delays in opening their markets.
Asked about the possibility that China might win permanent most-favored-nation trade status with the United States -- which Beijing has repeatedly demanded -- Mr. Daley said it was unlikely until "we see progress on a whole host of other issues."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chief's Statement

BYLINE: By Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, omitted large portions of his prepared text in his oral testimony yesterday before the House Banking Committee in Washington. He chiefly spoke on long-term budget issues like Social Security and Medicare. But the financial markets reacted to the prepared remarks, which were released yesterday morning. Following are excerpts from his prepared testimony: 
 If the recent two million-plus annual pace of job creation were to continue, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring large numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly. To be sure, job growth slowed significantly in August and September, but it did not slow enough to close, from the demand side alone, the gap of the demand for labor over the supply from increases in the working-age population.
Thus, the performance of the labor markets this year suggests that the economy has been on an unsustainable track. That the marked rate of absorption of potential workers since 1994 has not induced a more dramatic increase in employee compensation per hour and price inflation has come as a major surprise to most analysts. . . .
To be sure, there is still little evidence of wage acceleration. To believe, however, that wage pressures will not intensify as the group of people who are not working, but who would like to, rapidly diminishes, strains credibility. The law of supply and demand has not been repealed. If labor demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply, the question is surely when, not whether, labor costs will escalate more rapidly.
Of course, a fall-off in the current pace of demand for goods and services could close the gap and avoid the emergence of inflationary pressures. So could a sharp improvement in productivity growth, which would reduce the pace of new hiring required to produce a given rate of growth of real output.
Productivity growth in manufacturing, as best we can measure it, apparently did pick up some in the third quarter and the broader measures of productivity growth have exhibited a modest quickening this year. Certainly, the persistence, even acceleration, of commitments to invest in new facilities suggests that the actual profitability of recent past investments, and by extension increased productivity, has already been achieved to some degree rather than being merely prospective.
However, to reduce the recent two million-plus annual rate of job gains to the one million rate consistent with long-term population growth would require, all else equal, a full percentage point increase in the rate of productivity growth. While not inconceivable, such a rapid change is rare in the annals of business history, especially for a mature industrial society of our breadth and scope.
Clearly, impressive new technologies have imparted a sense of change in which previous economic relationships are seen as being less reliable now. Improvements in productivity are possible if worker skills increase, but gains come slowly through experience, education, and on-the-job training. They are also possible as capital substitutes for labor, but that is limited by the state of current technology. Very significant advances in productivity require technological breakthroughs that alter fundamentally the efficiency with which we use our labor and capital resources. But at the cutting edge of technology, where America finds itself, major improvements cannot be produced on demand. New ideas that matter are hard won.
Short of a marked slowing in the demand for goods and services and, hence, labor -- or a degree of acceleration of productivity growth that appears unlikely -- the imbalance between the growth in labor demand and the expansion of potential labor supply of recent years must eventually erode the current state of inflation quiescence and, with it, the solid growth of real activity. . . .
Aside from the question of whether stock prices will rise or fall, it clearly would be unrealistic to look for a continuation of stock market gains of anything like the magnitude of those recorded in the past couple of years.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office has just pointed out a reality: the "balanced budget" is not balanced. And there is little hope that it will become balanced.
The budget office's "Economic and Budget Outlook" states on page 34 that the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, will be $34 billion, the lowest since 1974. The deficit last year was $107 billion. After 2001, the deficit, the office predicts, will be eliminated. 
 A great accomplishment, if these estimates were true. But they are not. These estimates make the deficit appear smaller by including revenue that is intended for other purposes, such as the Social Security trust fund.
The budget office did calculate the deficit with this revenue excluded, and the deficit is much higher for the 1997 fiscal year: $177 billion. The budget will not be balanced after 2001; in fiscal year 2002, there will be a deficit of $161 billion. The budget office predicts that for each of the next 10 years we will spend more than $100 billion more than we receive. The debt will soar to more than $7 trillion dollars by 2008.
When the Government spends more than it receives, not only does the debt increase but so do interest costs on the debt. Interest costs are like taxes -- they can't be avoided, they must be paid.
The tax money that goes to paying the debt and its interest has been increasing by $15 billion a year, taking money away from worthwhile projects like highway and school construction. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for the 1997 fiscal year, the payment of the debt and its interest cost us $358 billion -- almost a billion dollars a day.
I had hoped that this year, with a good economy, we would stay the course: freeze the budget, with no spending increases and no tax cuts. Instead we passed the "balanced budget," which increased spending for the next year by $52 billion and cut taxes or revenues by $95 billion.
Politicians in Washington are congratulating themselves on passing a balanced budget. But there will be a day of reckoning in the next five years. The economy will slow down, and interest rates will rise. And lo and behold, we will find that the balanced budget was nothing but smoke and mirrors.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Favorite Son Wins Top Title

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
North Korea's "Dear Leader," Kim Jong Il, today assumed the country's top leadership post, which had been vacant since the death of his father, the "Great Leader" Kim Il Sung, three years ago. Some experts say they believe the official elevation creates possibilities for changes in North Korea that could reverberate around the Pacific Rim.
Mr. Kim is the globe's least-understood national leader in the world's most mysterious country, presiding over an army that is one of the world's biggest, with tons of chemical weapons and perhaps a few nuclear weapons at its disposal. Now Mr. Kim, who is 55 and has never traveled outside the Communist world, appears to have greater authority to expand a gradual opening-up of his country and develop ties with America if, as some experts believe, that is what he wants to do. 
 "North Korea is now headed for a free-market economy," said Kim Myong Chol, who formerly edited a North Korea-affiliated newspaper in Japan and has ties with members of the leadership in the North Korean capital. "In Kim Jong Il's mind, not everything about capitalism is bad."
Few experts agree that North Korea is headed for a market economy any time soon. But Kim Myong Chol's willingness to make such comments underscores the new currents of thinking that are stirring in North Korea and that may become more evident now that Kim Jong Il has the title of general secretary of the ruling Communist Party.
Some analysts expect modest but important changes in the years ahead, partly out of desperation because of the hunger and economic catastrophe that grips the country. Others emphasize that Kim Jong Il has already been effectively running the country for several years and anticipate little or no change.
But the formal rise to power of Kim Jong Il suggests that the mourning period for the father has now ended, and the younger Mr. Kim has dropped some tantalizing hints that changes may now be in order.
The South Korean Government issued a statement that seemed to express a cautious welcome to Mr. Kim, voicing hope that his election would increase stability in North Korea and lead to improvements in relations between the two countries.
"We've always been aware that North Korea was under the control of Mr. Kim Jong Il before this official announcement," a senior South Korean Government official said today. "But now that he will have the actual post of head of the party, the North Korean Government may be more stable, more responsible and more predictable."
The position of President has also been vacant since the death of Kim Il Sung, and it is unclear whether Kim Jong Il will later assume that post as well.
North Korea is in many ways less a Communist state than a reincarnation of an ancient Korean kingdom, in which the ruler's mandate is based not on political mechanisms but on birthright and Confucian loyalties. Thus while it might have seemed odd elsewhere in the Communist world for a son to inherit power from his father or for the nation's top leadership posts to be left empty for three years after the death of a ruler, both patterns are borrowed directly from Korean history.
Similarly, the Korean press has lately described phenomena like trees blossoming out of season, which to Westerners may seem an odd thing to make a fuss over but is understandable to Korean traditionalists as a sign that the Mandate of Heaven is passing.
"On the morning of Sept. 22, fishermen of the fishery station in Rajin-Sonbong City caught a 10-centimeter long white sea cucumber while fishing on the waters off Chongjin," the official New Korea News Agency reported. "They said the rare white sea cucumber has come to hail the auspicious event of electing comrade Kim Jong Il as party general secretary."
"Seeing the mysterious natural phenomena," the agency continued, "Koreans say comrade Kim Jong Il is indeed the greatest of great men produced by Heaven and that flowers come into bloom to mark the great event."
Mr. Kim has often been portrayed, particularly by South Koreans, as little more than a playboy terrorist with a passion for films. But some scholars say that Kim Jong Il has a more serious side, and in the last few years he has presided over a modest economic liberalization, with invitations for foreign investment and a growing number of private markets emerging in the countryside for food and clothing.
In a remarkable series of tape recordings smuggled out of North Korea, Mr. Kim can be heard admitting that centrally planned economies do not work as well as the market. Moreover, in a major essay published in August -- largely ignored because it was long, dreary and full of slogans -- Mr. Kim gave the clearest indication that he might pursue more flexible policies.
"Improving the relations between the North and the South is an urgent requirement," Mr. Kim wrote. He called for putting into effect long-frozen accords between the two Koreas and expressed willingness to negotiate with South Korea and also improve relations with Japan and the United States.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Remarks Roil Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The stock and bond markets fell sharply yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that they should not assume interest rates will remain low for some time to come.
The remarks caught investors and traders off guard, especially in the interest-rate-sensitive bond market. Though stock prices recovered a bit, bonds suffered the biggest one-day drop in more than two months. 
 In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan warned that a shrinking labor market coupled with rising demand for skilled workers could push wages higher and fuel inflation. That would force the Fed to raise the target on its short-term interest rate.
However, many analysts viewed Mr. Greenspan's comments as a warning rather than a strong indication that the Fed will raise interest rates at either its November or December meetings.
They also said the Fed chairman was trying to remind investors that the recent strong rallies in stocks and bonds cannot last forever. Some characterized his reminder as gentler than the one he delivered last December, when he asked whether the market rally then was a sign of "irrational exuberance."
The stock market may have taken a similar view yesterday. Although the Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 126.72 points during the session, a modest rebound left the index off 83.25 points, or 1 percent, at 8,095.06.
While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished lower, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 4.50 points, finishing at 1,741.77, another new high. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller companies fell 0.12 point, to 463.66.
The S.& P. 500 closed at 973.84, down 9.28 points.
In the bond market, which is more vulnerable to negative comments from the Federal Reserve, there was no recovery from its immediate selloff after Mr. Greenspan began testifying at 10 A.M.
The 30-year bond tumbled 1 24/32, to a price of 100 4/32, the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 1. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.36 percent, from 6.23 percent on Tuesday. Bondholders lost about $17.50 for every $1,000 invested.
"I think he wants to warn people that he may have to do something," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company in New York, speaking of the possibility of an increase in interest rates.
"Remember, this is the man who didn't like the market 20 percent ago," Mr. Pradilla added.
Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A., a financial consulting firm, said the bond market fell so sharply because many investors and analysts had begun to assume the Fed would not raise rates until sometime next year, if at all. This assumption became more widely accepted after August and September job growth turned out weaker than expected.
"The market having already priced out the prospect of a rate hike until June was caught completely by surprise," Mr. Stiles said.
But analysts also said that even if the Fed decided to lift interest rates next month, that increase should not halt the economy's growth.
"The bull market is far from over," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. Although Mr. Rice said he thought the stock market was overvalued and could fall as much as 10 percent, it should resume climbing. But some saw reason to pause in Mr. Greenspan's comments.
"I do think there is something to what the chairman is saying," said Cliff Waldman, an economist with the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association for more than 600,000 small companies.
According to a federation survey conducted in September, 17 percent of small-business owners said that finding qualified workers was their main problem, ahead of taxes and regulations. That percentage is near a high of 18 percent seen in August and comes when hiring plans are at an all-time high, Mr. Waldman said.
As a result, these companies may be forced to increase prices or decrease hiring plans, he said.
"What he's saying is not out of the ball park," Mr. Waldman said. "If the continued run-up in financial assets is because investors are betting inflation is all but dead, that bet's becoming a little riskier."
In trading yesterday, technology issues bucked the overall decline.
Gateway 2000 moved up 4 3/16, to 34; Microsoft inched up 2 1/2, to 139, and Texas Instruments rose 4 3/4, to 137 5/8.
While Mr. Greenspan's concern about inflation jolted both the stock and bond markets yesterday, it may have provided the backdrop the Treasury needed to auction $8 billion of Treasury Inflation Protection Securities.
The sale was a reopening of the Government's five-year inflation protection securities, first sold in July. They were sold yesterday at a high yield of 3.60 percent, below the 3.65 percent expected.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of Inflation Protection Securities:

HEADLINE: Ford Planning To Spin Off Lending Unit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to persuade investors that its stock is undervalued, the Ford Motor Company said late today that it would distribute to shareholders its 80.7 percent stake in its highly profitable consumer and commercial lending unit, handing out shares in the Associates First Capital Corporation worth nearly $18 billion.
Ford executives have long contended that the stock market has failed to account for the auto maker's valuable financial businesses in allowing Ford stock to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio just half that of the overall market. The nearly $18 billion in Associates shares to be spun off now represent a third of Ford's market value of $57.6 billion, yet Ford's earnings from its stake in the Associates made up just 7.8 percent of its second-quarter profits. 
 "We believe the market value of the Associates is neither fully nor consistently reflected in Ford's stock price," said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive. "Because the market views Ford as an automotive company, it has not fully recognized or rewarded us for our diversification in nonautomotive financial services businesses."
But the spinoff, one of the biggest in corporate history, would leave Ford even more dependent on the highly cyclical automotive business. The Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered Ford's corporate credit rating and its senior debt rating to A from A+ tonight, while affirming its commercial paper rating at A-1. The Chrysler Corporation already had an A rating, while the General Motors Corporation has an A- rating.
Moody's Investors Service reaffirmed Ford's credit rating at A1.
Scott Sprinzen, a managing director at S.& P., said that Ford's valuable stake in the Associates had given bondholders more reassurance until now that they would be repaid even if the automotive business ran into serious difficulty. "This very valuable asset will no longer be there for bondholders," he said, adding that the credit downgrade reflected about $80 billion of Ford's $164 billion in outstanding stock.
But Ford's immense cash reserves, which stood at $18.18 billion on June 30, still provide bond investors with considerable reassurance, he added.
Analysts still welcomed Ford's move. "This is something that was at the top of the wish list for shareholders," said Scott Merlis, the president of Merlis Automotive International Inc., an investment banking and research firm in Westport, Conn.
Ford can partly offset the effects of any recession in the United States by continuing to expand its car sales overseas, Mr. Merlis said. "Associates was not big enough as a percentage of total earnings to totally offset a downturn anyway," he said.
The spinoff will require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that it is tax-free to shareholders, which could take several months. Ford said that its plan would be to distribute roughly one share of Associates stock for every four shares of Ford stock.
The announcement was made after the close of trading. Ford shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $48.25, and hit a 52-week high during the day of $48.6875. Associates shares climbed 87.5 cents to close at $64.
Ford acquired Associates for $3.35 billion in 1989. It received $1.9 billion in an initial public offering in May 1996 of 19.3 percent of the Associates shares.
Ford earned $197 million in the second quarter from its stake in Associates, or 7.8 percent of Ford's total second-quarter earnings of $2.53 billion.
Mr. Trotman said today that Ford planned to maintain its dividend at the current level of 42 cents a share. With the absence of Associates' earnings, this could mean that Ford would pay out a higher percentage of its automotive earnings, unless these earnings rose sharply.
Associates, which is based in Dallas, has been the target of some criticism this year from consumer advocates who contend that it charges excessively high interest rates to low-income borrowers. The finance company has denied any wrongdoing and has said that such criticisms were inevitable in the consumer lending business.
Mel Stephens, a Ford spokesman, said that the criticism was unrelated to Ford's decision to spin off the rest of Associates.
Huge spinoffs have become increasingly popular in corporate America, as institutional investors have decided to diversify their portfolios by buying stock in many companies in different industries instead of a few diversified companies.
Ford has already held an initial public offering this year for nearly a fifth of the Hertz Corporation, while G.M. is expected to sell a 20 percent stake in its auto parts subsidiary, Delphi, as soon as next year and perhaps the rest of the subsidiary later. G.M. also cut loose the Electronic Data Systems Corporation last year, which previously traded as a special class of G.M. stock.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Cautions on Inflation; Change in Tone a Jolt to Investors

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned today that inflation might be on the horizon, jolting investors who had grown used to the ideal economic conditions of the last year and increasing the chances that the central bank might soon raise interest rates.
His caution signal was seen by analysts and in the financial markets as an abrupt change of tone and emphasis. For much of this year Mr. Greenspan has cautiously backed the view that technological advances and other factors have improved the economy's capacity to hold off inflation despite a run of strong growth and a decline in unemployment to near a quarter-century low. 
 Mr. Greenspan's statements blindsided Wall Street, where evidence that the economy is on an even keel had sent stock prices back up to near record levels in recent days. Stock prices plunged immediately after release this morning of his remarks prepared for a Congressional committee and recovered considerably, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 8,095.06, down 83.25 for the day. Bond prices dropped sharply and the dollar fell. Markets in much of the rest of the world also fell.
Economists, many of whom had been predicting that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year since there are few visible signs of inflation, said it was now possible that the central bank would raise rates as soon as its next meeting, on Nov. 12. That would increase borrowing costs, putting the brakes on the economy in an effort to keep inflation from accelerating.
Mr. Greenspan, whose suggestion that investors might be suffering from "irrational exuberance" had rocked markets around the world last year, also sent shudders through Wall Street today with a reminder that the bull market would have to cool off eventually.
"Aside from the question of whether stock prices will rise or fall, it clearly would be unrealistic to look for a continuation of stock market gains of anything like the magnitude of those recorded in the past couple of years," Mr. Greenspan said.
Though Mr. Greenspan's comments on the risk of inflation made up a substantial portion of his prepared testimony to the House Budget Committee, in his oral remarks to the committee he concentrated on the failure of Congress to take advantage of the strong economy and make more progress on politically painful issues like the need to overhaul Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Greenspan also questioned whether the Federal Government could follow through on its plan to balance the budget by 2002, warning that a lack of political will to follow through with planned spending cuts or a willingness to adopt overly optimistic economic assumptions could land the country to a fiscal mess.
The Federal Reserve last raised rates in March, when it pushed its Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent. It has left monetary policy unchanged at four meetings since then, despite signs that growth continued to run considerably higher than the 2.2 percent or so that is widely seen as the Fed's "speed limit."
Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities, said Mr. Greenspan was "splashing a little cold water in the face of this bullish market trend" and reminding investors not to indulge in overoptimism.
"It doesn't mean a big new problem has been uncovered, nor does it necessarily mean the Fed will change monetary policy," Mr. Rippe said. "But it does serve to remind us that there are some risks in the picture and that some of the trends may not be sustainable."
Mr. Greenspan's testimony comes as economists, including those within the central bank, are debating whether huge investments by American business in technology are yielding as-yet-unrecorded gains in productivity, allowing companies to absorb cost increases without passing them along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Over the last year Mr. Greenspan has become the most influental supporter of the idea that something basic has changed, although he has hedged his support for the notion of the "new economy" by saying that its effects might be limited and that it did not mean that inflation was no longer a threat. Still, his public flirtation with the idea has been one reason for the optimism in the financial markets, analysts said.
Mr. Greenspan gave no indication that he was abandoning his views about technology and productivity. But in a clear shift of emphasis, Mr. Greenspan emphasized the most traditional of economic rules, that continued reductions in unemployment would lead eventually to higher wages and then higher prices.
The root of the problem, Mr. Greenspan said, is a situation that is in other ways welcome: the country is running out of new workers.
He said the robust pace of job creation had pushed unemployment so low that unless the economy cooled off employers would have to begin offering higher wages to attract the workers they need. While workers would applaud higher wages, especially after eight years in which inflation-adjusted pay has declined, rising labor costs typically ignite a cycle that leads to higher prices and endangers the economy's ability to continue growing. The unemployment rate in September was 4.9 percent.
"If the recent two-million-plus annual pace of job creation were to continue, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring large numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly," Mr. Greenspan said. "To be sure, job growth slowed significantly in August and September, but it did not slow enough" to eliminate the risk of a wage and price upward spiral.
If demand for labor continues to exceed supply, it "must eventually erode the current state of inflation quiesence and, with it, the solid growth" that the economy has been enjoying, Mr. Greenspan said.
"To be sure, there is still little evidence of wage acceleration," Mr. Greenspan said. "To believe, however, that wage pressures will not intensify as the group of people who are not working, but who would like to, rapidly diminishes, strains credibility. The law of supply and demand has not been repealed."
Mr. Greenspan's comments were particularly surprising to economists because the most recent round of economic statistics -- especially a report last Friday that job growth in September was lower than expected -- indicated that the economy was slowing on its own.
"The standard interpretation of the last employment report was that it showed some slowdown in the demand for labor and perhaps in the economy," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Greenspan's comments seemed to dispel those notions. There's a growing sentiment on the Federal Open Market Committee that the Fed is going to have to do something soon and the economy is unlikely to slow down enough on its own to reduce inflationary pressures."

Greenspan Jars Markets With Warning on Inflation
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that inflation might be on the horizon, jolting investors who had grown used to the ideal economic conditions of the last year and increasing the chances that the central bank might soon raise interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks were surprising because for much of this year he had cautiously backed the view that technological advances and other factors had improved the economy's capacity to hold off inflation despite strong growth. Page A1. 

Stock and bond prices fell sharply after Mr. Greenspan's remarks, though share prices rebounded somewhat as some analysts viewed his comments as simply a caution about high valuations and not necessarily an indication that a rate increase was imminent. The Dow industrials, down as much as 126.72 points during the day, ended 83.25 lower at 8095.06. The movement was more pronounced in the Treasury market, where the 30-year bond yield jumped to 6.36 percent from 6.23. D10.

RUTH W. MESSINGER
In a speech to the Fifth Avenue Association, a group of Manhattan business leaders, at the Waldorf-Astoria: 
 "What really works is to have fewer poor people, so we don't have to spend as much to meet their needs. And I think we do that by growing and diversifying the economy of this city more than we have, and by using the leverage of government along with the business community to create jobs for more people who are looking for work. What does that mean? It means less sole reliance on Wall Street as the only economic engine driving this city, because that engine is not pulling enough trains. Too many of our chips are on Wall Street. Wall Street does many things that enhance its own profits. In some ways, the city benefits -- that is clearly the source of the surplus that the city had to spend in the last year. But in some ways the city has new problems with large Wall Street businesses."

HEADLINE: Messinger Vows Help for Small Businesses

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Declaring that "we have a job crisis in New York City," Ruth W. Messinger outlined an economic development strategy yesterday that would direct tax breaks and other municipal assistance to small businesses, which she said were best positioned to generate jobs and put more city residents to work.
Ms. Messinger, the Democratic candidate for mayor, said she would eliminate the commercial rent tax, which applies to businesses south of 96th Street in Manhattan, cut the unincorporated business tax and seek to lower the sales tax. She also said she would make it easier for small businesses to get loans. 
 Speaking to about 250 members of the Fifth Avenue Association, a Manhattan business group, at a luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria, Ms. Messinger warned that Wall Street "is the only economic engine driving this city" and that "too many of our chips are on Wall Street." She said that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had given too many tax breaks to big corporations and said that, as mayor, she would concentrate on businesses with fewer than 100 employees.
Ms. Messinger derided Mr. Giuliani for what she called his failure to address the city's 9.5 percent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national average.
"With this high number of people unemployed, we are becoming increasingly a city of the very rich and the very poor," Ms. Messinger said.
"I have talked over the last several months about the things that I think we need to do to help individual people in need," she said. "I am not going to go through any of those issues now because in many ways, those are only stopgap issues. What really works is to have fewer poor people, so we don't have to spend as much to meet their needs. I think we do that by growing and diversifying the economy of this city more than we have."
She said she would require all businesses that receive city tax abatements or that win city contracts to guarantee that a majority of their new employees were New York City residents. She pledged a particular emphasis on emerging industries, like biomedical technology and advanced computer software.
Ms. Messinger vowed to create an office of science, technology, higher education and medical research "to help both the new small firms in those fields and the older more established institutions that show some promise of being able to build and expand. Because I think that's where jobs will be in the next century."
Fran Reiter, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, also addressed the Fifth Avenue Association luncheon, telling the group of business leaders that the Mayor's tax breaks for large corporations had saved tens of thousands of jobs.

Income Gap Widens

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
The gap between New Jersey's well-to-do and lower-income residents widened during the first half of the decade, according to a Rutgers University study released yesterday.
Between 1990 and 1995, the average wage for the state's low-wage earners slipped nearly $1 an hour, to $7.25, said Leslie McCall, an associate professor of sociology at Rutgers and a co-author of the study. 
 The average wage for the top 10 percent of wage earners climbed 90 cents, to $28.58 an hour, over the same period.
The figures complicated what otherwise appeared to be a rosy employment picture; from the end of the last recession in 1992 through 1996, the state has seen a net gain of 180,000 jobs, she said.
"We can't any longer assume that with job growth we're going to see wage growth," said Ms. McCall, who noted that many of the new jobs were at the low-wage end of the service sector.

Refugees Are Being Killed In Congo, U.N. Report Says
A report by two human rights groups says there is irrefutable evidence that the troops of President Laurent Kabila of Congo have killed large numbers of civilian refugees since last fall and that the killings have not stopped. Mr. Kabila has been blocking United Nations efforts to investigate sites in several parts of the Congo, formerly Zaire, where thousands of Hutu refugees from Rwanda are thought to have been killed and buried in common graves. A14
 
Hutu Attack in Western Rwanda
More than 1,000 Hutu guerrillas attacked a border town in western Rwanda, battling Government forces for seven hours before retreating, Rwandan military officials and aid workers said. At least 80 insurgents and two government soldiers were killed, a Rwandan officer said. Hutu militia have mounted larger, better organized attacks since May. A15 

Official List of Terrorists
Under a Congressional mandate, the State Department designated 30 groups as foreign terrorist organizations, making it illegal to provide funds for them and denying their members visas to enter the United States. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the goal was to make the country "fully a no-support-for-terrorism zone." A13
 
Reporter Freed in Belarus
Belarus has freed a reporter for a Russian television network who had been imprisoned since July for illegally trying to cross the border with Lithuania. President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, often described as an autocrat, has been unhappy with Russian journalists because Russian television, which is free of censorship, reaches much of his country. A5
 
Vichy Trial Begins in France
Maurice Papon, the highest-ranking official of occupied France to face charges of complicity in German crimes against humanity, went on trial behind a bullet-proof plastic shield in a crowded Bordeaux courtroom. Accused of having sent 1,560 Jews to Auschwitz, the 87-year-old defendant has said he did not know that few of them would ever return. A3
 
'Dear Leader' Takes Top Post
North Korea's "Dear Leader," Kim Jong Il, 55, assumed the country's top leadership post, which had been vacant three years, since the death of his father, the "Great Leader" Kim Il Sung. Mr. Kim has been described as a playboy terrorist with a passion for films, but some scholars believe he may become a force for liberal change. A rare white sea cucumber caught last month was held to indicate these were auspicious times for Mr. Kim. A10
 
Canadian Wilderness Protected
The provincial government of British Columbia reached an agreement with environmentalists, oil and mining companies and Indian groups to safeguard more than 10 million acres of nearly untouched wilderness in the northern Rocky Mountains. The core 2.5 million acres of the Muskwa-Kechika area will be safe from all development. A7

Clinton Defends His Record On Campaign Fund-Raising
President Clinton, hoping to calm the political tempest over belatedly discovered White House videotapes of his meetings with Democratic donors, defended his fund-raising practices. Mr. Clinton rejected the latest Congressional suggestions, mostly by Republicans, that the appointment of an outside counsel was the only way to ensure a credible investigation into those practices. A1
 
House Passes Abortion Curb
The House approved by a wide margin a ban on a form of late-term abortion that opponents see as violent, unnecessary and a political vulnerability of those who defend abortion rights. President Clinton, who vetoed the measure once before, has promised to do so again. A1
 
Gun Makers to Add Safeguard
Most of the manufacturers of handguns in the United States have agreed to install child-safety locks by the end of next year at the urging of President Clinton, a senior White House official and a representative of the gun makers said. A1

HEADLINE: AIDS Research in Africa: Juggling Risks and Hopes

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Cecile Guede, a 23-year-old H.I.V.-infected mother and patient in an American-financed AIDS treatment experiment here, doesn't yet know if the disease has spared her year-old son.
Like scores of other women who have taken part in the same tests, she has no idea whether she received medicine or a dummy pill. And she may never be told. 
 It is now more than a year since she took pills prescribed to her in the program meant to determine the effectiveness of a short course of the anti-AIDS drug AZT in preventing pregnant mothers from passing the virus to their children.
A longer treatment with the drug is known to significantly reduce the rate of transmission of the virus from mother to baby, but the cost and complexity make it prohibitive in the third world. That is why tests to determine the effectiveness of various lower levels of the drug have been conducted here, the Dominican Republic and Thailand. The use of placebos in these tests, however, has set off a furor among medical ethicists in the West.
Ms. Guede, however, still does not quite grasp -- even after repeated questioning -- what exactly a placebo is or why she might have been given that instead of a real medicine.
"They gave me a bunch of pills to take, and told me how to take them" said the woman, who is illiterate. "Some were for malaria, some were for fevers, and some were supposed to be for the virus. I knew that there were different kinds, but I figured that if one of them didn't work against AIDS, then one of the other ones would."
For Ms. Guede, the reason to enroll in the study last year was clear: it offered her and her infant free health care and a hope to shield her baby from deadly infection. Unmarried and unemployed, this new mother, like many others, said the prospect of help as she brought her baby into the world made taking part in the experiment all but irresistible.
Still, the question of whether she and other pregnant women knew the implications of consenting to a placebo test hangs over the project, which is financed by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. It has set off a raging debate over medical ethics in the United States but has barely raised a ripple in this poor West African country of 11 million.
In the United States, tests of intensive treatment with AZT, known as the 076 regimen, and comparing the drug's effects with those of placebos ended in 1994 once it was shown that the drug sharply reduced transmission of the virus from mothers to their babies. It would be virtually impossible, doctors say, to receive approval for tests in the United States on AIDS-infected mothers using placebos now that the 076 regimen has been proved effective.
But other medical ethicists argue differently: There is no question of 076 being adopted in Africa because of its high cost, they say, and that is precisely why a low-cost method is needed. Some people say the best way to do that is to compare different low-cost methods, with no placebo group, but others say this would take longer and be less reliable.
"We cannot afford the 076 regimen," said Dr. Rene Anatole Ehounou Ekpini, a local health-care worker employed in the program.
"We already know what the alternative is to what we are doing," said Dr. Ekpini, who spoke in the simple state-run maternal and infant-care clinic in Koumassi, a working-class district Abidjan where the trials are being conducted. "The alternative is giving everyone here the placebo treatment, because if you step outside, that is what pregnant women with the disease are getting here: nothing."
In the United States, proponents of the AZT trials have said that the women who take part are willing volunteers who knowingly accept the risks.
But extended interviews with a handful of the women, made available to a reporter by the researchers, made it clear that despite repeated explanations, the understanding of these mostly poor and scantily educated subjects does not match the complexity of the ethical and scientific issues involved.
Social workers and nurses employed in the experiment do brief potential subjects about the nature of the testing program. A session in which one H.I.V.-positive woman was invited to take part showed just how quickly the details of the testing are disposed with.
Minutes after she was informed for the first time that she carried the virus, one pregnant woman, Siata Ouattara, still visibly shaken by the news, was quickly walked through the details of the tests, as well as general advice about maintaining her health and protecting others from acquiring the disease.
In less than five minutes, in which the previously unknown concept of a placebo was briefly mentioned, the session was over, and Ms. Ouattara, unemployed and illiterate, had agreed to take part in the tests. Asked what had persuaded her to do so, she responded, "The medical care that they are promising me."
One of the most highly educated of the women who spoke to a reporter, a 31-year-old single mother with a degree in law who gave her name only as Nicole, said she had never been made to understand that the medicine being tested, AZT, was already known to stop transmission of the virus during pregnancy.
"I am not sure that I understood all of this so well," Nicole said. "But there were some medicines that they said might protect the mother and the child, and they wanted to follow the evolution of my pregnancy and the effectiveness of the treatment."
Pressed further, Nicole, like the other mothers, said that she had not been told the results of blood tests on her 1-year-old.
Asked how she would feel if she learned tomorrow that she had received a placebo when a proven treatment existed, Nicole's tone changed abruptly. "I would say quite simply that that is an injustice," she said.
Then, regathering her composure, Nicole posed the problem another way. "At the time they explained this to me, I asked myself the simple question of whether I had any choice," she said. "As long as there was a possibility to save my daughter, I had to try."
For other mothers who took part in the test, the confusion was far more profound. Some acknowledged that they understood little.
"I don't remember exactly what they told me," said Valerie, a frail 28-year-old seamstress. "They said that it would help my child, and that it would ease my childbirth too."
Several Ivorian doctors objected to the ethical questions being raised over the tests, saying outsiders consider Africans incapable of weighing their own interests.
"One has the impression that foreigners think that once white people arrive here, they can impose what they want and we just accept it in ignorance," said Dr. Toussaint Sibailly, one of the doctors in the project. "If that was once the case, those days are long past."
Still, though the testing here was reviewed and approved by an official Ivory Coast board of ethics, a senior health official seemed surprised when told that a test like the one underway in Abidjan could probably not take place in the United States.
"If the country that is paying for the study cannot accept conducting it, then we can't be expected to accept it either," said Dr. Issa Malick Coulibaly, the senior health official with oversight over the AZT research.
An American scientist with the project said later that the Ivory Coast had never been told that this type of research could be performed in the United States, only that the experiment was designed according to the strictest American and international standards for medical research. American scientists involved in the experiments were told by the United States Embassy not to speak on the record about their work.
The women taking part in the study seemed to have a sense of obligation when they were told that the trials are meant to find an affordable drug regimen that can save tens of thousands of lives in the future.
"If the scientists say that it has to be this way, then I can only agree with them," said a mother named Salimata, who spoke as she clutched her tiny 4-month-old daughter. "People are trying to help us, and if a bunch of people have to die first, I am ready to risk my life too, so that other women and their babies can survive.
"If I got the placebo, that will hurt, for sure. But there is no evil involved."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN FINANCE: LITIGATION;
Largest Fine To Be Paid For Donation

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
A Pennsylvania landfill company agreed today to pay an $8 million fine, the highest penalty ever for a campaign-finance violation, in connection with a scheme to funnel $129,000 in illegal campaign contributions to 10 political candidates, a Federal prosecutor said tonight.
The company, Empire Sanitary Landfill, agreed to the fine in pleading guilty to the conspiracy before Judge Thomas Venaski of Federal District Court in Scranton, Pa., said David A. Barasch, the United States Attorney in Harrisburg. 
 The plea sets the stage for the trials of six men on scores of felony and misdemeanor counts that could bring long prison terms and heavy fines on conviction, Mr. Barasch said. The six are charged in a separate 140-count indictment accusing them of making the illegal donations, including to the campaigns of Bob Dole and President Clinton in the last election, and then covering them up, Mr. Barasch said.
The Dole Presidential campaign was the biggest beneficiary of the Empire scheme, receiving $80,000 in April and May 1995, while the Clinton-Gore campaign got $10,000 in September 1995, Mr. Barasch said.
He emphasized that there was no evidence that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole or any of the other recipients had any inkling that they were getting illegal money in the scheme, which was first reported today in The Washington Post. Mr. Barasch said some campaigns had returned it some time ago but that representatives of two others, whom he declined to name, had called him in the last two days, belatedly wanting to know where to refund the money.
"I told them to talk to their lawyers," Mr. Barasch said.
Those indicted were Renato P. Mariani, former owner and president of Empire; Alan Stephens, a former officer; two other company officials, Michael Serafini and Leo Del Serra; Frank Serafini, Michael's uncle and a Republican State Representative from Lackawanna, and Robert Giglio, a plumbing contractor who had done work for Empire.
Frank Serafini and Mr. Giglio are accused only of perjury in their grand jury testimony, Mr. Barasch said. They are accused of trying to hide their knowledge of the larger web of payments, repayments and disguised payments, he said.
Typically, Mr. Barasch said, Empire workers would be told to bring in a check to make a campaign contribution. They would, and they would be reimbursed, either out of disguised corporate funds or out of Michael Serafini's personal account, Mr. Barasch said. Some of the contributions were made while Empire was lobbying in connection with a trash-transportation bill in Congress in which the company had a keen interest, he said.
Mr. Barasch said other campaigns that unwittingly received illicit money included those of Senators Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum, both Pennsylvania Republicans; Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Representative Bill Paxon, Republican of New York.
Empire was acquired in December 1996 by USA Waste Services, a Houston disposal giant, which has agreed to pay the $8 million fine, Mr. Barasch said.
Frank Serafini's lawyer, Sal Cognetti, said his client would fight the charges, which were based in part on "responses to ambiguous questions."
Trial dates have not been set.

HEADLINE: Weekend Excursion;
Beside the Hudson, The Lure of Art

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.Y.

 BODY:
"You notice that I write in an absent-minded sort of way, crossing out and inserting words," the Hudson River landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church wrote in 1891 to a friend from Olana, his home near here. "Well, it is owing to the magnificent effects this morning. The beautiful clouds, and opalescent atmosphere, and lovely tints in the landscape, distract me everywhere."
Church, Thomas Cole and the other painters of the Hudson River School were drawn to the area by the grand vistas of the river and its headlands, by the dramatic sky and particularly by the light, which seemed, especially in summer, to lie upon the landscape in a pinkish haze. Sanford Robinson Gifford, a well-known Luminist painter who lived in the city of Hudson, made it his life's work to study the effect of this light on the atmosphere, the river and the mountains of the region. 
 A century later, artists are returning to the Hudson Valley, many of them refugees from New York City. They are attracted by the landscape and the pink light and by the lower rents fostered by community leaders seeking to revitalize the area as a cultural showplace.
Some artists keep weekend homes in the area. Ellsworth Kelly has a house in Spencertown; William Wegman, in Ghent. The Russian expatriate artist Mihail Chemiakin lives full time in Claverack. Others have begun to take studio space in the small city of Hudson itself (population 8,034), the hub of this growing artistic realm, and they are creating a community that in many ways resembles that of the North Fork of Long Island in the 1950's and 60's, when Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and other artists made their homes here.
Painters and sculptors have begun to rent studio space in Hudson's fine old crumbling buildings alongside the antiques dealers who have taken root there in recent years. Richard Artschwager rents a house, which he uses part time, on Union Street. Edward Avedisian lives on Warren Street. The photographer Lynn Davis has a house on Fourth Street.
And art galleries have begun to spring up in the city's vacant storefronts, including the Carrie Haddad Gallery, one of the first to arrive, and Kendall Art and Design; both show contemporary art. There are also two ceramicists' studios and the Hudson Valley Arts Center, which offers arts and crafts. Along with the artists have come renovations and new restaurants: the Charleston, the Cascades, the Paramount Grill, Earth Foods, and Oasis, a coffee shop.
 
An Arts Walk
 In recognition of its growing stature as an artistic center, Hudson will put its artists and their work on display over the Columbus Day weekend, when it holds its third annual Arts Walk on Oct. 12 and 13. Proceeds will help raise money to purchase public art for the city. At 46 sites, all along Warren Street, in the vacant storefronts and in the new galleries that have sprung up, there will be exhibits by 100 Columbia County artists.
On Oct. 13, there will be an auction of work by Columbia County artists at Time and Space Limited, a gallery and performance center on Columbia Street. Included will be an autographed poster by Mr. Kelly and a work by Mr. Chemiakin. At the 1855 Opera House, which a local group has long been trying to restore as a cultural and civic center, there will be the first exhibition by local artists from the 1940's and 50's, among them Stanley Bate.
The Arts Walk will also have music, including an alphorn concert on the courthouse steps and chamber music at six exhibition sites. For children, there will be crafts demonstrations and the opportunity to help build a hot-air balloon, which will be launched at noon on Oct. 13.
 
A Roller-Coaster History
 Hudson, a city of Federal and Victorian houses, with their brackets and milled cornices, is a diorama of American architectural history. But for years it has seemed to cling to life on the edge of the river, buffeted by cycles of poverty and prosperity. Now, like Peekskill, 40 miles to the south, Hudson is encouraging artists to settle, as a way of revitalizing a community that always seems to be in peril.
Founded in 1783, Hudson has had a shaky past. As one early history puts it, it was settled by "somber, undemonstrative Quaker men" seeking a good port for their whaling ships in the area, which had the last deep port on the river. In its early days it was a prosperous place; in 1829 a whaling ship arrived at the city docks "under discharge of cannon, and amidst the acclamations of citizens and sailors." The history also says, "The city is well and substantially built, and many of the residences are of great elegance, beautifully embowered."
Hudson's merchants traded with Curacao, the Windward Islands and Cuba. But soon the whaling industry declined; whale oil was replaced by petroleum; railroad tracks were laid along the river, and Hudson lost its ascendancy as a port.
After the Civil War, Hudson enjoyed a renaissance, becoming a manufacturing center bristling with tanneries, iron foundries and mills. The city was called the wooden match center of the world. During Prohibition, Hudson also became mildly notorious for its speak-easies and houses of prostitution along Columbia Street.
By the 1960's, Hudson's economic base had shrunk, and the city seemed to be clinging for its very life to the headland. Houses were boarded up, windows shattered. There was a melancholy to the empty streets lined with venerable buildings, a reminder of a once-thriving community.
But the place has always maintained a peculiar hold on artists and writers. In 1978, the poet and art critic John Ashbery bought a 19th-century house of rough-hewn stone near the courthouse. His home is a grand, dark place, filled with paintings given by artist friends. It reminds him of his grandfather's home in Rochester, a place where he had always been happy as a little boy.
"This is a late fantasy fulfillment," Mr. Ashbery said recently. "When I was growing up, I had this unrequited desire to live in a small town, and Hudson conformed to my idea of what a small town should be. It has that quality which I was always nostalgic for."
There is a completeness to Hudson, a sense of a finite town, everything within reach: the grand courthouse, the post office, the library in the old city almshouse, which dates from 1818. There are drug dealers in Hudson, too. "But we don't have murders or violent crime," Carrie Haddad said.
In the 1970's, a Federal grant enabled Hudson to restore its sidewalks and facades and to install new street lights. Two years ago, a citizens' group hired a planning firm to map a strategy to revitalize the town, and the Hudson Vision Plan resulted. One proposal was to encourage artists to move to the city. A group, Historic Hudson Inc., was started -- with Mr. Ashbery as a founding member -- to preserve the city's architectural and cultural heritage. Another aspect of the plan was a project to restore the waterfront and provide access to it once again.
With a $30,000 grant from the state and the Federal Government, the city removed three gas tanks from the shoreline. Now, with $175,000 in government money in place, there are plans to build a park on the riverfront, with a gazebo, a restaurant, nature trails and fishing areas, and to enlarge the docks for tour boats.
A year and a half ago, the old St. Charles Hotel was restored with a low-interest loan from the Hudson Development Corporation. Community leaders also hope to refurbish the Seventh Street Park and to move an 1850 statue of Venus back to its original site in the center of the park.
 
A Home for Artists
 Among the new artists to arrive in Hudson is Peter Barton, a sculptor and abstract painter whose work has vivid, expressive strokes thickened by beeswax. "I was drawn by the architecture," he said. "You get up and work among beautiful buildings." Another draw, Mr. Barton said, was that "David Kermani offered me free studio space on the third floor above his shop."
David Kermani, a former director of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in Manhattan who now owns an oriental rug store on Warren Street, is a prime mover behind Hudson's revitalization. Mr. Barton gave up his TriBeCa loft, which he had rented for $1,000 a month, for a $450-a-month apartment on Allen Street in Hudson. He will show one of his installations at the store during the Arts Walk weekend. It is a piece made from wire and chain molded into three-dimensional forms, with drawings.
Tony Thompson, who paints Hudson River landscapes, was one of the city's homesteading artists. He and his wife, Margaret Saliske, a furniture restorer and sculptor, left New York City for Hudson nine years ago.Mr. Thompson's work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and is in a number of corporate collections. The couple paid $140,000 for a three-story white Greek Revival house with Ionic columns, which they have renovated.
Mr. Thompson's paintings are representational landscapes of the Hudson River Valley, sometimes with their color planes broken up into abstractions, and often surrounded by his wife's elaborate frames. Their work will be on view during the Arts Walk at 415 Warren Street.
During his nine years in Hudson, Mr. Thompson has painted the same scene over and over again, the view from Hudson's Promenade Hill of the 19th-century Hudson lighthouse, the river and the Catskills beyond. It is much the same view that drew his predecessors in the 19th century.
"The light changes so drastically," he said. "You get these huge piles of clouds, then the mist at noon. It burns itself out, and the light becomes brighter. A storm goes by. It clears again."
"I work in my studio," Mr. Thompson added, "and when I happen to notice the light change, I zip down on my bike to the end of Warren Street. It's like having a theater there. You look outside and see what's playing, and then you can watch the show."

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Exploring the Misery Of a Desperate Era

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
When the Yale Center for British Art first opened here in 1977, it presented a view of England and English life that was predominantly Arcadian. The countryside in the 18th century looked idyllic. So did life in English country houses, large and small. Horses and dogs were well bred and well fed. Life in the slow lane in England was no cause for anxiety. Work was work, but very few people died of it.
The horrors of the downside of life in a later England were hardly touched upon in the Yale Center until 1988, when they were surveyed at length in an exhibition of mostly mid-19th-century art called "Hard Times." And at this moment, the hard times of our own mid-century are getting comprehensive coverage in "Humanist Landscapes: Humphrey Spender's Photo-Documents, 1932-1942." 
 Now 88, Mr. Spender was a pioneer photojournalist in the 1930's, when there was a deferential look to the picture pages in most of England's more substantial newspapers. He, on the contrary, practiced what the great German photographer August Sander had preached in 1931: that "photography should express the whole brutal, inhuman spirit of the time in universally comprehensible form."
As a point of view, that sure had topicality. It was in the mid-1930's, and throughout much of the northern half of England, that the English Depression bit deepest. Industries that had flourished for centuries lost out to foreign rivals. Areas that for many generations had lived by coal-mining were systematically downsized. Ships and shipyards were about to lose much of their traditional role. Unemployment stalked the streets, and living conditions plummeted. Anyone who has seen the movie "The Full Monty" will know that those conditions still exist, even in a once-great city like Sheffield.
In 1936, George Orwell lived rough and lived hard as he explored the areas in question. In his book "The Road to Wigan Pier" (1937), he described in detail and at first hand the dehumanizing conditions in which many thousands of English men, women and children were having to live.
What emerges at once from the show now at the Yale Center is that Orwell had both a mate and a match in his near-contemporary Humphrey Spender. Like Orwell, Spender neither melodramatized nor begged for attention. He, too, had traveled the afflicted areas not as a sightseeing tourist but as a fellow human being. In his perceptions, he was everywhere plain and simple, though never without subtlety.
It is relevant that Spender's elder brother, Michael, had lived in Germany while working for the company that produced the Leica camera. For Humphrey Spender the camera was, therefore, "like family." It is also relevant that his younger brother was Stephen Spender, a key figure among the younger English poets in the 1930's. But the decisive moment in his career was when he became aware of the potential of news photography, in which candor would be allied to immediacy. This he learned primarily while in Germany and Austria before 1933.
In England in 1936-37, Spender ran almost in tandem with Orwell, though neither knew the other and Orwell had not yet published "Wigan Pier." But Spender, like Orwell, had seen how unemployed miners would scramble on all fours up precipitous heaps of slag in search of small pieces of usable coal. And like Orwell, he had lived among the poorest of the poor and won their confidence.
But Spender was also a dramatist who missed nothing of the actualities of the almost derelict cities. He could sit for an hour in a public house and come back with a photograph that looked like a scene from an English equivalent of O'Neill's "Iceman Cometh."
If a city architect came around, notebook in hand, to decide which houses would lose their tenants and which should be spared, Spender caught every nuance of terror in the tenants' faces. And if a housewife still insisted on scrubbing her doorstep, he recorded the big generous half-circle with which she left it spotless.
He could also be very funny. At the Yale Center for British Art, there is a picture of a "Working Man's Hair Specialist" at work in the streets in Bolton. An update from the age of Hogarth, the image is nothing short of hilarious.
As for the "Commercial Travelers' Dance" in Birmingham in 1939, millisecond timing fixes the unexpectedly wild comedy of the scene.
Even so, mass-market newspapers didn't much care for his photographs. (Too "disturbing," they said). But in October 1938 Spender was taken up by "Picture Post," a new illustrated weekly with a more combative attitude to the day's disasters. So far from alienating the public, "Picture Post" racked up 1.35 million subscriptions by the end of the year.
Spender stayed with "Picture Post" till 1942, when he was drafted into the British Army. He did not make conventional "war photographs," but his every image stays with us.
In "Fighter Pilots Resting on Alert," taken at the height of the Battle of Britain, he gently reminds the reader that these very young men, bundled up and half asleep in full battle rig, might at any moment be sent out on a sortie from which none of them would return.
The Yale Center's exhibition is embellished throughout with paintings, drawings, books and other printed matter that documents the interaction between photographers and painters, novelists and students of society.
The final section includes a series of vintage copies of "Picture Post." Their tattered state testifies to the eagerness with which each issue was passed from hand to hand as a lifeline to news that was hard to find anywhere else.
"Humanist Landscapes: Humphrey Spender's Photo-Documents, 1932-1942" remains at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, through Nov. 9.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Some Philosophy Lessons From a Cunning Monk

BYLINE: By D. J. R. BRUCKNER 

 BODY:
A Tibetan lama, street smart and in exile, drops in on a high-powered Yale economist and stands the modern Western world on its head in Don Thompson's "Tibet Does Not Exist." This monk has little to say about the current suppression of the Tibetans by the Chinese, and he seldom asserts his Buddhist philosophy to change the minds of the economist, several academic colleagues and a couple of students.
In fact, although he is portrayed as an incarnation of past lamas, it is apparent from the outset that he has a refined sense of mental mischief; it is rarely possible to tell when he is serious and when he is just seeing what he can get away with. 
 Mr. Thompson is more apostle than playwright, and much of the script makes a good outline for a primer in Buddhism. But there is genuine humor here. And Brian Clay Luedloff, the director, along with a spirited cast, inject some of their own into the production by the Theater for Human Rights.
Fewer than 15 of the play's 90 minutes are didactic. This group treats the rest as good-mannered and amusing patter, and all the characters except the monk seem to be constantly tripping over the unspoken rules of their fastidious political correctness.
What dramatic development there is depends entirely on two people: Dominic Cuskern as the economist and Les J. N. Mau as the lama. Mr. Cuskern is as coolly arrogant as he should be to begin, and by the end he seems embarrassed to let anyone notice a transformation. Mr. Mau is so funny that it is surprising to find that after a while you are apprehensive about how cunning his monk might be under all that warm, loony unworldliness.
The playwright's reticence works: Tibet is much on your mind as you leave.

In New York City one battle has been lost, by surrender. But in Washington and around the country, conservatives and liberals of courage continue to fight for the religiously persecuted of the world.
 They need the courage. They are standing up to one of the best-funded and -organized lobbies ever put together to serve the interests of the persecuting dictatorships. 
 In New York, Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the City Council, marched up the freedom hill last spring. He presented a bill that would bar the city government and companies with which it signs contracts from doing business with any of 15 countries listed as religious persecutors.
Business executives were furious. They said it would hurt trade with those dictatorships. It would -- the only pressure for religious freedom the city could apply.
Yesterday Mr. Vallone responded. He did not narrow the bill and its consequences, as he might have, and yet maintain the pressure. He just spun around, marched down the hill, all the way, and withdrew his bill.
Instead he presented a set of "principles." Businesses agreed that they themselves would not "discriminate," which all of them have already promised. They would tell their managers abroad about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which most of the tyrannies involved have signed and ignored for 50 years.
No penalties against the guilty countries if they did not cease persecution, or against U.S. business serving them, are even mentioned.
The story is embarrassing for the city and for those of us who thought Mr. Vallone's guts would match his mouth. On we go, without him.
The struggle in Washington is about withholding some American subsidies from the dictatorships that persecute Christians, Buddhists and other religious minorities by arrest, torture and execution. This persecution has been repeatedly documented by the U.S. Government.
The penalties are small -- not higher tariffs, official boycotts or economically painful sanctions, but cancellation of non-humanitarian aid and U.S.-endowed loans. Never has America been asked to do so little for so many against such evil -- but still in the name of Heaven to do something.
The sponsors of the bill were so eager to get support for some action that they did not focus on China. But the shoe squeezed Beijing, producing acute pain in the American China lobby: organizations of American companies, a clutch of former high officials now involved with China and, of course, the White House.
One Administration problem with the bill was that after charges of religious persecution were investigated for up to a year, subsidies would be lifted unless the President ordered them continued, with explanation. That could put him on the human rights spot, which he does not enjoy.
But what really bothers the lobby is that the anti-persecution movement crosses political lines. It involves prominent Republican members of Congress like Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia and Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the bill's sponsors. It includes the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Christian Coalition, veteran conservative leaders like Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, and the liberal human rights leader Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.
But there is still influential opposition among liberals who are nervous about religion touching politics, even politics against oppression, and fear that Mr. Bauer has a "secret" agenda. If he does, it is a strange way of going about it -- angering the business community and other conservatives, and clergymen like the Rev. Billy Graham and his son Ned, who are opposed to the movement and to rocking Chinese boats.
All the Bauers, Pelosis, Wolfs and Specters have to gain is their own peace of mind and the knowledge that most Americans support them.
Speaking of peace of mind:
On March 16, Chinese police arrested Xu Yongze, a Protestant leader of China's underground churches, his wife and six other Chinese Christians. The charge was "disrupting public order." Nothing was heard from him afterward. Now Compass Direct, a U.S. religious news service, reports that on Sept. 17 he was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp.
Does that interest those who pretend a press release about "principles" will free a single human rights prisoner from his cell?
