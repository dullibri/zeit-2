HEADLINE: Pakistani Girl Is Sent to Britain

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani schoolgirl shot by Taliban gunmen for pushing for girls to be educated has been sent to the United Kingdom for medical treatment, a military spokesman said on Monday.
The spokesman said in a statement that 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai, whose shooting has drawn condemnation abroad and at home, will require prolonged care to fully recover physically and psychologically.
An air ambulance transporting Yousufzai, provided by the United Arab Emirates, had departed from Islamabad and was heading for the United Kingdom, said the spokesman. 
"The panel of doctors recommended that Malala be shifted abroad to a UK center which has the capability to provide integrated care to children who have sustained severe injury," said the spokesman in a statement.
Yousufzai, a cheerful schoolgirl who had wanted to become a doctor before agreeing to her father's wishes that she strive to be a politician, has become a potent symbol of resistance against the Taliban's efforts to deprive girls of an education.
Pakistanis have held some protests and candlelight vigils but government officials have refrained from publicly criticising the Taliban by name over the attack, in what critics say is a lack of resolve against extremism.
Opponents of Pakistan's government and military say the shooting is another example of the state's failure to tackle militancy.
The shooting of Yousufzai was the culmination of years of campaigning that had pitted the fearless young girl against one of Pakistan's most ruthless Taliban commanders, Maulana Fazlullah.
Fazlullah and his faction of the Pakistani Taliban took over Yusufzai's native Swat Valley in 2009 after reaching an agreement with the government which gave them de facto control of the former tourist spot.
Fazlullah imposed the Taliban's austere version of Islam there, blowing up girls' schools and publicly executing those deemed immoral. The army later launched a major offensive in Swat, forcing many Taliban fighters to flee.
Fazlullah's men simply melted away across the porous border to Afghanistan. Earlier this year, they kidnapped and beheaded 17 Pakistani soldiers in one of several cross-border raids that have become a new security headache for Pakistan.
Yousufzai continued speaking out despite the danger. As her fame grew, Fazlullah tried everything he could to silence her. The Taliban published death threats in the newspapers and slipped them under her door. But she ignored them.
TRIBAL CODE
The Taliban say that's why they sent assassins, despite a tribal code forbidding the killing of women.
Taliban sources said Fazlullah ordered two men specialising in high-profile assassinations to kill Yousufzai.
Pakistan's Taliban movement, which is linked to al Qaeda, has been fighting for years to topple the U.S.-backed government and establish the kind of rule they imposed in Swat.
The United States and other Western allies who give Pakistan billions of dollars in aid have been pushing the South Asian nation to crack down harder on the Taliban, al Qaeda and other groups that have formed a complex web of militancy.
Pakistan says Western criticism of its peformance against militants is unjustified, and that it has sacrificed more than any other country that joined the U.S. war on militancy after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
The nuclear-armed country has lost thousands of soldiers.
The attack on Yousufzai has angered many Pakistanis.
But many experts argue the war on militancy can only be won if the government strengthens the economy and creates jobs to ensure that fewer people join radical groups who exploit disillusionment with the state.
Critics say successive governments have been too preocupied with internal power struggles and tensions with the powerful military to tackle the country's growing list of problems.
Suspected militants struck again on Sunday night, attacking a police checkpoint near the northwestern city of Peshawar. Six policemen were killed, including a senior officer who was beheaded. Seven policemen are still missing.
Pakistan's interior minister said police had despatched guards to protect journalists who had been threatened by Taliban militants angered by coverage of Yousufzai's case.
The Taliban have said they would now try to kill her father, a headmaster of a girls' school in Swat.

HEADLINE: Abuse Growing In Loan Option For the Elderly

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
The very loans that are supposed to help seniors stay in their homes are in many cases pushing them out.
Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners 62 and older to borrow money against the value of their homes and not pay it back until they move out or die, have long been fraught with problems. But federal and state regulators are documenting new instances of abuse as smaller mortgage brokers, including former subprime lenders, flood the market after the recent exit of big banks and as defaults on the loans hit record rates.
Some lenders are aggressively pitching loans to seniors who cannot afford the fees associated with them, not to mention the property taxes and maintenance. Others are wooing seniors with promises that the loans are free money that can be used to finance long-coveted cruises, without clearly explaining the risks. Some widows are facing eviction after they say they were pressured to keep their name off the deed without being told that they could be left facing foreclosure after their husbands died.
Now, as the vast baby boomer generation heads for retirement and more seniors grapple with dwindling savings, the newly minted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is working on new rules that could mean better disclosure for consumers and stricter supervision of lenders. More than 775,000 of such loans are outstanding, according to the federal government. 
Concerns about the multibillion-dollar reverse mortgage market echo those raised in the lead-up to the financial crisis when consumers were marketed loans -- often carrying hidden risks -- that they could not afford.
''There are many of the same red flags, including explosive growth and the fact that these loans are often peddled aggressively without regard to suitability,'' said Lori Swanson, the Minnesota attorney general, who is working on reforming the reverse mortgage market.
Joan Serioux-Forde, 72, thought that she couldn't feel more devastated after her husband, Christopher, died last year. Then, roughly a month after the funeral, she received a letter from Generation Mortgage, a reverse mortgage lender, informing her that unless she paid $293,000, she would lose her home in San Bernardino, Calif. Ms. Forde said she was never informed that if she wasn't on the reverse mortgage deed, she would have virtually no right to stay in her home unless she bought it outright. ''It's a nightmare,'' she said. Generation Mortgage declined to comment.
Although the numbers of reverse mortgages have declined in recent years, the rate of default is at a record high -- roughly 9.4 percent of loans, according to the consumer protection bureau, up from around 2 percent a decade earlier. And borrowers are putting their nest eggs at risk by increasingly taking out the loans at younger ages and in lump sums, federal data and a recent bureau report show.
Peter H. Bell, president and chief executive of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a trade group, said that he met with officials from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to begin hashing out a way for lenders to adopt a uniform standard to determine whether seniors can afford to take on the loans.
Used correctly, reverse mortgages can be a valuable tool for seniors to stay in their homes and gain access to money needed for retirement. Seniors who have built up equity in their homes can borrow against a percentage of that and take out a lump sum or a line of credit. The loan doesn't have to be repaid until the homeowner moves out or dies, but borrowers still have to pay property taxes, maintenance and insurance.
Reverse mortgage lenders and brokers note that the loans are highly regulated and require potential borrowers to speak to a certified housing counselor about the potential pitfalls before taking out the loans. Mr. Bell adds that his trade group strictly monitors the advertising of its roughly 400 members to ensure that it is accurate.
Since the financial crisis, the reverse mortgage market has been in flux, dampened by a drop in property values, complaints about the loans and the recent departure of big lenders. Originations backed by the federal government peaked at about 115,000 in 2007 and totaled about 51,000 loans last year.
MetLife was the latest major player to exit the market, in April. That followed the departure last year of the two biggest reverse mortgage lenders, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, which cited falling housing prices and difficulty assessing borrowers' ability to repay the loans.
Into the void left by the big banks have moved smaller mortgage brokers and lenders. Some of them steer seniors into expensive, risky loans with deceptive sales pitches and high-pressure tactics, according to regulators, housing counselors and elder-care advocates.
Mark S. Diamond, a former subprime mortgage broker in Chicago, who has been sued for fraud by the Federal Trade Commission and the Illinois attorney general, faces a federal lawsuit filed in June by seniors who claim that he sold them reverse mortgages and either pocketed their loan amounts or promised to put the proceeds toward home repairs that never materialized. A lawyer for Mr. Diamond did not return calls for comment. Some solicitations reviewed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau present reverse mortgages as ''free money'' or mistakenly tell seniors that they could never lose their home. One Maryland reverse mortgage lender tells seniors that they can put the proceeds toward a vacation: ''Just because you're retired doesn't mean you don't need a vacation every now and then.'' Last year, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks issued cease-and-desist orders to a handful of reverse mortgage firms for operating without a license. In its advertising, one of those mortgage brokers falsely promised seniors ''you won't lose your home.''
Officials at the bureau, which issued a report on the industry in June, said they heard from a number of seniors who claimed that lenders encouraged them to make their older spouses the sole borrower on the loan. The brokers earn more money when they make larger loans with the older spouse as the only borrower.
Some surviving spouses complained that brokers told them they could be added later, but they were not. The bureau says those seniors are at greater risk of losing their homes. The complaints, according to elder-care advocates and federal officials, have been rising during the past year, although there are no exact numbers.
Linda McMahon, a 65-year-old widow, watched helplessly as the locks were changed on her home in St. Croix Falls, Wis., last month. She said that in 2005, when her husband was 82 and she was 58, a mortgage broker from Wells Fargo promised her that she could add her name to the mortgage once she turned 62. That never happened because that year, in 2009, she didn't have time to deal with it as her husband's health quickly deteriorated and he died from a heart condition, she said. Soon, she was unable to pay any of the property taxes and insurance. ''I am devastated,'' said Ms. McMahon, who is retired, living on Social Security income and now renting an apartment.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment. Reverse mortgages also have troublesome incentive structures that might encourage brokers to steer seniors toward lump-sum loans, which carry a fixed interest rate, rather than a line of credit with a variable interest rate, the bureau found. In a lump sum arrangement, the interest charges are added each month, and over time the total debt owed can far surpass the original loan.
Brokers earn higher fees on these loans and even more money when they sell the loans into the secondary market, where they can get rates nearly double those for variable loans, according to rate sheets obtained by the consumer bureau.
Some 70 percent of reverse mortgages are taken in lump sums, up from 3 percent in 2008, according to the bureau. When seniors use the money to pay off other debts, especially right before retirement or early into it, that can leave them with scarce resources to pay their property taxes and insurance.
Ms. Forde, who lives in fear of losing her San Bernardino home, said she could not afford to save her house by paying the full $293,000 debt. Now, she said, she spends much of her day standing guard by the window. Her home is already in foreclosure proceedings. With a wavering voice, she said: ''I have nowhere to go.''

HEADLINE: Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian Leader Through Shifting Allegiances, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
Norodom Sihanouk, the charismatic Cambodian leader whose remarkable skills of political adaptation personified for the world the tiny, troubled kingdom where he was a towering figure through six decades, died early Monday in Beijing. He was 89.
The death was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Bunchhay, quoted by news services. The former king had been dogged by ill health for years and regularly traveled to China for treatment.
King Sihanouk was crowned in 1941, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president, and held on to some form of power for the next 60-plus years. He served as monarch, prime minister, figurehead of the Communist revolution, leader in exile, and once again as monarch until he abdicated in 2004. He handed the crown to one of his sons, Norodom Sihamoni, after which he was known as the retired king, or the king-father.
He survived colonial wars, the Khmer Rouge and the intrigues of the cold war, but his last years were marked by expressions of melancholy, and he complained often about the poverty and abuses of what he called ''my poor nation.'' 
Alternately charming and ruthless, he dazzled world leaders with his political wit and, in the process, raised the stature of his small Southeast Asian nation. He won independence for Cambodia from the French colonial rulers in 1953, using diplomacy and repression to outmaneuver his domestic rivals but without resorting to war, as his neighbors in Vietnam had done.
He put his nation on a modern footing in the 1960s, especially bolstering the education system, but his Buddhist socialist agenda did poorly and produced economic stagnation.
When the Vietnam War threatened to engulf the region, he tried to carve out a neutral role for Cambodia, siding neither with the Communists nor the United States. But when the Vietnamese Communists began using the port of Sihanoukville and Cambodia's eastern border to ship military supplies on what was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, he took steps to repair relations with the United States. He turned a blind eye when the Nixon administration undertook a secret bombing campaign in 1969 against the border area of Cambodia. But this only further unsettled his country and led to a coup that ousted him the next year.
Convinced that the United States had been behind the overthrow, King Sihanouk allied himself with the Khmer Rouge at the urging of his Chinese patrons, giving the Cambodian Communists his prestige and enormous popularity. Their victory in 1975 brought the ruthless Pol Pot to power, with King Sihanouk serving, for the first year, as the figurehead president until he was placed under house arrest and fell into a deep depression. Over the next four years, the Khmer Rouge regime led to the death of 1.7 million people and nearly destroyed the country.
Criticized throughout his life for these dramatic shifts in allegiances, King Sihanouk said he followed only one course in politics: ''the defense of the independence, the territorial integrity and the dignity of my country and my people.''
In fact, he skillfully manipulated the great powers, usually with the support of China, to ensure his survival as well as his country's independence. His worst nightmare, he said in an interview, was to be pushed out of his country's political life into a quiet retirement, like Vietnam's last emperor, Bao Dai, who died in obscurity in Paris in 1997.
Instead, King Sihanouk returned in 1993 as monarch and head of state after an accord brokered by the United Nations ended nearly 14 years of war in Cambodia.
Even in his darkest moments, the king never lost his flair for flamboyance or his taste for the finer things. As a young ruler and the scion of one of Asia's oldest royal houses, he gained a well-deserved reputation as a playboy, a gourmand and an amateur filmmaker.
In his years in exile with his wife, Queen Monique, he kept his Cambodian movement alive by lavishly entertaining diplomats and foreign officials with Champagne breakfasts and elaborate French meals.
Denied any active role in government, he contented himself with the ceremonial position of king, still revered by many peasants.
Occasionally he interfered in politics. He undermined Prince Norodom Ranariddh, another son, by forcing him to accept a position as co-prime minister after winning the first postwar democratic election in 1993. Prince Ranariddh was ousted from that position in a coup by the other co-prime minister, Hun Sen, who became the country's dominant power during King Sihanouk's final years.
Norodom Sihanouk was born in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, on Oct. 31, 1922. A prince of the Norodom branch of the royal family, he was never considered a serious candidate to gain the throne. Instead, he was seen as a sensitive, if lonely, prince with a serious gift for music and, later, a passion for film.
He received a first-rate French education, initially at a primary school in Phnom Penh and then at the Lycee Chasseloup-Laubat in Saigon, the best in colonial Indochina. He was only 18 when King Monivong died in 1941 and the French colonial powers tapped him as the unlikely successor.
France had surrendered to Nazi Germany and was under Vichy control, worried that it would also lose its Indochinese colonies to Japan. The prince seemed the most malleable candidate, the one who would obey the dictates of French colonial officials.
For the first three years, King Sihanouk, a true Francophile, met all their expectations. As World War II engulfed Asia, he was a loyal partner of the French colonial administrators, who collaborated with Japan and hoped to fend off a nascent Cambodian independence movement.
In those early years, King Sihanouk seemed uninterested in government. He filled his days pursuing women and, in the tradition of his forebears, had several consorts who eventually bore him at least 13 children.
But in March 1945, as they were losing the war, the Japanese sought to oust the French in Cambodia. King Sihanouk stepped forward on the side of Japan and declared Cambodia the new independent state of Kampuchea. With Japan's defeat, King Sihanouk welcomed back the French, largely ignoring the growing number of Cambodians who thought their country should remain independent.
By his own account, the king did not pick up the banner of independence again until 1951, using it to fend off challenges from democratic and Communist movements demanding an end to French colonialism.
Taking advantage of the increasing French weakness from Communist victories in neighboring Vietnam, King Sihanouk persuaded the French to make Cambodia independent in November 1953 in advance of the 1954 Geneva peace conference that led to a divided Vietnam.
Then in a cunning move, King Sihanouk announced he would give up the throne to run in his country's first independent elections. Through a combination of repression, rigging and reliance on the votes of peasants who still considered him a god-king, his party swept the elections, and he set about creating Cambodia anew.
His brand of politics evolved into a one-party rule with some dissidents and rival parties pulled into his umbrella political party, the People's Socialist Community. The towers of Angkor decorated the country's new flag, one of the many ways that King Sihanouk used the massive temple complex at Angkor as a visible reminder that Cambodia was once the premier state and culture of the region.
He maintained strong ties to France, hiring French experts to help run his government and French teachers for his schools. In Phnom Penh, he nurtured a cafe society of intellectuals while he left the countryside in what he considered a more or less bucolic state but that was, in fact, a backward region of grinding poverty.
In contrast to its neighbors -- Vietnam to the east, with its war, and Thailand to the west, with its disfiguring modern development and militarism -- Cambodia appeared to be a welcome oasis throughout the 1960s, with now Prince Sihanouk presiding as charming, benevolent despot, treating his citizens like devoted children.
At the same time, he was imprisoning and sometimes executing opponents or driving others -- notably the Communist leader Solath Sar, who would become Pol Pot -- into exile and fueling discontent that fed growing political opposition and eventually armed insurrection.
Stories about King Sihanouk's extravagance became a staple of the diplomatic circuit, especially as he turned his hand to his first loves -- music and film. He entertained guests at his exclusive parties on his saxophone and embarked on a film career, eventually producing 19 movies for which he was director, producer, scriptwriter, composer and often leading man.
All the while he was head of state of a country increasingly squeezed by the Vietnam War. He took his place as one of the leaders of the nonaligned movement of newly independent nations -- Egypt and India among them -- hoping to emerge from poverty and avoid taking sides in the cold war. Yet he also accepted the outstretched hand of China, which was convinced that the United States posed a military threat to its borders.
Crystallizing Cambodia's hopes for avoiding entanglement was a speech in 1966 by the French president, Charles de Gaulle, in Phnom Penh calling for the end of the Vietnam War and the neutrality of Indochina. He paid King Sihanouk the ultimate compliment by saying Cambodia and France were alike, with ''a history laden with glory and sorrow, an exemplary culture and art, and a fertile land with vulnerable frontiers.'' But the war would spill across Cambodia's border.
With King Sihanouk's acquiescence, the Vietnamese Communists used Cambodia for its logistics. When the Vietnamese sanctuaries expanded, he only mildly objected to the United States's secret bombing of them. That bombing campaign was later cited in the articles of impeachment drawn up but never used against President Richard M. Nixon.
Despite the growing unrest in Cambodia, King Sihanouk was unprepared for his overthrow in 1970 by Prince Sirik Matak, a cousin, and Gen. Lon Nol. Supported by the United States, the new government immediately allowed American troops to invade Cambodia from Vietnam.
The invasion ignited protests around the world, including those at Kent State University in Ohio, where national guardsmen killed four students. After his ouster, King Sihanouk fled to Beijing, where Chinese leaders persuaded him to join forces with Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the group of Cambodian Communists that had been seeking to overthrow him since the '60s.
Although King Sihanouk had aggressively pursued the Khmer Rouge, arresting and often torturing them, he was so stung by the betrayal of the coup plotters that he agreed to head their resistance. His name and appearance in propaganda films and booklets helped the Communists recruit peasants in Cambodia and gave respectability to their cause in diplomatic circles. In the end, King Sihanouk helped bring Pol Pot to power.
The Khmer Rouge won in 1975 and immediately began a reign of terror. Cambodians were ordered out of the towns and cities and sent to grueling work camps and farms in the countryside. Cambodia was cut off from the rest of the world. Society was destroyed, with all religion and professions outlawed.
Intellectuals, monks and anyone deemed a political enemy were murdered. Tens of thousands of people died of treatable diseases, overwork or starvation.
King Sihanouk was the titular president during the first year of the Khmer Rouge rule. He said he had resigned a year later and was put under house arrest with his consort, Princess Monique, in one of the palaces. There he listened to world news on a radio and, he said, at times wanted to commit suicide.
He was rescued when the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979. But rather than turn against Pol Pot, King Sihanouk went to the United Nations and defended him, saying the country's enemy was Vietnam.
For the next 12 years, King Sihanouk provided a fig leaf of respectability for the Khmer Rouge as they and several non-Communist groups tried to evict Vietnam from Cambodia in the name of national liberation. The United States, China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations supported King Sihanouk, who maneuvered himself into a pivotal role in the final negotiations. Lined up against him, the Khmer Rouge and the rest of the resistance were Vietnam, the Soviet Union and Mr. Sen, who was then the head of the Cambodian government established under the Vietnamese occupation.
With the end of the cold war, Cambodia was no longer hostage to great power politics. The United Nations negotiated a settlement to the war in 1991, and national elections were held two years later. King Sihanouk returned to Phnom Penh to a thunderous welcome, encouraging him to believe he could become a powerful chief of state once again. But other Cambodian politicians, including his own children, did not want him back in control.
A party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh won the elections. Mr. Sen's party came in second; the Khmer Rouge boycotted the elections. Furious that he had lost, Mr. Sen and his surrogates threatened to reignite the war. King Sihanouk stepped in and persuaded the United Nations to create the position of co-prime minister for Mr. Sen, effectively nullifying his son's victory. However, King Sihanouk was returned to the throne and became king-father for the rest of his life.
Chastened, he maintained that he had been above the fray throughout, attempting to duplicate the role of national unifier played by King Bhumibol Adulyadej in neighboring Thailand.
But for the most part, King Sihanouk sided with Mr. Sen, his political son. Toward the end of his life, the king reduced his once hectic travel schedule and rarely ventured outside Asia. Beijing, where the Chinese government maintained a villa for him, was his most frequent destination.
Michael Leifer, the Southeast Asia expert and professor at the London School of Economics who died in 2001, wrote that ''the powerful myth of Sihanouk contributed to the people of Cambodia and the international community'' repeatedly turning to him ''as the font of national unity.''
He added: ''The record of the man, however, would suggest a greater facility for reigning than for ruling. He has been more at home with the pomp and circumstance of government than with its good practice.''

HEADLINE: Patents on Software: A Nobel Laureate's View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Patent, Used as a Sword'' (''The iEconomy'' series, front page, Oct. 8) makes the valuable point that patents in industries like software can sometimes impede innovation rather than promote it (as they are supposed to do). But in fact, the article doesn't go far enough. 
It argues that software patents may reduce innovation because they are too broad, vague and loose -- criticisms that are well taken.
But if these were their only shortcomings, then simply tightening patent standards would solve everything. Unfortunately, the problem is deeper than that.
Specifically, in the software industry, progress is highly sequential: progress is typically made through a large number of small steps, each building on the previous ones. If one of those steps is patentable, then the patent holder can effectively block (or at least slow down) subsequent progress by setting high license fees.
Moreover, like any other monopolist, it has the incentive to set such fees.
Thus, in an industry with highly sequential innovation, it may be better for society to scrap patents altogether than try to tighten them.

HEADLINE: Mining Contract Details Disclosed in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MATTHEW ROSENBERG

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Enmeshed in a bruising political battle over new mining rules seen as vital to Afghanistan's economic future, the country's mining minister on Sunday disclosed about 200 previous mining contracts for the first time, portraying the move as an attempt to bring transparency to a process vulnerable to corruption.
In the process, he appeared to take a swipe at a brother of President Hamid Karzai, citing as flawed the award of a contract in 2006 for a cement company in which he was a partner. 
The action, by Mining Minister Wahidullah Shahrani, was likely to please his supporters in the West, including the United States, who made greater openness in the Afghan government's financial dealings a condition of billions of dollars in development assistance and aid money pledged earlier this year.
But the move also comes at a precarious time for Mr. Shahrani. He is embattled politically and a target of critics for his shepherding of a proposed new mining law, vital to attracting foreign investment, which was blocked by the Afghan cabinet in July with President Karzai's support. Mr. Shahrani is to resubmit the law in the coming weeks.
Developing Afghanistan's potentially rich deposits of iron, oil, gold, copper, lithium and other natural resources is regarded as crucial to the country's economic prospects, transforming it into a state that can begin to pay its own way and allowing the international community to cut back its financial and, ultimately, military support. But there are persistent concerns that any resource boom could be jeopardized by corruption, worsening security and political instability.
''From now on every contract will be made public,'' Mr. Shahrani said at a news conference here. ''No contract will be kept secret.''
However, Mr. Shahrani did not release the contract for one of the country's biggest and most lucrative mining concessions, the 2007 agreement for the Aynak copper deposit in Logar Province near Kabul struck with a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, China Metallurgical Group Corporation. Accusations of bribery and a sweetheart deal for the mining concern have swirled for years, but without proof.
Mr. Shahrani said this agreement was made under a previous minister when nonpublication was subject to a legal deal with the Chinese. He said he had written to the Chinese with a request to make the contract public. Almost all of the other contracts published on the ministry Web site, struck as far back as 2002, covered an array of much smaller marble, coal and other mines, and until the details of the Aynak contract are released, analysts questioned whether the new initiative had full force.
''This is a start,'' said Yama Torabi, director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan, an anticorruption watchdog based in Kabul.
Mr. Shahrani said the ministry had discovered ''financial, legal and technical flaws'' in some of the contracts, and held up as an example at the news conference the operating rights for the country's only cement factory, which was awarded at the time to a partnership of investors, among them Mahmoud Karzai, one of President Karzai's brothers.
Mahmoud Karzai has been accused of using his brother's position for financial gain, and the cement factory had been controversial, not least among local provincial leaders who said the investors had cut jobs and paid low salaries. The contract was only four pages long, for an agreement that under proper international standards would normally be far longer, Mr. Shahrani said.
''Look at the contract of Ghori Cement,'' he said. ''Nobody remembers a 30-year contract being signed in four pages.'' He said the shortcomings reflected lack of capacity and experience among officials in the ministry when the agreement was put together, and that the flawed contracts would be revised.
Neither President Karzai's office nor Mahmoud Karzai returned messages seeking comment.
Afghan and Western officials in Kabul, along with technical experts who advise the government, have said that the initial rejection of the new mining and oil drilling law in part reflected the minister's political weakness. Mr. Shahrani, who took over in 2010, had expected the new law to breeze past the cabinet, yet instead found himself pitted almost alone against a range of more experienced and better-connected politicians -- from those seen as pro-Western reformers to former communists and the religiously conservative who, among other things, objected to the proposals as being too generous to foreign mining interests eager to exploit Afghanistan's natural resources.
President Karzai publicly sided with those lined up against the new law, sending it back for revisions over Mr. Shahrani's objections.
Some Western officials fear the maneuvering reflects attempts by political rivals to snatch control of the Mining Ministry, a coveted post that oversees millions of dollars in contracts.
''A lot of groups, a lot of people in the government, want to be part of the mining now that it is seen as a way to generate large sums of revenue,'' said one senior European diplomat in Kabul who follows the mining deliberations.
The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Sunday's announcement could be seen as an attempt by Mr. Shahrani to address his political vulnerability by boosting his standing among Afghans and the international community.
The Mes Aynak mine has been delayed by deterioration in security and the discovery of Buddhist ruins and artifacts. But Mr. Shahrani said that archaeologists preparing the site now had a deadline of the end of this year to finish their survey, and that he was confident that the Chinese could begin mining extraction in 2014.
Since he took over the ministry two years ago, Mr. Shahrani has been collecting details of agreements struck on natural resource deals going back over the past 10 years.
Earlier this year, fulfilling concerns raised by Western governments at the Tokyo Conference, where for the first time donors made it a condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money, President Karzai issued a decree calling for full details of natural resource contracts to be published, giving further impetus to his efforts.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says the Fed's Latest Monetary Policy Could Benefit the Global Economy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO (Reuters) -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, defended the central bank's monetary policy on Sunday from claims that it was hurting the economies of emerging countries.
Mr. Bernanke has often defended Fed actions against domestic critics, who argue the policy of keeping interest rates near zero while ramping up asset purchases hurts savers and risks future inflation.
But in a speech here, he addressed critics abroad by saying that stronger growth in the United States bolsters global prospects as well, countering the likes of Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, who has labeled the Fed's latest stimulus effort ''selfish.'' 
Critics say the Fed's unorthodox policies weaken the dollar and bolster the currencies of developing countries, hurting their ability to export.
''It is not at all clear that accommodative policies in advanced economies impose net costs on emerging market economies,'' Mr. Bernanke said at an event sponsored by the Bank of Japan and the International Monetary Fund.
The Fed last month announced a program of open-ended bond purchases that will be continued until there is substantial improvement in labor market conditions, barring a sustained and unexpected spike in inflation. To start off, the central bank will buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month.
''This policy not only helps strengthen the U.S. economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. spending and growth, it has the effect of helping support the global economy as well,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
In 2010, when the Fed started its second round of monetary policy stimulus, known as quantitative easing, many finance ministers accused the United States of pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy. Criticism of the current round of bond purchases has been more muted, but nonetheless evident.
Mr. Mantega told the 188 member countries of the monetary fund here on Friday that the policy was selfish and harming emerging markets by stealing their share of exports and by spurring destabilizing capital flows and currency movements.
''Advanced countries cannot count on exporting their way out of the crisis at the expense of emerging market economies,'' he told the fund's governing panel. ''Brazil, for one, will take whatever measures it deems necessary to avoid the detrimental effects of these spillovers.''
In opening remarks at the conference that Mr. Bernanke addressed on Sunday, the head of the monetary fund, Christine Lagarde, said steps by the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were ''big policy actions in the right direction.''
But she took note of the distress those policies were causing elsewhere and called for central banks to step up their dialogue and cooperation.
Critics of the Fed's policy, both foreign and domestic, contend that it is likely to do little to help the American economy, while risking unwanted inflation.
Central banks ''should consider draining excessive liquidity injected into the market and eliminate inflationary pressure in the long-term,'' the governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, was quoted as saying by the official state news agency Xinhua.
Russia is also concerned.
''For now, this excess liquidity is not contributing to inflation, but it could happen at some point,'' the Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, told reporters here.
While Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that bond buying was ''no panacea,'' he argued that the open-ended nature of the latest round should make people feel more certain that American economic growth would pick up.

HEADLINE: The Radical Is Romney, Not Ryan

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a contributing opinion writer, was a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the , Obama administration.

 BODY:
MITT ROMNEY, moderate. That earnestly sought post-debate public image contrasts starkly with Mr. Romney's actual positions on many issues, especially the future trajectory of government spending.
Clinging tightly to a studied vagueness when pressed for unpopular specifics, Mr. Romney has put forward a budget framework that would not eviscerate Medicare and Social Security, as is commonly believed, but would slash everything else that's not defense.
President Obama should use Tuesday night's debate to press Mr. Romney to defend -- or even just explain -- these proposed cuts, which would be far more draconian than those advanced by his running mate, Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan is widely viewed as the real fiscal hawk, but in key areas, his views on spending levels are actually closer to Mr. Obama's than to Mr. Romney's. 
All in all, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly -- over the next decade, they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States' gross domestic product, below the historic average of around 21 percent. (Recognizing that an aging society costs more, Mr. Obama proposes to hold spending at its current level, 23 percent.)
These differences may not sound like much, but by 2023, each percentage point of G.D.P. could represent about $250 billion in federal spending.
Though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought it up repeatedly in his debate with Mr. Ryan on Thursday, Social Security -- the single biggest government expenditure -- is not on the battlefield. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each backed away from threats to privatize or cut it and now propose to spend the same amount on it as Mr. Obama would in the coming decade.
That's not the case with Medicare. Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have each endorsed similar packages of about $950 billion of savings over 10 years, while Mr. Romney has opposed any reduction, making it virtually impossible for him to achieve his overall spending limit.
To be sure, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan agree -- and differ with Mr. Obama -- on many matters, like how to contain the growth in Medicare spending and whether to raise the eligibility age.
And they part company from Mr. Obama when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (the Republicans demand its repeal, claiming it would save about $1.6 trillion) and Medicaid (Messrs. Romney and Ryan want it turned over to the states and want to cut nearly 20 percent from Mr. Obama's planned levels).
But with respect to nearly half the budget, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan widely diverge from each other.
Mr. Romney is calling for a huge increase in defense spending -- roughly $2 trillion more over the next decade than Mr. Ryan wants to spend, which is only $400 billion above Mr. Obama's budget -- even though the military is not asking for such an increase. Such an increase would force giant reductions, about 40 percent, in everything that's left.
''Everything else'' isn't some catchall of small items, like feeding Big Bird. We're talking about a vast array of programs including civilian and military pensions, food stamps, unemployment and disability compensation, the earned income and child tax credits, family support and nutrition, K-12 education, transportation, public safety and disaster relief. And on and on.
All told, Mr. Romney would allocate $6.9 trillion for these items, compared with the $9.3 trillion proposed by his own running mate (and Mr. Obama's $12 trillion, which itself represents a 9 percent reduction from current levels, after adjusting for inflation).
No doubt some of what is buried within ''other mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending'' can be eliminated. Perhaps Americans won't miss a few national parks or the space program.
But also nestled within this category are critical outlays for investments in infrastructure and research.
Eating the seed corn is never advisable, yet that's what Washington is already doing. The share of spending on infrastructure (roads, airports, dams and the like) fell from 2 percent of G.D.P. in 1971 to 1 percent in 2010.
More -- not less -- government money needs to be invested in these kinds of growth-generating projects (not to mention education and training).
I recognize that in the real world, cuts on the scale envisioned by Mr. Romney will prove politically untenable, which would force a President Romney to rethink his agenda.
But as a statement of intent, it's Mr. Romney -- not Mr. Ryan -- who has produced the budget that would more dramatically reduce the services offered by government, and in ways that would shock and outrage most Americans. We can only hope that Mr. Obama will draw those contrasts clearly in the debate.

HEADLINE: China Asserts Market Setting Currency Value

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TOKYO (AP) -- China's currency has reached its equilibrium rate and its value is mainly set by the market, rather than intervention, Zhou Xiaochuan, the nation's central bank chief, said Sunday, signaling that major movement in the renminbi's value is unlikely soon. 
In a speech delivered by Yi Gang, his deputy, Mr. Zhou, governor of the People's Bank of China, also warned that too much monetary easing by major economies puts inflationary pressure on China as strives to increase growth while controlling prices.
China's exchange rate against the American dollar has resurfaced in the United States presidential race, with Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, accusing President Obama of ducking an important decision on whether China is manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage.
The Treasury Department was to announce a decision Monday, but it said Friday that no announcement would be made until after global finance officials meet in early November, probably after the Nov. 6 election.
The United States has long urged China to lift controls on foreign exchange markets that Washington contends keep the renminbi undervalued, making China's exports relatively less expensive in overseas markets.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Zhou said China's central bank refrained from intervening in the market in the last year, while the exchange rate stayed around 6.3 renminbis per dollar.
''The rate, the spot rate and future rate, determined by the market supply and demand, basically are very close to the equilibrium rate,'' he said.
The renminbi has appreciated more than 30 percent against the dollar in nominal terms since 2005, Mr. Zhou said, adding that the currency had ''appreciated quite a bit in the past 15 years.''
He outlined progress by China in revamping its financial sector and setting up foreign exchange markets, in the speech delivered after the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank last week in Tokyo.
Mr. Zhou was among several top bankers and other officials absent from the meeting, apparently to express China's ire over a territorial dispute with Japan.

HEADLINE: No More Industrial Revolutions?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: An economist's prediction that the United States faces a future of 'epochal decline in growth' has serious political consequences. 

 BODY:
The American economy is running on empty. That's the hypothesis put forward by Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. Let's assume for a moment that he's right. The political consequences would be enormous.
In his widely discussed National Bureau of Economic Research paper, "Is U.S. Economic Growth Over?" Gordon predicts a dark future of "epochal decline in growth from the U.S. record of the last 150 years." The greatest innovations, Gordon argues, are behind us, with little prospect for transformative change along the lines of the three previous industrial revolutions:
IR #1 (steam, railroads) from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum) from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (computers, the web, mobile phones) from 1960 to present.
Gordon argues that each of these revolutions was followed by a period of economic expansion, particularly industrial revolution number two, which saw "80 years of relatively rapid productivity growth between 1890 and 1972." According to Gordon, once "the spin-off inventions from IR #2 (airplanes, air conditioning, interstate highways) had run their course, productivity growth during 1972-96 was much slower than before." Industrial revolution number 3, he writes
 created only a short-lived growth revival between 1996 and 2004. Many of the original and spin-off inventions of IR #2 could happen only once - urbanization, transportation speed, the freedom of females from the drudgery of carrying tons of water per year, and the role of central heating and air conditioning in achieving a year-round constant temperature.
Over most of human history, in Gordon's view, the world had minimal economic growth, if it had any at all - and "there is no guarantee that growth will continue indefinitely." Gordon's paper suggests instead that "the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well turn out to be a unique episode in human history."
The United States faces "headwinds" that could cut annual growth in Gross Domestic Product to as little as 0.2 percent annually, which is one tenth the rate of growth from 1860 to 2007.
The headwinds Gordon cites include:

        
The reversal of the "demographic dividend." The huge one-time-only surge of women into the workforce between 1965 and 1990 raised hours per capita and "allowed real per capita real G.D.P. to grow faster than output per hour." Now the number of workers who are retiring is growing, reducing the average number of hours worked for the entire population. "By definition, whenever hours per capita decline, then output per capita must grow more slowly than productivity."
        
Rising inequality means that the majority of the population will get a smaller fraction of the benefits of economic growth.
        
America is losing the competitive advantage it long enjoyed based on the educational achievement of its workforce. Gordon cites O.E.C.D. data showing that out of 37 countries surveyed, the United States recently ranked 21st in reading, 31st in math, and 34th in science. Higher education cost inflation, Gordon adds, "leads to mounting student debt, which is increasingly distorting career choices and deterring low-income people from going to college at all."
        
Globalization and rapid advances in information technology encourage outsourcing and automation, which inevitably have "a damaging effect on the nations with the highest wage level, i.e., the United States."
Taken in full, Gordon's controversial N.B.E.R. paper challenges our belief that innovation and invention will continue to drive sustained expansion in the United States.
Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T and co-author of the book "Why Nations Fail: Origins of Power, Poverty and Prosperity," wrote in response to an email I sent him asking about Gordon's hypothesis:
Bob has been a good corrective to people who think that the innovations of today are transforming the world in a way that those of yesteryear never did. This is a very important corrective. But I think he misses the major engine of innovation: the market tends to find whatever is profitable, even if we cannot see what that is today.
Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, wrote to me that the Gordon essay "is a wise and thoughtful piece but a very, very speculative one. The historical evidence presented is quite reasonable." Katz noted that projections of "what new ideas will be discovered and their potential impacts on economic growth" are "highly uncertain." In the end, he said, "I am probably a bit more optimistic on the potential for innovation but I share Gordon's worries about inequality and education and environmental issues."
David Autor, who is also an economist at M.I.T., has written extensively about problems with employment and job growth, but he holds a more optimistic view than Gordon:
My guess is that the big gains in the next couple of decades are likely to come from the medical arena - prolonging life, tackling disease, correcting genetic deficiencies, regrowing limbs, reversing the course of Alzheimer's.
Autor had another thought:
It's my hope - but here I'm less confident - that advances in energy generation (solar, wind power, efficiency itself) will contribute to stemming global warming by reducing carbon emissions. That would be a major improvement to the expected trajectory of G.D.P.
Martin Wolf, an economic columnist for the Financial Times, has opened up a discussion of the political implications of Gordon's bleak assessment of the American future, writing:
For almost two centuries, today's high-income countries enjoyed waves of innovation that made them both far more prosperous than before and far more powerful than everybody else. This was the world of the American dream and American exceptionalism. Now innovation is slow and economic catch-up fast. The elites of the high-income countries quite like this new world. The rest of their population like it vastly less. Get used to this. It will not change.
If Gordon is even modestly on target, the current presidential campaign begins to ring hollow. Listen to the rhetoric. "Mitt Romney's plan for a stronger middle class is a five-part proposal for turning around the economy and delivering more jobs and more take-home pay for American families," the Romney campaign declares on its web site. "His plan will end the middle class squeeze of declining incomes and rising prices, bring back prosperity, and create 12 million jobs during his first term."
Over at the Obama web site, you find: "President Obama is fighting to grow the economy from the middle class out, not the top down. This election presents a choice between two fundamentally different visions of how to grow our economy and create good middle-class jobs."
Juxtapose these campaign claims with Gordon's chart describing the growth of G.D.P. per capita over the last 810 years. The blue line represents G.D.P. growth in England, which benefitted from the industrial revolution first. The point on the chart where the line shifts to the color red (the early 20th century) is the moment when the United States replaced England as the global leader in productivity growth.
Gordon's chart demonstrates that there was a sustained lack of productivity growth from 1300 to 1700, which supports his argument that economic expansion is a relatively recent phenomenon and by no means inevitable. The chart also illustrates the decidedly downward turn that American growth rates have taken since the mid-1970s.
Gordon goes on to raise the stakes, extending his projections into the future. The green line in the second Gordon graph charts his view of the hypothetical path of real G.D.P. per capita growth over the next 88 years. It is a grim image. Gordon describes a steadily diminishing rate of growth in the United States:
Doubling the standard of living took five centuries between 1300 and 1800. Doubling accelerated to one century between 1800 and 1900. Doubling peaked at a mere 28 years between 1929 and 1957 and 31 years between 1957 and 1988. But then doubling is predicted to slow back to a century again between 2007 and 2100. Of course the latter is a forecast.
In essence, Gordon is saying that there won't be a fourth industrial revolution:
Why is this related to inequality? Because the burden of this decline will fall on the bulk of the population. The continuing prosperity of the wealthiest, on the other hand, will be magnified.
Using detailed income data compiled by Emmanuel Saez, a Berkeley economist, Gordon calculated that from 
1993 to 2008, the average growth in real household income was 1.3 percent per year. But for the bottom 99 percent, growth was only 0.75, a gap of 0.55 percent per year. The top one percent of the income distribution captured fully 52% of the income gains during that 15-year period.
In supplementary material emailed to The Times, Gordon acknowledged that
Globalization will add to U. S. growth in the same sense that economists have always argued that free trade creates more winners than losers. But the losers from globalization are those not only whose jobs are lost to imports and outsourcing, but those whose incomes are beaten down as foreign investment flocks to southern states with lower wages, and as corporations like Caterpillar are successful in extracting concessions on wages and benefits from their employees. And the winners are C.E.O.s of multinational companies like Caterpillar who see their profits and stock prices rise as they build factories abroad, whether or not any jobs are created at home.
Intellectually, both the Obama and Romney campaigns are undoubtedly aware of the general line of thinking that lies behind Gordon's analysis, and of related findings in books like "The Great Stagnation" by Tyler Cowen of George Mason University. Cowen argues that innovation has reached a "technological plateau" that rules out a return to the growth of the 20th century.
For Obama, the argument that America has run out of string is politically untouchable. In the case of Romney and the Republican Party, something very different appears to be taking place.
There are two parallel realizations driving policy thinking on the right. The first is the growing consciousness of the threat to the conservative coalition as its core constituency - white voters, and particularly married white Protestants - decreases as a share of the electorate. Similarly, the conservative political class recognizes that the halcyon days of shared growth, with the United States leading the world economy, may be over.
While Gordon projects a future of exacerbating inequality (as an ever-increasing share of declining productivity growth goes to the top), the wealthy are acutely aware that the political threat to their status and comfort would come from rising popular demand for policies of income redistribution.
It is for this reason that the Republican Party is determined to protect the Bush tax cuts; to prevent tax hikes; to further cut domestic social spending; and, more broadly, to take a machete to the welfare state.
Insofar as Republicans prevail in their twin aims of cutting - or even eliminating - social spending, and maintaining or lowering tax rates, they will have succeeded in obstructing the restoration of social insurance programs in the future.
Affluent Republicans - the donor and policy base of the conservative movement - are on red alert. They want to protect and enhance their position in a future of diminished resources. What really provokes the ferocity with which the right currently fights for regressive tax and spending policies is a deeply pessimistic vision premised on a future of hard times. This vision has prompted the Republican Party to adopt a preemptive strategy that anticipates the end of growth and the onset of sustained austerity - a strategy to make sure that the size of their slice of the pie doesn't get smaller as the pie shrinks.
This is the underlying and inadequately explored theme of the 2012 election.
 Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

HIGHLIGHT: Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. 

 BODY:
A quick generic note: I'm constantly facing critiques along the lines of "Now you say A, but back in 1996, or 2003, or something, you said B. You're not consistent!" Since I've written so much over the years, there's plenty of opportunity for this sort of trawling, and I don't have time to answer each case.
So what's going on? One of three things:
1. The situations are different.
2. I've changed my views based on events.
3. I've changed my view because I've learned something.
An example of (1): The Bush tax cuts were not at all comparable to the Obama stimulus. The tax cuts were supposed to be permanent, reducing revenue by a couple of percent of GDP in perpetuity (and they may well end up doing that), whereas stimulus has always been envisioned as a temporary measure (and has proved very temporary in practice). It's perfectly reasonable to worry about the effects of a willful permanent rise in the deficit that is the result of a "starve the beast" agenda but not worried about the effects of a temporary rise in response to a major crisis.
An example of (2): I used to be much more concerned about loss of investor confidence in the United States; the robustness of such confidence in advanced countries with monetary independence has been an important lesson.
An example of (3): I used to take the Pete Peterson "eek! aging population!" line too seriously; I didn't realize until I got more into it that health care costs, not demography, are the main story.
So, enough with the gotchas. Why not evaluate what I say on, you know, its merits?

HEADLINE: Norway Increases Carbon Tax on Domestic Production

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: With a new levy on its own offshore oil and gas resources, Norway raises the stakes in a global game of taxing carbon. 

 BODY:
Norway will nearly double the carbon dioxide tax rate for its offshore oil and gas production in 2013, the country's environment ministry announced last week.
By raising the tax rate from 210 Norwegian Krone to 410 Krone (or (EURO)28 to more than (EURO)55) per ton of CO2, the Norwegian government is setting one of the highest carbon tax rates in the world.
"The commitment to the environment must be followed up on in the budget and resolutions," said Brd Vegar Solhjell, minister of the environment.
Much of the newly generated tax revenue will go into governmental fund devoted to investing in clean energy, the environment and public transportation.
By 2013, 33 countries and 18 so-called sub-national jurisdictions will have some sort of levy associated with the emission of CO2, according to the Australian Climate Commission. In many cases, the tax will not only be a narrow tax on CO2 emissions themselves, but a "carbon price," a floor on the price of fuels that generate climate-changing emissions fixed by cap and trade schemes as well as taxes on coal, gasoline and transportation.
Many environmentalists are praising Norway's new tax, because it is high. But direct comparisons between carbon emission taxes or disincentives around the world are difficult. For example, Sweden's carbon tax is set at (EURO)101 per ton of carbon for consumers, but much less for its industrial producers.
The Australian Climate Commission produced a report to a global context for climate taxes and cost of CO12. See the graphic above and hereshowing what countries are doing around the globe. (For a bigger version of the map, clickhere.)
Australia, the most recent country to impose a new carbon tax, started levying 23 Australian Dollars (about (EURO)18) per ton of CO2 emitted in July. Before the tax went into effect the country was one of the world's biggest carbon polluters per capita, emitting 27.3 tons of CO2 per person, per year, according to its own figures. 
Though the carbon tax levied in Australia is much lower than the one just announced by Norway, Australian consumers worried that they would feel the effects of their tax in their wallets.
Here is a video produced by Clean Energy Future that sells the relatively unpopular idea.
Norway's steep increase in carbon taxes for energy producers is seen by many as exemplary, especially as it adds to an already green fiscal policy in place in Norway for decades.
''The EU prefers a system that taxes more of what we burn and less of what we earn. If we want to consume less energy, we need a smarter way of taxing," said Isaac Valero-Ladron, [#x2028]EU Spokesman for Climate Action in response to Norway's new tax.
Mr. Valero-Ladron points to the successes of environmentally progressive tax schemes put into place in Northern European countries during the nineties. According to his data, these tax policies have already led to significantly lower levels of CO2 emissions without impacting economic growth.
"The higher the tax, the more aggressive a signal the government is going to send about the need to lower carbon emissions," said Janet E. Milne, a professor at the Vermont Law School and the director of its Environmental Tax Policy Institute.
"You have to get fairly high carbon tax rates in order to get a significant long term change in behavior," she said.

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Revamp Education

BYLINE: JUDY DEMPSEY


HIGHLIGHT: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is calling for a restructuring of education that would put the emphasis on quality, not quantity, but European governments, instead, are chiseling away at their education budgets. 

 BODY:
BERLIN - Some European countries are cutting back on education spending to help their budgets at a time when it seems like Europe needs skilled and educated workers more than ever, a subject I write about in my Letter from Europe this week. 
Students and teachers in Italy, Spain and Great Britain have been protesting against sharp cuts in funding. 
In the case of Britain, the introduction of hefty tuition fees at universities means that would-be students will be forced either to take out loans in the hope that they get a well-paid job upon graduating or put off going to college until they can afford it.
A report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development argues that now is the ideal time for governments to radically restructure the entire education sector. 
But the O.E.C.D. calls for a restructuring that would invest with the emphasis on quality, not quantity. Secondary school teachers, for example, should be very well paid to attract the best, and universities should be run much more efficiently, the O.E.C.D. argues, noting the contrast with the approach in much of Asia. 
Secondary school teachers in Asia are relatively well paid and enjoy a higher social standing than those in Europe, according to the O.E.C.D. Indeed, it is rare to find any Asian government cutting back on education, financial crisis or no financial crisis. Education is considered sacrosanct and the key to the region's competitiveness.
Governments in Europe, in contrast, are chiseling away at education budgets instead of using the financial crisis to reallocate funds to education as part of an overhaul of the system. 
Take the cases of Spain and Greece. 
During the boom years, Spain's regional governments went on a spending spree, building new universities and expanding campuses. This led to more young people achieving higher education. But the dropout rate and the quality of courses left much to be desired, according to the O.E.C.D. Better to focus on quality, not quantity, the O.E.C.D. recommends.
In the case of Greece, there were too many university courses that were poorly attended, and the recruitment of secondary school teachers was not rigorous enough to ensure good teaching, according to the O.E.C.D.
The case for reform in Greece is obvious. The country cannot afford to cut education resources radically, and there is one place where more money for better schools and universities could come from: the defense budget.
Greek defense spending still accounts for 2.1 percent of gross domestic product, according to NATO. After the United States, Greece is the second biggest defense spender among the 27 NATO countries in relation to its gross domestic product. That is astonishing for a country in a deep economic crisis and in need of investment in the crucial area of education.

As many of the social structures we have relied on in the past for retirement seem to disappear or appear vulnerable (company pensions and Social Security to name two), we're becoming increasingly more responsible for our own financial futures. But at the same time we're overwhelmed with information about how to handle our money.
Never before have we had so much information at our fingertips about how to handle money, and never before have so many of us felt out of control. Sorting though this noise is more important than ever before, not only for our financial futures but for our mental health.
Think I'm overstating the problem?
In 2011, IDC Digital Universe published a study, "Extracting Value from Chaos." It found we have 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 billion terabytes) of data floating around. What does that look like

        
Every person in the United States tweeting 3 tweets per minute for 26,976 years nonstop
        
Every person in the world having over 215 million high-resolution MRI scans per day
        
Over 200 billion high definition movies (each 2 hours in length), which would take one person 47 million years to watch if that person watched for 24 hours a day
        
The amount of information needed to fill 57.5 billion 32 gigabyte Apple iPads.
In 2012, that number is expected to grow to 2.7 zettabytes.
Obviously, it's easy to get distracted. And based on the questions I get, people are really distracted when it comes to money.

        
Should I buy this stock?
        
What do you think the market will do?
        
Will Europe go down in flames?
        
Will the economy ever recover?
But what if instead of asking those questions, we asked just these questions:

        
How much can I save?
        
How is my portfolio allocated?
        
Can I pick up some extra work this month?
        
Can I start a little business on the side?
By asking these questions we switch our focus to things we have at least some control over. We start to focus on our personal economy, instead of the global economy. Our personal economy becomes the filter for all the noise. Things like Europe, the market, and individual stocks drop off our radar. Instead, we focus on information that helps us with the one thing we can control: ourselves.
Obviously with so much noise, it can be incredibly hard to get this focused. But the sooner you figure out the value of this filter, the faster you'll be able to make sense of the noise.
So besides burying your head in the sand, what have you done to filter the noise?

HEADLINE: Answers to Readers' Questions About Wittenberg and the Marathon

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Ken Belson and Juliet Macur of The Times answers questions from readers about Mary Wittenberg and the New York City Marathon. 

 BODY:
 10:21 a.m. | Updated The New York City Marathon, the marquee event of New York Road Runners, will be held this year on Nov. 4. The organization is led by Mary Wittenberg, one of the most influential women in sports. 
In an article published in Sunday's edition of The New York Times, Ken Belson and Juliet Macur reported that the rapid growth of the Road Runners has irritated some runners and officials. Here, Ken Belson and Juliet Macur answer questions from readers about the article. You can still post questions in the comment area below and answers will be posted through Tuesday morning.
 Q. 
Concerning the added expense of the New York Police Department during the New York City Marathon: Has the benefit to the city in economic gain and the resulting tax revenue rippling down from the event been calculated into mitigating the cost equation of entry fee? If not, would the city consider directing tax revenue directly applicable to the event towards the New York Police Department, reducing the burden of the registration cost shared by runners?--H. Schiffman, New York City
 A. 
The additional police fees cover traffic control, not security costs. The Road Runners was asked to pay 70 percent of those costs this year and 100 percent next year. The economic benefits are in the hundreds of millions, but of course, they are dispersed across the city to hotels, restaurants and so on. It would be hard for the Road Runners to use that income to offset the price of its entry fees because it doesn't collect the additional sales taxes that the city collects.
Whether the city would turn over a portion of that money (or give it to the New York Police Department to get them to reduce what they charge the Road Runners) is a question that the Bloomberg administration would have to answer. My personal view is that is unlikely because the city would then get bombarded with requests from other races and be accused of favoritism.--Ken Belson 
 Q. 
For years, the Road Runners was a member-driven organization. Under Wittenberg's direction, it primary purpose has been to serve her agenda. Decision after decision has shown her hubris and her disinterest in the members, whose support helped build the organization.
If the writers had spoken to more long-standing members, they would have found a far higher level of dissatisfaction than they reported. A level of dissatisfaction tempered with resignation since the average member no longer has a voice. For example, the writers off-handedly mention that members must run nine Road Runners races and volunteer at another to get guaranteed admission to the New York City Marathon. What they fail to mention is when "volunteering" is mandatory, it is hardly volunteering. Especially when this is a decision that was simply made and announced by Wittenberg and her team. Much like the ill-fated decision to end the baggage drop for the marathon.
There's also a concern among many members that the growth in the number of participants in the marathon has come at the expense of better runners. Given the prestige of the New York race, it makes sense to attract a deep field of good runners, down to local levels. At a minimum, there should be basic standard of performance that guarantees entry to better runners. --David Hales, New York City
 A. 
Thanks for your thoughts. We certainly heard an earful from some of the long-standing members you mention, including some who joined the Road Runners before Fred Lebow arrived on the scene. Some of them echoed your concerns, especially what they felt was the concentration of decision-making and the subsequent dilution of the voices of rank-and-file members. They also addressed your thoughts on the growth in the number of runners in the marathon coming at the expense of other, better runners.
Mary Wittenberg, though, didn't turn the marathon into a mass race, Fred Lebow did. Her goal has been to find ways of attracting new runners to the sport, and she has used the marathon as one of the vehicles for doing that. Her mission has been endorsed by the Road Runners' board and, based on some of the comments linked to our story, many in the running community. We tried to represent both of these positions in our story.--Ken Belson 
 Q. 
I too worry about the number of participants and the quality of the race experience. I'm a mid-first wave runner and attest to the crowding on and just off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Hopefully adding a fourth wave will reduce this congestion. It's still a great race and a great day for the city, but as the number of participants increases my enjoyment of the experience has decreased. The whole no-baggage fiasco was an attempt by Wittenberg to cram more people into the race while reducing congestion at the finish line. Do we really need more people in the race? Whose purpose does this serve? Andrew P., New York City
 A. 
The bag policy was aimed at reducing congestion at the finish line and, I suspect, placating the neighbors near the park. Say what you will about the way it was initially handled, but the Road Runners reversed course pretty quickly in recognition of the reaction. Whether that stands next year is another question.
Setting aside the question of whether more people should be in the race, it is clear that the demand to be included continues to grow. There were more than 141,000 applicants to run in this year's race, up from about 92,000 when Wittenberg took over. In some ways, the Road Runners is simply accommodating the intense interest in running the New York City Marathon. It is analogous to owning a popular restaurant and deciding whether to expand to keep up with all the diners. Only in this case, the additional runners allow the Road Runners to fund other projects, like getting young kids to run.--Ken Belson 
 Q. 
Changes under Wittenberg have been dramatic but, disturbingly, not obviously beneficial to the local running community or club members. As a member, most of the changes seem to have been driven by a singular focus on growth and that's exactly what we've seen. In your article, Wittenberg provides some rationale but I found most of it unsatisfactory. But, most disturbing, is her ultimate justification which borders on zealotry. When challenged, she finds comfort in the words of the late Grete Waitz who would regularly inform her that the late Fred Lebow would approve of the club's new direction. This anecdote is at first humanizing but, on reflection, it explains much of what has gone on. The club's leader continues to make wildly unpopular decisions on the basis of support from beyond the grave. I cannot say what Lebow would think of crowded and expensive races or marathon baggage policies. But, wouldn't the community be better served if these things were weighed on their merits rather than Wittenberg's belief of WWFD? And shouldn't the Road Runners board require more than prophetic statements to support major policy changes?--SJG, New York City
 A. 
I can't speak for Grete Waitz or Fred Lebow, and I've never been much for sances. But based on our reporting, it is clear that the majority of board members at the Road Runners fully approve of Wittenberg and the direction she has taken the organization. There may be disagreements about degree and emphasis, but they support the overall platform she has created. Whether the board is made up of friendly members is a more fundamental question. Several former board members believe the composition of the board has changed dramatically over the years and that board members are chosen more for their professional affiliations and fund raising skills than their love of the sport. Those views were included in our story.--Ken Belson 
 Q. 
Is there a reason to strive for a higher profile for the New York City Marathon? I wonder what this does for the marathon, the city and running in general. And, more importantly, is it even possible to raise the race's profile. Maybe I'm biased but I believe it is one of the best-known marathons in the world. Sure there are people (amateurs and elite athletes) who may prefer one event over another. But this is, and has been, a well-known, well-attended and generally well-appreciated event. Only a modern day growth obsessed mentality can look at the New York City Marathon and say it needs more of something.--SJG, New York City
 A. 
This is a complicated question. The Road Runners promotes the marathon not just because it's the most notable race on its calendar, but because it has the potential to raise money from television networks, sponsors and other sources that can fund other ambitions, like charitable giving. At its best, it is a virtuous cycle: The more runners who attend, the larger the television audience, the more sponsors want to get involved, the more money raised for the Road Runners and the more, in theory, they can do with it.
It's worth nothing that Wittenberg has tried to broaden the calendar to include events on the Friday and Saturday before the marathon to make the event more appealing for runners and their families, particularly those who come great distances to attend. This is a page out of the N.F.L.'s playbook and events like the college draft and the Super Bowl, which have turned into week-long extravaganzas.
You may consider this overkill, but it is the way of sports these days.--Ken Belson 
 Q. 
The article states, "...Wittenberg...tries to run in most of the club's races to stay attuned to the runners' experience.." A sub 6:00 minute / mile runner does not experience the packed starting line and crowded conditions that the average runner feels. I ran the New York City Marathon in 1991 (when I lived in New York) and thought it was "lively" and fun. I ran it again in 1999 (after moving down to Georgia) and experienced a different race entirely: it was overpriced, overcrowded and miserable. The field didn't open up until the 15th mile. To add insult to injury, I arrived at the expo to find only men's extra large shirts were left (I did not arrive last minute to the expo).
I spent a heck of a lot of money on a flight, hotel, meals etc. to experience a packed race that didn't even provide a decent fitting shirt. I love New York but you can keep the New York City Marathon...--Kimarie, Roswell, Ga.
 A. 
Thanks for your comments on how the New York City Marathon went from "lively and fun" in 1991 to "overcrowded, overpriced and miserable" in 1999. I was curious to see how many runners finished the 1991 New York City Marathon and looked up The Times' story on it. As it turns out, it was so big - more than 25,797 finishers - that the finish line chutes were "almost, but not quite, overwhelmed by arriving runners," according to The Times. It was the largest marathon held anywhere.
Fred Lebow, the chief executive of the Road Runners then, said no race would ever be as big. "We had too many runners," he said, adding that he had miscalculated how many runners would be no-shows. He said 25,000 finishers were ideal. (So much for that, though: the next year, the race had 27,797 finishers.)
As we know now, the marathon just kept growing and has nearly doubled since then. The wave system has helped clear up some of the congestion, but it is still a mass race that has lost some of the intimacy - and some of the fun, as far as you and some others are concerned - that was a feature of the earlier New York City Marathons.
Regarding your T-shirt issue, I can't say that I have an explanation for their lack of smaller T-shirts. Maybe the Road Runners should ask you for your T-shirt size on the race's registration form, so they can better estimate the sizes of T-shirts they need. Or maybe they just expected small runners to take that XL shirt, belt it and wear it as a mini-dress.--Juliet Macur 
 Q. 
I'm hoping to run New York City next year. I've completed eight runs, one to go. I have no problem with mandatory volunteering! It takes hundreds of people to have a good race. We should all volunteer without being asked. It's not fair for the same people to do it every time. And it's fun and you meet great people. I've seen runners being very hostile to volunteers. This is awful! And yes, we should stay out of the bike lanes! There are always runners who think the rules don't apply to them but we should be good citizens and get back in the lanes when the volunteers ask. Most runners are really nice, happy people who are polite and follow the rules so that everyone will have a good time. I hate to see those mean, arrogant few who ruin what should be a pleasant experience and who give us all a bad name.
I have gotten responses to my emails to Road Runners, I've had personal chats with Mary at some of the runs; at the Bronx 10 miler Mary was running up and back from the start encouraging people, and when you really think about it you'll find you don't need to bring luggage to a race. Go Mary!--Runnerrose, Long Island, N.Y.
 A. 
Thanks for your comments. I think you are one of many Road Runners members who enjoy volunteering at races. At the Fifth Avenue Mile, I saw a legion of volunteers - particularly those at registration - who were nothing but peppy when runners came to collect their race packets. Several of them waved at Mary Wittenberg and told her they appreciated the work she was doing. (Come to think of it, were you a volunteer at the Fifth Avenue Mile?) I didn't see any of those rude runners you said you've come into contact with. Maybe everyone had their coffee and got up on the right side of their beds that day.
Mary Wittenberg is definitely not one of those cranky runners. As I saw during my day with her at the Fifth Avenue Mile, she was all smiles and ran up and down the course cheering people on, just like you saw her do at the Bronx 10-miler. Her energy is unmatched and enviable. And I don't even think she drinks caffeinated drinks, either.
As for runners in bike lanes, I am a big proponent of everyone staying in their respective lanes on the road. Ever see a bicyclist hit a pedestrian? Not pretty!--Juliet Macur 
 Q. 
What is the mission of New York Road Runners? I personally feel that over the recent years, they have gotten away from what I perceive as their original mission and have many scattered missions.
Originally, they were a local running organization which organized numerous local area races of various distances. This is very different from organizing world-class events (New York City Marathon, New York City Half Marathon), having a running program in schools, having a major charity program, promoting running in third world countries, etc, etc, etc. These are all good activities, but I believe they take away greatly from the original mission of the organization as it operated from the 1958 founding of the New York Road Runners Club until the last decade or so.
So perhaps they should be split into more than one organization, with one of these just to stage local races, which is why the New York Road Runners Club was founded. Thoughts?--David, Katonah, N.Y.
 A. 
It is true that the New York Road Runners has a broader mission that includes promoting fitness and health, not just road racing. This mission has evolved over many years, but has been amplified in some ways when the New York Road Runners merged operations with its foundation.
From my reporting, I can tell you that the New York Road Runners' multi-tiered strategy of staging races, promoting elite runners and trying to get the young and old to exercise more is unique among running clubs. Part of it is also in response to, for instance, rising obesity rates and the New York Road Runners' desire to have a higher civic mission. I don't think the New York Road Runners is going to revert back to the days when it focused the majority of its energy on staging races.--Ken Belson

HEADLINE: Bulls and Bears Fight It Out, in Courts

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Intrigue continues to circle around Silvercorp Metals, a Chinese mining company incorporated in Canada and traded in New York, with new investigations about its financial dealings reported. 

 BODY:
 5:17 p.m. | Updated with Silvercorp office declining to comment, and closing stock price. 
The saga of Silvercorp Metals, a Chinese mining company based in Canada and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, continues to unfold with a lot of legal action -- and precious little in the way of certainty about whether the company's claims are true.
As I wrote in July, short-sellers have challenged the company's claims about its reserves. The company, indignantly denying the allegations, has begun legal attacks in three countries. So far it seems to be winning at home and losing abroad.
Now Jon Carnes, the president of Eos Holdings, a hedge fund that is short Silvercorp, says he has been informed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have started a formal investigation into Silvercorp, in response to a complaint filed by Mr. Carnes. He said the complaint asserted that the company had improperly financed an investigation by the local police in Luoyang, a Chinese town where a Silvercorp subsidiary is based.
Kun Huang, a researcher for Eos, has been imprisoned in Luoyang since July, although no criminal charges have been filed.
Based on Mr. Huang's research, which included arranging for the analysis of rocks that fell off trucks leaving Silvercorp's Ying mine, Mr. Carnes questioned both the quality and the quantity of Silvercorp's silver reserves. 
The company has since reduced its estimates of its reserves, but it has indignantly denied it made incorrect statements. It sued Mr. Carnes and others in a New York court, claiming he was part of a "short and distort" campaign to drive down the company's stock price. That suit was dismissed, but Silvercorp said it would appeal.
A related suit against an Australian hedge fund manager is pending in a Canadian court.
Silvercorp referred inquiries on Monday to its investor relations office in Vancouver. That office declined to comment on whether it had been notified of a formal investigation, or whether it had an obligation to disclose such an investigation. 
Mr. Huang's supporters have established a Web site -- which does not indicate who is responsible for it -- titled "Public Company Prisoner."
The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail has reported extensively on the case, citing evidence that the company did pay for the police investigation but quoting company officials as denying it.
George Prouse, the head of the R.C.M.P. unit that Mr. Carnes said had begun a formal investigation, refused to comment.
The New York Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The battle over the stock price is, so far, inconclusive. The shares, which trade under the symbol SVM, closed at $5.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon, less than half the $12.70 price of the shares in a 2010 secondary offering underwritten by CIBC World Markets and BMO Nesbitt Burns. But the price is above the $4.84 low reached this spring.
Silvercorp's auditors, from the Canadian affiliate of Ernst & Young, have signed off on company audits, but auditors have been fooled by other Chinese companies, and many investors fear that such audits cannot be trusted. Efforts by the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to arrange joint inspections of those companies with Chinese officials have so far been unsuccessful, although China has agreed in principle that American officials could observe Chinese inspections.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Negotiations Resume, Along With Battle for Public Opinion

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Talks between the N.H.L. and the players' association are scheduled to resume Tuesday morning in Toronto, but Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union, said he did not expect substantive discussions on the core economic issues dividing the two sides in the 30-day lockout. 

 BODY:
Talks between the N.H.L. and the players association are scheduled to resume Tuesday morning in Toronto, but Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union, said he did not expect substantive discussions on the core economic issues dividing the two sides in the 30-day lockout.
Fehr dismissed speculation that the union would present a new offer radically different from previous ones.
"I don't know where that comes from," he said. "It's just somebody's guess."
Fehr added that the meeting was aimed at finding ways to break the current logjam in negotiations, so that bargaining can begin on the core economic issues. Neither side has made a new offer on core economics since Sept. 12. The owners are demanding a reduction in the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 47 percent. The players have proposed accepting diminished pay raises that would reduce their share to about 53 percent.
The first two weeks of the regular-season schedule have been canceled, and more cancellations are expected at the end of the week. On Monday the players missed the first of 13 bimonthly paychecks for the 2012-13 season. But they are also set to receive an escrow check from last season that comes to about 8 percent of their 2011-12 salary.
The sides will meet a day after the Web site Deadspin obtained details of a focus group last week in Washington, conducted on the N.H.L.'s behalf by Frank Luntz, the top Republican strategist responsible for coining terms like climate change and government takeover.
The Deadspin report said that the N.H.L. was seeking ways to reframe public opinion that is generally unfavorable to the owners. According to one participant, Luntz stressed the phrase "shared sacrifice" on the focus group of N.H.L. fans, suggesting that the league may portray the players as being unwilling to bargain.
Luntz's focus group material also asked which images from an array of pictures made the participants miss hockey the most. The images appeared to include one of the enforcer Derek Boogaard throwing punches as a member of the Minnesota Wild. Boogaard died last year of a drug and alcohol overdose, and a study of his brain revealed that he sustained extensive damage believed to be related to his hockey career.
Luntz posted a message on Twitter, which was removed Monday night, looking for fans in New York to participate in a focus group next week.
Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, speaking on behalf of the league and owners, has frequently criticized the union for not making new offers, but Fehr said that the charge was inaccurate.
"The notion that because somebody repeats something innumerable times, that then makes it true, I just never believed," he said. "We made a series of proposals designed to meet some of their objections, and they chose to treat them as, 'Oh, this looks more similar to your last proposal than we would have liked, so I'm not going to treat it as a new proposal.'
"I can give you a dog named Rover and you can tell me it's really Fido all you want. I don't know what to do about that."

HEADLINE: Fed Governor's Plan to Limit Bank Size Fuels Debate

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The proposal by Daniel Tarullo could indicate a shift in the discussion over "too big to fail" financial institutions. 

 BODY:
Since the financial crisis, academics, politicians and even former bank chieftains have called for the nation's banking behemoths to be broken up or shrunk - calls that appear to have fallen largely on deaf ears among Washington's policy makers.
Now, a powerful insider has suggested a simple tool that could place a tight limit on the size of individual banks. Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor who oversees bank regulation, said in a speech last week that an important part of a bank's balance sheet could be capped at a set percentage of the nation's gross domestic product.
That a regulator at the Fed - the most powerful of the banking industry's overseers - would say that such a structural overhaul of the financial system might be considered, was a sign that the policy debate over what to do about "too big to fail" might be shifting.
 Mr. Tarullo's "statements mark a significant - perhaps even dramatic - shift in thinking at the central bank," Simon Johnson wrote in a recent column for Bloomberg News. Mr. Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been a leading voice in the movement to limit the size of large banks.
It's not just that the Fed governor's words provided comfort to supporters of breaking up the banks. They also come at a moment in the debate over the Dodd-Frank Act, when both Republicans and Democrats might be able find common ground.
Mitt Romney and other Republicans have criticized Dodd-Frank, contending that it is overly complex and protects "too big to fail" institutions. Some Republicans looking to repeal Dodd-Frank say they still want to constrain large banks. Their concern is that the law may lead the market to believe that the government protects large banks. In turn, investors might then provide cheap loans to the biggest banks, fueling even more growth in the banks' balance sheets. As a result, some Republicans may warm to the simple cap on bank size outlined in Mr. Tarullo's speech.
"I am completely open to the proposal because of my similar concern about the growing size of institutions that are too big to fail," said Senator David Vitter, a Republican of Louisiana. "Beyond this specific proposal, there is a growing nonpartisan consensus to do a lot more to limit the size of the megabanks."
Any shift at the Federal Reserve would be notable. The central bank, mindful of the stability of the financial system, has avoided giving strong backing to measures that could have a direct impact on bank size.
Mr. Tarullo did not give an unequivocal, personal backing to a cap on size of banks. But he said that if size were to become a big issue, Congress should take it up, so the effects of a cap could be debated. Mr. Tarullo then detailed a type of cap that he said seemed to have "the most promise."
His proposed limit would focus on something called "nondeposit liabilities." These are the borrowings that banks do to finance themselves, excluding deposits.
For example, at the end of June, JPMorgan Chase had $1.24 trillion of nondeposit liabilities, a figure that excludes deposits in the United States, but includes international deposits.
That $1.24 trillion is equivalent to 8 percent of G.D.P. Any legislation would have to decide whether to set a percentage that would immediately force a bank like JPMorgan to shrink. If it were set at 5 percent, JPMorgan would have to shed the excess borrowings, which in turn would lead it to cut its overall size.
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, introduced legislation earlier this year that proposed the cap be set at 2 percent of G.D.P., which would force several of the largest banks, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, to shrink aggressively. (That bill has not advanced.)
Alternatively, the cap could be set at a percentage of G.D.P. that allows banks to stay at close to their current size. In that case, it would just constrain future growth.
Dodd-Frank has a provision that sets out to limit the relative size of banks. It stipulates that banks cannot have liabilities that exceed 10 percent of the total financial system's liabilities. But this may not cap bank growth if the whole system is ballooning, as happened in the last decade. From 1999 to 2007, the Goldman Sachs balance sheet grew by 346 percent. But it would have increased by only 48 percent if its growth had been strictly tied to G.D.P. growth in that period.
The cap has its critics.
One drawback is that it might deter banks from issuing longer-term debt, which can act as a stable source of financing in a crisis. Hal S. Scott, a professor in Harvard Law School, said it would be preferable to limit short-term borrowings by banks, since that is more vulnerable to bank runs.
Others say that the economy needs both large and small banks and growth could be harmed by efforts to dictate bank size.
"The costs to society would outweigh the benefits," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. "But I realize that the idea of setting limits on large banks is gaining popularity across the political spectrum."
Others fear that an inordinate focus on one tool to deal with financial stability could backfire. They think that the multifaceted approach of Dodd-Frank is better at catching and moderating the risks in the banking system.
"I think it's a mistake to think there's some sort of silver bullet here," said Michael S. Barr, professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Mr. Barr worked on Dodd-Frank as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department. He also says he thinks that going back right now and undoing parts of Dodd-Frank would most likely only dilute the overhaul.
"If Congress took up reform, it would only be in the direction of weakening it, not strengthening it," he said.

HEADLINE: Off Year on Wall St. Drove Down Manhattan Wages, Data Show

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A cutback in year-end bonuses on Wall Street was the main reason Manhattan was the only large county in the country to record a drop in wages for the 12 months that ended in March. 

 BODY:
 Despite all of the Bloomberg administration's efforts to diversify New York City's economy, the latest data on wages show that Wall Street still has an outsize effect on income.
 A cutback in year-end bonuses on Wall Street was the main reason Manhattan was the only large county in the country to record a decline in wages in the latest 12-month period for which figures are available, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York.
 The average weekly wage paid in Manhattan was 6.3 percent lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the first quarter of 2011, the bureau said. It said that the total wages paid to workers in financial services in Manhattan fell by $5.3 billion, or 13.4 percent, in those 12 months. 
 The first quarter is the most important in New York because that is when most Wall Street firms hand out the bonuses that account for most of the annual income for their best-paid workers. The city and state rely on those bonuses to yield taxes and fuel spending and hiring.
 Manhattan still had by far the nation's highest average weekly wage, $2,464, more than $500 higher than for the runner-up, Santa Clara County, Calif., the home of Silicon Valley. The rest of the 10 biggest counties all recorded increases in wages, led by San Diego, where the average weekly wage rose 7.5 percent.
 At the same time, Manhattan added more jobs (53,000) in the 12 months that ended March 31 than all but one of the other large counties in the country. Harris County, Tex., which contains Houston, added 70,400 jobs during the same 12 months, the bureau reported.

HEADLINE: M.T.A.'s Choices of Fare Structures Draw Mixed Reactions

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Here are some readers' responses to City Room's request for comments on the fare restructuring choices presented by the M.T.A. 

 BODY:
The multiple-choice question placed on the table by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Monday does not have a none-of-the-above option, unfortunately. 
One way or another, it looks like subway and bus fares are going up. But the authority has not decided yet how to distribute the pain - additionally burden regular riders, occasional users, or both? -- and is seeking public input. We asked readers their thoughts on four possibilities presented by the authority:
1. Leave base fare at $2.25. Increase 30-day unlimited-ride MetroCard price to $125 from $104. Cut 7-percent bonus on pay-per-ride cards to 5 percent.
2. Leave base fare at $2.25. Increase 30-day unlimited card price to $119. Eliminate pay-per-ride bonus.
3. Increase base fare to $2.50. Increase 30-day unlimited card to $109. Eliminate pay-per-ride bonus.
4. Increase base fare to $2.50. Increase 30-day unlimited card to $112. Keep 7-percent pay-per-ride bonus intact.
Here are some of your responses:
The bonuses are a pain if they are not full increments. Option #3 is best as it's the only one that keeps the monthly worthwhile. The raise on single is painful, but at least it will be eliminate all those cards with scattered remainder amounts.
 -- Dennis, NYC 
The bulk of the increase should be to the unlimited card(s) - these provide very low fares with high usage. (I pay less than a dollar per ride based on using a 30-day card an average of 3 times a day or more.) The idea of higher usage benefitting the MTA doesn't apply here; I am paying a lower fare than I probably did 20-30 years ago (with inflation factored in).
 -- Ed B., NYC 
I prefer the larger % increase on single rides and weekly unlimited, while keeping monthly unlimited cards close to or at current rates. Single rides & weekly cards are largely used by tourists, let them bear the burden of the fare increase, not local workers who use MTA every single day to get around the city and largely use a monthly unlimited card to do so.
 -- Chris, NYC 
Stop raising the price of the 30-day card (it's not a monthly card) so aggressively. When I buy the 30-day card, the MTA gets the use of my money in one lump sum up front. You would think they would encourage that, rather than encouraging people to buy one ride at a time.
 -- Dr. Edna, New York 
I would think the single-fare user base includes a significant percentage of riders with lower incomes; that is, ones who often have to get somewhere (e.g., home where the children are waiting; to work in the morning after they leave for school) but can't afford to pull together more than that single fare at that moment. Ipso facto: these are the residents we least want to place an economic burden on. When in doubt always think first about the resident of the city at the bottom of the economic ladder!
 -- lynneb, northampton, ma 
Number (1) of the above choices. But my first choice would be to eliminate the unlimited ride options. Those buyers tend to be commuters. The MTA has to buy extra train cars to accommodate the commute period. The power companies charge more during peak usage. They have to build extra plants just to cover such times. I see no reason why we should be giving discounts to peak time transit users.
 -- Don Wiss, Brooklyn, NY

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal in Mongolia Threatens Rio Tinto Project

BYLINE: WILLIAM MACNAMARA


HIGHLIGHT: Mongolia's new government is in the process of passing a 2013 budget whose draft proposal includes increasing taxes and royalties on a huge copper mine by $300 million. If Rio Tinto seeks international arbitration to resolve the issue, it could delay the start date for the mine. 

 BODY:
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia - Rio Tinto's biggest new mining project is under threat after the government of Mongolia said it was considering whether to renegotiate an investment agreement involving the $6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper mine. 
Mongolia's new government is in the process of passing a 2013 budget whose draft proposal includes increasing taxes and royalties on the mine by $300 million.
The mining industry has been a boon for the sparsely populated Mongolia, driven in large part after an agreement in 2009 for the copper mine at Oyu Tolgoi.
The deal awarded a 66 percent share of the mine to Turquoise Hill Resources, formerly Ivanhoe Mines, whose majority owner is Rio Tinto, the multinational mining company with headquarters in Melbourne and London. The agreement in 2009 froze tax rates over the life of the mine. It safeguarded the project for Rio Tinto and its suppliers, which began spending billions of dollars to build a vast copper mine in the Gobi Desert.
Even an attempt at renegotiation could hurt Rio Tinto. If the company seeks international arbitration to resolve the issue, it could delay the start date for the mine. Construction is almost complete, with commercial production expected to start in 2013.
In Ulan Bator, however, investors and foreign governments are more worried about the effect of renegotiation on the country's growth rate.
"If there appears to be an attempt at renegotiating or somehow reneging on the investment agreement, that could have a possibly catastrophic effect on the country," said David Wyche, the economic section chief at the United States Embassy in Ulan Bator. "It could stop the flow of foreign capital into Mongolia."
Last week, the caucus of Mongolia's Democratic Party, which leads a coalition government in place since August, passed a budget proposal that called for a new sliding royalty on Oyu Tolgoi's revenue that would rise to 20 percent depending on the copper price. The 2009 investment agreement set the royalty rate at 5 percent.
The new plan would also raise Oyu Tolgoi's effective tax rate by eliminating income-tax allowances. The government would bring in 221.3 billion tugriks, or $160 million, from the royalty and 224.5 billion tugriks, or $163 million, from corporate income tax, according to estimates in the draft budget proposal.
This week, the plan is expected to reach Parliament, which will decide whether to adopt or modify the proposal.
The budget is crucial for Mongolia, which faces a fiscal deficit this year that is expected to widen next year. Revenue from coal, the country's biggest export, plunged over the summer, national statistics show, because of a drop in both price and volume. Mongolia's mining boom depends on commodities demand from China, whose economy has slowed this year.
To date, Rio Tinto and its partners in the Oyu Tolgoi project have spent $6.2 billion building the mine. The project still requires billions of dollars to expand the mine, which is taking shape 1,300 meters beneath the surface of the Gobi Desert.

HEADLINE: Times to Add Portuguese-Language Edition

BYLINE: TANZINA VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: The new Web site, intended to reach readers in Brazil, will publish 30 to 40 articles a day with content on subjects like business, culture and global affairs. 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company, continuing its drive to expand its international presence, is adding a Portuguese-language edition next year.
The Web site, intended to bring Times journalism to readers in Brazil, will begin in the second half of 2013. The site will offer content on subjects including business, culture and global affairs, the company said in a statement Sunday evening. 
The site will publish 30 to 40 articles a day from local writers, New York Times staff members and International Herald Tribune staff members, whose articles will be translated from English to Portuguese. The company said it expects to add graphics and multimedia over time and at least one-third of the content on the site will be content created exclusively for the Web site.
The site's editor, who has not yet been selected, will report to Joseph Kahn, the foreign editor of The Times. The headquarters for the site will be in So Paulo. The Times also has a bureau in Rio de Janeiro.
"Brazil is an international hub for business that boasts a robust economy, which has brought more and more people into the middle class," Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman of The New York Times Company and publisher of The New York Times, said in a statement, "As the world gets smaller and digital technology enables us to reach around the globe to attract readers with an interest in high-quality news, Brazil is a perfect place for The New York Times to take the next step in expanding our global reach."
On Monday afternoon, Mr. Sulzberger was scheduled to speak at the Inter American Press Association General Assembly in So Paulo.
The Web site is the latest sign of the company's effort to extend its global reach. The Times's Chinese Web site, which has been in a testing phase since earlier this summer, will have its official debut in November.

HEADLINE: Contraceptive Economics

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Public support for effective contraception choices makes good economic sense, by a cost-benefit analysis of the sort Republicans otherwise embrace, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Americans passionately disagree about both the biology and the morality of contraception. Even many who skillfully practice what Thomas Robert Malthus termed the "improper arts" consider it a personal and, ideally, completely private choice. 
But private choices are constrained by public policies. Both behavioral economics and recent empirical research help explain why access to long-acting, reliable, safe and reversible methods of contraception should be considered a public health priority.
Recent news coverage shows a pathological level of misinformation in some quarters, embodied in the assertion by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri, that "legitimate" rape victims could never become pregnant against their will. On a more amusing note, a group of Catholic nuns in Ohio released a video contending that women who use contraceptives are less sexually attractive to men (feminist bloggers at Jezebel had a good time with this one). 
Conservatives with an accurate grasp of biology are more likely to use a strategy of trivialization. The Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan labels Sandra Fluke, Georgetown law student, as a "ninny" for suggesting that insurance coverage of contraception is a serious issue. Carrie Lukas, writing for National Review Online, derides the Democrats' "cartoonish appeal to women to vote based on their 'lady parts.'" 
A more polite and perhaps more effective approach is simple avoidance. Ann Romney, asked whether she believed that employer-provided health insurance should be required to cover birth control, replied: "You're asking me questions that are not about what this election is going to be about. This election is going to be about the economy and jobs."

But unintended pregnancies - which account for about half of all pregnancies - have huge economic consequences for women's employment, family welfare, public spending and children's health. In a recent Guttmacher Institute study of women at 22 family planning clinics in 13 states, the most frequently cited reason given for using contraception was inability to take care of a baby at the time. 
The Guttmacher Institute estimates that unintended pregnancy costs American taxpayers roughly $11 billion each year.
A report by Adam Thomas published in March by the Brookings Institution shows that unintended pregnancies are disproportionately concentrated among women who are unmarried, teenage and poor. It also summarizes evidence that these pregnancies set in motion a series of unfortunate outcomes that effectively reproduce poverty. 
Conventional economic theory, still taught in many college classrooms, assumes that individual decisions reflect rational choices. From this perspective, a woman who engages in sexual intercourse without making the effort required to make low-cost methods of contraception succeed (which typically includes finding a partner willing to cooperate, as with use of a condom) must either be unpardonably ignorant or trying to get pregnant.
Behavioral economics, on the other hand, emphasizes that people often lack self-control, particularly when affected by "visceral factors," such as hunger, thirst and sexual desire.
From this perspective, people need to protect themselves, pre-emptively, from carelessness that can lead to costly consequences. Even small differences in the form protection takes can have significant long-run effects. 
Women sometimes forget to take birth control pills or let their prescription lapse. Partly for this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now prioritizes use of IUDs and hormonal implants. Unpopular among older physicians and older women because they were once considered risky, these methods are now rated quite safe. 
Mounting evidence suggests that making these new contraceptive technologies more economically accessible reduces abortions and unwanted births. 
A recent study in St. Louis enrolled more than 9,000 adolescent and adult women at risk of unintended pregnancy into a study that provided contraceptive counseling and offered participants the reversible contraceptive method of their choice at no cost; 75 percent chose either IUDs or implants. 
The researchers reported a clinically and statistically significant reduction in abortion rates, repeat abortions and teenage birth rates. 
Teenage pregnancies in the study group amounted to 6.3 per 1,000, compared with 34 per 1,000 on the national level. Abortion rates in the St. Louis area rose to 13.4 per 1000 women in 2010; in the study group, they amounted to 5.9 per 1,000. 
The results corroborate earlier estimates of the payoff to public investments in family planning. 
Republicans typically embrace cost-benefit analysis. But they seem reluctant to accept its application to the impact of contraceptive access on public health. Indeed, they have sought to cut funds for existing programs on the federal and state levels. 
Apparently, they're not such rational actors themselves. Maybe they're just responding to something in their gut - in other words, their viscera.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Earnings Plummeted in Third Quarter on Write-Down

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Although Citigroup's third-quarter profit plummeted because of a multibillion-dollar loss related to its continued exit from its Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the bank increased its lending, particularly in Latin America, and snagged a larger share of capital markets business. 

 BODY:
 4:39 p.m. | Updated 
Citigroup said on Monday that its third-quarter earnings plummeted because of a $4.7 billion loss related to the joint venture brokerage business Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. 
Last month, Citigroup agreed to sell its part of the joint venture, beginning with a 14 percent stake, to Morgan Stanley. Citigroup said at the time that it was writing down the value of its remaining interest in the brokerage business.
The loss was offset slightly by an uptick in mortgage lending and buoyed by a rebound in capital markets. Citigroup, the nation's third-largest bank, reported net income of $468 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $14 billion, compared with net income of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Excluding the loss on its brokerage unit, a one-time accounting charge and credit adjustments, the bank reported earning $3.27 billion, or $1.06 a share, up from $2.57 billion, or 84 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Citigroup was expected to record earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $18.7 billion.
Shares of Citigroup closed up 5.5 percent to $36.66.
Like its rivals in the industry, Citigroup is grappling with sluggish growth in the United States.
Under the leadership of Vikram S. Pandit, its chief executive, the bank has worked to sharply reduce the bank's expenses and credit losses. "Our core businesses showed momentum during the quarter as we increased lending and generated higher operating revenues," Mr. Pandit said in a statement.
Along with Bank of America, Citigroup was among the banks most crippled by the financial crisis of 2008. Mr. Pandit has vowed to restore the bank to profitability, in part by shedding more troubled assets.
Citigroup is still trying to work through the glut of bad assets it holds in its Citi Holdings Unit.
Increasingly, a large share of the company's earnings stem from its consumer banking unit in North America, which includes mortgage lending. 
John C. Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer, emphasized in a conference call on Monday that Citigroup was able to successfully grow across its "core businesses." 
While Citigroup did not get the same help from mortgages as rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which reported robust profits on Friday from a refinancing frenzy, the bank reported an 18 percent increase in profit in its North American banking segment, in part because of mortgage lending. Even though mortgage originations were down, revenue in the unit was up, in part as a result of widening spreads on the loans. Mr. Gerspach suggested the bank could have been more nimble by increasing staffing to handle the burst in refinancing activity. 
On Friday, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, pointed to robust growth in its mortgage banking unit, sounding an optimistic note on the housing market. 
"We believe the housing market has turned the corner," Mr. Dimon said. 
Mr. Gerspach, however, struck a more cautious tone. "There is still a question, clearly in my mind, as to whether we have a strong enough economy to support the housing market," he said. 
The bright spot for Citigroup on Monday was a 67 percent increase in profit from its securities and banking unit, as the bank benefited from revived capital market activity. 
"We continue to gain market share in investment banking," Mr. Gerspach said. He pointed to "improved market share in every investment product." 
Outside of the United States, however, some of Citigroup's results were lackluster. Profit in its international consumer banking unit fell 3 percent, to $862 million, from $885 million in the period a year earlier. With a large international footprint, the bank has positioned itself to benefit from increased lending in Asia and Mexico.
"There is an underlying growth story in the numbers," Mr. Gerspach said.
Latin America, where Citigroup has positioned much of its hopes for increased profitability, saw some gains. Revenue in the region grew 7 percent, to $2.4 billion. Some of the profit was crimped by reduced loan spreads in Asia. 
Across the bank, consumer banking posted revenue gains of 2 percent, to $10.2 billion, from the period a year earlier, while net income in the consumer banking unit increased 18 percent, to $2.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Sprint Clinches Deal With SoftBank

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Sprint Nextel is selling a 70 percent stake to SoftBank of Japan. | Bank earnings continue with Citigroup. | Two Americans are awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. | The A.C.L.U. is taking aim at Morgan Stanley's mortgage machine. 

 BODY:
 SPRINT CLINCHES DEAL WITH SOFTBANK | Sprint Nextel is selling 70 percent of itself to SoftBank for $20.1 billion. The deal, which was announced on Monday, is Sprint's boldest attempt to improve its fortunes as it faces new pressure from rivals, DealBook reports.
SoftBank, a big Japanese telecommunications company, said it would pay $8 billion to buy newly issued Sprint stock and $12.1 billion to buy existing stock from other investors at a premium. Sprint's shares have risen 14 percent since the company confirmed on Thursday it was in talks with SoftBank. The transaction, which is expected to close in the middle of 2013, ends speculation about Sprint's fate after T-Mobile agreed to combine with MetroPCS. DealBook notes that "Sprint is also working to gain more control over Clearwire, the wireless broadband company in which it owns a large stake, people familiar with the matter said."
CITIGROUP TO REPORT EARNINGS | Bank earnings continue with Citigroup at 8 a.m. Analysts expect the bank to report earnings of 96 cents a share, compared with $1.23 a share in the period a year earlier. The results, in any case, will be analyzed for clues to the health of the broader banking sector. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which reported earnings on Friday, were helped by a pickup in mortgage lending. But investors still had reservations, as shares of both banks closed lower on Friday.
On Citigroup's conference call at 11 a.m., you can expect to hear about how regulations are affecting the bank's business. Bankers tend to blame the government for hindering mortgage lending, DealBook's Peter Eavis writes, but that argument leaves out some important realities.
NOBEL GOES TO 2 AMERICANS | The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Alvin E. Roth of Harvard (soon to be at Stanford) and Lloyd S. Shapley of U.C.L.A., "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design."
MORGAN STANLEY TO BE SUED OVER MORTGAGES | Banks' risky ways during the mortgage boom are coming back to haunt them, with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase being sued this month. Now, the American Civil Liberties Union is taking aim at Morgan Stanley's mortgage machine in a lawsuit expected to be filed on Monday, claiming that the investment bank fueled risky mortgage lending directed at African-American borrowers, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in The New York Times. The lawsuit says Morgan Stanley pressured a now-defunct lender, New Century, to "churn out the wildly profitable loans that came with 'dangerous' characteristics," according to The Times.
ON THE AGENDA | 
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, speaks at a National Association for Business Economics conference in New York at 8 a.m. George Soros speaks at the conference at 11:45 a.m. Paul Volcker is at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business at 5:45 p.m. in a conversation with William L. Silber, the author of a new book on the former Fed chairman. Laurence Fink of BlackRock and Robert Greifeld of Nasdaq join two other chief executives for a discussion on the federal debt at 4 p.m. on Bloomberg TV. Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark and executive producer for "Start-ups: Silicon Valley," is on CNBC at 10:40 a.m. Charles Schwab reports earnings before the opening bell, and the brokerage firm's chief executive is on CNBC at 7 p.m. Data on retail sales for September are to be released at 8:30 a.m.
 HIGH-SPEED TRADING COOLS DOWN | 
Dominating the stock market may not be so lucrative after all. High-frequency trading firms, "struggling to hold onto their gains," are expected to make no more than $1.25 billion in profit this year, down 35 percent from last year, Nathaniel Popper reports in The New York Times. "While no official data is kept on employment at the high-speed firms, interviews with more than a dozen industry participants suggest that firms large and small have been cutting staff, and in some cases have shut down."
 ROMNEY'S IN-HOUSE ECONOMIST | 
The economist behind Mitt Romney's policies is R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who straddles "the occasionally uncomfortable line between academia and politics," The New York Times writes. Mr. Hubbard, like the Republican candidate, would like to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and lower taxes. But he is more than just a pundit. If Mr. Romney is elected, Mr. Hubbard may be in the running for the job of Treasury secretary or even Federal Reserve chairman, The Times writes. He may have more to say on CNBC on Monday at 4:20 p.m.

HEADLINE: A Corporate Boss With a Taste for Risk Makes His Latest Big Bet

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: By buying majority control of Sprint Nextel, SoftBank is making an enormous bet that it can turn around a flailing company beset by larger rivals. It is not the first time the Japanese company and its chief executive, Masayoshi Son, have taken on a daunting gamble. 

 BODY:
By buying majority control of Sprint Nextel for $20.1 billion, SoftBank is making an enormous bet that it can turn around a flailing company beset by larger rivals. 
It is not the first time the Japanese company and its chief executive, Masayoshi Son, have taken on a daunting gamble.
Known as a voluble entrepreneur given to pursuing his vision despite naysayers' criticisms, Mr. Son believes that by buying Sprint, he can help the ailing cellphone service provider trump the duopoly of Verizon and AT&T that has long dominated the American market.
It is a game plan he followed in 2006, when SoftBank bought Vodafone's Japanese unit for $15 billion, in an effort to add mobile communications as his company's latest division. 
And much of that drive is based on Mr. Son's belief that he is simply smarter and more agile than the existing market players.
"We are from the Internet world," he said during a call with analysts on Monday. "We are different from the incumbent telephone companies."
SoftBank began as a software publisher in 1981 before successfully moving into Internet services, amassing a market value of up to $180 billion. He partnered with a nascent Yahoo to create the American company's joint venture in Japan, which gave him a stake in a Web giant that was rapidly growing at the time. 
After the dot-com bubble deflated, however, SoftBank's stock capitalization shrank to as little as $20 billion.
Mr. Son persevered and rebuilt his company, before staking a significant portion of its future on wireless services. By 2006, Japan's cellphone market was dominated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI, with Vodafone's operation stuck in a distant third place. 
He aimed to change that dynamic with a combination of aggressive marketing and savvy pricing. Until last year, SoftBank was the only Japanese service provider to offer the iPhone. And it has rolled out services like the White Plan, a voice-and-data plan with a simplified price structure that caught on with metropolitan subscribers. (That is despite offering what some analysts describe as the worst coverage in Japan.)
And SoftBank has been heavily focused on expanding its Long Term Evolution, or LTE, high-speed data network, employed by the latest batch of smartphones.
That strategy has produced results. SoftBank has raised its earnings before interest and taxes to $2.5 billion for its 2012 fiscal year, outstripping KDDI, according to a presentation published on Monday. And if the company's $2.3 billion purchase of a smaller rival, eAccess, goes through, it will overtake KDDI as Japan's second-biggest mobile service provider.
The game plan had put SoftBank on a path to reducing its significant debt load, which stood at nearly $13 billion as of June 30. But news of the company's designs for Sprint weighed heavily on its shares, as investors fretted about the enormous amounts of borrowing needed to finance that transaction and the American company's turnaround. Shares in SoftBank fell 5.3 percent on Monday, to 2,268 yen, and have tumbled nearly 17 percent since Thursday.
Still, Mr. Son apparently believes that moving into a new market -- a larger one with plenty of growth in the lucrative smartphone sector -- is a better overall strategy for his company and its investors. SoftBank's plans include aiding Sprint in upgrading its network to LTE, as well as using its new partner as a vehicle to roll up smaller competitors and battle with the reigning cellphone network operators.
"It's not an easy path to go," Mr. Son said at a news conference in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg News. "But without taking on a challenge, we may end up facing bigger risks."

HEADLINE: The Data-Mining Industry Kicks Off a Public Relations Campaign

BYLINE: NATASHA SINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Data brokers say they want to correct misconceptions about what they do and explain why they think data-driven marketing can help consumers. 

 BODY:
The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in Manhattan, introduced a $1 million public relations campaign on Monday morning with a lofty title: the "Data-Driven Marketing Institute."
The purpose of the effort is to buff the image and forestall regulation of the consumer data-mining industry. This industry consists of business-to-business companies, known as data brokers, that collect, share, analyze and sell information about consumers' online and off-line behaviors in order to tailor marketing pitches to them.
According to a statement, the trade group intends to promote such targeted marketing to lawmakers and the public "with the goal of preventing needless regulation or enforcement that could severely hamper consumer marketing and stifle innovation" as well as "tamping down unfavorable media attention." As part of the campaign, the group plans to finance academic research into the industry's economic impact, said Linda A. Woolley, the acting chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association.
The group planned to announce the campaign during its annual conference in Las Vegas. It comes as legislators in both the United States House and the Senate have opened investigations into the practices of leading data brokers. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is also investigating certain firms and has called on the industry to increase transparency. Some legislators, regulators and privacy advocates have said they are worried that unregulated collection of marketing data about people's personal, health and or financial concerns had the potential to result in unfair pricing or inferior service for some consumers.
Ms. Woolley said the industry's public relations effort was intended to counteract those concerns.
"We want to set the record straight on what we think has been a lot of mischaracterization of what we do and to explain the benefits of data-driven marketing to consumers," Ms. Woolley said.
One issue the campaign is not designed to address, however, is a recommendation from the F.T.C. earlier this year that the industry set up a public Web portal where consumers could learn about the practices of data brokers and about consumer choices for accessing or deleting information collected about them. Ms. Woolley said so many different types of companies collected or used consumer data for marketing purposes that a public Web portal would be unfeasible.
Still, when consumers learn that third-party companies may collect information about their purchasing records and tastes, at least some people say they would like to be able to see the marketing records data brokers hold about them and have some control over them, said Chuck Teller, the founder of Catalog Choice, a company that helps consumers limit the catalogs, coupons and other direct-mail pitches they receive.
About 67 percent of people who answered a recent e-mail questionnaire sent out by his company said they felt it was very important for them to be able to see the information that data brokers collected about them, while about 78 percent said they felt it was very important to be able to opt out of the distribution and sale of information about them, Mr. Teller said.
"It's pretty clear that consumers want to opt out of the use of their data by companies they don't do business with," Mr. Teller said.

HEADLINE: SoftBank Sets a Record With Sprint Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The agreement by SoftBank to take control of Sprint Nextel is the biggest deal by a Japanese company in the United States since at least 1980, according to Thomson Reuters, 

 BODY:
Japanese companies have done a string of deals in the United States this year, but the pact announced Monday is one for the record books.
The agreement by SoftBank to take control of Sprint Nextel is the biggest deal by a Japanese company in the United States since at least 1980, according to Thomson Reuters, which values Monday's deal at $23.3 billion.
That far exceeds the next-largest deal: the $9.8 billion stake that NTT DoCoMo, SoftBank's rival, took in AT&T Wireless in 2000. 
 The SoftBank deal is also worth more than some recent takeovers, including Takeda Pharmaceutical's 2008 purchase of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for $8.1 billion. It also tops the $7.8 billion agreement that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group struck with Morgan Stanley in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, according to Reuters data.
Monday's deal is a welcome development for the financial advisers involved, in a year starved for deal activity.
The agreement has lifted Citigroup, an adviser to Sprint, to sixth from seventh place in Thomson Reuters's global league table this year. Sprint's other advisers, UBS and Rothschild, each moved up one spot as well.
One of SoftBank's advisers, the Raine Group, entered this year's worldwide league table in 30th place after the deal. (The deal is the Raine Group's biggest, according to Reuters.) The Mizuho Financial Group, another SoftBank adviser, rose to 17th from 22nd place.
For American consumers, SoftBank is set to be the latest Japanese company to make its mark on daily life in this country.
In 1989, the Mitsubishi Estate Company made headlines with a deal to buy a 51 percent stake in the Rockefeller Group in New York. (The stake eventually grew to 100 percent, after Rockefeller went through bankruptcy.)
One analyst drew a comparison to that deal last week, when Sprint confirmed it was in talks with SoftBank. Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, was skeptical of the tie-up.
"This is tantamount to Japanese buyers buying Rockefeller Center," he said.
The year 1989 was also when the Japanese electronics giant Sony took a foothold in Hollywood. Its roughly $4.7 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment was a blockbuster at the time.
On Monday, SoftBank's shares fell 5.3 percent, with investors concerned over the company's ability to turn around the ailing Sprint.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Says Monetary Steps Were Too Timid

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: "With the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive," William C. Dudley, vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, says in a speech. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's recent expansion of its economic stimulus campaign was announced as a course correction. It wasn't that economic circumstances had changed, officials said. They simply had concluded that they needed to do more. The implication, of course, was that the Fed had failed to do enough.
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, made that point explicit in a Monday speech.
"Monetary policy, while highly accommodative by historic standards, may still not have been sufficiently accommodative given the economic circumstances," Mr. Dudley said.
He underscored the point later, saying, "With the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive." 
Mr. Dudley said that the shortcomings of monetary policy were one of five reasons, in his judgment, that the recovery continues to disappoint expectations. The others he listed include the overhang of mortgage debt, economic problems in Europe and other parts of the world, the aging of the American population and the shortcomings of fiscal policy makers.
The speech was intended primarily as an explanation of the Fed's recent decision to expand its efforts. The central bank said last month that it would buy mortgage securities at a rate of $40 billion a month until job creation picks up. Mr. Dudley, the vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, is a crucial ally of the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
The government has since reported that the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent in September, but Mr. Dudley made no mention of that news. He made clear that the Fed is unlikely to be moved by a few months of good news, in part because officials do not want to find themselves apologizing again for not doing enough.
"If we were to see some good news on growth I would not expect us to respond in a hasty manner," Mr. Dudley told the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics. "Only as we became confident that the recovery was securely established, would I expect our monetary policy stance to evolve."

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign Feels 'Good' About State of Race

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: The president's staff said he is preparing intensely for Tuesday's debate. 

 BODY:
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. - The Obama campaign insisted Monday it remained sanguine about the state of the presidential race, a day before President Obama was to meet Mitt Romney in Hempstead, N.Y., for a second high-stakes debate.
With polls showing Mr. Obama clinging to a narrow lead in the crucial battleground of Ohio, and early voting well under way in several states, a spokeswomen for the campaign, Jennifer Psaki, said, "We feel good about where are in the race." Ms. Psaki said the campaign's early-voting operation was superior to that of Mr. Romney's campaign.
The Obama campaign has been scrambling to halt the shift in momentum in Mr. Romney's favor since the first debate in Denver, which left many Democrats disappointed with the president's performance. Mr. Romney has jumped to a small lead over Mr. Obama in several national polls, as well as in battleground states like Florida, Colorado, and Virginia. But Ms. Psaki said that after two weeks of churn, the state polls were reasonably stable.
"It's very, very close," she said to reporters at Mr. Obama's debate camp in this colonial tourist town. "There are some states where we're up by a few points, there are some states where we're down a few points. It's tightened, which we fully expected would happen."
The White House and campaign officials were stingy with details about Mr. Obama's preparation, beyond saying that it was dead serious. Ms. Psaki described the president as "calm and energized" and said he had interrupted his preparation only for a brief visit to the local campaign office Sunday, and to walk the leafy grounds at a golf resort here.
"We know the president is his own harshest critic and he knows that Mitt Romney had a better debate," she said. "But people across the country aren't voting on who is the better salesman-in-chief; they're looking for who is going to better represent them in the White House."
"That's why he's looking forward to answering questions from the American people tomorrow night," she added. "Some that will be about the economy, some that will be about many other issues. Of course, we have no control over that."
How much control they will have over the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, is another matter. Ms. Psaki declined to comment on a report by Mark Halperin of Time Magazine that the Obama and Romney campaigns both protested to the Commission on Presidential Debates that Ms. Crowley had indicated she planned to ask follow-up questions at the debate - a town-hall format, in which voters are supposed to ask most of the questions.
"Obviously this is a town hall, which means the questions will be coming for the American people in the audience," she said. "But if the questions come from other sources, he's happy to address those questions as well."

HEADLINE: SoftBank's Deal for Sprint Is One for the Books

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The agreement by SoftBank to take control of Sprint Nextel is the biggest deal by a Japanese company in the United States since at least 1980, according to Thomson Reuters, 

 BODY:
Japanese companies have made a string of deals in the United States this year, but the pact announced on Monday is one for the record books.
The agreement by SoftBank to take control of Sprint Nextel is the biggest deal by a Japanese company in the United States since at least 1980, according to Thomson Reuters, which values the deal at $23.3 billion.
That far exceeds the next-largest deal, the $9.8 billion stake that NTT DoCoMo, SoftBank's rival, took in AT&T Wireless in 2000. 
 The SoftBank deal is also worth more than some recent takeovers, including Takeda Pharmaceutical's 2008 purchase of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for $8.1 billion. It also tops the $7.8 billion agreement the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group struck with Morgan Stanley in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.
It also ranks as the biggest foreign deal involving an investment in an American company so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters. 
The deal on Monday is a welcome development for the financial advisers involved, in a year starved for deal activity.
The agreement has lifted Citigroup, an adviser to Sprint, to sixth from seventh place in the Thomson Reuters global league table this year. Sprint's other advisers, UBS and Rothschild, each moved up one spot as well.
One of SoftBank's advisers, the Raine Group, entered this year's league table in 30th place after the deal. (The deal is the group's biggest, according to Thomson Reuters.) The Mizuho Financial Group, another SoftBank adviser, rose to 17th place from 22nd.
For American consumers, SoftBank is set to be the latest Japanese company to make its mark on daily life in this country.
In 1989, the Mitsubishi Estate Company made headlines with a deal to buy a 51 percent stake in the Rockefeller Group in New York. (The stake eventually grew to 100 percent, after Rockefeller went through bankruptcy.)
Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, drew a comparison to that deal last week, when Sprint confirmed it was in talks with SoftBank.
"This is tantamount to Japanese buyers buying Rockefeller Center," he said.
The year 1989 was also when the Japanese electronics giant Sony took a foothold in Hollywood. Its roughly $4.7 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment was a blockbuster at the time.
SoftBank's shares fell 5.3 percent in Tokyo on Monday, with investors concerned over the company's ability to turn around the ailing Sprint.

HEADLINE: Nowadays, Wall Street Saviors May Wish They Weren't

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The banks that bought up failing rivals are now being sued for the misdeeds of those firms before their rescues. Next time, Wall Street may be less cooperative. 

 BODY:
"Would I have done Bear Stearns again knowing what I know today?"Jamie Dimon asked almost rhetorically last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
"It is really close. What I know today is if they called me again to do something again like that, I couldn't do it. My board wouldn't allow me."
No kidding.
 The bailouts during the financial crisis of 2008 may have been unpopular on Main Street, but they are turning out to be just as unpopular in certain corners of Wall Street, and perhaps for good reason.
Some of the strongest firms during the crisis that acquired failing banks at the behest of the government - JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, among them - have found themselves in the cross hairs of lawsuits brought by the government for activities related to deals they made under pressure from the authorities.
Whether you love or hate Wall Street, whether you want bankers to go to jail or not, the recent series of suits brought by the government may have a profound impact on how businesses react to being asked to provide assistance when the next financial crisis arrives. Chances are, they won't.
"As a policy matter, it's going to make it much harder in the future for companies to buy a troubled company," said Mr. Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, which bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 in a deal engineered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.
Mr. Dimon's comments in Washington are in part a response to a recent lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court by Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general, claiming that JPMorgan Chase misrepresented and defrauded investors of certain mortgage securities. Damages are estimated to be as high as $3 billion.
The only problem is that the "multiple fraudulent and deceptive acts" that the government alleged didn't take place at JPMorgan Chase; they happened at Bear Stearns during 2005 to 2007.
The same Bear Stearns that the United States government practically begged JPMorgan Chase to buy to help avoid a financial panic. The same Bear Stearns in which the initial $2 a share price of the transaction was dictated - literally - by Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary.
Four years on, with less than a month before the election, Mr. Schneiderman, who is co-chair of President Obama's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, has filed suit.
"We've lost $5 to $10 billion on various things related to Bear Stearns," Mr. Dimon said - and that's before this latest lawsuit.
"Someone said the Fed did us a favor," he continued, referring to the nearly $30 billion in guarantees that the Federal Reserve provided as part of the transaction. "We did them a favor. Let's get this one exactly right. We were asked to do it."
Mr. Dimon is clearly frustrated. Had Bear Stearns filed for bankruptcy, he said, there "would be no money. There would be no lawsuits. There would be no stock-drop lawsuits, there would be no class actions, there would be no mortgage lawsuits because there would be no money. But we bought it."
A cynic could chalk Mr. Dimon's outrage up to pure swagger. After all, his purchase of Bear Stearns elevated him and JPMorgan to superstar status with dozens of articles then referring to him as the new King of Wall Street.
And it's hard to believe that JPMorgan didn't come out ahead - or at least close to even - on the acquisition, given that Bear's 43-story headquarters on Madison Avenue was part of the deal.
Nonetheless, it is worth listening to Mr. Dimon. The next time a bailout is required, it might not be political pressure that keeps it from happening, but a company's board not willing to accept it.
If you ran a company, would you help participate in a bailout if you thought there was a chance the government might turn around and sue you later for the misdeeds of the company you're helping to save?
When the government helped save General Motors by providing money and guarantees as part of its bankruptcy, "they absolved G.M. of all prior legal liability," Mr. Dimon said in an earnings conference call with investors and analysts on Friday. "So the government's being a little inconsistent here."
Last week, Wells Fargo was sued by Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who accused the bank of defrauding the government by lying about the quality of the mortgages it handled under a federal housing program.
He said the bank had "engaged in a longstanding and reckless trifecta of deficient training, deficient underwriting and deficient disclosure, all while relying on the convenient backstop of government insurance."
The accusations in the suit stretch back a decade. Perhaps ironically, Wells Fargo is considered one of the best lenders in the nation. That status put Wells Fargo in a position to buy the failing Wachovia in 2008 with the encouragement, in part, of Sheila Bair, then the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who had originally helped orchestrate a deal to sell Wachovia to Citigroup.
That deal, however, would have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The deal with Wells Fargo most likely saved the F.D.I.C. billions of dollars.
Perhaps even stranger, Wells Fargo was one of several of the nation's largest banks to participate in a $25 billion settlement earlier this year over mortgage-related issues, some of which seem to overlap with the new case against it.
And, of course, Bank of America has been involved in a series of civil suits related to its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide and its purchase of Merrill Lynch, struck at the apex of the financial crisis in September 2008.
Earlier this year, Bank of America paid $1 billion to settle charges of civil fraud at Countrywide. But here's the important part: Bank of America acquired the failing Countrywide under some pressure from the government. So much pressure, in fact, that Kenneth D. Lewis, then the bank's chief executive, considered it a favor that would later be repaid by the Federal Reserve's lowering the bank's capital requirements to make additional acquisitions.
After the Merrill purchase, which was engineered by the Treasury and Fed, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors sued the bank for misleading shareholders about the deal. The bank paid the S.E.C. a $150 million penalty in 2010 and settled with shareholders last month for $2.43 billion, though the Merrill unit has given a boost to the bank's bottom line.
None of this is to suggest that the government should not hold those responsible for fraud or other misconduct accountable. But few of the lawsuits that the government has brought against the banks have anything to do with the culpability of those individuals who were actually responsible for the problems.
Instead, the government is simply holding responsible the company's shareholders, who were unlikely to have been shareholders at the time of the misdeeds.
Does this really offer a deterrent effect? Or is this just a nice way to garner headlines ahead of an election?
The executives responsible, as usual, pay nothing. If there were "deceptive acts," the government could and should bring cases, if not criminal, then civil, against the individuals.
Fraud isn't something a company does; it is something people do.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Turns Over New Libor Documents

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York turned over nearly 6,000 pages to a House subcommittee that is examining whether the regulator turned a blind eye to Libor rate-rigging during the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released to Congressional investigators on Monday a battery of documents that detailed its response to interest rate manipulation at some of the world's biggest banks. 
The New York Fed turned over nearly 6,000 pages to a House subcommittee - documents that include internal communications as well as correspondence with its fellow banking regulators. The documents relate to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an important benchmark that some banks gamed to bolster profits during the depths of the financial crisis. 
The rate-rigging scandal came into focus this summer after Barclays struck a $450 million settlement with authorities over accusations that it reported bogus Libor figures. The case, the first of several actions expected to arise from investigations into more than a dozen banks, raised questions about why the New York Fed and other regulators failed to thwart the illegal activity.
The concerns led the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee to examine whether the New York Fed turned a blind eye to rate-rigging during the financial crisis. The subcommittee ordered the New York Fed to detail its correspondence with other regulators about rate manipulation across the banking industry.
 It is unclear whether the New York Fed documents provided to Congress on Monday will corroborate those concerns. The documents are not yet public, in part because some of the information remains confidential. The subcommittee, which is run by Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, did not say whether it would eventually release the material on Libor, a benchmark for the price of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans. 
"The subcommittee staff has now begun its review of these documents," a spokeswoman said on Monday. 
But in a statement on Monday, a New York Fed spokesman said the materials "are consistent" with an earlier release of Libor-related documents that centered only on Barclays. In July, the regulator released a trove of information about the British bank that, by the New York Fed's account, highlighted its rapid response to the problems. 
"The New York Fed helped to identify the problem of underreporting of Libor, briefed U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies on the issue and worked to address the problem at its core by pressing for reform of the flawed Libor rate-setting process in London," the spokesman said. 
While the Barclays documents did indicate that the New York Fed advocated broad reforms to the rate-setting process and passed along concerns to other regulators, the agency was attacked for not going further. The material showed that the New York Fed learned in April 2008 that Barclays was reporting false interest rates but it did not refer the specific wrongdoing to federal prosecutors or other investigators.
At the time, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official that "we know that we're not posting um, an honest" rate. The employee suggested that other big banks posted similarly phony reports, saying that Barclays wanted to "fit in with the rest of the crowd."

HEADLINE: Why the Debate Over Big Bird Is a Sign of Progress

BYLINE: DAN KEDMEY


HIGHLIGHT: The fact that funding for PBS generates buzz in today's political debates shows just how ideologically close Obama and Romney are compared to our founding fathers. 

 BODY:
This past Sunday in the magazine, Adam Davidson argued that, for all the surface discord that characterizes the Obama and Romney campaigns, the candidates hold surprisingly harmonious views on the economy. They back similar policies on free trade, Social Security and welfare. Perhaps their biggest disagreement centers on slightly different tax rates for corporations and investors. "For someone who lived in the first 150 years or so of this country," Davidson wrote, "it might be hard to see what's so different about the economic policies of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney."
Compared with the founding fathers, Obama and Romney could be mistaken for running mates. When Alexander Hamilton proposed the establishment of a central bank, Thomas Jefferson countered that Hamilton's system "was calculated to undermine and demolish the republic." Jefferson drew a stark line between his views on government debt and Hamilton's. "I would wish the debt paid tomorrow," Jefferson wrote in a letter to President Washington. "He wishes it never to be paid."
Hamilton, in turn, wrote that Jefferson, the "quiet, modest, retiring philosopher," would be unmasked as "the intriguing incendiary, the aspiring turbulent competitor." He warned that Jefferson's attempts to dismantle his banking system "would be one of the most wanton and flagitious acts that ever stained the annals of a civilized nation."
Their feud engulfed the nation's first newspapers. Jefferson arranged a sinecure that paid $250 a year to the editor of The National Gazette, which ran scathing attacks on Hamilton. "Can any attentive reader of that Gazette," Hamilton wrote, "doubt for a moment that it has been systematically devoted to the calumniating and blackening of public characters?" For his part, Hamilton secured loans and printing contracts for The Gazette of the United States, where he published his own scathing rebuttals under the pen name Catullus.
The debate between Jefferson and Hamilton (and Catullus) stemmed from a deep ideological divide that took decades to heal. Today a consensus has formed in support the government's biggest economic programs. Politicians have the luxury of debating lower-stakes issues, like the finer points of the tax code or the fate of Big Bird. As a result, attack ads like this one might actually be seen as a sign of progress:

HEADLINE: The Arizonification of America

BYLINE: JEFF BIGGERS


HIGHLIGHT: On immigration policy, Arizona leads the way, but maybe not where we thought it was going. 

 BODY:
Phoenix, Ariz.
With the "papers please" provision of Arizona's controversial SB 1070 immigration law now in effect, Bill Clinton roused an overflowing crowd at Arizona State University last week with a special shout out to the state's "dreamers," the highly organized ranks of undocumented youth seeking permanent residency either through education or the military (and sometimes both). Appearing on behalf of the former Surgeon General Richard Carmona, whose surging campaign to become the first Latino Senator in Arizona now leads in the latest polls, Clinton drew some of his biggest cheers for his support of the DREAM Act merely by calling it the "right thing to do."
Welcome to the Arizona showdown.
Underscored by Gov. Jan Brewer's latest act of defiance in denying state benefits to undocumented youth affected by President Obama's deferral of immigration action against them, the Republican Party's full embrace of Arizona's immigration policy at its summer convention drew a clear line in the state's sand. The "Arizonification" of America continues to frame the national immigration debate. It has cemented the state's frontline image as so hopelessly wedded to a punitive approach of "attrition through enforcement" at any cost that "The Daily Show" once referred to Arizona as the "meth lab of democracy."
Not that the headline-grabbing nativists, frontier justice sheriffs, neo-Nazi marchers, gun-toting militiamen and Tea Party political figures don't exist in Arizona. But as the estimated 5,500 in attendance for Carmona and Clinton reminded the state, the fringe elements dominating the media and Arizona's state house may have finally met their match. Case in point: An electrified citizens' campaign has mounted the most serious get-out-the-vote effort against Joe Arpaio, the notorious Maricopa County Sheriff, in his 20-year reign.
The resurgence of this "other Arizona" signals a revival of the state's century-old legacy of fighting against such anti-immigrant and thinly veiled racism, a movement that began almost as soon as Arizona's entry as a territory in the mid-19th century. For example, in Tucson, the pioneering Mexican immigrant Estevan Ochoa not only salvaged public education but single-handedly faced down the Confederate occupation of the Old Pueblo. When the Tucson Unified School District dismantled its acclaimed Mexican-American Studies program in Ochoa's hometown last spring, Latino youth were quick to rekindle his memory.
I believe that today's overlooked but growing alliance among Latinos, retiring baby boomers and rooted centrists will have a far a more lasting impact on both the liberal and conservative agendas nationally than the headline-grabbing but faltering Tea Party. This alliance might even have an impact on the 2012 election: Beyond Carmona's surprising gains, the latest polling data to include Spanish-speaking voters now places the presidential showdown in a dead heat, even as Gov. Mitt Romney hangs on to a healthy overall lead in Arizona.
Is the other Arizona coming back?
Consider the progressive stalwarts who wrote one of the most enlightened constitutions in the country at Arizona's birth in 1912. In a prophetic speech that he gave after negotiating a nationally watched labor agreement between striking union miners and copper companies, Gov. George W. Hunt spelled out the challenge facing the entire nation: 
It will be a happy day for the nation when the corporations shall be excluded from political activity and vast accumulations of capital cannot be employed in an attempt to control government.
Railing against corporate influence and money in politics in Arizona in 1916, Hunt foretold the Occupy Wall Street movement a century in advance: 
"The working class, plus the professional class, represent 99 percent," he declared. "The remaining 1 percent is represented by those who make a business of employing capital."
For all of his enlightenment, Hunt and his progressive forces succumbed to anti-immigrant pressures from more conservative unions and excluded the very foot soldiers who had built his labor ranks before statehood: in 1903, Mexican-American, native and immigrant workers led the first strikes in the state in Morenci.
The betrayal came full circle in 1917. Driven by a similar anti-immigrant hysteria during World War I, armed copper company thugs led by a border sheriff rounded up and deported striking immigrant miners in the copper capital of Bisbee. The extreme measure drew national condemnation, but also set a precedent of using punitive measures against immigrants over the next century whenever the economy slumped, wars ended or election time heated up.
But Arizonans also fought back. In 1972, the national media once again focused here, when Gov. Jack Williams signed a bill that banned secondary boycotts and strikes during harvest time, cracked down on collective bargaining rights and union membership procedures, and made it a crime to make "misleading" speeches about boycotted products. The headlines screamed: "Arizona-type legislation is spreading to many other farm states, despite protests."
Launching his "Si Se Puede" movement, the inspiring slogan that would be adopted as "Yes, We Can" by President Barack Obama's first presidential campaign, Cesar Chavez, an Arizona native and co-founder of the United Farm Workers embarked in 1972 on a "fast for love" in Phoenix in the "spirit of social justice in Arizona." Chavez wrote: 
The fast is to try to reach the hearts of those men, so that they will understand that we too have rights and we're not here to destroy, because we're not destroyers, we're builders.
Although Williams's hard-line anti-union legislation would be fought in the courts for years, the Chavez-led campaign signed up 150,000 new voters, ushering in a new era of electoral participation: Within two years, thanks to Chavez's work, Raul Castro became the state's first (and still the only) Latino governor.
In one of the most overlooked major news stories last year, a similar "Si Se Puede" movement once again shocked local and national media observers and entrenched political interests lulled into believing Arizona's SB 1070 had placed the state on electoral lockdown. Led by Randy Parraz, a labor organizer, new bipartisan movement fed up with the state's extremist policies took its organizational momentum into electoral politics and carried out the historic recall of former state senator Russell Pearce, the self-declared "Tea Party President" and legislative mastermind behind SB 1070. The historic nature of the recall, dating back to the state's progressive constitution battle a century ago, was the opening salvo in the 2012 elections, for two reasons.
First, Parraz and his Citizens for a Better Arizona brought together often disparate factions in Arizona - including rising Latino youth, retiring baby boomers, centrists that included the Mormon church, and the demoralized local Democratic Party - in arguably one of the most conservative legislative districts in the nation. "Arizona has been in the headlines for all of the wrong reasons," Parraz told his forces. "We need a victory now." And they got it. Pearce, considered one of the most influential voices in the "attrition through enforcement" movement spreading across numerous states, was the first state senate president to be recalled in American history, according to election record keepers.
Speaking about the Pearce recall, Dan O'Neal, chairman of the Arizona Progressive Democrats of America, said: "This election sends a message to other Democratic efforts," to not be afraid to take on issues and races in red states."
Secondly, the recall also spotlighted the emergence of a new Latino generation and its role in a historic demographic shift taking place in Arizona and across the nation. With the nation's highest "cultural generation" gap, according to a Brookings Metropolitan Policy study in 2010 - 83 percent of the state's aging population was categorized as Anglo, and 57 percent of the children came from Latino families in the last census - Arizona has changed from 72 percent to 50 percent non-Latino in the past two decades. The demographics don't pull any punches. A new political conversation is about to take place in Arizona. And organizers are not sitting back and waiting.
Working with several other civil rights groups, Parraz and his Citizens for a Better Arizona now lead the "Joe's Got to Go" campaign against Arpaio, whose one-time insurmountable lead over his opponent Paul Penzone has shrunk to a few percentage points. With the sheriff under investigation for racial profiling by the Department of Justice, the take-no-prisoners challenge of Arpaio's role as the face of SB 1070 enforcement has already electrified the state's once-timid liberal ranks.
If an Arpaio upset happens, with the state "papers please" law a part of all races in the state and the nation, the rise of the "other Arizona" and its bipartisan rejection of extremism could reverse the "Arizonification of America" push back in the opposite direction. As one of 15 swing states where the margin of victory often hangs on one to three percentage points, the expected 6-8 percent increase in Latino voters places Arizona on the cusp of electing Carmona to a highly prized Senate position for the Democrats.
In essence: While Arizona may not swing to President Obama, the defeat of Arpaio or a victory for Carmona would be a huge step toward dismantling Republican control behind Arizona's state immigration policy, and changing a state of mind for the media and outside observers.
No more "meth lab of democracy." 
Inspired by organizers like Parraz, and driven by the changing demographics, electoral change is coming in increments to Arizona in 2012 - and ultimately laying the groundwork for the gubernatorial race in 2014 for either Brewer or a bevy of Republican candidates. A groundwork deeply rooted in the other Arizona's powerful lessons of history that transcend the state's borders.
As Phoenix-based Puente human rights advocate Carlos Garcia recently told me, Arizona's gift to the nation may simply be this legacy of resiliency against extremism on the front lines. "Turning the tide from hate to human rights," as Garcia put it, sends a powerful message that will reach far beyond the ballot box.

HEADLINE: American Politics and Chinese Data

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of increasingly heated election rhetoric about China, Beijing has released some important economic data as its currency hits record highs. What DealBook readers need to know about China this week. 

 BODY:
In the midst of increasingly heated election rhetoric about China, Beijing has released some important economic data as its currency hits record highs.
 SEPTEMBER'S TRADE NUMBERS weremixed, and at leastone analyst suggested that the upside surprise in export data was a result of the introduction of the iPhone 5. 
The inflation rate of 1.9 percentwas close to the slowest rate since 2010 and China's broad measure of money supply, known as M2, grew at 14.8 percent, the fastest rate in 14 months.
 On Thursday, Beijing will release third-quarter gross domestic product figures. The consensus forecast is 7.4 percent, below Beijing's 7.5 percent target and possibly a "a rare treat to the perma-bears."
 CHINA'S CURRENCY, the renminbi, continues to hit record highs, at one point on Monday making an intraday high for the third day in a row. The reasons for the surge are unclear, withsuggestions including increased confidence in a Chinese recovery and "electioneering" in the last month before the United States election. 
On Friday, the United states Treasury delayed until mid-November a semiannual, Congressionally mandated report that must declare whether China manipulates its currency. Delays of this report are not uncommon, but it certainly is convenient to push it past the election. 
Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People's Bank of China, said in a speech over the weekend that the value of the renminbi was set by the market and the value was near equilibrium. Mr. Zhou's deputy delivered the speech at the annual International Monetary Fund conference, held this year in Tokyo, as Mr. Zhou declined to attend, apparently as a result of an islands dispute with Japan.
Not everyone agrees that the currency's value is determined by the market or trades near equilibrium. 
Both Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul D. Ryancriticized the Obama administration for delaying the release of the currency report, with Mr. Romney repeating his claim that "Day 1, I will label China a currency manipulator. We got to get those jobs back and get trade to be fair".
 CHINA DOES NOT SEEM PLEASED at the idea of a Romney presidency. Last month, Xinhua, the official news service, sounded almost like an Obama campaign ad when it wrote that Mr. Romney's China-bashing talks were "useless" to the United States economy.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithneraddressed the merits of labeling China a currency manipulator in April, saying that:
Nothing would happen, except you would diminish the incentive they have to move. It comes with no effective sanction or action. If it had been an effective way to get change in China, then bipartisan, Democrat and Republican presidents over time would have embraced that basic strategy. But it had no merit as a basic strategy. And it does carry the risk of a trade war, which is why there's so much opposition to that basic policy.
Mr. Geithner's comments remind us that United States policy toward China has actually been remarkably consistent over the last 30-plus years, across Republican and Democratic administrations. 
Romney supporter and "old wise man" of the United States-China relationship, Maurice R. Greenberg, told Bloomberg News that he expected Mr. Romney to maintain that bipartisan consistency and "abandon his China stance" if elected:
Do you want China to be an enemy or a friend?" Greenberg, 87, asked. "We have a choice between a trade agreement or a trade war. I choose a trade agreement and I hope that we will."
 CHINA IS UNLIKELY TO BE SWAYED by threats over its currency. Arthur Kroeber of GK Dragonomics explained the political economy of the renminbi in a Foreign Policy magazine essay last year. Mr. Kroeber said that the Chinese government considered the exchange rate not just as a price but as a tool in a broader development strategy and suggested that:
U.S. policy should therefore de-emphasize the exchange rate, where the potential for success is limited, and instead focus on keeping the pressure on China to maintain and expand market access for American firms in the domestic Chinese market -- which in principle is provided for under the terms of China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
Therein lies one of the main problems in the United States-China economic relationship, one that is succinctly explained in James McGregor's new book "No Ancient Wisdom, No Followers: The Challenge of Chinese Authoritarian Capitalism."
Mr. McGregor argues that China's state-owned enterprises and authoritarian capitalist system, the "China Model", may be increasingly incompatible with the global trade system. 
Americans deserve a substantive discussion about China from our presidential candidates, and perhaps they will get one, as one of the topics for the third debate is "the rise of China and tomorrow's world."

HEADLINE: Luxe Homes With Low Tax Bills

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The shimmering limestone tower at 15 Central Park West, where apartments routinely trade for upward of $20 million, has become symbolic of the most luxurious upper reaches of New York's real estate market. Its architect, Robert A. M. Stern, is the dean of the Yale School of Architecture. The views stretch out over the expanse of Central Park. And earlier this year, a single penthouse sold for $88 million.
Yet despite its sublime finishes, refined pedigree and nosebleed prices, the residential portion of that Manhattan building is officially valued by the city, for tax purposes, at only $332 per square foot. In reality, the average price per square foot for apartments sold there over the past 18 months has been $7,813, according to the Miller Samuel appraisal firm.
That kind of disparity is true for many of the stratospherically expensive apartments in the city. As a result, their owners pay far less in property taxes, relative to the value of the apartments, than most New York apartment owners pay. So despite a boom in the upper echelons of the real estate market -- 125 apartments have sold for at least $20 million in the last five years, and developers are churning out more every year -- the city is unable to truly cash in. 
The effect ripples down from there. ''If a certain kind of property is systematically undervalued, another kind of property has to pick up the slack,'' said Andrew Hayashi, a property tax expert at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
In a study of 2010 nationwide property tax rates, the average homeowner paid a median of 1.14 percent of home value that year, according to the Tax Foundation, a research group. In Manhattan, that figure was 0.78 percent. For the $88 million apartment at 15 Central Park West, 0.78 percent would be $686,000. But this year, the property taxes due on that penthouse were $59,000.
The relatively low tax bill was mainly due to its valuation, but the owners of that penthouse -- the financier Sanford I. Weill sold it to a trust controlled by Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the daughter of a Russian billionaire -- were also helped by a program called 421a, which gives developers big tax breaks for a certain number of years that they can pass along to condo buyers, in exchange for which the developers build or help finance affordable housing.
But even without the 421a abatement, the bill for the penthouse would have been only $145,000.
These comparatively meager official values are the result of a state law dating from decades ago that requires the city to calculate the value of condominiums and co-ops by using rental buildings as comparable properties, instead of apartment sales. At the top of the market, populated by $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, even $88 million apartments, real estate experts say that truly comparable rental buildings essentially do not exist.
''The highest-value ones are going to tend to be the hardest to line up,'' said George Sweeting, deputy director of the city's Independent Budget Office. Their resulting effective tax rates, he continued, ''will be extremely low, even by the standards of the city.''
According to the Independent Budget Office, the overall city valuation for condos and co-ops is only about 20 percent of what it would be were the city allowed to use comparable sales. That is a striking discount, but one that shrivels in comparison with the market's upper echelons, which means the percentage of the sales value that those apartments pay in taxes shrivels right along with it.
An apartment at the Plaza Hotel that sold for $48 million last year is valued by the city at $1.7 million, or 3.5 percent of its sale price. A condo at 80 Columbus Circle that sold for $30.55 million last summer is valued at $2 million, or 6.5 percent. And the $88 million apartment is valued at $2.97 million, just 3.4 percent.
The state law mandating the use of rental data has been on the books since the 1980s, when the market in the city was a very different place. Manhattan had more rent regulation, many fewer condos and lots of co-op conversions. A 2006 city report said tying the value of co-ops and condos to rentals was expected to keep an apartment's official value -- and, thus, its property taxes -- from rising too quickly, because rent regulation kept rental values relatively stable.
Today, to find a condo's or co-op's comparable rental cousin, the Finance Department looks at factors like age, location and size. Older buildings, even the grandest, often have a greater value discrepancy than new condos because older rentals are more likely to have at least some rent-stabilized units; this means that the taxes on those properties are generally lower.
But for any truly lavish building, finding a comparable rental is a challenge. One of the rental buildings used to find the value of 15 Central Park West, for example, is 145 West 67th Street -- a very tall, but otherwise unremarkable, building.
''We understand that the requirement by state law to ignore sales prices makes an already complex property tax system even more confusing for property owners, which raises questions of equity within the system,'' Owen Stone, a spokesman for the Finance Department, said in an e-mail. ''We are always looking for ways to make things more transparent.''
Property tax experts say that from time to time, some effort is made to rethink the way apartments are valued. But changes can be made only by the State Legislature, and the technical and political pressures tend to overwhelm the cause, which then is quietly put on a shelf.
''It's not so easy to go and change one screw,'' said Ana Champeny, a supervising analyst at the Independent Budget Office. ''Potentially, you have to redo the whole system.''
These property taxes, of course, are not paid in a vacuum. The city does receive a transfer tax every time a property is sold, as well as a mortgage recording tax, though many high-priced homes are bought with cash. And while the property taxes on mansions in the sky may be a relatively low percentage of sales value, they are still substantial.
A spokeswoman for Extell -- which is developing the luxury market's hottest ticket of the moment, One57, where two apartments are under contract for at least $90 million -- said the project would contribute over 1,000 construction jobs and hundreds of permanent jobs to the city.
As it happens, Extell has also applied for 421a tax abatements for One57.
But if the property taxes on these luxury apartments were to rise, would it even make a difference in sales to the superrich?
''I think you'd choke off that market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel.
Mr. Miller said that in some instances, exceptionally high carrying costs had tugged down prices and slowed the pace of sales, even in apartments that cost tens of millions of dollars.
''The logic was that the high end of the market doesn't really care if the monthly charges are high; it's more readily absorbed than on the lower end, and that turned out not to be true,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The conventional wisdom was, 'Ah, the wealthy don't care!' But of course they do.''

HEADLINE: Overseas Lending Offers Bright Spot for Citigroup

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
5:18 p.m. | Updated
Citigroup's wager that international lending will offset a sluggish recovery in the United States started to pay off Monday when the bank reported third-quarter earnings.
Although Citigroup's quarterly profit plummeted because of a multibillion-dollar loss related to its continued exit from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the bank increased its lending, particularly in Latin America, and snagged a larger share of capital markets business.
Citigroup, the nation's third-largest bank by assets, behind JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, reported net income of $468 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $14 billion, compared with net income of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
Beneath the drop in revenue, though, the bank has a number of strong core businesses. Under the leadership of Vikram S. Pandit, Citi has devoted much of its resources and tied its hopes for future profitability to banking in developing countries, where there is comparatively more growth and less crippling economic uncertainty than in the United States.
Last month, Citigroup agreed to sell its part of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the joint brokerage venture, to Morgan Stanley, beginning with a 14 percent stake. Citigroup said at the time that it was writing down the value of its remaining interest in the business.
Citigroup is still trying to work through the glut of bad assets it holds in its Citi Holdings unit, which reported a $3.56 billion loss in the third quarter, up from a $1.23 billion loss in the same period of last year. Without the charge related to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the losses in that unit are reduced to $679 million.
Excluding the loss on its brokerage unit, a one-time accounting charge and credit adjustments, the bank reported a profit of $3.27 billion, or $1.06 a share, up from $2.57 billion, or 84 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analyst expectations of earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $18.7 billion. The bank's stock was up more than 5 percent, to $36.66, on the results.
Since barely limping through the 2008 financial crisis, Citi has been working to forge a new direction that will help restore the bank to profitability. As part of its strategy, Citi has worked to sharply reduce the bank's expenses and credit losses while trying to shed its most troubled assets.
The bank's efforts at a revival have been hampered, though, by obstacles and missteps. In March, citing concerns that Citi might not have enough cash to withstand the most extreme economic downturn, the Federal Reserve scuttled the bank's plans to raise its dividend or increase share buybacks. The move was a tough blow for Citi, especially because most of the bank's rivals were allowed to raise dividend payments. After the Fed decision, Citi's shareholders rebuffed a $15 million pay package for Mr. Pandit, the chief executive, in April.
On Monday, Citi was able to trumpet growth in its core businesses like consumer lending and investment banking. "Our core businesses showed momentum during the quarter as we increased lending and generated higher operating revenues," Mr. Pandit said in a statement.
John C. Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer, echoed Mr. Pandit's assertion on a conference call on Monday, pointing out the "underlying growth story in the numbers."
Citi is being buoyed by greater demand for loans in Latin America. Mr. Gerspach said the consumer lending unit in Latin America was having "4 percent, 5 percent growth quarter over quarter." Revenue in the region grew 7 percent, to $2.4 billion.
Profit in its international consumer banking unit fell 3 percent, to $862 million, from $885 million in the period a year earlier. Activity in Asia was hurt, in part, by lower interest rates that tamp down revenue the bank can get from its lending in the region.
In South Korea, Citi had to navigate a shifting regulatory landscape, especially when the country's officials capped interest rates on a variety of consumer loans.
While Citigroup did not get the same help from mortgages as rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which reported robust profits on Friday from a refinancing frenzy, the bank reported an 18 percent increase in profit in its North American banking segment, in part because of mortgage lending. Even though mortgage originations were down, revenue in the unit was up, in part as a result of widening spreads on the loans.
Across the bank, consumer banking posted revenue gains of 2 percent, to $10.2 billion, from the period a year earlier, while net income in the consumer banking unit increased 18 percent, to $2.2 billion.
Another bright spot for Citigroup on Monday was the 67 percent increase in profit from its securities and banking unit, as the bank benefited from revived capital market activity.
"We continue to gain market share in investment banking," Mr. Gerspach said. He pointed to "improved market share in every investment product."
Equity trading in the investment bank soared 76 percent from the same period a year earlier.
Some analysts took note on Monday. The results in the investment banking and securities business were "much better than we were expecting," Gerard S. Cassidy, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research report.
Other banking analysts were also heartened by Citi's results. "Several moving parts, but mostly progress everywhere," Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura, said in a research note.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What Should M.T.A. Do? A Range of Views

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The multiple-choice question placed on the table by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Monday does not have a none-of-the-above option, unfortunately.
One way or another, it looks like subway and bus fares are going up. But the authority has not decided yet how to distribute the pain - additionally burden regular riders, occasional users, or both? -- and is seeking public input. We asked readers their thoughts on four possibilities presented by the authority:
1. Leave base fare at $2.25. Increase 30-day unlimited-ride MetroCard price to $125 from $104. Cut 7-percent bonus on pay-per-ride cards to 5 percent. 
2. Leave base fare at $2.25. Increase 30-day unlimited card price to $119. Eliminate pay-per-ride bonus.
3. Increase base fare to $2.50. Increase 30-day unlimited card to $109. Eliminate pay-per-ride bonus.
4. Increase base fare to $2.50. Increase 30-day unlimited card to $112. Keep 7-percent pay-per-ride bonus intact.
Here are some of your responses:
The bonuses are a pain if they are not full increments. Option #3 is best as it's the only one that keeps the monthly worthwhile. The raise on single is painful, but at least it will be eliminate all those cards with scattered remainder amounts. -- Dennis, NYC
The bulk of the increase should be to the unlimited card(s) - these provide very low fares with high usage. (I pay less than a dollar per ride based on using a 30-day card an average of 3 times a day or more.) The idea of higher usage benefitting the MTA doesn't apply here; I am paying a lower fare than I probably did 20-30 years ago (with inflation factored in). -- Ed B., NYC
I prefer the larger % increase on single rides and weekly unlimited, while keeping monthly unlimited cards close to or at current rates. Single rides & weekly cards are largely used by tourists, let them bear the burden of the fare increase, not local workers who use MTA every single day to get around the city and largely use a monthly unlimited card to do so. -- Chris, NYC
Stop raising the price of the 30-day card (it's not a monthly card) so aggressively. When I buy the 30-day card, the MTA gets the use of my money in one lump sum up front. You would think they would encourage that, rather than encouraging people to buy one ride at a time. -- Dr. Edna, New York
I would think the single-fare user base includes a significant percentage of riders with lower incomes; that is, ones who often have to get somewhere (e.g., home where the children are waiting; to work in the morning after they leave for school) but can't afford to pull together more than that single fare at that moment. Ipso facto: these are the residents we least want to place an economic burden on. When in doubt always think first about the resident of the city at the bottom of the economic ladder! -- lynneb, northampton, ma
Number (1) of the above choices. But my first choice would be to eliminate the unlimited ride options. Those buyers tend to be commuters. The MTA has to buy extra train cars to accommodate the commute period. The power companies charge more during peak usage. They have to build extra plants just to cover such times. I see no reason why we should be giving discounts to peak time transit users.
-- Don Wiss, Brooklyn, NY

HEADLINE: After Childhood Pouring Refills, Reaching Beyond the Past

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio
Bridgette the waitress glides through morning at Donna's Diner with an easy, familiar air, as though she were born somewhere between the cash register and the coffee maker. She is a constant, like pancakes on the menu.
It has been this way since her hardworking grandmother, Donna Dove, opened the modest diner a dozen years ago here in the small Ohio city of Elyria. At 9 years old, Bridgette was taking phone orders, reciting daily specials and saving her tips for the princess canopy bed she had seen in a store window on Broad Street. Customers just loved little ''Bridgy.''
Her mother and grandmother each became pregnant at 16, but little Bridgy Harvan, now almost 21, broke that emerging pattern. When not working, she attends Lorain County Community College, Elyria's academic marvel. She studies her textbooks during the breaks in diner action, like a cartographer charting a path through the unknown.
All the while, though, she keeps an eye on her customers -- especially the older regulars known as the Breakfast Club. They drink their coffee and reminisce about the days when Elyria was in ascent. She pours their coffee and tries to imagine such a place. 
''More coffee, Jim?'' she asks, wielding a coffeepot. ''Dale, a refill?''
It is a small, unifying moment, shared between past and future in present-day Elyria, a city with cascading waterfalls and a declining downtown, Fortune 500 companies and a shuttered Y.M.C.A., upper-middle-class homes and homes in foreclosure, intense local pride and an acute need for economic rejuvenation.
''Speedy,'' Bridgette calls to a white-haired man with a hearing aid. ''Coffee?''
But as she patrols the narrow diner with coffeepot in hand, Bridgette is also juggling the hopes and obligations of a young woman trying to find her way. She is living with a boyfriend who is out of work. She is slowly inching toward degrees in ultrasound technology and business marketing. She is collecting coupons to save money. And lately she has been feeling tired, even a little woozy.
Bridgette can hardly be faulted, then, for not fully grasping the broad American experience to be found among her customers. With their anecdotes and war stories, these people provide the Elyrian context.
The Breakfast Club
Take the Breakfast Club. It began meeting many decades ago -- before Donna was even born -- at the old Paradise Restaurant on Broad Street, back when that commercial strip hummed. Its members carried ''Birds of Paradise'' business cards and flipped a coin daily to see who got stuck with the tab.
The faces changed with time, and so did the venue, as restaurants closed and downtown options narrowed. These days the gathering is at Donna's Diner, in a 19th-century building on the city square, where the Breakfast Club's nostalgia can create the illusion that Elyria's manufacturing base never went away, that its commercial soul never fled to the Midway Mall on the city's outskirts, near Interstates 80 and 90.
Here at the table, among others, are Jim Dall, who ran the Ford dealership, now gone; and John Murbach, who owned a prominent building-supply business, gone; and Janice Haywood, who with her husband, Tom, sold the finer things at Brandau Jewelers, gone.
Here, too, are Speedy Amos, who saw combat in both World War II and the Korean War; and Bill Balena, a bankruptcy lawyer whose business is hopping; and Connee Smith, who is related to THE Garfords, as in the industrialist Arthur Lovett Garford, the inventor of the padded bicycle seat. They used to say in Elyria that ''Mr. Garford saved our butts.''
Bridgette and her mother, Kristy, take their orders, while Donna conducts the grill with her spatula baton, tucking at the whitening edges of eggs as she frets about unpaid bills and fewer customers. She is considering a suggestion by one of her regulars, a judge, to close the diner and run the cafeteria in the nearby county courthouse.
This, of course, would alter life in a small corner of Elyria and disrupt the general continuity of the Breakfast Club, whose daily gatherings are really extensions of the same never-ending meal. Conversations are left on the table, to be picked up like an unpaid tab the next morning, or maybe the next week.
These free-flowing discussions are salted with tidbits of Elyrian pride. The city's founder, Heman Ely, a New Englander who came here in the early 1800s to build mills along the cascading Black River, is buried not far from the BP Station. The first chartered high school west of the Alleghenies is down the street. The First Congregational Church has stunning Tiffany stained glass.
The expected decorum at the table is the lack of it, reflected in everything from the mismatched plates and mugs to the occasional naughty aside.
''Good morning, ladies,'' Dale Price, 70, a retired telephone repairman, says to his two eggs sunny-side up, jiggling them with his fork. But his plate has the last laugh; when he cuts into his sausage, juice squirts onto his blue shirt.
Eccentricities are tolerated. Everyone knows that Jim, 89, a fine athlete in his day, takes morning swims in his backyard pool, nude. That Dale always pays for his check with crisp $2 bills from the Lorain National Bank a few doors down. And that Speedy, 86, will inevitably bring up his battle career, for which he might receive a salute -- partly in jest, mostly with deep respect.
As much as anyone, Speedy represents the Elyria that was.
Returning from World War II as a former Marine with shrapnel in his right arm -- a piece of Okinawa -- Speedy finished college at roughly the age that Bridgette is now, moved to Elyria from eastern Ohio and joined his uncle's insurance agency, which was right across the street from where he sits in the diner. Was.
He rented a cheap room at the Y.M.C.A., bought a Ford from Jim Dall and joined the city's upswing. Back then, you had the General Motors plant on Lowell Street, the General Industries factory on Olive and Taylor, and dozens of other manufacturers adding to the city's prosperous din. Every side street seemed to have a tool and die shop.
From 1940 to 1970, the population doubled to more than 50,000, which meant a housing boom -- and good luck finding downtown parking on a Friday night. There were three movie theaters, a J. C. Penney, a Sears, Merthe's department store, the Paradise, on and on. At one point, Brandau Jewelers needed 24 employees to handle the demand for fine-cut diamonds and exquisite porcelain figurines.
Speedy began to make his mark here in Elyria. But when the Korean War broke out in 1950, he interrupted his insurance-and-golf life to innocently ask whether the Marines needed any reserves. Before he knew it, he was in the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea, among some 25,000 anxious, frostbitten troops who were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by Chinese soldiers.
Before making their improbable, heroic escape, fighting through deadly roadblocks and the forbidding cold, the men who came to be known as the Chosin Few were instructed to destroy the contents in their wallets. Gone went Speedy's family photographs, his golf club membership card, his driver's license with an Elyria address.
Speedy eventually returned to that address, returned to all that he believed he had been protecting. He married Helen Lou Henderson -- Lou, everyone calls her -- and joined the Junior Chamber of Commerce, the V.F.W., the Red Cross, the Rotary. He fathered two daughters and lost a son at birth. He became a deacon at the First Congregational Church, worshiping beneath that Tiffany glass. Retired now, he volunteers with literacy programs and Meals on Wheels.
For many years, his wife says, Speedy never talked about his war experiences. But as time has slipped away, so has his guard. His prior life as a battle-tested Marine is now central to who he is. Every November, he puts on his dress blues -- still fits -- and leads a birthday celebration for the United States Marine Corps.
Sometimes, when sipping hot coffee just poured by Bridgette, Speedy can feel the ice-hard Korean ground and see the trucks plowing snow over the frozen, contorted American dead. Sometimes, when eating one of Donna's sweet pancakes, he can recall tucking packets of frozen food close to his chest, so that his body heat might thaw a few beans to be scraped off and eaten.
Sometimes, when the Breakfast Club banter is lively and the diner telephone's ringtone is playing ''There's no place like home'' and here's another round of refills, Speedy has that isolating sensation known to battle veterans: of being among those who cannot know what it was like, of wondering why he was among those to survive.
How the hidden enemy would taunt with bell rings and bugle bleats. How boots marching on snow made a soul-chilling crunch. And how being on the other side of the world, shivering and scared, can make a place like Elyria seem so improbable.
Keeping Memories Alive
Memories are welcome at the Breakfast Club. Memories are expected. Memories fill the time while waiting for Bridgette to materialize with a refill.
For example, the sight of a rock-solid man who seems off somehow, hustling past the diner's window with head down, will prompt a ''There's Ike.'' This, in turn, will spur wistful memories of that man, Ike Maxwell, as the unstoppable, all-everything running back of the champion Elyria High School football team of 1971, back when high school sports dictated the social calendar.
And, of course, after every high school game, and after every high school reunion, you simply had to go to the Midway Oh Boy restaurant for an Oh Boy: two hamburger patties, cheese and shredded lettuce, with a slathering of a white sauce of secret ingredients. ''So that when you bite into it,'' says John Haynes, a lawyer -- and everyone laughs in anticipation, including Speedy, because they all know the sloppy wonder of eating an Oh Boy.
It's an Elyria thing. It's their thing.
Bridgette has been to the Midway Oh Boy, which is still selling its signature burgers on Lake Avenue. But she has no memory of the Breakfast Club's version of Elyria, her hometown. Heck, she wasn't even born when the Capitol movie theater was demolished -- or was it the Lincoln? -- and Speedy got permission to take some of the bricks that now form his backyard patio.
Bridgette graduated from Elyria High School in 2009. Before long, she had joined more than half of her graduating class of 444 students in taking classes at Lorain County Community College, an ever-expanding academic institution on 270 acres in the city's northeastern end. Everyone, from the mayor on down, sees it as vital to Elyria's future.
The college's longtime president, Roy A. Church, says he is committed to helping Elyria -- and northeastern Ohio -- regain its economic viability, now that its once-dominant manufacturing base has been displaced by the service industry. The low-paying jobs listed by Bridgette's Facebook friends provide a glimpse into what's out there now: crew person at McDonald's, associate at Jo-Ann Fabric, counter sales at Budget Auto, sales associate at Victoria's Secret, crew member at Burger King.
To change this pattern, Dr. Church has gradually broadened the institution's scope well beyond what is usually understood by the term ''community college.'' It offers bachelor's and master's degrees through its association with 10 Ohio universities. It provides job retraining. It works with local leaders to attract larger companies seeking to relocate.
The campus looks like the grounds of a large technology company, which isn't far from the truth. It has an ''innovation institute'' where would-be entrepreneurs receive start-up money, office space and technical support. It has a ''fab lab'' where students -- and the general public -- have access to digital-fabrication tools that can help them design and create products. It has a center that offers packaging solutions for companies that make sensors. It even has a ready-made technology park, with building sites available.
Most of this is directed toward a central goal: to help Elyria and the region find the Next Big Thing.
''We've had to raise the aspirations -- and the spirit -- of the place,'' Dr. Church says. ''It's a slow go, but we're well into it.''
Bridgette is part of these raised aspirations. She sees her grandmother, Donna, working hard every day, without ever seeming to get ahead, and her mother, Kristy, waiting on table after table. ''That's when I decided I'm not doing that,'' Bridgette says. ''I need sleep! I need insurance! And a 401(k)! I need those things. I need those things.''
Turning 21
The diner days blend together like eggs whisked in a bowl. Then, one midsummer morning, a large birthday cake with white and orange frosting is placed on the long table reserved for the Breakfast Club. Little Bridgy is 21.
''Do you have enough breath to blow those out?'' teases Speedy Amos, motioning to the stand of candles plunged into the cake.
Bridgette assures the man who is four times her age that, yes, she can do it. Her familiar air is on display. When two more members of the Breakfast Club walk through the door and into the small commotion, Bridgette calls out:
''Hi, girls. Do you want to sing 'Happy Birthday' and then I'll come wait on you?''
Sure, the customers say.
The song is sung, the cake is divided, and Bridgette returns to work. In a few weeks, she will be back at school, plotting a better future for herself and the child she is carrying.

HEADLINE: Retail Spending Showed Broad September Gains

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent more money at retailers in September -- a surge that reflected growing consumer confidence and Apple's introduction of the iPhone 5.
Retail sales jumped 1.1 percent last month, producing the best two months of sales in two years, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
''The consumer is back,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. ''They are not spending money like it is going out of style, but they are spending at a more normal pace that is consistent with a moderately growing economy.'' 
The increase in retail sales came only 10 days after the government reported that unemployment fell to 7.8 percent in September, its lowest level since President Obama took office. And it followed a survey last week by the University of Michigan that showed consumer confidence rose in early October to a five-year high.
Businesses appeared to be banking on a resurgent consumer. A second Commerce Department report on Monday showed that companies increased their inventories in August by 0.6 percent after a 0.8 percent gain in July. Overall sales were up 0.5 percent in August after a 0.9 percent rise in July that followed a big drop in June. Companies typically increase their stockpiles of goods when they expect sales to rise in coming months.
The retail sales report was the government's first monthly look at consumer spending. Consumer spending is critical because it drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.
In September, retailers made gains in almost every major category. That contrasted with August's retail sales, which rose almost entirely on the strength of auto sales and higher gas prices.
Sales of electronics and appliances last month swelled 4.5 percent, in part because of iPhone sales. Sales at auto dealers increased 1.3 percent. Building materials and garden supplies, furniture and clothing sales all gained, too.
Some of the September increase also reflected higher food and gas prices. If those prices continue to rise, consumers might cut back elsewhere and keep growth from accelerating. But economists pointed to a key measure of sales that rose a solid 0.9 percent without counting autos and gas station sales.
''We saw a cautious consumer in August because they had to spend more on gasoline,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior economist at IHS Global Insight. ''Now in September, the consumer is starting to spend more on other items. Consumers are feeling better.''
Mr. Christopher said the introduction of the new Apple iPhone 5 was definitely a factor in September. He estimated that four million iPhones were sold in the United States in the latter half of September.
The gain from electronics and appliance stores added only about 0.1 percentage point to September retail sales increase. So even excluding that gain, sales were solid, Mr. Christopher said.
Economic growth was anemic in the first half of the year, held back by weaker consumer spending. The latest economic figures suggested that consumers were shaking off high unemployment and the threat of tax increases and sharp government spending cuts that could come next year if Congress failed to reach a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
Mr. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors said that threat had kept businesses from stepping up hiring. But he said he expected that consumers would help the economy emerge from the malaise that clouded the spring.
''What the recent economic reports suggest is that once the fiscal cliff issue is cleared, payroll and economic growth should surge regardless of the election results,'' Mr. Naroff said.

HEADLINE: Hey, That's My Professor Cursing on the Stage

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- David P. Schmidt stood center stage at the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University here and glowered through his glasses at the audience before leaping into a corrosive, expletive-laden monologue from ''Glengarry Glen Ross.'' His character, Blake, is a hotshot manager, sent by the home office to inspire a handful of real estate salesmen with a contest: First prize, an Eldorado. Second prize, a set of steak knives. Third prize, you're fired.
In this staging of David Mamet's 1984 play -- with Blake grafted in from the 1992 film adaptation -- the salesmen whom Blake hectors stood behind Dr. Schmidt. Instead of speaking to them, he delivered his screed directly to the audience, making eye contact to increase the level of discomfort.
The listeners were used to seeing Dr. Schmidt speak. Most, after all, were Fairfield undergraduates, and many were in his classes on business ethics or business law. But they had never seen him quite like this. 
''A couple of my students told me that they were unnerved to see their ethics teacher playing that role,'' Dr. Schmidt said later. ''I think it challenged their expectations, or their stereotypes. And that can be a learning process.''
A collaboration between the university's arts and sciences and business schools, the production earlier this month was part of the syllabus for a dozen classes in business, economics, philosophy, communications and politics. A political science course took a Marxist view, discussing the work as an emblem of the dark side of capitalism. A philosophy course on existentialism examined the way the characters lost sight of their true selves. Business professors focused on both the ethical and practical problems of the office depicted in the play.
Mostly, ''Glengarry'' was used to give the Fairfield students, many of whom are already worried about finding jobs in a slow economy, a glimpse of a harsh reality: a world where they may find themselves subject to abusive managers who pit them against one another, with the threat of firing always in the air.
''We talk a lot about preparing people to go out into the world and find jobs, but we don't talk much about what it's going to be like out there,'' said Alistair Highet, the play's director and the editor of the university's alumni magazine.
To bring these lessons more fully to life for students, Mr. Highet cast most of the principal roles with faculty members: people the students would know in a different context. Along with Dr. Schmidt, Donald E. Gibson, the dean of the business school, played John Williamson, the office manager, and two philosophy professors, Dennis Keenan and Ryan Drake, played the struggling salesmen, Shelly Levene and George Aaronow.
Other roles were played by members of Actor's Nucleus, a company based in nearby Bethlehem, Conn., which brought twists of its own: both Richard Roma, the most aggressive and successful of the salesmen, and his client, James Lingk, were played by actresses, Kelly Briney and Melora Mennesson. (The characters' names were changed to Ricky and Jamie.)
''Once we decided that Kelly should play Roma,'' Mr. Highet explained, ''that meant that Lingk should be a woman too.'' Partly, he said, that was to ensure that the scene in which Roma sells property to Lingk would not be seen as a matter of sexual dynamics -- ''a woman using her wiles to get what she wanted,'' as he put it.
''But I also wanted to respect Mamet's text, so I preserved the masculine pronouns as much as I could,'' he added. ''Roma speaks about herself as a man in a world of men, and Levene says, 'Roma is a good man, we know she is.' I liked the effect that this generated, and the questions about gender in the workplace that the casting brought to the surface. But those were a bonus.''
In its first stab at using a single play as the basis for interdisciplinary study, Fairfield last year presented the Spanish playwright Juan Mayorga's ''Perpetual Peace,'' about the use of torture in the war on terrorism, in a translation by Jerelyn Johnson, a professor in the modern language and literatures department.
It was at the cast party for that show that Dr. Gibson, the business school dean, proposed staging ''Glengarry.'' (He and others involved said they had no idea at the time that the work would be revived on Broadway next month, starring Al Pacino and Bobby Cannavale.)
''I see this play as a cautionary tale,'' said Dr. Gibson, whose specialty is studying employee anger. ''Workplaces can be like this. But they don't have to be.''
At his business ethics class last Thursday morning, Dr. Schmidt got quickly to the point. ''Is the workplace depicted in the play,'' he asked his students, ''someplace you'd like to work?''
When no hands were raised, Dr. Schmidt mentioned that in another class, students who had held internships told him that they had worked under similar conditions and hated it, but also found the competition exciting.
As the 90-minute class ended, he made clear what he hoped students would take away from the experience.
''What you saw in the play was a company -- and my character in particular -- stressing the system to its breaking point,'' he said. ''You can make a lot of money doing that, if you don't mind the human cost. But the central rule of ethics is, do no harm. And here, a lot of harm was being done to a lot of people.''
Deirdre Gallagher, a junior, said she appreciated the chance to see interoffice dynamics enacted, not just talked about. ''Here we saw something that could happen in real life,'' she said.
But Jerry Bivona, a junior, found the play unbalanced. ''There was nothing ethical about the way these characters behaved,'' he said. ''I wish they could have found a play that also had a positive element.''
Lisa Tkach, a sophomore, said that in her philosophy class students talked about how Mr. Mamet's characters abandoned their ideal, moral selves to get ahead in business. They also concluded, Ms. Tkach said, that the playwright's use of profanity was meant to convey their degradation.
''As a salesman became more corrupt, there was an increase in the profane language used by that character,'' she explained in an e-mail, but also observed, ''It's even stranger that a majority of the class was more taken aback by the amount of profanity than the actual immoral actions of the characters.''
Dr. Gibson and Dr. Johnson both said they hoped to continue integrating theater into their broader course plans. And Dr. Schmidt, though unsure whether he would take up another acting role, said he hoped the program would continue as well.
''We go to plays not just to be entertained,'' he said, ''but to learn, and, most deeply, to learn about ourselves. We're leveraging that by making explicit connections with our classes. I think it's a really great innovation.''

HEADLINE: Prime Minister Emphasizes His Belief That Greece Will Stay in European Union

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
ATHENS -- Even as talks with international creditors stalled, the Greek prime minister expressed optimism on Monday that an agreement would be reached that would end once and for all speculation that the country will leave the euro zone.
''After this deal is over, drachma phobia will be over,'' Antonis Samaras, the prime minister, said during a short interview on the sidelines of a conference in Athens. ''Therefore the psychology will be different, the expectations will be different, and we will make it.'' 
But several leading business executives at the same conference indicated they saw little sign of progress in reducing government regulations to encourage entrepreneurship, or in fixing the banking system so that companies can obtain credit. And one analyst said there was still a 90 percent chance that Greece would have to leave the euro zone.
''We haven't seen many structural reforms actually implemented,'' said Megan Greene, director of economic research on Western Europe at Roubini Global Economics, a research firm in New York known for bearish forecasts. ''If they are implemented, they will take time to pay off. So we are looking at shrinking growth for years to come.''
''Greece's future is austerity and retrenchment and in my view a decade of depression,'' Ms. Greene said at the conference, organized by The International Herald Tribune.
Not all conference participants were so pessimistic. Joly Dixon, a former European Commission official who is advising the Greek government, pointed out that the cost of labor had plunged, improving the country's ability to compete on world markets.
''Greece has actually made remarkable progress in improving its cost-effectiveness,'' Mr. Dixon said. ''It's a welcome development, but it's not enough.''
The reminder of the grave challenges facing Greece came as Yannis Stournaras, the Greek finance minister, said it was unlikely that negotiations with the so-called troika of international lenders would be finished by Thursday in time for a Brussels summit meeting of European Union leaders.
Mr. Samaras had hoped to present other European Union leaders with a deal Thursday. But the talks with the troika -- the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank -- have stalled over the lenders' insistence on layoffs in the civil service and an overhaul of labor laws. The changes would include a reduction in the severance pay given to dismissed workers, as well as a longer workweek.
Evangelos Venizelos, president of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, a junior partner in the governing coalition, said at the conference that Greece needed more time to turn around its economy and pleaded for the troika to release more than 31.5 billion euros ($40.79 billion) in aid all at once rather than in tranches. ''We need to get all 31.5 billion all in one go,'' Mr. Venizelos said. ''Society can't take anymore. It has reached its limit. It needs hope.''
There was general agreement among both government representatives and business leaders at the conference that Greece still faced huge problems. But they disagreed on whether a turnaround was possible soon or was far in the future.
Kostis Chatzidakis, the Greek minister of development, said that Greece had, for example, improved coordination between government departments so that investors no longer needed to go from agency to agency getting approvals.
''Greece is really trying very hard; this is a superhuman effort that we're doing on a daily basis in government,'' he said. ''The climate is slowly but steadily changing.''
But several business managers who spoke at the conference expressed frustration at what they said was slow action on improving business conditions.
''If we don't solve the problems plaguing the banking system in Greece, nothing can move forward -- the rest is just a paper exercise,'' said Constantinos Antonopoulos, chief executive of the Intralot Group, a Greek company that provides services and equipment used by the gambling industry and government lotteries.
''Right now we couldn't have a worse environment for Greek investors,'' Mr. Antonopoulos said. ''We have structural reforms, but those will take years'' to bear fruit, he said.
Vassilis Antoniades, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, said that a survey of the 30 largest investors in Greece found that they had a positive view of infrastructure like ports and the educational level of Greek workers. But investors complained about government bureaucracy and an unpredictable tax system, he said.
Tax evasion was a recurrent theme. Mr. Venizelos defended himself against accusations that he had failed to take action on a list of possible tax evaders provided by Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, when she was French finance minister.
According to news reports, the list names nearly 2,000 Greeks with a total of almost $2 billion in Swiss bank accounts.
Mr. Venizelos said that he was unhappy that Greek officials had not investigated the names on the list more intensively but that the amount involved was a small percentage of the 70 billion euros in deposits that had left the country, or the 52 billion euros in unpaid back taxes.
Mr. Venizelos also predicted that the governing coalition led by Mr. Samaras would survive a full term. ''I do believe we have another 3.5 years ahead of us to get results,'' he said.
A bit of good news for Greeks came from Simon Anholt, a consultant who provides image advice to governments. ''Greece still has remarkable equity in its brand, if I can use that awful word,'' he said. ''Greece has got a very serious reality problem.''

HEADLINE: Euro Here to Stay

BYLINE: By PAUL TAYLOR | REUTERS

 BODY:
PARIS -- The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the European Union arrived just as a realization was dawning that Europe's single currency -- the Union's most ambitious project -- had survived three years of incessant financial turmoil and was not going to break up.
But having narrowly avoided an acrimonious divorce and the loss of some of its errant children, the euro zone risks a future as an unequal, loveless marriage with frequent rows and the prospect of separate bedrooms.
Two things have become clearer in the past few weeks that had been widely disputed: Contrary to prevailing opinion earlier this year, the euro is here to stay; and it could very well keep all its 17 members and add more. 
But the euro zone has not yet found a way out of the doldrums of economic stagnation, unemployment and social dislocation that are widening the gap between northern and southern Europe and fueling euro-skeptical populist movements in many countries.
Three events have changed the outlook for the euro area.
First, the European Central Bank put a floor under the euro zone by agreeing last month to buy unlimited quantities of bonds of any troubled member state that accepted the conditions of a bailout program. The E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, made it clear that the bank would use all its tools to defeat anyone betting on a breakup of the monetary union.
Second, the euro zone's permanent rescue fund became operative last week after months of wrangling and legal challenges, providing a backstop of &#x20ac;500 billion, or $645 billion, for countries that risk losing access to capital markets.
Third, the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, signaled by visiting Athens that the Union's most powerful economy wanted Greece to stay in the euro area; she drew a line after months of debate in Berlin, notably in her own coalition, about ejecting the Greeks.
As a result of those developments, a flood of scenarios for the explosion and breakup of the euro, which had spewed for months from banks and political risk consulting firms in London and in New York, has suddenly dried up.
In currency markets, short bets against the euro have subsided. Bond yields have fallen and bank shares have recovered. Spanish banks are having to borrow less from the E.C.B. as some of them regain access to the money markets.
In another indication of a changed climate, economists at Citigroup have revised their view that Greece would almost certainly leave the euro, saying that important euro zone players seem to have decided that a Greek exit would do more harm than good.
The U.S. bank lowered the probability of a Greek exit to 60 percent from 90 percent, although it still believes Greece is more likely than not to leave the euro within 12 to 18 months, arguing that European governments are unlikely to agree to waive part of the country's huge debt to make it sustainable.
Do not write off a write-off, though -- especially if it can be delayed until after the German general election next year. It may then seem a more rational, albeit unpopular, option than a disorderly Greek default and exit, with all the disastrous economic and social consequences for Greece and Europe.
One voice last week contrasted with the easing of European existential anxiety: The International Monetary Fund said the Union's policy response remained ''critically incomplete, exposing the euro area to a downward spiral of capital flight, breakup fears and economic decline.''
In its role as a teller of uncomfortable truths, the I.M.F. is trying to jolt the euro zone, especially Germany, into moving ahead faster with a banking union, as well as closer fiscal integration and an altering of the policy mix between austerity and growth.
In a candid acknowledgement, the I.M.F. said it had underestimated the damage to growth wrought by budget cutting and urged Europe to ease up on austerity, drawing an indignant rebuff from the German finance minister.
The shift in perceptions about the euro zone is more noticeable in the financial markets than on the streets, where the effects of the sovereign debt crisis will continue to cause damage for years to come.
Public spending cuts and recession are tearing at the fabric of societies in places like Athens and Madrid, casting many middle-class families and retirees into poverty and more unemployed and young people into precarious situations.
The crisis has changed the balance of power in Europe, giving Germany and its north European allies a superior say in euro zone decision-making that is commensurate with their credit ratings, while making southern states weaker and more dependent.
A two-speed Europe, in which everyone was heading in the same direction at different paces, may now be turning into a two-tier Europe, with the euro zone becoming a tighter inner core with its own budget and stricter rules, while Britain, Sweden and some others form a looser outer circle.
Germany, determined to limit its taxpayers' liabilities for other euro states, has rejected the issuing of common euro zone bonds or providing a guarantee for joint bank deposits.
The German, Dutch and Finnish finance ministers are trying to rule out any retroactive use of euro zone rescue funds.
Yet Berlin supports the emerging idea of a separate euro zone budget to cope with asymmetric economic shocks. Its backing for a single banking supervisor will surely open the door to some greater risk mutualization, where members receive dividends for doing business in a cooperative setting, in the longer term.
As the euro area becomes a more integrated federal bloc, E.U. members outside the single currency zone face awkward choices. Those like Poland, Hungary and Latvia that aspire to join the monetary union as soon as possible are trying to hug the euro zone as tightly as possible, demanding seats and votes in a new banking supervisory authority that makes decisions on banks operating on their soil.
Poland tried unsuccessfully last week to push into the inner sanctum of euro zone finance ministers by offering to join a group of E.U. states establishing a financial transaction tax in return for a seat at the Eurogroup table -- the regular meetings of finance ministers of the euro zone countries. It was told only euro members could attend. Britain, which has no intention of joining either the euro or the banking union, is demanding a veto right to protect its large financial sector from decisions taken by the others, while aiming to use closer euro zone integration as an opportunity to negotiate a loosening of its own European ties. Sweden, with a pro-euro political establishment that lost a referendum on joining the currency in 2003, seems more uneasy and conflicted about the euro zone's moving ahead without it.
All of this means Europe faces a tense period of reshaping that will severely test its Nobel-recognized powers of building peace and prosperity on a fractious continent.

HEADLINE: Signs of Possible Recovery Buoy Chinese Exporters

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- Buyers from around the world thronged the cavernous halls of the Canton Fair at its opening day on Monday as a new and somewhat more optimistic mood seemed to take hold among Chinese exporters.
With only a few exceptions, exporters of products as varied as hammers, electric fans and gaudy wall decorations for nightclubs said that demand from emerging markets and the United States was beginning to recover.
''It's getting better,'' said Zhang Lu, the sales manager of Ningbo Dabu Welding Technology, which sells welding helmets with heavily tinted safety visors and designs on the sides that include flaming skulls and American eagles. 
China's credit squeeze also appears to be easing. Chen Wenfei, the assistant general manager of Jiangmen Ruirong Pump Industry, said that a recent bank loan to buy factory equipment and rising export orders had allowed the company to hire 30 workers, bringing the total to 330.
The loan process ''was very fast -- we are an existing customer, and they increased our credit line,'' said Mr. Chen, whose company exports water well pumps to the Mideast and North Africa.
Yet demand in China is still flat, executives from provinces across China said in interviews. Many companies still have sizable inventories of unsold goods. And while Chinese exports to many markets have been surprisingly strong this fall, sales to Europe are still falling, with no end in sight.
In the latest sign of chronic overcapacity, wholesale prices were down 3.6 percent last month from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics announced Monday. Prices are still rising at the consumer level but at an ever slower pace, up 1.9 percent last month from a year earlier.
The mood at the Canton Fair, China's main export fair with nearly 60,000 exhibition stalls, has nonetheless improved strikingly from the previous session of the twice-a-year event, last held in April, even though any economic recovery in China itself seems narrowly based and may not last.
The Chinese government announced Saturday that exports grew 9.9 percent last month, almost twice as fast as most forecasts, while a broad measure of the money supply also increased faster than expected.
The nascent economic recovery seems not to depend on a sustainable revival of consumer spending in China.
Instead, it appears heavily dependent on exports -- which may cause additional job losses in struggling overseas economies and could result in increased calls from politicians like Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president of the United States, for more confrontational trade and currency policies toward China.
The early signs of an improving economy are also underpinned by investment spending, largely financed by a potentially inflationary surge in loans from state-owned banks to government construction projects.
''It seems that while people are searching for signs of China's consumption taking the lead, it is the good old exports and investment that might lead the recovery again, at least in the short term,'' Wang Tao, a China economist at UBS, wrote in a research note Monday.
Many economists expect the Chinese government to announce Thursday that economic growth in the third quarter was barely short of the official target of 7.5 percent. But Chinese business executives said that the reality was worse for many companies selling in the domestic market, leaving considerable room for a rebound.
''All industries are going down, but why aren't the official statistics going down?'' asked Bob Wang, the sales manager of Kralle Tools, a manufacturer in Wenzhou, an eastern city, that makes circular saw blades for lumber mills.
He said he believed that government officials had been underestimating the extent of China's slowdown to avoid losing face.
Liu Jianjun, the chief spokesman for the Canton Fair, cautioned in a statement Sunday that foreign demand still had not fully recovered. ''For the next few months, the export situation will remain very difficult,'' Mr. Liu said.
With real estate markets in much of the world still weak, Chinese exporters of construction products are less bullish than exporters of other goods.
''This year's business is worse than last year's,'' said Renee Wong, the export manager of Heng Feng Aluminum, which is based in Foshan in southern China and exports aluminum window frames to Africa, Australia and Poland. ''It's a hangover from the global financial crisis.''
American buyers nonetheless appeared to be more numerous than usual at the Canton Fair on Monday, with many catching the first two-hour morning train from Hong Kong. Demand from countries that export commodities and populous nations has also been unexpectedly robust.
''Australia is steady, India is strong -- Europe is slowly falling asleep,'' said Marlies Janssen, the Dutch chief executive of Retail D'sign Factory, a design and purchasing company based in Shanghai that specializes in vacuum cleaners and kitchen blenders.
But Japanese buyers were conspicuous by their near absence from the fair, a consequence of a territorial dispute over seven uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that set off anti-Japanese demonstrations in many Chinese cities, with dozens of Japanese cars destroyed.
Chinese exports have benefited partly from a halt to the appreciation of the renminbi, China's currency, against the dollar this year.
The renminbi has bobbed up and down around 6.3 to the dollar, even weakening by 1 percent for a while in the summer.
Investors have been taking money out of China as the real estate market has weakened and the prospects for appreciation have faded, offsetting the continued inflows from China's persistent trade surpluses.
The product that seemed to draw the biggest crowds at the Canton Fair was one of potentially dubious legality. It was the ''stealth license plate,'' a remote-controlled electric frame for car license plates that can slide a black cover over the plate in two seconds to prevent the plate from being identified by automatic cameras at toll plazas or police speed traps.
Two lights in a plug-in dashboard display indicate whether the front and rear license plates are visible.
A saleswoman for the company, ZheJiang HongXu Industrial in Yongkang City, China, said that the devices could not be sold in China but were being exported to the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan.
She fell silent when her manager loudly ordered her not to discuss the product with any journalists.

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal in Mongolia Threatens Rio Tinto Project

BYLINE: By WILLIAM MACNAMARA

 BODY:
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia - Rio Tinto's biggest new mining project is under threat after the government of Mongolia said it was considering whether to renegotiate an investment agreement involving the $6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper mine. 
Mongolia's new government is in the process of passing a 2013 budget whose draft proposal includes increasing taxes and royalties on the mine by $300 million.
The mining industry has been a boon for the sparsely populated Mongolia, driven in large part after an agreement in 2009 for the copper mine at Oyu Tolgoi.
The deal awarded a 66 percent share of the mine to Turquoise Hill Resources, formerly Ivanhoe Mines, whose majority owner is Rio Tinto, the multinational mining company with headquarters in Melbourne and London. The agreement in 2009 froze tax rates over the life of the mine. It safeguarded the project for Rio Tinto and its suppliers, which began spending billions of dollars to build a vast copper mine in the Gobi Desert.
Even an attempt at renegotiation could hurt Rio Tinto. If the company seeks international arbitration to resolve the issue, it could delay the start date for the mine. Construction is almost complete, with commercial production expected to start in 2013.
In Ulan Bator, however, investors and foreign governments are more worried about the effect of renegotiation on the country's growth rate.
"If there appears to be an attempt at renegotiating or somehow reneging on the investment agreement, that could have a possibly catastrophic effect on the country," said David Wyche, the economic section chief at the United States Embassy in Ulan Bator. "It could stop the flow of foreign capital into Mongolia."
Last week, the caucus of Mongolia's Democratic Party, which leads a coalition government in place since August, passed a budget proposal that called for a new sliding royalty on Oyu Tolgoi's revenue that would rise to 20 percent depending on the copper price. The 2009 investment agreement set the royalty rate at 5 percent.
The new plan would also raise Oyu Tolgoi's effective tax rate by eliminating income-tax allowances. The government would bring in 221.3 billion tugriks, or $160 million, from the royalty and 224.5 billion tugriks, or $163 million, from corporate income tax, according to estimates in the draft budget proposal.
This week, the plan is expected to reach Parliament, which will decide whether to adopt or modify the proposal.
The budget is crucial for Mongolia, which faces a fiscal deficit this year that is expected to widen next year. Revenue from coal, the country's biggest export, plunged over the summer, national statistics show, because of a drop in both price and volume. Mongolia's mining boom depends on commodities demand from China, whose economy has slowed this year.
To date, Rio Tinto and its partners in the Oyu Tolgoi project have spent $6.2 billion building the mine. The project still requires billions of dollars to expand the mine, which is taking shape 1,300 meters beneath the surface of the Gobi Desert.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate In New York Poses a Test For Cuomo

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- While the nation's unemployment rate has been declining over the last year, New York State's has been rising sharply, presenting a challenge for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as he tries to build an image as a fiscal centrist who can transform the state's business climate.
Over the last 12 months, New York has been the only state with a statistically significant increase in its unemployment rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of August, the state's rate had climbed to 9.1 percent from 8.2 percent when Mr. Cuomo took office in January 2011, a reversal of the national trend, according to the federal household survey.
In every corner of the state, there are trouble spots. In the Bronx, the unemployment rate is nearly 14 percent. Along Lake Ontario, in rural Orleans County, shrinking manufacturing jobs and government payrolls have pushed unemployment to more than 11 percent. In St. Lawrence County, in the northern Adirondacks, the rate is also 11 percent. 
The Cuomo administration, backed by some economists, argues that New York's economic picture is more accurately reflected by other, more positive statistics. They point to a federal payroll study that shows New York doing well, relatively speaking -- with jobs growing by 1.4 percent over the last 12 months, an above-average rate. Initial unemployment insurance claims have also been falling.
''Simply relying on the household unemployment survey does not paint an accurate or complete picture of job creation in New York State because the sample used in that survey is inadequate,'' said Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for the governor.
''Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, jobs are being created at the fastest rate in four years, and the proof is in the numbers,'' he added, citing falling unemployment claims. ''New York has regained all of the 324,000 private-sector jobs lost in the recession,'' Mr. Bamberger said.
But for a governor often discussed as a 2016 presidential contender, the rising unemployment rate, which is based on a national survey of households, could be the statistic that prompts a thousand political ads if the trend continues -- Mr. Cuomo's potential opponents, after all, are unlikely to highlight conflicting economic data. (And the unemployment rate is not the only sign of economic concern: the state's poverty rate has also risen sharply.)
''Certainly, this would come under scrutiny if he ever ran for president,'' said Don Dutkowsky, an economist and professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. ''But there is a sense that he's taking hold of some real challenges and trying to move forward, and that's something we wouldn't mind seeing on the national stage either.''
Unemployment data from the national household survey has become something of a fetish in the current presidential race. Mitt Romney had assailed President Obama for failing to bring down the national jobless rate below 8 percent; it did fall to 7.8 percent in September.
Economists offered a range of theories about the reasons that unemployment and payroll numbers diverged in New York City, statewide and, to a lesser extent, in other parts of the Northeast. There are notable differences between the surveys: the unemployment data is based on a household survey that reaches the self-employed and people who work in agriculture, but the payroll survey is not. Some said the unemployment survey had shortcomings, particularly the relatively small number of people interviewed -- about 2,330 in New York State.
Others dismissed those concerns and said the numbers needed to be closely watched.
''It's something to keep an eye on,'' said David Hitchcock, the primary New York State analyst for Standard & Poor's.
But he said he was encouraged by data showing continuing private-sector job growth. Standard & Poor's has an AA rating for New York -- Mr. Hitchcock called that an ''average rating for the average state'' -- and also a positive outlook.
''It's not good if the unemployment rate goes up,'' he said.
''But if it looks like a temporary thing and private-sector job growth is continuing,'' he added, ''one would hope it would level off and come down again. If it doesn't, then I think there's something more fundamental going on.''
Marisa DiNatale, an economist at Moody's, said the unemployment numbers might miss some downstate population growth, while the more positive payroll numbers ''seem to be supported by other economic data coming out of the state that looks pretty good.''
''Certainly the economy has slowed in New York, and the pace of job growth has slowed,'' she said.
And James A. Parrott, chief economist at the labor-backed Fiscal Policy Institute, said: ''Unemployment is still a problem, but it's not as bad as the unemployment rate suggests.''
''The recovery is not as strong as it could be,'' he said, adding that much of the job growth has come in low-paying industries, like retail, restaurants and home health care.
Two senior officials at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, in a blog item posted on the Fed's Web site last month that focused on the New York City economy, explored and dismissed a few possible explanations for the divergence between the unemployment and payroll data.
''While there are several potential explanations, the stagnation of resident employment remains largely a puzzle,'' wrote Jason Bram, a senior economist, and James Orr, an assistant vice president in the regional analysis group.
''There seems to be no single overriding explanation for the gap between the two employment measures,'' they added. ''Other indicators of the city's economy are indicating a healthy recovery, particularly the low office vacancies and rising rents.''
Mr. Cuomo has talked frequently of the importance of job creation and economic development, but he has been in office less than two years, so the impact of some of his initiatives may not yet have been fully felt. He has governed as a fiscal centrist, championing laws that imposed a cap on property tax increases and lowered pension benefits for new state workers. This month, he has been conducting bus trips around the state to show off economic development projects receiving state aid.
But he has his work cut out for him. While the state budget is finally coming under control after years of outsize deficits, a growing fiscal crisis among New York's municipal governments is likely to put the state under stress. Last week, the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, ranked New York last among the 50 states for its business climate, while the conservative Cato Institute gave Mr. Cuomo a ''D'' grade in assessing his tax and spending record.
In a radio interview last week, Governor Cuomo's top aide, Lawrence S. Schwartz, said the reports were ''more based on ideology and not facts,'' adding that the groups ''took a bunch of data sets and manipulated them to fit their worldview.''

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Talks to Resume

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
Talks between the N.H.L. and the players association are scheduled to resume Tuesday morning in Toronto, but Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union, said he did not expect substantive discussions on the core economic issues dividing the two sides in the 30-day lockout. 
Fehr dismissed speculation that the union would present a new offer radically different from previous ones.
"I don't know where that comes from," he said. "It's just somebody's guess."
Fehr added that the meeting was aimed at finding ways to break the current logjam in negotiations, so that bargaining can begin on the core economic issues. Neither side has made a new offer on core economics since Sept. 12. The owners are demanding a reduction in the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 47 percent. The players have proposed accepting diminished pay raises that would reduce their share to about 53 percent.
The first two weeks of the regular-season schedule have been canceled, and more cancellations are expected at the end of the week. On Monday the players missed the first of 13 bimonthly paychecks for the 2012-13 season. But they are also set to receive an escrow check from last season that comes to about 8 percent of their 2011-12 salary.
The sides will meet a day after the Web site Deadspin obtained details of a focus group last week in Washington, conducted on the N.H.L.'s behalf by Frank Luntz, the top Republican strategist responsible for coining terms like climate change and government takeover.
The Deadspin report said that the N.H.L. was seeking ways to reframe public opinion that is generally unfavorable to the owners. According to one participant, Luntz stressed the phrase "shared sacrifice" on the focus group of N.H.L. fans, suggesting that the league may portray the players as being unwilling to bargain.
Luntz's focus group material also asked which images from an array of pictures made the participants miss hockey the most. The images appeared to include one of the enforcer Derek Boogaard throwing punches as a member of the Minnesota Wild. Boogaard died last year of a drug and alcohol overdose, and a study of his brain revealed that he sustained extensive damage believed to be related to his hockey career.
Luntz posted a message on Twitter on Friday night looking for fans in New York to participate in a focus group next week.
Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, speaking on behalf of the league and owners, has frequently criticized the union for not making new offers, but Fehr said that the charge was inaccurate.
"The notion that because somebody repeats something innumerable times, that then makes it true, I just never believed," he said. "We made a series of proposals designed to meet some of their objections, and they chose to treat them as, 'Oh, this looks more similar to your last proposal than we would have liked, so I'm not going to treat it as a new proposal.'
"I can give you a dog named Rover and you can tell me it's really Fido all you want. I don't know what to do about that."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Proposes a Way to Limit Individual Bank Size

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Since the financial crisis, academics, politicians and even former bank chieftains have called for the nation's banking behemoths to be broken up or shrunk - calls that appear to have fallen largely on deaf ears among Washington's policy makers.
Now, a powerful insider has suggested a simple tool that could place a tight limit on the size of individual banks. Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor who oversees bank regulation, said in a speech last week that an important part of a bank's balance sheet could be capped at a set percentage of the nation's gross domestic product. 
That a regulator at the Fed - the most powerful of the banking industry's overseers - would say that such a structural overhaul of the financial system might be considered, was a sign that the policy debate over what to do about "too big to fail" might be shifting.
Mr. Tarullo's "statements mark a significant - perhaps even dramatic - shift in thinking at the central bank," Simon Johnson wrote in a recent column for Bloomberg News. Mr. Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been a leading voice in the movement to limit the size of large banks.
It's not just that the Fed governor's words provided comfort to supporters of breaking up the banks. They also come at a moment in the debate over the Dodd-Frank Act, when both Republicans and Democrats might be able find common ground.
Mitt Romney and other Republicans have criticized Dodd-Frank, contending that it is overly complex and protects "too big to fail" institutions. Some Republicans looking to repeal Dodd-Frank say they still want to constrain large banks. Their concern is that the law may lead the market to believe that the government protects large banks. In turn, investors might then provide cheap loans to the biggest banks, fueling even more growth in the banks' balance sheets. As a result, some Republicans may warm to the simple cap on bank size outlined in Mr. Tarullo's speech.
"I am completely open to the proposal because of my similar concern about the growing size of institutions that are too big to fail," said Senator David Vitter, a Republican of Louisiana. "Beyond this specific proposal, there is a growing nonpartisan consensus to do a lot more to limit the size of the megabanks."
Any shift at the Federal Reserve would be notable. The central bank, mindful of the stability of the financial system, has avoided giving strong backing to measures that could have a direct impact on bank size.
Mr. Tarullo did not give an unequivocal, personal backing to a cap on size of banks. But he said that if size were to become a big issue, Congress should take it up, so the effects of a cap could be debated. Mr. Tarullo then detailed a type of cap that he said seemed to have "the most promise."
His proposed limit would focus on something called "nondeposit liabilities." These are the borrowings that banks do to finance themselves, excluding deposits.
For example, at the end of June, JPMorgan Chase had $1.24 trillion of nondeposit liabilities, a figure that excludes deposits in the United States, but includes international deposits.
That $1.24 trillion is equivalent to 8 percent of G.D.P. Any legislation would have to decide whether to set a percentage that would immediately force a bank like JPMorgan to shrink. If it were set at 5 percent, JPMorgan would have to shed the excess borrowings, which in turn would lead it to cut its overall size.
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, introduced legislation earlier this year that proposed the cap be set at 2 percent of G.D.P., which would force several of the largest banks, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, to shrink aggressively. (That bill has not advanced.)
Alternatively, the cap could be set at a percentage of G.D.P. that allows banks to stay at close to their current size. In that case, it would just constrain future growth.
Dodd-Frank has a provision that sets out to limit the relative size of banks. It stipulates that banks cannot have liabilities that exceed 10 percent of the total financial system's liabilities. But this may not cap bank growth if the whole system is ballooning, as happened in the last decade. From 1999 to 2007, the Goldman Sachs balance sheet grew by 346 percent. But it would have increased by only 48 percent if its growth had been strictly tied to G.D.P. growth in that period.
The cap has its critics.
One drawback is that it might deter banks from issuing longer-term debt, which can act as a stable source of financing in a crisis. Hal S. Scott, a professor in Harvard Law School, said it would be preferable to limit short-term borrowings by banks, since that is more vulnerable to bank runs.
Others say that the economy needs both large and small banks and growth could be harmed by efforts to dictate bank size.
"The costs to society would outweigh the benefits," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. "But I realize that the idea of setting limits on large banks is gaining popularity across the political spectrum."
Others fear that an inordinate focus on one tool to deal with financial stability could backfire. They think that the multifaceted approach of Dodd-Frank is better at catching and moderating the risks in the banking system.
"I think it's a mistake to think there's some sort of silver bullet here," said Michael S. Barr, professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Mr. Barr worked on Dodd-Frank as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department. He also says he thinks that going back right now and undoing parts of Dodd-Frank would most likely only dilute the overhaul.
"If Congress took up reform, it would only be in the direction of weakening it, not strengthening it," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: George Whitmore Jr. Is Dead at 68; Falsely Confessed to 3 Murders in 1964

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
George Whitmore Jr., an eighth-grade dropout whose confession in 1964 to three New York murders he did not commit had a decisive role in the Supreme Court's Miranda ruling protecting criminal suspects and in the partial repeal of capital punishment in New York State, died on Oct. 8 in a nursing home in Wildwood, N.J. He was 68.
The cause was a heart attack, his daughter Regina Whitmore said.
Mr. Whitmore was 19 in April 1964, when he was picked up on a Brooklyn street for questioning about an attempted rape in the neighborhood the night before. A soft-spoken young man, he had grown up in a house in a junkyard that his father owned in Wildwood. After trying hard in school but dropping out at 17, he moved to Brooklyn and was waiting for a ride to work when the police car pulled over. 
At first he was pleased that the police were asking for his help in solving a crime, he later told interviewers; he would have a good yarn to tell his friends, he thought. But when his interrogation ended several days later, Mr. Whitmore had confessed to the attempted rape, and more. He also confessed to the rape and murder a few weeks earlier of another woman in the neighborhood, Minnie Edmonds, as well as to the murder of two young women in Manhattan in August 1963. Their bodies had been found bound and stabbed numerous times in the apartment they shared on East 88th Street.
Called ''the Career Girl Murders'' in newspaper headlines, the killings of Janice Wylie, 21, a researcher at Newsweek magazine, and Emily Hoffert, 23, a schoolteacher, had been under investigation for eight months.
Mr. Whitmore recanted his confessions and maintained his innocence. He contended repeatedly afterward that the police had beaten him and that he had signed a statement confessing to the crimes without knowing what it was. In the case of the Wylie-Hoffert killings, he said, he could provide the names of a dozen people who would remember seeing him that day, because it was the day of the civil rights march on Washington, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ''I Have a Dream'' speech. He and everybody else in Wildwood had watched it on television and talked about it all day, he said.
In 1964, a Brooklyn jury convicted Mr. Whitmore on the charges of attempted rape. The verdict was overturned when jurors were found to have been reading newspaper accounts of the case in which Mr. Whitmore was called the ''prime suspect'' in the Career Girl Murders. Tried a second time, he was convicted again, but again the verdict was thrown out, on different grounds.
By 1965, Manhattan prosecutors had evidence that Mr. Whitmore had been wrongly accused in the Wylie-Hoffert murders. They had linked the deaths to Richard Robles, a recently released prisoner. (He was later convicted, and remains in prison.)
Even so, while Mr. Whitmore now faced a second trial in the rape and murder of Ms. Edmonds, his indictment in the Wylie-Hoffert case remained in place. News accounts said that by refusing to dismiss the indictment, prosecutors hoped to deny Mr. Whitmore's defense lawyers an argument: that dismissal of the double-murder indictment proved it had been coerced, and that Mr. Whitmore's confession to the Edmonds murder, elicited in the same interrogation, had therefore been coerced, too.
Selwyn Raab, who was a reporter for The New York World-Telegram and Sun at the time (and later for The New York Times), had found a dozen witnesses who remembered seeing Mr. Whitmore in Wildwood on the day of the double murder. They had bumped into him in the homes of friends and relatives while watching Dr. King's speech, Mr. Raab wrote in a front-page article.
''Whitmore's case showed how fragile the whole system was, and still is,'' Mr. Raab said in an interview on Sunday. ''Even now, police use the same techniques to manipulate suspects into giving false confessions. And 90 percent of convictions are still based on confessions.''
The police and prosecutors at the time denied any misconduct. Legal reformers asked Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, to appoint a panel to investigate, but he declined.
Mr. Raab went on to write a book about the case, ''Justice in the Back Room,'' which was made into a television movie, ''The Marcus-Nelson Murders,'' in 1973. That movie starred Telly Savalas as a police detective and led to the television series ''Kojak,'' in which he starred. With the Manhattan district attorney refusing to clear him entirely in the Wylie-Hoffert case, Mr. Whitmore went to trial in the murder of Minnie Edmonds solely on the evidence of his ''confession.''
In the debate in the New York State Legislature over a proposal to abolish the death penalty, Mr. Whitmore's case became a warning cry against the killing of innocents. ''In Whitmore's case,'' said Assemblyman Bertram L. Podell of Brooklyn, ''we have learned to our shock and horror that a 61-page statement of completely detailed confession was manufactured and force-fed to this accused.''
Governor Rockefeller signed a bill in 1965 abolishing capital punishment, except for the killing of police officers. (The death penalty was reinstated in 1995, and declared unconstitutional in 2004.) The Supreme Court cited Mr. Whitmore's case as ''the most conspicuous example'' of police coercion when it issued its 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, establishing a set of protections for suspects, like the right to remain silent. Mr. Whitmore was tried several times in the Edmonds murder, with each trial ending in a hung jury.
Entangled in multiple cases, Mr. Whitmore was in and out of prison for months and years at a time, until April 10, 1973, when the Brooklyn district attorney, Eugene Gold, dismissed the last case against him -- a retrial on the attempted rape charges -- after new evidence exonerating Mr. Whitmore had surfaced. Upon his release, Mr. Whitmore said: ''I'm not bitter. I appreciate greatly what the D.A. did.''
Mr. Whitmore moved back to Wildwood, operated a commercial fishing boat for a time, and was later disabled in a boating accident. He was unemployed for long stretches and suffered from depression and alcoholism, said T. J. English, who wrote a book about Mr. Whitmore.
Mr. Whitmore's daughter Regina said he had never married.
His survivors include three other daughters, Aida, Sonya and Tonya; two sons, George and James; and more than 20 grandchildren.
''He told us about what happened to him,'' Ms. Whitmore said. ''But he said he never held it against anybody. He was always a very sweet man with us. He wanted us to grow up happy.''

HEADLINE: Lost to Gun Violence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Understanding Kids, Gangs and Guns,'' by Sudhir Venkatesh (Op-Ed, Oct. 4), correctly highlights that good gun policy is good social policy and that the economic cost of gun death is astronomical. But family members whose loved ones are killed pay dearly every day for the devastating loss of their loved ones. 
In Brooklyn recently, hundreds of victims of gun violence cried and hugged one another while remembering their children, mothers, nieces and neighbors who are lost forever because of guns. Talented young singers, aspiring and thoughtful college students, and loving mothers are gone. That cost cannot be measured.

HEADLINE: 2 From U.S. Win Nobel In Economics

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Two Americans, Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley, were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Monday for their work on market design and matching theory, which relate to how people and companies find and select one another in everything from marriage to school choice to jobs to organ donations.
Their work primarily applies to markets that do not have prices, or at least have strict constraints on prices. The laureates' breakthroughs involve figuring out how to properly assign people and things to stable matches when prices are not available to help buyers and sellers pair up. 
Mr. Roth, 60, has put these theories to practical use, in his work on a program that matches new doctors to hospitals and more recently for a project matching kidney donors. Public school systems in New York, Boston, Chicago and Denver use an algorithm based on his work to help assign students to schools. A professor at Harvard, he recently accepted a new position at Stanford.
''Al has spent the last 30 years trying to make economics more like an engineering discipline,'' said Parag Pathak, an economics professor at M.I.T. who has worked on school-matching systems with Mr. Roth. ''The idea is to try to diagnose why resource allocation systems are not working, and how they can be engineered to produce something better.''
Mr. Shapley, 89, a mathematician long associated with game theory, is a professor emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles. He made some of the earliest theoretical contributions to research on market design and matching, in the 1950s and 1960s.
In a paper with David Gale in 1962, Mr. Shapley explained how individuals could be paired together in a stable match even when they disagreed about what qualities made the right match. The paper focused on designing an ideal, perfectly stable marriage market: having mates find one another in a fair way, so that no one who is already married would want (and be able) to break off and pair up with someone else who is already married.
In the 1980s, Mr. Roth applied this work to matches for medical residency programs and eventually school choice. He was interested in how to keep matches fair and how to keep more sophisticated players from manipulating the system to their advantage.
In older matching systems, a student would apply to his first-choice school, which was often popular. If the student did not get in, then the application would be sent on to the student's second choice. But if that was also a popular choice, then that school's program would have already filled up by the time his application was even considered, and the process would repeat itself with his third-choice school and so on.
Even if students were qualified to get into one of their top schools, they could be shut out because they did not rank their preferences strategically. This created an incentive to try to game the system by listing a less popular school as their first choice because that way they would at least have a chance of getting in somewhere.
Mr. Roth designed a system in which students had an incentive to tell the truth about where they wanted to go. A centralized office could then assign them to a school best suited for them, based both on their own preferences and the preferences of the schools they were applying to.
The school systems he helped create use a ''deferred acceptance algorithm,'' which was developed by Mr. Shapley's theoretical work.
The system works by tentatively accepting students to their top-choice school. It holds off on the final assignment until it has gone through all the other applications to make sure there are not other students who have a higher claim to a spot at that given school (because of higher test scores, a sibling at the school or whatever other criteria the school prioritizes), even if those students happened to rank the school lower on their list of preferences.
''The idea is to level the playing field,'' Mr. Pathak said. ''You want to make sure that not only do sophisticated players not have to spend the time learning the strategies and different heuristics that will get them ahead, but also that unsophisticated players are not hurt by the fact that they are not aware of all this information.''
This same sort of system is used to match new medical school graduates to medical residency programs, which was once a messy process that led to a lot of unhappy candidates. Now all residency assignments are posted simultaneously. In the mid-1990s Mr. Roth redesigned the system to help match married couples who were jointly looking for jobs at hospitals.
Mr. Roth has also helped build a system that assigns kidney donation swaps.
For example, a man needs a kidney, and his wife is willing to donate one of hers but she is not a match. Across the country there is a couple in the same position, and it turns out that the wives are a match for the husbands in the opposite couple. In this simple case, the two couples essentially barter their kidneys: Wife A gives her kidney to Husband B, and Wife B gives her kidney to Husband A. It is rare that two couples will serendipitously match each other's kidney donation needs this way, and there are often more pairs of donor-recipients involved. Mr. Roth's system helps find the most efficient exchange of organs so that the most patients can be saved with the fewest number of pairs involved in a given trade.
Mr. Shapley was born in Cambridge, Mass. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard and his a Ph.D. in mathematics at Princeton, where he studied alongside John Nash, a fellow Nobel laureate. He is married and has two sons.
Mr. Roth received his bachelor's from Columbia and his master's and doctorate from Stanford, all in operations research. He is married with two children.
The Nobel in economic science is not one of the original prizes created by Alfred Nobel. It has been awarded each year since 1969 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In addition to a medal and a diploma, the laureates collectively win a cash prize worth about $1.2 million.

HEADLINE: Mining Contract Details Disclosed in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MATTHEW ROSENBERG. 
Alissa Rubin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Enmeshed in a bruising political battle over new mining rules seen as vital to Afghanistan's economic future, the country's mining minister on Sunday disclosed about 200 previous mining contracts for the first time, portraying the move as an attempt to bring transparency to a process vulnerable to corruption.
In the process, he appeared to take a swipe at a brother of President Hamid Karzai, citing as flawed the awarding of a contract in 2006 for a cement company in which he was a partner. 
The action, by Mining Minister Wahidullah Shahrani, was likely to please his supporters in the West, including the United States, who made greater openness in the Afghan government's financial dealings a condition of billions of dollars in development assistance and aid money pledged earlier this year.
But the move also comes at a precarious time for Mr. Shahrani. He is embattled politically and a target of critics for his shepherding of a proposed new mining law, vital to attracting foreign investment, which was blocked by the Afghan cabinet in July with President Karzai's support. Mr. Shahrani is to resubmit the law in the coming weeks.
Developing Afghanistan's potentially rich deposits of iron, oil, gold, copper, lithium and other natural resources is regarded as crucial to the country's economic prospects, transforming it into a state that can begin to pay its own way and allowing the international community to cut back its financial and, ultimately, military support. But there are persistent concerns that any resource boom could be jeopardized by corruption, worsening security and political instability.
''From now on every contract will be made public,'' Mr. Shahrani said at a news conference here. ''No contract will be kept secret.''
However, Mr. Shahrani did not release the contract for one of the country's biggest and most lucrative mining concessions, the 2007 agreement for the Aynak copper deposit in Logar Province near Kabul struck with a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, China Metallurgical Group Corporation. Accusations of bribery and a sweetheart deal for the mining concern have swirled for years, but without proof.
Mr. Shahrani said this agreement was made under a previous minister when nonpublication was subject to a legal deal with the Chinese. He said he had written to the Chinese with a request to make the contract public. Almost all of the other contracts published on the ministry Web site, struck as far back as 2002, covered an array of much smaller marble, coal and other mines, and until the details of the Aynak contract are released, analysts questioned whether the new initiative had full force.
''This is a start,'' said Yama Torabi, director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan, an anticorruption watchdog based in Kabul.
Mr. Shahrani said the ministry had discovered ''financial, legal and technical flaws'' in some of the contracts, and held up as an example at the news conference the operating rights for the country's only cement factory, which was awarded at the time to a partnership of investors, among them Mahmoud Karzai, one of President Karzai's brothers.
Mahmoud Karzai has been accused of using his brother's position for financial gain, and the cement factory had been controversial, not least among local provincial leaders who said the investors had cut jobs and paid low salaries. The contract was only four pages long, for an agreement that under proper international standards would normally be far longer, Mr. Shahrani said.
''Look at the contract of Ghori Cement,'' he said. ''Nobody remembers a 30-year contract being signed in four pages.'' He said that the shortcomings reflected a lack of capacity and experience among officials in the ministry when the agreement was put together, and that the flawed contracts would be revised.
A spokesman for President Karzai, Aimal Faizi, said on Monday that the decision to publish the contracts had been made in a cabinet meeting and had not been taken unilaterally.
He said that in the meeting Mr. Shahrani had raised concerns that some of the contract holders might object to the publication of the details, but that President Karzai had argued for disclosure.
''The president said, 'No, there is nothing to hide and let's make it public, it should be transparent,' '' he quoted the president as saying.
He said that he could not speak for Mahmoud Karzai but that the government wanted every contract to be public -- ''whether it is Mahmoud Karzai's or anybody else's contract.''
Mahmoud Karzai did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Afghan and Western officials in Kabul, along with technical experts who advise the government, have said that the initial rejection of the new mining and oil drilling law in part reflected the minister's political weakness. Mr. Shahrani, who took over in 2010, had expected the new law to breeze past the cabinet, yet instead found himself pitted almost alone against a range of more experienced and better-connected politicians -- from those seen as pro-Western reformers to former communists and the religiously conservative who, among other things, objected to the proposals as being too generous to foreign mining interests eager to exploit Afghanistan's natural resources.
President Karzai publicly sided with those lined up against the new law, sending it back for revisions over Mr. Shahrani's objections.
Some Western officials fear the maneuvering reflects attempts by political rivals to snatch control of the Mining Ministry, a coveted post that oversees millions of dollars in contracts.
''A lot of groups, a lot of people in the government, want to be part of the mining now that it is seen as a way to generate large sums of revenue,'' said one senior European diplomat in Kabul who follows the mining deliberations.
The diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the announcement Sunday could be seen as an attempt by Mr. Shahrani to address his political vulnerability by bolstering his standing among Afghans and the international community.
The Mes Aynak mine has been delayed by deterioration in security and the discovery of Buddhist ruins and artifacts. But Mr. Shahrani said that archaeologists preparing the site now had a deadline of the end of this year to finish their survey, and that he was confident that the Chinese could begin mining extraction in 2014.
Since he took over the ministry two years ago, Mr. Shahrani has been collecting details of agreements struck on natural resource deals going back over the past 10 years.
Earlier this year, fulfilling concerns raised by Western governments at the Tokyo Conference, where for the first time donors made it a condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money, President Karzai issued a decree calling for full details of natural resource contracts to be published, giving further impetus to his efforts.

HEADLINE: Where Mayor Sees Clear Fiscal Skies, Clouds Gather

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has reached what he apparently conceives of as the victory lap in his near-endless mayoralty.
He wastes few opportunities to unburden himself of tart views on national politics and economics, pointedly contrasting his grand reign in New York with the fratricidal partisan feuding in Washington.
Only in England has he found a politician whom he adores. So last week he flew off to Birmingham to speak at a Conservative Party conference. 
Praising the ''gold medal'' Tory prime minister, David Cameron, Hizzoner cheered on Mr. Cameron's decision to fight a deep recession by slashing deficits and carving away at public spending.
''Most national governments have tried to ride out the storm by simply battening down the hatches and hoping that clear skies will return quickly,'' the mayor told the conference. ''But very few governments have charted new courses that will lead them to clear skies. And I think the United Kingdom has been an exception, and the Conservative Party has been the reason.''
It might be splendid if this triumphant narrative held true, in Britain and in New York City. It does not.
The British economy is a balloon rapidly losing air, and has been shrinking for months. Just last week, an inopportune day before the New York mayor spoke, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the British economy would contract by 0.4 percent in 2012.
Income in Britain remains 4 percent below peak, while it has grown slightly in the United States. The I.M.F. also suggested last week that turning to austerity during a recession is like attaching a leech to the chest of sick man. It only makes him sicker.
As for New York, the mayor might consider crowing less and worrying more. Having wisely built up budget surpluses, the mayor has emptied most of his accounts during the economic storm. Tax revenues no longer come in above projections.
And he has become a sleepier fiscal shepherd. Once, Mr. Bloomberg fought for stringent union contracts. That time has passed. Nearly every union contract in the city has expired, and the mayor has insisted on wage freezes while setting aside not a dime toward settlements.
Few union leaders take him seriously. They seem content to engage in listless negotiation and simply wait until Mr. Bloomberg passes into history. Then they'll present the next mayor with an impressive political and fiscal headache.
To take just one example: The teachers' contract expired some years back. The Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed fiscal watchdog, estimates that if the union achieves merely the same 4 percent raise given to other unions, the next mayor will face a $4 billion hit in the first year.
''The jig is up,'' said Maria Doulis, director of city studies at the Citizens Budget Commission.
The mayor, to his credit, has labored to diversify the city's economy, and the fruit of his work is seen in the sharp increase in tourism, and in the technology companies taking seed.
But the city's traditional fatted calf, Wall Street, is ailing. Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, issued a recent report that noted that this richest of New York industries has regained less than a third of the jobs it lost since the financial crisis.
And the near-death experiences of 2008 brought few titans closer to God. Revenues on the Street rose in 2009, but have contracted since then, in part because the barons are cannibalizing their profits to push up salaries that are already 5.3 times as much as other private-sector salaries in New York.
Hizzoner is of this world, and has profited handsomely from its excesses. But the industry's maladies give him few sleepless nights.
Last week he took his weekly turn on his radio show. Asked about the city's growing income inequality, he shrugged.
He rattled off the plutocratic math: The wealthiest 500 filers in the city pay 15 percent of the city's total income tax.
''We want the richest people to come here and patronize our stores and pay their taxes here,'' he said. ''That does create a bigger income disparity, but that's where the money comes from to fix our schools.''
Rattle the diamond-encrusted cages, he says, and the wealthy birds will take flight.
New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, often frets about high-income fugitives. So last spring that state's Office of Legislative Services studied the question.
The office found that some New Jersey residents were moving. But they are fleeing not to a low-tax haven like Mississippi or Texas. No, as it turns out, the No. 1 destination for the discontented of Ridgewood and Upper Saddle River is that high-tax haven known as New York.
As we say on this side of the pond: Oops.

HEADLINE: With New Sanctions, European Union Tightens Screws on Iran Over Nuclear Work

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and THOMAS ERDBRINK; James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union toughened sanctions against Iran over its disputed nuclear program on Monday, banning trade in industries like finance, metals and natural gas, and making other business transactions far more cumbersome.
The measures were the latest in a long series of sanctions from Europe, the United States and the United Nations Security Council, and were evidence of the worsening damage to Iran's economy.
In a joint statement, European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, expressed ''serious and deepening concerns over Iran's nuclear program.'' They added that in continuing to enrich uranium, despite Western concerns that it is aiming for a bomb, Iran was ''acting in flagrant violation of its international obligations.'' 
Ahead of the meeting, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said: ''We want to see a negotiated agreement. But we will continue to keep up the pressure.''
Ms. Ashton represents six major powers, including the United States, in nuclear talks with the Iranians. There have been five rounds of discussions since late 2010, the last of which ended in frustration in June. Ms. Ashton said the major powers would keep in contact with Saeed Jalili, Iran's negotiator, to assess when to convene another meeting.
Iran is suffering acute inflation from the weakness of the rial, the national currency, which lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar in recent weeks. Outside economists have pointed to Iran's currency troubles as evidence that the sanctions, which have severely restricted Iran's ability to sell oil and conduct international banking transactions, are having a profound impact. Iran has been showing new signs of problems, including severe drops in monthly oil and automotive production and in the number of foreign commercial ships docking at its ports. How to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions has become an issue in the American presidential race.
The new European sanctions were necessary as a result of a ''continued failure to satisfy the world that the program was for peaceful purposes,'' said William Hague, the British foreign secretary.
But Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, emphasized the need for a more intensive diplomatic effort alongside the sanctions.
''I think there are voices that sound like they want a war,'' Mr. Bildt said. ''We don't want war.''
The latest measures make business deals between Europe and Iran far more complicated. The European Union ''agreed to prohibit all transactions between European and Iranian banks unless authorized in advance under strict conditions with exemptions for humanitarian needs,'' according to an official statement.
The statement said that the European Union also had ''decided to strengthen the restrictive measures against the Central Bank of Iran. Further export restrictions have been imposed, notably for graphite, metals, software for industrial processes, as well as measures relating to the shipbuilding industry.''
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has described the Western sanctions as economic warfare, said the latest measures were nothing new.
''Creating instability is among the arrogant powers' insidious policies,'' the semiofficial Fars News Agency quoted him as saying during a speech in Shirvan, in eastern Iran. He praised Iran's ''exemplary political stability and tranquillity,'' adding: ''The enemies wanted to make our people depressed and exhausted through their sanctions. Our nation's will and resolve to defend the ruling Islamic system should be a lesson to them.''

HEADLINE: Nowadays, Wall St. Saviors May Wish They Weren't

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
"Would I have done Bear Stearns again knowing what I know today?"Jamie Dimon asked almost rhetorically last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
"It is really close. What I know today is if they called me again to do something again like that, I couldn't do it. My board wouldn't allow me."
No kidding.
The bailouts during the financial crisis of 2008 may have been unpopular on Main Street, but they are turning out to be just as unpopular in certain corners of Wall Street, and perhaps for good reason. 
Some of the strongest firms during the crisis that acquired failing banks at the behest of the government - JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, among them - have found themselves in the cross hairs of lawsuits brought by the government for activities related to deals they made under pressure from the authorities.
Whether you love or hate Wall Street, whether you want bankers to go to jail or not, the recent series of suits brought by the government may have a profound impact on how businesses react to being asked to provide assistance when the next financial crisis arrives. Chances are, they won't.
"As a policy matter, it's going to make it much harder in the future for companies to buy a troubled company," said Mr. Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, which bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 in a deal engineered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.
Mr. Dimon's comments in Washington are in part a response to a recent lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court by Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general, claiming that JPMorgan Chase misrepresented and defrauded investors of certain mortgage securities. Damages are estimated to be as high as $3 billion.
The only problem is that the "multiple fraudulent and deceptive acts" that the government alleged didn't take place at JPMorgan Chase; they happened at Bear Stearns during 2005 to 2007.
The same Bear Stearns that the United States government practically begged JPMorgan Chase to buy to help avoid a financial panic. The same Bear Stearns in which the initial $2 a share price of the transaction was dictated - literally - by Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary.
Four years on, with less than a month before the election, Mr. Schneiderman, who is co-chair of President Obama's Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, has filed suit.
"We've lost $5 to $10 billion on various things related to Bear Stearns," Mr. Dimon said - and that's before this latest lawsuit.
"Someone said the Fed did us a favor," he continued, referring to the nearly $30 billion in guarantees that the Federal Reserve provided as part of the transaction. "We did them a favor. Let's get this one exactly right. We were asked to do it."
Mr. Dimon is clearly frustrated. Had Bear Stearns filed for bankruptcy, he said, there "would be no money. There would be no lawsuits. There would be no stock-drop lawsuits, there would be no class actions, there would be no mortgage lawsuits because there would be no money. But we bought it."
A cynic could chalk Mr. Dimon's outrage up to pure swagger. After all, his purchase of Bear Stearns elevated him and JPMorgan to superstar status with dozens of articles then referring to him as the new King of Wall Street.
And it's hard to believe that JPMorgan didn't come out ahead - or at least close to even - on the acquisition, given that Bear's 43-story headquarters on Madison Avenue was part of the deal.
Nonetheless, it is worth listening to Mr. Dimon. The next time a bailout is required, it might not be political pressure that keeps it from happening, but a company's board not willing to accept it.
If you ran a company, would you help participate in a bailout if you thought there was a chance the government might turn around and sue you later for the misdeeds of the company you're helping to save?
When the government helped save General Motors by providing money and guarantees as part of its bankruptcy, "they absolved G.M. of all prior legal liability," Mr. Dimon said in an earnings conference call with investors and analysts on Friday. "So the government's being a little inconsistent here."
Last week, Wells Fargo was sued by Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who accused the bank of defrauding the government by lying about the quality of the mortgages it handled under a federal housing program.
He said the bank had "engaged in a longstanding and reckless trifecta of deficient training, deficient underwriting and deficient disclosure, all while relying on the convenient backstop of government insurance."
The accusations in the suit stretch back a decade. Perhaps ironically, Wells Fargo is considered one of the best lenders in the nation. That status put Wells Fargo in a position to buy the failing Wachovia in 2008 with the encouragement, in part, of Sheila Bair, then the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who had originally helped orchestrate a deal to sell Wachovia to Citigroup.
That deal, however, would have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The deal with Wells Fargo most likely saved the F.D.I.C. billions of dollars.
Perhaps even stranger, Wells Fargo was one of several of the nation's largest banks to participate in a $25 billion settlement earlier this year over mortgage-related issues, some of which seem to overlap with the new case against it.
And, of course, Bank of America has been involved in a series of civil suits related to its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide and its purchase of Merrill Lynch, struck at the apex of the financial crisis in September 2008.
Earlier this year, Bank of America paid $1 billion to settle charges of civil fraud at Countrywide. But here's the important part: Bank of America acquired the failing Countrywide under some pressure from the government. So much pressure, in fact, that Kenneth D. Lewis, then the bank's chief executive, considered it a favor that would later be repaid by the Federal Reserve's lowering the bank's capital requirements to make additional acquisitions.
After the Merrill purchase, which was engineered by the Treasury and Fed, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors sued the bank for misleading shareholders about the deal. The bank paid the S.E.C. a $150 million penalty in 2010 and settled with shareholders last month for $2.43 billion, though the Merrill unit has given a boost to the bank's bottom line.
None of this is to suggest that the government should not hold those responsible for fraud or other misconduct accountable. But few of the lawsuits that the government has brought against the banks have anything to do with the culpability of those individuals who were actually responsible for the problems.
Instead, the government is simply holding responsible the company's shareholders, who were unlikely to have been shareholders at the time of the misdeeds.
Does this really offer a deterrent effect? Or is this just a nice way to garner headlines ahead of an election?
The executives responsible, as usual, pay nothing. If there were "deceptive acts," the government could and should bring cases, if not criminal, then civil, against the individuals.
Fraud isn't something a company does; it is something people do.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Debt Impasse Shadows Race For Presidency

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Mitt Romney will again debate their visions for the next four years on Tuesday night, and if the campaign so far is any guide, they will not acknowledge that the winner's agenda could depend on the fiscal showdown between Election Day and Inauguration Day.
If Mr. Romney wins, Republicans say they would seek to delay the year-end deadline for a bipartisan deal by up to a year to give him time to flesh out his budget plans and get Democrats to agree. But even if Democrats and the financial markets go along with the delay, the months before Mr. Romney's swearing-in could be as crucial to his presidency as the transition period was for Mr. Obama four years ago, when the economic crisis led him to draft a big stimulus package while President George W. Bush still occupied the White House.
Mr. Romney's ability to foster cooperation at the outset could determine his success on a range of issues. Yet Democrats have been dismissive, at best, about his budget plans, which have few specifics on how Mr. Romney would reduce deficits. He has mostly spoken about cutting taxes and increasing military spending. 
Mr. Obama, if he loses, would still be president for the lame-duck Congress, but he would have limited leverage. If he gets another four years in the White House, he already has plans to go right back on the campaign trail to build support for his deficit-reduction framework, Democrats say, and administration officials are debating whether Mr. Obama should make some concession to Republicans to spur negotiations.
Without agreement of some kind, more than $700 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts would occur after Dec. 31, scheduled by a mix of coincidence and bipartisan agreement. How the re-elected president navigates this ''fiscal cliff'' could determine how much political clout and budget resources he will have.
''I think it's the whole ballgame for the second term,'' said John D. Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, who led Mr. Obama's postelection transition planning four years ago.
Politically, Mr. Obama would have to build trust with Republican leaders who had hoped to make him a one-term president, even as he remained in campaign mode, seeking to assert his claim to a mandate to make the necessary trade-offs on spending and taxes. And the strength he shows in dealing with Republicans on Capitol Hill could also set the tone for the debate on other knotty issues, like immigration and climate change.
Substantively, any agreement in Congress, which opens a week after the election, could define the terms for how Mr. Obama and lawmakers move next year on efforts to contain the long-term costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, the programs that are driving forecasts of unsustainable debt. And it would determine how much money is available to address Mr. Obama's priorities like education, energy and health care through his term.
''Absent this kind of a deal, I really don't see what his second term does,'' said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former House member.
To begin his fight for that deal, Mr. Obama would revive his dormant year-old deficit-reduction plan, which relies on tax increases on high incomes as well as spending cuts.
''He believes he has to play the outside game, so he'll go all around the country and say, 'Look, we need revenues,' '' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
Mr. Obama, advisers say, will seek to mobilize Americans behind his argument that his plan is a balanced and more economically prudent alternative than to simply allow automatic across-the-board spending cuts to take effect and all Bush-era income-tax rate cuts to expire.
He will reinforce his vow not to sign another extension of the Bush tax cuts -- which expire on Dec. 31 -- except for taxable income below $250,000. The Democrats hope that will force Republicans to drop their demand to continue tax cuts for high incomes, lest they get the blame for an impasse that causes taxes to go up for everyone.
''I think back in the vault is an Obama plan to put on the table,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. ''He's not going to let that opportunity on Nov. 13'' -- when Congress returns -- ''come and go without asserting some leadership.''
If Mr. Obama fails to win a broad budget compromise, Mr. Podesta said, his domestic agenda in a second term could be limited to finishing the main achievement of his first four years, his health care law. Its final stage takes effect in 2014, expanding private insurance to about 30 million uninsured Americans.
''He's got to win a battle for a fiscal framework that gives him the ability to make the kind of investments that he's out on the campaign trail talking about -- whether that's education, innovation, science and tech, infrastructure,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''He can't go from one draining budget battle to the next.''
Because the budget impasse ''has become emblematic of Washington's dysfunction to people, I think their capacity to trust us here on a whole range of issues -- on energy, immigration, education -- is at risk if we don't figure out how to come together in a bipartisan way to solve this problem,'' said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado.
People in both parties say much would depend on Mr. Obama's margin of victory and how Republicans would interpret a loss. ''Do they take that as, 'Well, Obama won and he really took it to us on the issues, and we lost so we need to be reasonable?' '' said a senior House Republican aide, who did not want to be identified discussing party strategy. ''Or is it an all-out blame fest -- 'Mitt Romney was a horrible candidate. We didn't really lose. Romney lost.' ''
At the center of Republicans' calculations would be two leaders who have had rancorous relationships with Mr. Obama: Speaker John A. Boehner in the House and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.
''By the time the polls have closed on election night, if it's decided that Obama gets re-elected, both Mitch McConnell and John Boehner will be saying to each other, 'We're going to clean up in the 2014 midterms,' '' said Mr. Weber, the former Republican congressman.
Typically the president's party loses Congressional seats in midterm elections. Mr. McConnell is also up for re-election in 2014 in Kentucky. If he negotiates a tax-raising deal, it would all but ensure a Tea Party challenger in the Republican primary. More immediately, Mr. Boehner will need the support of antitax House Republicans to win another term as speaker in January.
And Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate, would return as House Budget Committee chairman, his conservative following there intact and his antitax instincts likely to be sharpened by the ambition he is said to have for the presidential nomination in 2016.

HEADLINE: Mr. Romney Needs a Working Calculator

 BODY:
To the annoyance of the Romney campaign, members of Washington's reality-based community have a habit of popping up to point out the many deceptions in the campaign's blue-sky promises of low taxes and instant growth. The latest is the Joint Committee on Taxation, an obscure but well-respected Congressional panel -- currently evenly divided between the parties -- that helps lawmakers calculate the effect of their tax plans. 
Last month, the committee asked its staff what would happen if Congress repealed the biggest tax deductions and loopholes and used the new revenue to lower tax rates. The staff started adding it up: end all itemized deductions, tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, and tax the interest on state and local bonds, along with several other revenue-raisers.
The answer came last week: ending all those deductions would only produce enough revenue to lower tax rates by 4 percent.
Mitt Romney says he can lower tax rates by 20 percent and pay for it by ending deductions. The joint committee's math makes it clear that that is impossible.
The analysis doesn't include every possible tax expenditure, leaving out, for example, the tax break employers get for providing health insurance. But because Mr. Romney refuses to raise capital gains taxes and wants to end the estate tax, it is hard to see how he could do much better than 4 percent.
This is why Mr. Romney has refused to say which deductions he would eliminate, just as Representative Paul Ryan refused when asked a direct question in last week's debate. Specify a deduction, and some pest with a calculator will point out that it doesn't add up.
Even Fox News isn't buying it. Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, said on Fox News Sunday that Mr. Romney would work out those details later with Congress. As the program's moderator, Chris Wallace, pointed out, that's like offering voters the candy of a 20 percent tax cut without mentioning the spinach they will have to eat.
The Romney campaign claims it has six studies proving it can be done, but, on examination, none of the studies actually make that point, or counterbalance the nonpartisan analyses that use real math. Two of the studies, for example, were done by the same Republican economist, Martin Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, who said it would require ending all deductions for everyone making $100,000 or more. But Mr. Romney has explicitly said he would not do that.
It is increasingly clear that the Romney tax ''plan'' is not really a plan at all but is instead simply a rhapsody based on old Republican themes that something can be had for nothing. For middle-class taxpayers without the benefit of expensive accountants, the bill always comes due a few years later.

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
9 P.M. (ABC, CBS, CNBC, CNN, C-Span, Fox, Fox Business, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC, NY1, 13, 48, 49) PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE Mitt Romney and President Obama, above, face off for a second time in this live town-hall-style meeting at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Candy Crowley of CNN is the moderator. 
4:35 P.M. (HBO2) THE COMPANY (2003) In this ensemble drama the director Robert Altman explores the inner workings of a ballet troupe while focusing on a dancer (Neve Campbell) trying to make her way to the top as she keeps company with a chef (James Franco). Malcolm McDowell plays the company's artistic director, who is so self-absorbed that he has no idea of the damage he inflicts. In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote that the film, which features members of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago (among them Domingo Rubio, above, with Ms. Campbell), ''is enjoyably lithe and droll yet somehow almost water-soluble; it seems to dissolve on screen.'' The footwork continues at 8 with ''Black Swan'' (2010), starring Natalie Portman in the role that won her an Academy Award. She plays Nina, a ballet dancer on the verge of insanity as she tries to break out of the corps and into the dual lead of ''Swan Lake'': the Swan Queen and her villainous black swan twin. Mila Kunis is the sultry newcomer who is everything the increasingly tormented Nina is not, as their company's artistic director (Vincent Cassel) points out. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother, a former dancer who wants her daughter to achieve what she could not. The result is ''a witchy brew of madness and cunning,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times about this film from Darren Aronofsky, which also received Oscar nominations for best director and best picture.
8 P.M. (13, 49) RACE 2012 This documentary, directed by Phillip Rodriguez, uses the presidential election as a lens through which to view the country's racial landscape, from the impact of immigrants on the electorate and the reaction of whites to their declining numbers and influence, to the economic imbalance among races, which may affect America's political future. Offering perspective are Randall L. Kennedy, a law professor at Harvard; Rich Benjamin, a senior fellow at the research center Demos, who is the author of ''Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America''; the Tea Party activist Ana Puig; Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee; and Ronald Brownstein, the editorial director of the National Journal Group.
8 P.M. (Sundance) ICONOCLASTS Judd Apatow and Lena Dunham, left, tour his Los Angeles offices and her new Brooklyn apartment as they discuss their collaboration on the HBO series ''Girls,'' as well as their experiences in Hollywood as a veteran (his) and a newcomer (hers).
8 P.M. (ESPN) THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME When Josh Swade, who describes himself as a superfan of University of Kansas basketball, discovered that the game's original rules, written by its inventor, James Naismith, would be auctioned at Sotheby's on Dec. 10, 2010, he knew what he had to do. Determined to bring them ''home'' to the university in Lawrence, Kan., where Naismith had coached and taught for nearly 40 years, Mr. Swade embarked on a journey to raise more than $1 million in three weeks. In this latest ''30 for 30'' installment, Maura Mandt and Mr. Swade document the pursuit of his dream with the help of an influential alumnus and a grandson of the coaching legend Phog Allen.
9 P.M. (Style) TIA & TAMERA The Mowry twins return for Season 2, which starts with Tamera's revelation that she is having a baby boy. But first she must slog through filming in New Orleans, where what she calls ''pregnancy brain'' is causing her to forget her lines. The sisters can be seen on the Disney Channel in ''Twitches'' (2005), at 2:30, as twin witches separated at birth who reunite on their 21st birthday to fight a dark force threatening their long-lost mother, and in ''Twitches Too'' (2007), at 8:30, as they prepare to attend college while saving the world.
10 P.M. (Military) SECRETS OF ... Interviews with President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta present details about the preparation and execution of the SEAL Team 6 assault on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in 2011. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Paying the Price of Being Uninsured

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Possibly Fatal Mistake,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Oct. 14):
Thank you, Scott Androes, for courageously allowing Nicholas D. Kristof to share your story about the real consequences of living without health insurance. It highlights what was most disturbing about Mitt Romney's view that uninsured heart attack victims are not denied care, because they get treated in the emergency room.
The media jumped on the bad economics of that philosophy, but your story makes the more important point-- that actually, yes, people do die because they don't have health insurance. They forgo preventive and sick care that can save their lives. 
The moral and economic case for preserving Obamacare as a critical first step toward solving our health care challenges is undeniable.
REBECCA SPENCE New Providence, N.J., Oct. 14, 2012
To the Editor:
It was sad to read Nicholas D. Kristof's column about a friend facing possible death from cancer. However, I cannot agree that the man's situation stems from a lack of national health care.
Mr. Kristof's friend, Scott Androes, made a series of irresponsible decisions that led to his dire condition. After quitting his job, apparently leaving his health coverage behind, he failed to buy new coverage because it was ''really expensive.'' When symptoms occurred, he didn't see a doctor because he didn't want to pay a few hundred dollars.
Yet Mr. Kristof maintains that his friend was mostly ''unlucky,'' such as failing to have a spouse with health insurance, and attacks Mitt Romney for suggesting that people are responsible for the results of their own choices. He prefers the Obamacare ''solution'' of forcing everyone to pay for coverage.
Individual deaths are always sad. But government control of decisions better left to individuals will never be accepted by the majority of Americans. If Mr. Androes dies of cancer, sad as it will be, it cannot be laid at anyone's doorstep but his own.
LESLIE DIMMLING Garden City, N.Y., Oct. 15, 2012
To the Editor:
I, too, was in Nicholas D. Kristof's class of 1982 at Harvard University and was saddened to hear about Scott Androes's health care crisis with metastatic prostate cancer (though I knew neither of them in college).
Like many physicians, I sometimes forget how brutally this supposed outstanding health care system of ours treats people like Mr. Androes. Of course, he bears some responsibility for not seeking preventive care, as I am sure Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, where he is being treated, either provides or could have directed him where to get indigent care. But every health care provider in this country whose job it is to promote health and wellness bears responsibility for care of the uninsured.
In my own office, I was horrified recently when I heard a member of my staff tell a caller (and potential patient) to call back when he had health insurance! I chastised her and reminded her that we try to accept everyone according to his or her ability to pay, or at least to refer the person to someplace where care is available.
Of course, the Affordable Care Act promoted by President Obama will change some of that, but it will not change hearts.
LYNNE PERRY-BOTTINGER New Rochelle, N.Y., Oct. 14, 2012
To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof's heart-rending account of his friend's struggle with prostate cancer does not make an argument for Obamacare (or any other system) because Mr. Kristof fails to show how Scott Androes's experience would have probably been different had he had health insurance. We are meant to assume that if Mr. Androes had had insurance, he would have had checkups, and that those checkups would have probably changed the course of the disease, but Mr. Kristof presents no evidence for this.
Getting decent health care will not help one avoid cancer; the most it can do is identify it earlier. Identifying cancer earlier is no guarantee that the course of the disease will be changed. For example, a 2011 article in The Archives of Internal Medicine showed that if a woman identifies a breast cancer through a routine mammogram, the chances that she has saved her life by doing so are from 3 to 13 percent.

HEADLINE: Then as Now, Businessmen Bent on Power

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
The titans of the early industrial age get a professional-wrestling sort of treatment in the slickly made docu-series ''The Men Who Built America,'' which begins on Tuesday night on the History channel. 
The program may not contain any startling revelations about its five principal subjects, Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan and Henry Ford. But based on the first episode, it certainly gives them a modern-day relevance, perhaps unintentionally. It connects them to the super-rich business executives of today who seem more interested in machinations and profits than in people.
The series begins in 1865, just after the assassination of Lincoln, and it lays out its central theme bluntly. ''For the first time in the country's short existence,'' the narration says, ''the man most capable of leading America is not a politician.''
He is, the series hypothesizes, Vanderbilt, and he certainly helps lead the country into the industrial age by creating a railroad empire. The episode recaps his career through the familiar combination of narration and re-enactment (with the re-enactments being of especially high quality for this type of series), but there's a twist. Instead of using biographers and academics as talking heads, the series gets its color commentary from modern-day figures who have loomed large in the worlds of business and finance, like Mark Cuban, Jack Welch and Steve Wozniak.
This is the brawn-on-brawn view of history: the focus is on how the five titans outmuscled their competitors and sometimes one another to build business empires and personal fortunes of absurd -- some might say obscene -- size. (The re-enactments foster this tone with slow-motion striding, clipped conversation and so on; the business world version of macho.)
Perhaps future episodes will explore whether this was the only way that the job of industrialization could have been accomplished. But the first installment, which introduces Vanderbilt and Rockefeller and foreshadows the emergence of Carnegie, seems interested in gamesmanship for gamesmanship's sake.
It's an unflattering portrait of these men, one that suggests that they didn't care about the people who depended on them for jobs or about what their posturing and stock market fiddling were doing to the overall economy. There may be accuracy to that view, but of course it's an oversimplification, as countless libraries, museums and other examples of their philanthropy attest.
Yet the tone also gives the series a timeliness. Amid all the attention two men are getting as they try to win the presidency here in 2012, it's a reminder that most of the things that directly shape our personal lives -- the jobs, the goods, the utilities, even the pollution -- are created and controlled by people who never stand for election.

HEADLINE: China and Its Trade Practices Are Coming to the Debates

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

 BODY:
Halfway through the fall debates, the sparring between President Obama and Mitt Romney and their running mates has been notable for the absence of an issue Mr. Romney has pressed on the campaign trail and in his television advertising: China.
When American policy toward Beijing does come up Tuesday night -- or next week, when it will be one of five designated topics in a debate focused solely on foreign affairs -- Mr. Romney will have plenty of arguments to draw on.
In one recent ad, he accused the Obama administration of letting hundreds of thousands of American factory jobs vanish in the face of what he calls China's unfair trade practices. ''It's time to stand up to the cheaters,'' he says in the ad, ''and make sure we protect jobs for the American people.''
And that is just part of a fusillade of soft-on-China accusations that Mr. Romney has leveled at Mr. Obama, who he says has allowed the Chinese to manipulate their currency, distort fair trade, steal American technology and hack into American government and corporate computers. 
The Obama campaign has hardly been silent. In an ad earlier this month it said that while Mr. Romney ran a private equity firm, it invested in a Chinese company that exploited low-wage labor. ''Mitt Romney tough on China? Since when?'' the ad asks.
Many Asia experts say Mr. Romney's comments are indeed tough. They begin with a pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and end with promises to increase America's already formidable military presence in the western Pacific and sell new American fighter jets to Taiwan. Analysts say such moves would amount to a profound shift in a policy toward China that has remained remarkably constant for decades across Republican and Democratic administrations. And they would be virtually certain to upend relations with Beijing's leaders.
Whether a President Romney would carry out such pledges, however, is another matter. ''There is a lot of game playing on both sides,'' said Uri Dadush, director of the International Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Once in office, presidents tend to recognize that the Chinese don't react well when you point a gun to their head.''
Even some of Mr. Obama's own current and former aides acknowledge that Mr. Obama went too far to accommodate China's leaders during his first year in office. The White House hardened its approach after the Chinese gave the cold shoulder to the United States on issues ranging from climate change to Iran's nuclear program. The president then pursued trade grievances, firmed up diplomatic and military ties with Beijing's neighbors and designated the western Pacific as a central focus of American military strategy.
Mr. Romney promises to display even more spine.
''The policy that Obama has adopted of constantly acquiescing to China, constantly giving China more room in the hope that China will grant us some concessions, simply hasn't worked,'' said Alex Wong, the campaign's foreign policy director.
Mr. Romney often promises to officially declare that China is deliberately weakening its currency, the renminbi, to make its exports more competitive, thereby costing American jobs. That action would only trigger bilateral consultations. But should Beijing refuse to bend, he has said, he would instruct the Commerce Department to impose duties on Chinese imports.
In the 2008 presidential campaign Mr. Obama also promised to label China a currency manipulator. But once in office, he opted for behind-the-scenes pressure on Beijing to let the renminbi strengthen. So has every president since 1994. Many economists argue that the pressure, combined with China's own desire to rebalance its economy, has worked. The renminbi is no longer grossly undervalued, they say, although other powerful hidden subsidies, like artificially low interest rates, remain. Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent, the International Monetary Fund concluded in July, revising its status from ''substantially'' to ''moderately undervalued.''
Similarly, China's current account surplus -- which measures in part how much more money China makes from exports than it spends on imports -- has fallen to three percent of gross domestic product, down from 10 percent in 2007. That suggests a stronger renminbi has reduced the trade imbalance between China and its partners.
''I think we should declare victory,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Carnegie Endowment's Mr. Dadush asserts that Mr. Romney's pledge makes ''no economic or trade policy sense, given what China has done and given its importance.''
Grant D. Aldonas, Mr. Romney's trade adviser and a Commerce under secretary for international trade during President George W. Bush's first term, acknowledges the renminbi's gains but argues the government recently has been suppressing its value.
The renminbi has indeed weakened one percent against the dollar since February, according to Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment. But Mr. Pettis argues that the reason for the renminbi's fall is capital flight, not government intervention. So many Chinese are taking money out of the country that Beijing is ''actually forcing the renminbi up, not down,'' he said.
Mr. Romney is threatening to use the Commerce Department's powers to unilaterally impose tariffs on Chinese products, while the Obama administration's main tactic against unfair trade practices has been to bring cases before the World Trade Organization. Mr. Romney argues there is no need to hold back because a trade war is already under way. But many economists say the current battles are mere skirmishes, not a real trade war. They warn that unilateral sanctions could trigger Chinese retaliation that would more than offset any economic benefits.
Consider 2009, when the Commerce Department imposed a duty on imports of Chinese tires -- a move sought by the United Steelworkers Union and widely criticized by economists and by Mr. Romney as politically motivated. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert with the Peterson Institute, said the action protected at most 1,200 American jobs but last year alone cost American consumers $1.1 billion in higher-priced tires.
China responded with tariffs on imports of American chicken parts that cost American poultry producers an estimated $1 billion in lost sales. Last month, the Obama administration let the tire tariff quietly expire.
On the military front, Mr. Romney's aides have said he wants to build up the American military presence to counter China's influence in the western Pacific. The Obama administration has moved in that direction, expanding an Australian base to 2,500 Marines and stationing four combat ships in Singapore. Mr. Romney has also criticized President Obama's 2011 decision to sell Taiwan $5.85 billion in military hardware to update its air force instead of approving Taiwan's request for 66 new and more advanced F-16 fighters. As president, an aide said, Mr. Romney would approve such a request.
''There would be a tough Chinese reaction,'' said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who described China's opposition to the sale as an unofficial red line. ''The question is how tough.''

HEADLINE: Ford C-Max Energi Plug-in Hybrid Is Certified at 620 Miles of Range

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The rating gives the vehicle another selling point against the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, which is rated at a range of 540 miles. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, Ford fired another volley in its sustained campaign to vanquish the Toyota Prius. The automaker's C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid was certified by the Environmental Protection Agency at a range of 620 miles.
The Energi improved on the ratings of the plug-in hybrid competition; the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid is certified by the E.P.A. at 540 miles of total range, and the Chevrolet Volt at 380 miles.
"Congratulations to Ford," John Hanson, a Toyota spokesman, wrote in an e-mail, a rare hat tip from rival to rival. John Davis, chief engineer for the C-Max, confirmed in a telephone interview that the 620-mile range figure would appear on the Energi's window sticker. The car will arrive at dealerships next month.
Automakers have only recently begun to emphasize estimated range as a selling point for their vehicles, complementing measures like fuel economy. Recent scholarship indicates the range number would only become more prominent in a shopper's purchase decision.
"The 21st century is emerging as the century of the 'supercommuter,'" a study (PDF) released this year by the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University said. Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the center, said in a telephone interview that more Americans were willing to travel beyond the bounds of their metropolitan regions for their jobs, and commute 90 miles or more one way. "The recession has made people much more transportation-mobile than housing-mobile," he said.
Mr. Moss added that more fuel-efficient cars, including hybrids and electrics, would serve this new supercommuter. "It fits their lifestyle," he said. "They can drive more using less gas - or no gas."
Ford has noted the Energi would deliver up to 21 miles of all-electric range and an E.P.A.-certified miles-per-gallon equivalent of 100 m.p.g. in combined urban and highway driving. In hybrid-drive mode, the car has a combined rating of 43 m.p.g. The C-Max in standard guise is a hybrid vehicle rated at 570 miles of total range. "We know customers are sensitive to fuel economy, but they're also concerned about range because they look at the time between fill-ups," Mr. Davis, the Ford engineer, said.
He added that the Energi version was expected to account for 15 to 20 percent of C-Max sales in the United States. The Energi will carry a base price of $33,745 including destination, but a federal income tax credit of up to $3,750 would bring the price to $29,995. State incentives are also available.

HEADLINE: The Great Hanging at Gainesville

BYLINE: RICHARD PARKER and EMILY BOYD


HIGHLIGHT: Why dozens of white men were lynched across Texas in October 1862. 

 BODY:
October is the time when summer finally releases its grip on the flat plain of North Texas. But in the fall of 1862 this part of Texas was in the grip of a cycle of violence: Texan against Texan, even as the Civil War pitted Southerner against Northerner.
"Texas had been divided about secession - deeply," says the Temple University professor Gregory Urwin, who has researched Civil War atrocities. "So the threat was now internal as well as the threat of Union invasion itself" in the eyes of slaveholders. Confederate supporters "responded to that threat now the way they did to Indians and Mexicans before. It was life and death."
By 1862, the fragile order of this frontier state was breaking down under the pressures of an unpopular draft and a capricious martial law. In 1861, the idea of secession had been seductive. But the reality of war on the home front in Texas was disillusioning, grim and terrifying in its lawlessness. In the fall of 1862, in North Texas, more than 40 men, most guilty of nothing more than not reporting for the draft that day, would hang or be shot in a military atrocity by Confederate troops that remains the largest case of vigilante justice in America.
Already that year, Confederate troops had ambushed a party of German immigrants on the Nueces River, killing 19, executing 9 more and then hunting down still more on the Rio Grande. The ambush and executions far exceeded the legal authority of the Confederate commanders, who should have arrested the Germans for attempting to flee conscription. The following year nine more men, Confederate troops on leave, were hanged near Bandera in the Hill Country - by other Confederate troops on patrol.
In Texas, the Confederate military, which was supposed to ensure security, posed an increasing threat to civilians through its mix of powerful and often incompetent officers and undisciplined troops left to guard the home front. Brig. Gen. Paul Octave Hbert, the state military commander, though a West Point graduate, had logged just five years of active duty military experience before becoming a rich sugar planter and governor of his native Louisiana - only to rejoin the military after secession. His troops despised him as arrogant, and even Gov. Francis Lubbock said Hbert seemed "somewhat bewildered by the magnitude of the task assigned him."
The imperious Hbert practically installed himself as a military governor. He issued proclamations for every able-bodied man to be able to serve in the militia if not in the army; they went largely ignored. He put all of Texas under martial law and his personal authority, going against Jefferson Davis's explicit wishes. He then doled out sweeping authority to his state militia commanders, who in turn did the same with local provosts - men who, in many cases, had limited military experience but vested interests in the local economies or, worse, old scores to settle.
Hbert's autocratic control virtually guaranteed that conflict would break out on the North Texas plains, where the controversies of secession and slavery still seethed. The region, northeast of Dallas, had been settled by newcomers from the Upper South and the Midwest, without slaves, though a minority of older settlers did own slaves. In the run-up to secession, the editor of the Sherman Patriot newspaper had even called for the secession of North Texas from Texas itself. Slave owners and sympathizers fought back with fear-mongering; they even sparked a lynching of blacks for a series of rumored arsons that never took place.
In Gainesville, a town in Cook County about 75 miles northwest of Dallas, only 1 in 10 white males owned slaves and anti-secession, anti-war sentiment abounded: a branch of the Peace Party was still active in Cooke County, long after Texas joined the Confederacy. As the Confederacy's unpopular Conscription Act went into effect - exempting slaveholders from military service but requiring it of non-slaveholders - a Union League had formed to protest the law in a petition to Richmond. 
The commander of the area's military district, Brig. Gen. William Hudson, feared that the agitation among Kansas Jayhawkers and Oklahoma unionists would spill over the nearby border and so ordered draft dodgers arrested. The Unionist and draft dodger circles were quickly penetrated by a pair of self-appointed spies, brothers who supported the Confederacy, who reported their findings to the local provost, Col. James Bourland. A plantation owner in Cooke County, Bourland carried out the arrests and teamed up with Col. William Young, who hand-selected a jury, composed mostly of slave owners, to try the prisoners. Bourland and Young had a strong motivation to tamp down dissent: together they owned a third of all slaves in Cooke County.
The arrests began early on the morning of Oct. 1. The skies darkened through the day, unleashing a torrent of rain. By noon, 70 men were in chains; a few escaped and still others were shot trying to escape. By the end of the day, 150 men were in a makeshift prison in Gainesville. That number would swell to nearly 200.
The very next day the men went on trial for treason against the Confederacy and avoiding the draft. Despite the composition of the town, 7 of the 12 jurors sitting in judgment were slave owners. Some were powerful men with mutual ties: Daniel Montague had served under Colonel Young, Jeremiah Hughes collected war taxes for the Confederacy and William Simpson was a member of the home guard unit rounding up the prisoners now on trial. The remainder of the jury was composed of illiterate farmers or fresh arrivals from the Deep South. 
Initially, the court considered the evidence against them so flimsy that it moved to acquit and release nearly all the prisoners of treason and insurrection; only seven Unionists were to be condemned at all. But a mob was growing outside, and it threatened to break into the prison. The court quickly acceded to its demands for rough justice. 
On Oct. 12, a cold Sunday morning in Gainesville, the mob had enough of the deliberations inside and stormed the courtroom, demanding a list of the men on trial; the jury complied and handed over the names of 14 of them, chosen at random; all were hanged the next day, under the supervision of Young (coincidentally, three days later he was killed by bandits preying along the Red River). 
The fear of spreading factional violence prompted two jurors to flee service. They were replaced by two men, Newton Chance and William Howeth, who wanted all suspected Unionists hanged. The cycle of violence tightened. There would be no mass acquittal or release. Instead, the men were retried; 19 were condemned to death. Young's son oversaw the next round of hangings. Most of the condemned men had done nothing more than fail to report for the draft, itself a crime without formal punishment under Confederate law. 
Chaos soon took over North Texas. Hundreds of families fled the state, fearing for their lives. Military commanders alternately helped lynch mobs or tried to quell them. In Decatur, Capt. John Hill supervised the hanging of five more men while in Sherman, Brig. Gen. James Throckmorton - who had opposed secession as a legislator but donned the gray uniform out of loyalty to Texas - arrived in time to save five men from the noose. The editor of the Sherman Patriot was murdered. In Denton, a man shot a prisoner dead. A North Texas company serving in Arkansas nearly mutinied upon learning of the violence back home.
Texas newspapers hailed the hangings while Lubbock, the governor, applauded the military. But President Davis was humiliated; he had been pressing for an investigation of Union atrocities in Missouri but now was faced with atrocities by his own military against his own people. The Northern press seized on the episode as an example of Southern barbarity. Davis summarily dismissed Hbert from his command. 
On his way out the door, Hbert banned the export of cotton - already made nearly impossible by the Union blockade off the coast - except by authorized agents of the Confederacy. Of course, these authorized agents would receive a fee. Hbert's final order proved wildly unpopular during the remainder of the war. To the injury of atrocities against its own civilians in Texas, the Confederacy could now add the insult of economic punishment, even as it demanded more troops and more cattle for a losing war. At least on the home front in Texas, the tide of the Civil War had begun to turn.

HEADLINE: Why Private Medicare Plans Don't Cost Less

BYLINE: DANA P. GOLDMAN, ADAM LEIVE and DANIEL MCFADDEN


HIGHLIGHT: In considering the role of private insurance companies in Medicare's future, it is worth noting the political factors that have made private Medicare plans more costly to date, three economists write. 

 BODY:
Dana P. Goldman is the director of the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. Adam Leive is a graduate student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Daniel McFadden is a senior fellow at the Schaeffer Center and the 2000 Nobel winner in economic science. 
One question at the center of the Medicare debate is whether private insurance companies have a future role to play in the huge federal program. Paul Ryan's 2012 budget proposal gives private health plans a starring role in the form of a voucher program. But some economists would give them the hook, citing the failure of Medicare Advantage to control costs. Some perspective is in order.
Medicare Advantage has historically cost 7 to 12 percent more than traditional Medicare, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. But to conclude that this cost difference proves that private health plans have no place in Medicare misreads the Medicare Advantage experience in an important way: It ignores the decisive role that government has played in driving up the program's costs. Medicare Advantage is only partly about reducing costs. It is also designed to increase choice for beneficiaries. And the incentives that government gives private health plans to expand choice end up undercutting efforts to save money. 
Under Medicare Advantage, private plans deliver Medicare services directly to patients. Insurance companies bid to provide Medicare beneficiaries with a different package of services than traditional Medicare, but their coverage must be at least as generous. The government then reimburses the insurers to cover about 13 million enrollees, or about 27 percent of the Medicare population. 
Both insurers and consumers are making choices. Beneficiaries opt out of traditional Medicare if they think a private plan offers them a better deal, and insurers enter the Medicare Advantage market if they believe it will be profitable. The crucial point is that both consumers and insurers need an incentive to take part in the market. That costs money -- and it is the government that has chosen to pay the price to give beneficiaries more choices. The result is that insurers compete by covering more services rather than by reducing premiums and improving efficiency to remain profitable at lower premiums. 
Many contend that the government "overpays" for people enrolled in private plans, since traditional Medicare could have covered these patients for less money. But the reason it would have cost less is partly that the government has done a woeful job in figuring out how much to pay the private plans. The government compensates insurers based on the health of their enrollees at the start of the year. Plans with healthier patients receive less money than those with sicker ones to reflect the likelihood that healthier people will use less care. Healthier patients enroll in Medicare Advantage plans, so in, principle, plans should be reimbursed less by the government for enrolling these patients (the technical term for this process is "risk adjustment"). But for decades, the government has failed to determine who is healthy and who is sick with any precision, with the result that private plans receive larger payments to cover their patients' costs than necessary. This botched payment system gives insurers an incentive to spend more time selecting the healthiest patients, and less time treating them more efficiently. 
Medicare officials will counter that Medicare Advantage plans are forbidden from excluding individual patients -- and they are right, to an extent. But a more egregious source of overpayments comes directly from insurers' unrestricted choice of geographic markets in which to operate. The economists Thomas McGuire, Joseph Newhouse and Anna Sinaiko found that, for many years, private companies aimed at richer, urban areas because these were more profitable, in part because government payments to insurers must be based on the costs of traditional Medicare, which are higher in these areas. 
In rural areas, by contrast, marketing costs are higher, and physicians and hospitals - being fewer - have more bargaining power with insurers. To induce private insurers to enter this market, the government increased reimbursements to them and, as expected, more companies then offered health care plans. 
The dynamic here is straightforward: When faced with a choice of expanding choice (and spending money) or controlling costs by forcing competition on premiums, the government has selected the former. 
The reason is not difficult to discern: politics. As part of the changes in 2003 -- when Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, headed the Senate Finance Committee -- the government paid insurers the highest of four different rates to encourage participation. At a minimum, plans were paid traditional Medicare rates, but under certain conditions they could be paid more. In a 2007 hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley described the fevered politics surrounding the 2003 Medicare changes, when many senators (from both parties) lobbied for higher payments to private plans. In his statement, Senator Grassley argued against equalizing payment levels between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, saying members on "both sides of the aisle" wanted to promote the availability of these plans, especially in rural areas.
So it's no surprise that Medicare Advantage costs would reflect this generosity; that is the way the government set it up. Even when private plans save money, Medicare forces the plans to provide more generous benefits, which only encourages more care and even higher costs. These extra benefits include dental services, vision care, hearing aids, podiatry, and other supplemental services. More than half of the Medicare Advantage plans offer some form of gym or health club membership, for example.
So the truth about Medicare Advantage is not so simple. Furthermore, the program's experience poses a more relevant and nuanced question, namely: If we actually set up the system to save money -- and required everyone to make a choice -- what would happen? 
The new Medicare prescription drug program provides a partial answer. In this program, the government has a fixed contribution to drug benefits. Consumers choose from an array of plans - although there is evidence that they have trouble taking advantage of the complex choices they are offered. Still, the Part D market appears stable and efficient, indicating that competition with reasonable management of the products offered in the market can work.
The real question is whether a level playing field, with carefully designed and managed competition in private health insurance, can fulfill its promise and deliver enough cost savings and gains in consumer choice to be decisively superior to traditional Medicare. It's an experiment worth trying.

HEADLINE: A Fast Shopper Chooses His College Early, but With Reservations

BYLINE: WILL WALKER


HIGHLIGHT: Will Walker, a student at University School in Hunting Valley, Ohio, doesn't feel like "lightning struck" at any of the colleges he visited. But he's chosen to submit a binding early decision application anyway. 

 BODY:
Last summer, when I was in the midst of my college visitation process, I traveled a couple hundred miles north to visit Middlebury College, a liberal arts school in Vermont.
The school was great. The students were nice, the admissions officer was entertaining, and the food (which I ate at an off-campus hot spot) was superb. But my biggest take-away from the visit wasn't anything about the college itself. Instead it was No. 6 on the list of "10 Ways to Enjoy the College Process," which a student passed out at the beginning of the information session.
 "Apply early decision only if you felt like 'lightning struck' you," the sheet said. 
Yeah. Fat chance.

You see, to me, the college application process isn't like that. There's not one school that I think about every waking minute; I don't salivate over any single school. In fact, to me, choosing a college is more like buying a TV than anything. Granted, it's a $250,000 TV that you have to watch 24-7 for the next four years of your life. But it's a TV nonetheless.
Think about it. You go into a very clean, well-decorated building, while a group of 20-somethings tells you about a bunch of specifications you don't really understand:
"The LED rays ensure that the blacks are blacker and the colors are more vivid."
Or: 
"We allow students to switch their majors halfway through their junior year only if they've demonstrated proficiency in another subject by declaring it a concentration."
And then, based on the technical specifications you do understand, and what you think of the five-minute, uneducated evaluation of the images you see, and, of course, how much you like the salesman, you make your decision.
Most people who buy TVs are happy with them. And I'm sure that I'll be happy with my college choice. But I certainly didn't feel like lightning struck me when I saw the 18-inch Panasonic. And I didn't feel like lightning struck me at any of the colleges I've visited.
However, despite the warnings of the Middlebury pamphlet, I do have plans to apply early decision. Come Nov. 1, I'll probably apply binding early-decision to Williams College, a small, liberal arts school in northwestern Massachusetts.
I'll apply early decision there because I liked it the best. The study-abroad options sounded fantastic, I loved the tutorial system, I liked the vibe I got from the campus, and my admissions officer seemed really down to earth and nice. But I didn't feel like "lightning struck" me. It's not like on the eighth day God created Williams College. I just thought it fit me a little better than the other schools I visited.
I do, however, have some reservations. A part of me, for example, is worried that I'm missing something, that I'll visit a different school in December, fall totally in love with it, and be worried about being bound somewhere else. And the gap between Williams and my second-choice school, Georgetown University, is pretty narrow (largely because the people I know at Georgetown are the most exceptional I've ever met).
And, of course, there are also financial concerns. I probably won't have to apply for any need-based aid, but my school nominated me for a merit scholarship at Davidson College called the John Montgomery Belk Scholarship, a full ride that I wouldn't be able to take advantage of if I got accepted in the early decision round of my first-choice school.
Despite all of that, I think that, ultimately, I'll stick to my guns. I liked Williams a lot, and have no doubt in my mind I would be happy there.
As my art history teacher told me last week: "Walker, there are 3,000 excellent schools in the country. If you're so picky that you'd only like 1 percent of them, then that's still 30 schools. You're applying to 10. Do the math."
I'm just hoping I picked the right 10.

HEADLINE: Romney's Tax Plan and Economic Growth

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's proposal to lower tax rates and close tax loopholes is unlikely to produce any meaningful economic growth, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, are quite insistent that their tax plan is just the elixir that the economy needs to jumpstart growth. As Mr. Ryan said at last week's debate, "Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow the economy and create jobs." He pointed to the similarity between Mr. Romney's tax plan and the one that became law under Ronald Reagan in 1986.
Indeed, there is similarity between the Reagan and Romney tax plans. Reagan broadened the tax base by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes and used the revenue to lower the top statutory federal income rate to 28 percent - exactly as Mr. Romney proposes.
In principle, a change that holds revenues constant while lowering marginal tax rates - the rate on the last dollar earned - should increase growth. That is because, in economist-speak, both the income and the substitution effects are pushing in the same direction.

The income effect results when taxes rise. People have to work and produce more to pay the additional tax in order to have the same amount of disposable income they had previously. Conversely, if taxes fall, the opposite effect occurs - people can work and produce less and still have the same disposable income.
The substitution effect arises when marginal tax rates alter the trade-offs between work and leisure, saving and consumption, taxable investments and tax-sheltered investments such as municipal bonds, taxable wages and nontaxable fringe benefits such as health insurance, renting and owning a home and so on.
What Reagan did and Mr. Romney proposes is to keep taxes constant but to reduce marginal tax rates. By "taxes" I mean aggregate tax revenues; there was no overall tax cut in 1986 or in the Romney plan. Mr. Romney has said repeatedly that the level of tax revenues will be exactly the same after his plan is implemented as they otherwise would be. In the aggregate, there is no tax cut in the Romney plan.
But under the Romney plan, marginal tax rates would fall by 20 percent across the board - not 20 percentage points but 20 percent of the rate. With the top rate at 35 percent presently, a 20 percent reduction would lower it by seven percentage points to 28 percent. Other rates would fall proportionately.
A full distributional analysis of the Romney plan cannot be done because Mr. Romney hasn't said what deductions and loopholes would be eliminated to pay for his rate cut. He only recently suggested that he would not eliminate them individually but rather would cap all deductions at $17,000 per taxpayer.
For the sake of argument, let's assume that the Romney plan is revenue-neutral. Thus for those with itemized deductions larger than $17,000 in total, taxes would rise. But their tax rate would fall. In the aggregate, the rate reduction will offset 100 percent of the tax rise.
Of course, the aggregate tax change will affect different taxpayers differently. Some people will pay more total federal income taxes than they pay now, and others will pay less. Those who don't itemize will get the benefit of the rate cut but not pay more taxes as a result of the loss of deductions, because they don't have any. People with large deductions relative to their income may see a large increase in taxes that is only partially offset by the rate reduction.
Leaving aside the question of fairness, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The idea of tax reform is to get people away from basing economic decisions, such as whether to rent or a buy a home, on tax considerations. In principle, work and investment decisions become more efficient and thereby raise growth.
As noted earlier, economic theory is unambiguous that holding taxes constant and reducing marginal rates will increase growth. But it is important to understand that this effect is neither large nor instantaneous. At best, it will raise the long-term trend rate of growth by perhaps tenths of a percent. With compounding, the effect can eventually be large.
But the idea that tax reform will jump-start an economy suffering from the after-effects of a cyclical downturn is nonsense. This can be illustrated by looking at the impact of the 1986 tax reform.
Real gross domestic product growth was about the same after the 1986 act took effect in 1987 as it was before, and tax reform obviously did nothing to forestall the 1990-91 recession. Unemployment fell, but it had been trending downward before tax reform, and the 1986 act probably had nothing to do with it. Within a couple of years it was trending upward again.
By the mid-1990s, it was the consensus view of economists that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 had little, if any, impact on growth. In an article in the May 1995 issue of the American Economic Review, the Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, a strong supporter of tax reform who had served as chairman of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, found large changes in the composition of income, but the only growth effect was a small increase in the labor supply of married women.
In a comprehensive review of the economic effects of the 1986 tax reform act, in the June 1997 issue of the Journal of Economic Literature, Alan Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and Joel Slemrod, the University of Michigan economist, also found that the primary impact was on the shifting composition of income. They could find no significant growth effects. They concluded, "The aggregate values of labor supply and saving apparently responded very little."
Compositional changes in income are not unimportant and may be worth the effort of doing tax reform, even if there is no growth effect whatsoever. For example, it may improve fairness, simplicity and tax administration. But it appears that even in a best-case scenario in which the top rate comes down a lot - the 1986 act lowered the top rate 22 percentage points from 50 percent - the real economic effects are at best very modest.
Mr. Romney's plan is not likely to be enacted in anywhere near the form he has proposed, if only because Congress is far more polarized today than it was in 1986, and the major political parties are much farther apart on the goals of tax reform. Consequently, there is little reason to think we will see tax reform any time soon, and even if Mr. Romney's plan is enacted as proposed the growth effect will be small to nonexistent.

HEADLINE: Goldman Beats Expectations

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs swung to a profit in the third quarter. | Andrew Ross Sorkin says lawsuits brought by the government "may have a profound impact" on how businesses view the next crisis. | SoftBank is betting it can break the dominance of Verizon and AT&#038;T. 

 BODY:
GOLDMAN BEATS EXPECTATIONS | Goldman Sachs may be getting its groove back. The Wall Street firm said on Tuesday that it swung to a profit in the third quarter, reporting net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $1.46 billion, compared with a loss of $428 million in the quarter a year ago. The third-quarter profit amounted to $2.85 a share, beating the $2.12 a share analysts were expecting. Goldman also said it was increasing its dividend to 50 cents from 46 cents. (The conference call to discuss the results is at 9:30 a.m. Dial 1-888-281-7154 to listen in the United States.)
One risk still looms for Goldman, as a new book by a former employee, Greg Smith, is set to be released next week. But judging by the first chapter, it is not entirely clear what dirt Mr. Smith might reveal in "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," DealBook's Susanne Craig writes. Mr. Smith illustrates Goldman's famously competitive culture with anecdotes about folding stools and a Cheddar cheese salad. The other chapters, with titles like "Welcome to the Casino" and "Monstrosities," may prove more embarrassing for the firm, Ms. Craig notes.
Goldman added a new board member on Monday, naming Adebayo O. Ogunlesi as an independent director. Mr. Ogunlesi, a well-known Wall Street figure who once said he did not fit the mold of a typical investment banker, runs Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that recently raised a $8.25 billion fund.
Over all, it has been a year of retrenching in the financial industry, and the cutbacks have had an effect on New York City's economy. The City Room blog writes that smaller bonuses on Wall Street were "the main reason Manhattan was the only large county in the country to record a decline in wages in the latest 12-month period for which figures are available, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York."
THE BAILOUT BLUES | Jamie Dimon was hailed as the King of Wall Street when JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 in a government-brokered deal. But he has lately been having second thoughts about Bear, which is the target of a new lawsuit filed by New York's attorney general. Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column: "Whether you love or hate Wall Street, whether you want bankers to go to jail or not, the recent series of suits brought by the government may have a profound impact on how businesses react to being asked to provide assistance when the next financial crisis arrives. Chances are, they won't."
AN INSIDER'S PLAN TO LIMIT BANK SIZE | Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor, made a splash last week when he urged Congress to consider limiting the size of banks' balance sheets. DealBook's Peter Eavis writes that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle may warm to that idea. "I am completely open to the proposal because of my similar concern about the growing size of institutions that are too big to fail," said Senator David Vitter, a Republican of Louisiana. "Beyond this specific proposal, there is a growing nonpartisan consensus to do a lot more to limit the size of the megabanks."
ON THE AGENDA | Mitt Romney and President Obama meet Tuesday night in the second presidential debate. Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, has cultivated some well-placed friends on Wall Street, who held a fund-raising event Monday evening, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.

SOFTBANK'S BIG GAMBLE | With a $20.1 billion deal to take control of Sprint, SoftBank of Japan is "making a risky wager that it can break the dominance of Verizon and AT&T in the United States the way it did a similar duopoly that long reigned over the Japanese market," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. But SoftBank's investors may be concerned that the chief executive, Masayoshi Son, is letting his ego guide his thinking, The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column writes. Mr. Son said on Monday, "Every man wants to be No. 1." Still, SoftBank's shares rebounded on Tuesday, climbing 9.5 percent, after two days of declines.
The deal strengthens Sprint, expanding its customer base and giving it more purchasing power, DealBook notes. But it raises questions about another wireless company, Clearwire, which is seen as a potential takeover target in the future. Clearwire's shares were up nearly 16 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Goldman Beats Expectations

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs swung to a profit in the third quarter. | Andrew Ross Sorkin says lawsuits brought by the government "may have a profound impact" on how businesses view the next crisis. | SoftBank is betting it can break the dominance of Verizon and AT&#038;T. 

 BODY:
GOLDMAN BEATS EXPECTATIONS | Goldman Sachs may be getting its groove back. The Wall Street firm said on Tuesday that it swung to a profit in the third quarter, reporting net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $1.46 billion, compared with a loss of $428 million in the quarter a year ago. The third-quarter profit amounted to $2.85 a share, beating the $2.12 a share analysts were expecting. Goldman also said it was increasing its dividend to 50 cents from 46 cents. (The conference call to discuss the results is at 9:30 a.m. Dial 1-888-281-7154 to listen in the United States.)
One risk still looms for Goldman, as a new book by a former employee, Greg Smith, is set to be released next week. But judging by the first chapter, it is not entirely clear what dirt Mr. Smith might reveal in "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," DealBook's Susanne Craig writes. Mr. Smith illustrates Goldman's famously competitive culture with anecdotes about folding stools and a Cheddar cheese salad. The other chapters, with titles like "Welcome to the Casino" and "Monstrosities," may prove more embarrassing for the firm, Ms. Craig notes.
Goldman added a new board member on Monday, naming Adebayo O. Ogunlesi as an independent director. Mr. Ogunlesi, a well-known Wall Street figure who once said he did not fit the mold of a typical investment banker, runs Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that recently raised a $8.25 billion fund.
Over all, it has been a year of retrenching in the financial industry, and the cutbacks have had an effect on New York City's economy. The City Room blog writes that smaller bonuses on Wall Street were "the main reason Manhattan was the only large county in the country to record a decline in wages in the latest 12-month period for which figures are available, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York."
THE BAILOUT BLUES | Jamie Dimon was hailed as the King of Wall Street when JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 in a government-brokered deal. But he has lately been having second thoughts about Bear, which is the target of a new lawsuit filed by New York's attorney general. Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column: "Whether you love or hate Wall Street, whether you want bankers to go to jail or not, the recent series of suits brought by the government may have a profound impact on how businesses react to being asked to provide assistance when the next financial crisis arrives. Chances are, they won't."
AN INSIDER'S PLAN TO LIMIT BANK SIZE | Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor, made a splash last week when he urged Congress to consider limiting the size of banks' balance sheets. DealBook's Peter Eavis writes that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle may warm to that idea. "I am completely open to the proposal because of my similar concern about the growing size of institutions that are too big to fail," said Senator David Vitter, a Republican of Louisiana. "Beyond this specific proposal, there is a growing nonpartisan consensus to do a lot more to limit the size of the megabanks."
ON THE AGENDA | Mitt Romney and President Obama meet Tuesday night in the second presidential debate. Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, has cultivated some well-placed friends on Wall Street, who held a fund-raising event Monday evening, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. The event's nearly 200 co-chairs included John Paulson of Paulson & Company and Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, the co-founders of Apollo Global Management. Another host, Paul E. Singer of Elliott Management, recently donated $250,000 to support same-sex marriage in Maryland, Politico reports.
 Stephen Siderow, co-founder of the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital, is on Bloomberg TV at 1 p.m. Justin Rosenstein, who works with Dustin Moskovitz at the start-up Asana, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m. Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, State Street and UnitedHealth report earnings before the bell. In London, Bloomberg Link hosts a conference on currency markets. The Consumer Price Index for September is out at 8:30 a.m., and data on industrial production for September comes out at 9:15 a.m.
SOFTBANK'S BIG GAMBLE | With a $20.1 billion deal to take control of Sprint, SoftBank of Japan is "making a risky wager that it can break the dominance of Verizon and AT&T in the United States the way it did a similar duopoly that long reigned over the Japanese market," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes.

HEADLINE: Town Hall Format Poses Risks for Obama and Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The candidates will be grilled by common voters on Tuesday night, and that could pose some real risks. 

 BODY:
As President Obama and Mitt Romney prepare for their debate on Tuesday night, they face an unpredictable variable that was not a factor in their previous encounter: the common voter.
Both presidential candidates have had some of their most awkward and politically fraught moments when confronted directly by voters. Tuesday's debate will force as many as a dozen such encounters, any one of which could become a crucial moment in the campaign's remaining weeks.
Mr. Obama was caught off guard during a 2010 economic town hall forum on CNBC when an African-American woman declared herself profoundly disappointed in him. He grinned awkwardly and then rambled for four minutes, providing new evidence of the political peril from a still sluggish economy.
At the Iowa State Fair in 2011, Mr. Romney's answer to a combative voter provided one of the most enduring -- and damaging -- moments in his campaign. "Corporations are people, too, my friend," a defensive Mr. Romney responded, a line that would dog him in the months ahead.
For 90 minutes tonight, both candidates must seek to avoid such moments -- and their advisers know it. There is precious little time left before Election Day to correct a devastating interaction should one occur.
Both men live in protective bubbles, shuttled around in bulletproof cars and protected by aides. The pointed questions they usually get are from reporters, pundits or the occasional greeting from a supporter on a rope line.
Mr. Romney is seen as particularly awkward when interacting with voters, and polls suggest that he has the bigger challenge. In most surveys, a majority of people say they do not believe that he understands their plight. He does not get high marks for empathy.
In the same polls, Mr. Obama scores better when it comes to understanding voters. But the president has sometimes struggled to display empathy when he's talking to them. Instead, he has a tendency to answer emotion with explanation, often launching into a long, rambling discourse laden with facts and figures.
In Tuesday's debate, most of the questions will come from members of the audience, who were selected by Gallup as examples of uncommitted voters. That could translate into particularly pointed questions for the two candidates, particularly on the subject that has dominated the campaign: the economic struggles of the middle class.
What makes the questions particularly difficult -- and what has bedeviled both men during the past year -- is the proximity of the questioner.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly been asked by reporters, news anchors and others about the disappointment that his supporters feel in his inability to turn around the economy more quickly. In most of those cases, he is able to quickly dismiss the question or find a way to change the subject.
But that was impossible in the case of the woman who confronted Mr. Obama at the CNBC forum. There she was, standing just feet from the president, declaring her frustrations for all to see.
"I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration," the the president. "I'm deeply disappointed where we are right now. I'm waiting, sir. I'm waiting. I don't feel it yet. Is this my new reality?"
Mr. Obama offered her the same explanation that he often does on the campaign trail, trying to thread the needle between being compassionate and defending his own record. "My goal here is not to convince you that everything is where it needs to be," he said. "But what I am saying is that we are moving in the right direction."
The president had a similar exchange with a voter at a town hall meeting on health care in 2010. The woman asked about taxes included in his health care plan, asserting, "We are overtaxed as it is."
Mr. Obama's answer took more than 17 minutes, as he rambled on about Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office, earmarks, payroll taxes, the deficit, Congressional pay-as-you-go rules and Cobra insurance coverage. All the while, the woman asking the question stood politely.
"Boy, that was a long answer," Mr. Obama said when he finished. "I'm sorry."
Mr. Romney has had just as much trouble during his interactions with real voters.
In a coffee shop in Tampa, Fla., Mr. Romney met with voterswho complained about their difficulty finding work. "I should tell my story," Mr. Romney said, trying to be funny. "I'm also unemployed."
But instead of humor, what persisted was the unfortunate image of Mr. Romney -- who is worth an estimated $250 million -- sitting next to unemployed workers and joking about being out of work himself. It added to the ammunition for Democrats that he is out of touch with regular people.
In 2011, when a young boy handed Mr. Romney a $1 bill turned into origami, the Republican struggled to find an unfolded $1 bill to hand back to the boy. The Washington Post reported that Mr. Romney "had a $100 bill" in his billfold and eventually found a $5 bill to give the boy.
And in Youngstown, Ohio, in March, Mr. Romneytold a young college-bound student that he should "shop around" for the lowest price, suggesting that he shouldn't look to the government for help in paying for college. That gave Mr. Obama a chance to tout his own efforts to raise government student loans.
Both candidates have spent days preparing for the debate, though advisers know that there is a limit to how much they can be scripted to deal with an interaction with a voter.
Mr. Obama expects voters to question him on the slow economic recovery. Mr. Romney can rehearse how he might respond to questions about his wealth or his business practices while at Bain Capital.
But in the end, success or failure tonight is likely to come down to how comfortable each appears to be in handling those questions. The cameras will be watching, and so will tens of millions of voters.

HEADLINE: No Guarantee of Obama Rebound in Second Debate

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at two theories and what they might say about President Obama's performance in Tuesday night's debate. 

 BODY:
President Obama was soundly defeated in the first presidential debate in Denver, contributing toward about a four-point swing toward Mitt Romney in head-to-head polls - enough to turn the race from one in which Mr. Obama had a clear lead into a very close contest.
There are two theories about what that might mean for Tuesday night's debate in New York - and next Monday's in Florida.
One theory would hold that Mr. Obama is poised for a rebound. There are several logical mechanisms by which this could occur. First, expectations have been lowered for Mr. Obama's performance - and raised for Mr. Romney's. Next, the news media, having "called" the first debate for Mr. Romney, might be inclined to do the opposite in this case - fairly or not. Finally, as a general principle, polls have some mean-reversion tendencies, meaning that the bounces produced by news events have some tendency to fade with the passage of time. 
The opposite theory - just as logical - is that Mr. Romney's strong performance in the first debate is a leading indicator for what will happen in the last two. Perhaps he is simply the better debater - or perhaps he has the more persuasive message; the 90 minutes in Denver, after all, were the best moments of his campaign so far. If this theory is right, he could continue to dig a deeper hole for Mr. Obama.
Does the historical evidence allow us to adjudicate between these two theories, which come to opposite predictions about the outcome?
In the chart below, I've listed the change in national polls before and after each presidential debate since 1976. (I exclude the debate of Sept. 21, 1980, when the incumbent, President Jimmy Carter, did not participate but the independent, John Anderson, did.) 
The numbers in the chart indicate the margin between the incumbent party candidate and the challenger; leads for the incumbent party are designated in purple, and for the challenging party, in orange.
The data in the chart should be similar to a previous analysis that I did about the impact of presidential debates, but I've had to be a little more careful to resolve a potential ambiguity. In the original analysis, I looked at the before-and-after polls for the first debate only. However, in some cases, some of the polls that I used in the "after" column were also conducted after the second debate, blurring the distinction between them. Thus, I've rerun the numbers with more precision about exactly when the polls were conducted. (The polls listed in the "after" column for the first presidential debate, for instance, now consist of surveys that began their interviewing within a week following the first presidential debate - but which ended it before the second one.)
The chart still shows that the challenger gains ground after the first presidential debate on average. But there is one year, 1992, when it now shows the incumbent, the elder George Bush, gaining after the first debate rather than the challenger, Bill Clinton.
The issue is that Mr. Clinton had an extremely strong second debate in 1992 - a town-hall-style debate in Richmond, Va. All of his gains in the polls came after that debate - not after the first one, in St. Louis. In fact, this analysis now has Mr. Bush gaining ground after the first debate, reducing his deficit with Mr. Clinton in the polls to about 10 percentage points from 13.
Mr. Clinton expanded his margin to 16 points after the Richmond debate, however - a 6-point bounce.
But those gains were temporary. Mr. Bush rebounded to within 10 points of Mr. Clinton following the third and final debate in East Lansing, Mich., and eventually lost the election by only about 5 points.
Thus, the sequence of debates in 1992 constitutes strong evidence for the hypothesis that Mr. Obama will rebound.
In other years, however, one candidate remained on a winning streak. John Kerry is evaluated as the winner of both the first and second presidential debates in 2004, for example; the same goes for George W. Bush in 2000, and Barack Obama in 2008, although John McCain gained slightly after the third presidential debate that year.
The next chart shows the change in polls from one debate to the next one. It illustrates a negative correlation, meaning that there is a tendency for the winners of the debate to reverse.
However, the tendency is only modest, and it is not very robust - the negative relationship comes solely as a result from the sequence of debates 1992. Otherwise, the candidate who wins one debate has been about as likely to win or lose the next one.
It's also worth observing that the modest tendency for debate winners to reverse stems more from the third debate rather than the second one: the second and third debates produced opposite winners in four of the five years in which a third debate was held. There has not been any overall relationship between the winner of the first debate and the winner of the second one.
Mr. Obama will likely need a stronger performance in at least one of the final two debates to make himself feel at all secure on Election Day. 
You can argue the case that if Mr. Obama has one A-level performance left in him, and one league-average one, he'd prefer to save the best for last. If there is a tendency for the winner of the debates to reverse themselves, then a loss in the first debate for Mr. Obama might predict a win for him in the second one. But by the same logic, a win for Mr. Obama in the second debate would then predict another loss in the third one.
But it's presumptuous to assume that Mr. Obama will have the luxury to pick and choose: it may be that he's simply not as strong in this format as Mr. Romney is, in which case every moment spent on the debate stage is a negative for him.
If there is reason to suspect a rebound for Mr. Obama, it is probably based more on election fundamentals than the debates themselves. Mr. Obama's approval ratings are just strong enough, and the economy has shown just enough resiliency, that he might be a narrow favorite on each basis. One function that debates can serve is to bring elections more into line with the fundamentals.
There is no evidence, incidentally, that the second presidential debate is any less important than the first one. On average, it has moved the polls by 2.3 percentage points in one direction or another - almost exactly the same as after the first debate, which moved them by 2.4 percentage points on average.
The third debate, however, has often had a more muted impact. The only significant change in the polls following the third debate was in 1992, when Mr. Bush narrowed his deficit with Mr. Clinton, and that may well have reflected a case of reversion to the mean.

HEADLINE: Women on the Verge of a Political Breakthrough

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: Two remarkable women -- Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Val Demings in Florida -- are part of the surge of female candidates running for office in the United States this November. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - Already American women are setting records in this election cycle, running for office in ground-breaking numbers, as I write in my latest Female Factor column. But beyond the sheer numbers, among the scores of veterans and newcomers, several women stand on the brink of making history.
Few of them may be more remarkable than Representative Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, 50, a Democrat who is running for the U.S. Senate against Tommy G. Thompson, 70, the former longest-serving governor of that state. If Ms. Baldwin wins, she will be the first female senator from Wisconsin and the first openly gay senator in U.S. history.
Ms. Baldwin, with an undergraduate degree from Smith College and a law degree from the University of Wisconsin, is among the most liberal members of the House. But she's not a conventional liberal. Unlike many liberals, she is pro-gun and pro-hunting. She supports the Second Amendment, owns a gun herself and has a coalition called Sportsmen and Sportswomen for Tammy. 
What's more, she has not allowed her sexual orientation to become a distraction or an issue in this center-right state, and when she decided to run for the Senate, she didn't consider that her sexuality might become an obstacle, she said in a telephone interview on Friday. 
"I listened to the people of my state,'' she said. "Middle-class families are struggling. Too many Wisconsin families are squeaking by and are very frustrated by the disconnect with what's happening in Washington, D.C., with partisanship and special interests."
In the past few months she has raised more money than her opponent and has been able to spend freely on advertising, getting contributions from national groups like Emily's List and LPAC, a lesbian political action committee. 
When asked about the possibility that she'll become a "poster child" for the gay movement, she demurred. "I have always been a strong advocate for equality and equality of opportunity," she said, "and I have been a voice against discrimination, but the fight that is up and center in the United States right now is how do we get our economy back at full throttle." 
While Ms. Baldwin commands the political stage with the ease and political savvy that comes with experience, Val Demings approaches her run for a U.S. House seat in Florida with the bold enthusiasm and optimism of a newcomer. There's nothing studied about her. She's learning as she goes and seems happily challenged by the very thought that she might have a seat in the well of the House.
Her life has evolved in unexpected stages. Up from poverty in central Florida - her mother was a maid, her father a janitor - Ms. Demings, 55, attended Jacksonville's public schools and earned an undergraduate degree at Florida State University and a master's degree from Webster University. 
She began as a social worker and then joined the Orlando police department. "I started off as an officer working patrol and worked my way to the top," she said in a telephone interview.
Five years ago, in 2007, she became the first female police chief in Orlando, running a department of a thousand people, at a time when crime had climbed to record levels and the department's budget had to be trimmed. 
"We were able to do it," she says. "We reduced violent crime by 40 percent and established much better relationships with the community."
Three and a half years later she decided to retire. "When I was sworn in I made a promise to myself that I would retire when my work was done.'' But soon after she made the announcement, she started getting calls from people asking her to consider running for Congress. 
"I thought they were out of their minds," she says with a laugh. "I am not a politician. I'm kind of rough around the edges. I say what I mean and mean what I say. I am a cop!"
But she couldn't resist the challenge. "I made the decision because we've got a mess in Washington," she says. "What I see in Washington is a lot of political games being played."
"I'm a lifelong Democrat, proud of that,'' she says. "But this is not about a particular party or individual. It's about who has the ability to come to the table and make the tough decisions, and that's really my style of leadership."
Running now against a Tea Party incumbent, Ms. Demings, who is married to the sheriff of Orange County and has three grown sons, stays in touch with diverse communities in her predominantly Republican district, riding her motorcycle around town and packing a 9-millimeter pistol in her Dooney & Bourke bag, a farewell gift from her police department.

 0:25 A.M. | Still Debating When Obama Called It Terrorism 
Mr. Romney's senior advisers and surrogates flooding the spin room seemed to have one thing above all else on their minds: to deny that Mr. Obama identified the attack in Benghazi, Libya, early on as terrorism, and to scold Candy Crowley, the debate moderator, for backing up Mr. Obama when he said he did just that in the Rose Garden.
"The idea the president called out a terrorist attack in the Rose Garden - Governor Romney's correct, the president is wrong,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who helped lead a House hearing into the attacks last week.
Mr. Chaffetz came armed with a transcript of the president's spokesman, Jay Carney, stating days later that there was no evidence to back up the claim the attack was preplanned, that it was most likely sparked by an anti-Islamic video.
Tom Ridge, a former Homeland Security secretary under George W. Bush, predicted that the most discussed moment of the debate would be "Candy Crowley's trying to say on behalf of the president, 'Well, you did mention terror.'"
"The fact of the matter is,'' Mr. Ridge said, "the president, his ambassador to the United Nations, his secretary of state and even he himself on multiple occasions talked about that incident as being the consequence of some kind of spontaneous demonstration to that ugly movie."
In the Rose Garden on Sept. 12, one day after the attack, Mr. Obama said, "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."
But others in his administration said for days that the evidence pointed to a spontaneous attack during a demonstration in reaction to the American-made video.
John H. Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, flatly asserted, "The president got caught lying tonight, and he's going to pay a penalty for that."
Democrats strongly disagreed. David Axelrod, the president's top stragetist, said Ms. Crowley's assertion that Mr. Obama "did call it an act of terror" was a highlight of the debate.
"Governor Romney was fact-checked by the moderator when he denied that the president stood in the Rose Garden the day after'' and referred to the attack as terrorism, Mr. Axelrod said.
- Trip Gabriel 
 0:23 A.M. | Fact-Check: Automatic Weapons 
When Mr. Romney was asked about his position on gun control, he erred when he said "We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons." 
While the sale of new fully automatic machine guns to civilians has been outlawed since 1986, older machine guns were grandfathered into the law and can be sold to civilians in certain states. The law, posted on the Web site of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms contains a section called "transfer or possession of machine guns."
It says: "No person shall transfer or possess a machine gun except: (a) A transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the United States, or any department or agency thereof, or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision thereof. (See Part 479 of this chapter); or (b) Any lawful transfer or lawful possession of a machine gun that was lawfully possessed before May 19, 1986 (See Part 479 of this chapter)."
The National Rifle Association wrote in 1999 that the effect of the law had been "to 'freeze' the number of privately owned fully-automatic firearms at roughly 150,000, an exact figure being unavailable due to privacy protection requirements that apply to tax-based laws such as the National Firearms Act."
- Michael Cooper and Michael Luo 
 11:44 P.M. | Fact-Check: Different From Bush? 
When Mr. Romney was asked how he and former President George W. Bush were different, he said they were different people and because the times were different, "my five-point plan is so different than what he would have done." 
But Mr. Romney's five-point plan, which is light on specifics, is an echo of the platform that Mr. Bush ran on in 2000 - energy independence, education, expanded free trade and a get-tough stance toward China, balanced budgets and small business. As Mr. Romney pointed out, Mr. Bush fell short in those areas, for instance by turning balanced budgets of the Clinton era into annual deficits. Still, their campaign platforms are remarkably similar.
- Jackie Calmes 
 11:44 P.M. | Conservatives Criticize Crowley on Libya Comments 
Many conservative commentators quickly trained their sights on a common enemy during the debate: Candy Crowley, the moderator.
Ms. Crowley, they complained, let Mr. Obama speak for longer than Mr. Romney. She fact-checked the Republican without fact-checking the Democrat. And she even told Mr. Romney to take his seat.
One of the lead headlines on the Drudge Report late Tuesday night said, "Candy gives Obama 9 percent more time "
Laura Ingraham, the author and radio host, said on Twitter, "Candy ALWAYS lets Obama blow the clock..." 
But the most serious criticism of Ms. Crowley from the right was focused on her handling of an exchange between the two candidates over Libya and when the president declared the attack on the United States diplomatic mission there a terrorist attack. 
Mr. Romney accused the president of waiting 14 days before he declared it an act of terror. Ms. Crowley responded: "He did call it an act of terror." 
Because Mr. Obama was not direct in his remarks - he initially said of the attack "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation" - Republicans have pounced, saying he blamed a video that mocked Islam. 
Charles Krauthammer, the columnist and Fox News analyst, accused Ms. Crowley of "contaminating" the debate with her intervention. John H. Sununu, a top Romney adviser, said Ms. Crowley "had no business doing a real-time fact check, if you will, because she was dead wrong."
And Ann Coulter Tweeted: "Obama (and Candy) lied, our ambassador died: No, Obama Didn't Call Benghazi "Act of Terror" in Speech."
But what the conservative pundits have not focused on is that Ms. Crowley also fact-checked Mr. Obama in that same breath, saying, "It did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea of there being a riot out there about this tape to come out." She added, addressing Mr. Romney, "You are correct about that."
- Jeremy W. Peters 
 11:30 P.M. | Fact-Check: Middle-Class Struggles 
Mr. Romney used a series of indicators to argue that the middle class has struggled under the Obama administration. It is true that incomes have fallen and some consumer prices have gone up, even as inflation has increased only mildly.
Mr. Romney said that "the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums - up $2,500. Food prices up, utility prices up."
It's true that Americans' incomes have fallen markedly in recent years, by $4,520 from January 2009 to August 2012, according to Sentier Research's analysis of Labor Department data. 
Overall inflation has been pretty mild, however, thanks to the weak economy. Monthly inflation rates have averaged 0.2 percent over the last four years, about what they were in the previous decade, according to the Labor Department.
That said, there are certain categories of consumer products that have shown bigger price increases that might be more salient for people. Food prices have risen about 7 percent since President Obama took office in January 2009. 
Health insurance costs have grown as well. The estimates vary depending on what you are actually measuring and for which population. The average household spent $1,922 on health insurance last year, compared with $1,653 in 2008, an increase of 16.2 percent, according to the Labor Department. The average household spent $3,313 on total health care spending, compared with $2,976 in 2008, an increase of about 10 percent. 
On the other hand, household fuel and utility costs, for example, have risen only about 0.6 percent.

 11:13 P.M. | Fact-Check: Fast and Furious 
Asked for his position on whether to restrict access to assault weapons, Governor Romney brought up Fast and Furious, the botched gun-trafficking case that led to a politically charged oversight investigation by Congress. But Mr. Romney's description of Fast and Furious, and what is known about it, was misleading in certain significant respects. 
Mr. Romney described it as a "program under this administration" under which thousands of weapons "were given to people that ultimately gave them to drug lords" who used them to kill their own people and Americans. He said he could not imagine what its purpose was. He also said that while it had been "investigated to a degree," it was still unclear "how it worked exactly" or "who it was that did this" and "what the idea was behind it." He said the Obama administration had asserted executive privilege to "prevent all the information from coming out."
The operation was exhaustively investigated by the Justice Department's independent inspector general office, which had access to all the disputed documents and which delivered a 471-page report last month that was praised by members of Congress across party lines as comprehensive and fair.
Operation Fast and Furious was an investigation that ran from late 2009 to early 2011 into a gun-trafficking network in Arizona. The ring was using "straw buyers" - front men without criminal records - to purchase weapons in American gun stores and then funneling them to a drug gang in Mexico, which has much stricter gun-control laws. Contrary to Mr. Romney's statement, the network was not given guns; rather agents passively allowed suspects to keep buying guns from gun stores rather than moving swiftly to intervene with straw buyers and seize the weapons at the first opportunity.
This tactic - known as "gunwalking" - was internally controversial within the Phoenix Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives because it posed a risk to public safety and ran counter to agency traditions. But its purpose is not a mystery. The agents held back because they were frustrated with bringing cases against low-level straw buyers, who were easily replaced and whose cases presented certain legal challenges in Arizona.They wanted to identify higher-level criminals in the network in order to dismantle the entire organization.
As a result, however, the straw buyers continued to acquire weapons freely, obtaining hundreds of guns that are presumed to have reached criminal hands. In December 2010, two weapons that had been purchased by one of the suspects early in the investigation were found near the site of a shootout where a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, was killed, as Mr. Romney alluded.
It is also not a mystery who was behind it, and it is somewhat misleading to limit the discussion to the particular operation that took place during the Obama administration. The inspector report concluded that poorly supervised Arizona-based law enforcement officials had developed the gunwalking tactics on their own. It also found that they had used a similar strategy and tactics in an investigation of another Arizona-based gun smuggling network starting in 2006, a case called Operation Wide Receiver. In particular, the report said that William Newell, the special agent in charge of the A.T.F.'s field division in Phoenix at the time of Fast and Furious and part of Wide Receiver, "bore ultimate responsibility for the failures in Operation Fast and Furious." The report also found that the field division had not alerted A.T.F. headquarters about its use of the tactics, and that no one at Justice Department headquarters, under either the Bush or the Obama administrations, had authorized or knew about each operation's tactics at the time they were being used.
Mr. Romney is correct that President Obama asserted executive privilege to shield some Justice Department documents from a Congressional subpoena. The disputed documents do not date from the origins of Fast and Furious, however. They are from after February 2011, by which time the operation was over. The documents - many of which the inspector general quoted from in its report - are e-mails in which officials discussed how to respond to Congressional inquiries and media questions as they struggled to figure out what happened. Mr. Obama has claimed he has a legal right not to comply with the subpoena for them because it would damage the candor of internal executive branch deliberations to allow Congress to compel their disclosure. That dispute is now the subject of a lawsuit filed by Congress.
- Charlie Savage 
 11:15 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney Said Tax Rate Was 'Fair'? 
Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of saying in a "60 Minutes" interview that he believed it was "fair" that he paid a lower tax rate than ordinary workers like bus drivers. Mr. Obama simplified the question Mr. Romney was asked by CBS's Scott Pelley and Mr. Romney's response.
This was the full exchange, which focused on the fairness of the capital gains tax rate:
PELLEY: Now, you made on your investments, personally, about $20 million last year. And you paid 14 percent in federal taxes. That's the capital gains rate. Is that fair to the guy who makes $50,000 and paid a higher rate than you did?
ROMNEY: It is a low rate. And one of the reasons why the capital gains tax rate is lower is because capital has already been taxed once at the corporate level, as high as 35 percent.
PELLEY: So you think it is fair? 
ROMNEY: Yeah, I - I think it's - it's the right way to encourage economic growth, to get people to invest, to start businesses, to put people to work.
- Michael Luo 
 11:08 P.M. | The Reaction: Better for Obama 
"This time, President Obama showed up."
That was the conclusion of the Democratic analyst Joe Trippi on Fox News immediately after Tuesday's debate, echoed by commentators on the Internet and on all the major networks.
Brit Hume, seated next to Mr. Trippi on Fox, said Mr. Obama would "probably be declared the winner on most cards."
Indeed, on ABC, the conservative columnist George Will said, "Barack Obama not only gained ground that he had lost, he cauterized some wounds that he inflicted on himself by seeming too distant and disengaged."
On CNN, the longtime analyst David Gergen said "the night goes to Barack Obama." On MSNBC, the Rev. Al Sharpton credited Mr. Obama with his "best performance of his career as a debater."
"Tonight Mitt Romney was up against a different man," said the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who added that "Democrats will be thrilled."
Republicans tended to call the debate a draw, as the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer did on Twitter at the halfway mark and again after the debate.
"Even GOP not declaring a Romney win," observed the Obama campaign national press secretary Ben LaBolt on Twitter.
As the second hour of the debate began, another former Bush press secretary, Dana Perino, wrote on Twitter, "As everyone predicted, each side will be able to say their candidate did well tonight." She predicted that the mainstream media would say, "Obama stops slide."
Most of the focus afterward was in fact on Mr. Obama, although Ben Smith of Buzzfeed noted, "Romney did, again, come away looking like a guy who could be president, which is probably the most important thing." Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist, said on MSNBC, "I'm not sure that the president's performance is enough to arrest Mitt Romney's momentum in the race."
Either way, there was this observation from Mr. Will on ABC, a compliment to both candidates and to the moderator, Ms. Crowley: "I have seen every presidential debate in American history, since the four of Nixon and Kennedy in 1960. This was immeasurably the best."
- Brian Stelter 
 11:01 P.M. | Fact-Check: Libya Attack Called Act of Terror 
Once Mr. Obama said "Please proceed," it was probably not a good idea for Mr. Romney to proceed.
The issue was Libya, and Mr. Romney took Mr. Obama to task for saying that he had initially called the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi an "act of terror."
"Please proceed," Mr. Obama said, smirking.
Mr. Romney, apparently not aware that he was walking into a trap, plowed ahead.
"Is that what you're saying?" he asked, pressing his point.
Mr. Obama smirked again. "Please proceed, Governor."
Mr. Romney kept on, until the moderator, Ms. Crowley, intervened. "He did, in fact, sir."
And so he did. The day after the attack in Libya, Mr. Obama, in the Rose Garden, said: "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for."
 Correction: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that Mr. Obama did not not call the attack an "act of terror" in the weeks after the event. Mr. Obama did refer to it using that language again in the days after his initial statement. 
- Helene Cooper 
 11:02 P.M. | Voters' Voices: An Informed Assessment 
LARGO, Fla. - If undecided voters are often also "low information voters," then the independents here Tuesday night would certainly fall into the category of high information voters. Three are retirees who spend a lot of their time reading news. And Mr. Nystrom, the waiter, is a close follower of economic data across the states because he is hoping to leave Florida for a better job. He has a college degree in technology, and he has not been able to use it around Largo.
As such, these viewers have as many answers as the candidates, and they suggested that the answers the candidates provided actually open a host of new questions that, for now, will go unanswered. They did not watch this debate passively. They were active participants.
On the issue of trade with China, for instance, Mr. Bach, Ms. Siegrist, Mr. Nystrom and Mr. Fechko had so much to say, they drowned out the television for a moment.
"China is never 
"Romney doesn't .
"Guys, guys!"
"Quiet."
Then came the concluding statements.
"The last question was the best part of the debate for the president," Mr. Bach said. "He came out strong. He turned the debate of two weeks ago totally around. There was no comparison. He brought out his passion and his experience and his concern. Romney played defense a lot of the night."
Romney was faulted for reversing himself too much.
"I've watched 20 of the 22 Republican debates and I don't like that Romney has positions now that he did not have previously," Mr. Fechko said, listing issues such as abortion, immigration and taxes.
But Mr. Obama was also faulted for his "wishy-washy" position on gun control and because his statement on the attack in Libya seemed weak.
The group did not like the terms winner and loser, but the consensus seems to be this:
"If people are using the debates only as their guide as to how they will vote, then Obama certainly helped himself tonight," Mr. Fechko said.
- Susan Saulny 
 10:54 P.M. | Fact-Check: U.S. Military Spending at 4% of G.D.P. 
In a rapid-fire exchange on dueling tax rate plans, Mr. Obama said Mr. Romney wanted to give tax breaks to the wealthy - which he said would decreases government revenue, but then add large sums to the military budget, as well. Like all statistics, these on military spending can be viewed from different angles to offer different perspectives.
"Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military's not asking for them," Mr. Obama said.
In the previous debate, of the vice presidential candidates, Mr. Romney's running mate, Paul D. Ryan, denied that the Republicans proposed to increase military spending more than $2 trillion over a decade. But the Pentagon would need $2.3 trillion more than is projected through fiscal year 2022 at current spending levels, adjusted for inflation.
That is because military spending as a share of the economy's total output is expected to dip below 4 percent of the gross domestic product later in the decade. To keep it at that level would require the additional spending. The drop in military budgets as a share of G.D.P. is due less to any reductions for the Pentagon and more to the fact that a growing piece of the federal budget pie is being consumed by spending for entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security as more baby boomers reach retirement age.
To be sure, Mr. Romney has vowed to spend at least 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product on national defense. In setting that goal, he has lots of company: Mr. Obama's first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, also urged early in his tenure that military spending never drop below 4 percent of the gross domestic product.
Yet both Admiral Mullen and the defense secretary with whom he worked the most, Robert M. Gates, also came to realize that the nationwide economic downturn meant that the fire hose of money flowing to the Pentagon after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was no longer sustainable. Both Admiral Mullen and Mr. Gates then pushed ahead with a sweeping series of defense spending adjustments, including canceling or slowing some weapons programs, shrinking the size of the military's personnel rosters and slimming the civilian bureaucracy. Those cuts have been taken ever deeper under Mr. Obama's current defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta.
Regardless of who is the next president, he will have to shape his military budgets based on two realities: the nation's economic condition - and a Congress that carries out its own agenda on defense.
The wars of today are fought differently, with different weapons that offer more bang for the buck than earlier generations. And today's national security environment requires a different size force.
Since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, the military's roster has shrunk. Remember those (expensive) heavy armored divisions standing watch across the Fulda Gap in Germany to deter the Soviet Army? Gone. The arsenal of bombers, attack jets, warships and nuclear warheads has diminished, as well, as the White House and Pentagon tried to fit defense dollars to the changing national security environment.
And the public's representatives in Congress, where the budgets must be approved, have made clear that there is no appetite for paying the tab for a large standing military sized to the needs of 1970. After all, personnel costs are the largest part of the Pentagon budget.
Defense Department spending doubled in the decade since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but deficit-reduction measures urged by both Democrats and Republicans have forced the Defense Department to reduce budget proposals for the next decade.
To hit those deficit-reduction targets, the Obama administration has offered more than $450 billion in cuts that would reduce the military budget by roughly 7 percent or 8 percent over the next 10 years, even beyond the spending reductions that are expected to come naturally from the withdrawals first from Iraq and from Afghanistan.
The Obama White House and the Pentagon are joined at the hip in urging Congress to reach a budget deal that would avert even deeper cuts in military spending in a process of across-the-board reductions call sequestration.

 10:55 P.M. | Fact-Check: Broken Promise on Immigration Reform? 
"Now, when the president ran for office," Mitt Romney said, "he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation - he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our - our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didn't do it." Mr. Romney is right about that, and some Latino voters have been disappointed.
President Obama made the promise, particularly to Latinos, during the summer of 2008. In an interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision, the Spanish-language network, he said, "What I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year, an immigration bill that I strongly support."
When he has come under attack from Mr. Romney during the campaign for failing on that promise, Mr. Obama has largely blamed Republicans. At a new encounter with Mr. Ramos at a town hall meeting in Miami last month, Mr. Obama said he had not anticipated that Republicans who previously supported reform "suddenly would walk away."
One measure of Mr. Obama's efforts was the attempt in December 2010 to pass the Dream Act, a bill that would give legal status to at least 1.2 million young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when they were children. After an intense campaign by the White House, the bill passed the House of Representatives. In the Senate, it failed - by five votes - to gain the 60 votes needed to go to the floor. Five Democrats voted against the bill. But all Republicans but three voted against it, including many who had supported it in the past, giving the president grounds to say the Dream Act was "blocked by Republicans."
Last month in Miami, Mr. Obama said his lack of progress on immigration legislation was "my biggest failure so far." With no prospect of passing legislation in Congress, Mr. Obama used executive authority in June to offer reprieves from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants.

 10:49 P.M. | Fact-Check: Employing Women in Massachusetts 
Mr. Romney said that as governor, he employed more women in senior state government positions than did any other state administration, but there have been conflicting reports as to whether that is the case.
A 2004 study by the University of Albany Center for Women in Government and Civil Society supported that contention; according to that study, 50 percent of Massachusetts policy-making posts were held by women in 2003, compared with an average of 32 percent for state governments as a whole. But Factcheck.org, of the Annenberg Center on Public Policy, took a different position: over Mr. Romney's four years as governor, it stated, 31 percent of all appointments were women. And the share of women named to senior-level posts actually declined slightly, to 27.6 percent, it said. The organization said that a Romney administration work force official "cherry-picked statistics to make Romney's record on appointing women to government positions look better than it is."
- Michael Wines 
 10:45 P.M. | Fact-Check: Fewer Women Have Jobs? 
Governor Romney criticized President Obama's economic performance by saying that fewer women have jobs than four years ago. But that is not correct, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Romney said: "In the last four years, women have lost 580,000 jobs. That's the net of what's happened in the last four years." But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 253,000 more women working in the United States than was the case in January 2009, when President Obama took office. According to the B.L.S., there were 67,222,000 women working this September, while the bureau said there were 66,969,000 women working in January 2009.

 10:43 P.M. | Fact-Check: Calling China a Currency Manipulator 
Mr. Romney said that China had been artificially holding down the value of its currency for years and that President Obama had passed up the opportunity to label China as a currency manipulator. Though the Obama administration has never named China as a currency manipulator, no other administration since 1994 has.
Every six months, the Treasury Department issues a report in which it can identify nations as currency manipulators. The Obama administration has never named China as a currency manipulator. Nor has any administration since 1994, opting instead for behind-the-scenes pressure that has prodded China to let its currency, the renminbi, rise. 
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent against the dollar, according to a July report by the International Monetary Fund that revised the renminbi's status from "substantially" to "moderately undervalued." Mr. Romney's advisers have said that China has more recently intervened to weaken the currency. But Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment, says that while the renminbi has fallen by 1 percent since February, the fall is a result of capital flight, not government intervention.
Even if the United States formally identified China as a currency manipulator, that in itself would only trigger bilateral consultations. Economists point out that the United States and China are already negotiating over the renminbi's value - and have been for many years. Mr. Romney has promised that if China does not compromise, he will follow up by instructing the Commerce Department to impose countervailing duties on Chinese imports on a case-by-case basis. Economists warn that that might trigger a trade war with China in which both sides lose.
- Sharon LaFraniere 
 10:39 P.M. | Fact-Check: Manufacturing Jobs 
Toward the end of the debate, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama had a spirited back and forth on exports and manufacturing jobs. Mr. Obama has campaigned on his record of bringing back manufacturing jobs to America, but Mr. Romney has argued that manufacturing jobs have shrunk on Mr. Obama's watch.
Both candidates have a point.
Manufacturers have about 610,000 fewer employees on payroll than they did when Mr. Obama took office. But Mr. Obama took over when the economy was still in free fall, months before the worst recession since the Great Depression ended and months more before employers felt confident in adding workers. Manufacturing firms started adding jobs in mid-2010, and have added about 400,000 positions since then.
Mr. Obama has furthermore promised to create one million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years. How realistic is the goal? It could certainly happen. Manufacturing employers would need to add about 21,000 workers per month for the next four years. In the past year, they have added about 14,500 new workers a month.
Even if the economy added those million manufacturing jobs, though, it would not imply that manufacturing has really recovered as a jobs powerhouse, or ever will. By the end of 2016, Mr. Obama wants there to be about 13 million manufacturing jobs in America. That is about the same number of manufacturing jobs there were when he won election in 2008.

 10:40 P.M. | Before Debate Ends, Spinning Begins 
And here they come! Even before the debate had ended, the spinners had flooded the zone of the press filing center. The Democrats arrived first, with blue signs proclaiming Axelrod, Schumer, Psaki and Kerry. They were quickly swarmed by the gentlemen and ladies of the press. A few minutes later came an influx of red signs with Republicans: Sununu, Jindal and Chaffetz. First the two teams were on opposite sides of the room, but now blue and red are intermingling. 
Is there still a debate going on?

 10:37 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney on the Dream Act 
"Now, Governor Romney just said that, you know, he wants to help those young people, too," President Obama said, referring to young undocumented immigrants. "But during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the Dream Act that would allow these young people to have a chance." Since the primaries, Mitt Romney has softened his position on the Dream Act, a bill that would give legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. But not by much.
Mr. Romney did say during the primaries that he would veto the Dream Act, a measure supported mainly by Democrats that has long been stalled in Congress. In June, Mr. Romney shifted his position to say he would support giving legal resident green cards to "illegal immigrants who served in our military" - one group who would be eligible under the Dream Act.
In a town hall meeting last month in Miami with Univision, the Spanish-language network, Mr. Romney said he would also consider giving green cards to "kids that get higher education," echoing another part of the Dream Act. But Mr. Romney said he preferred the approach of Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who started work last spring on an alternative to the Democrats' bill.
However, few details are known of Mr. Rubio's proposal, because he never offered a written blueprint. In June, after President Obama announced he would give temporary reprieves from deportation to young immigrants - in part to upstage Mr. Rubio - the senator set aside his efforts.
Under the Dream Act, by independent estimates at least 1.2 million young undocumented immigrants could be eligible for legal status.
- Julia Preston 
 10:35 P.M. | Fact-Check: Daylight on Israel? 
Mr. Romney said that "the president said that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel." Is he correct?
Mr. Romney's campaign cites a newspaper account of a meeting with Jewish leaders at the White House in 2009 as evidence for Mr. Romney's statement. In that account, published in The Washington Post, people at the meeting said Mr. Obama had said that "there was no space between us and Israel" during the George W. Bush administration, which he said had hurt the ability of the United States to influence Israeli actions or cajole Arab nations. "When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states," the newspaper quoted Mr. Obama as saying.
An Obama administration official said they did not know whether Mr. Obama made that statement during what was a private meeting.
The newspaper account did not quote Mr. Obama as explicitly stating that his goal was to put distance between the United States and Israel, as Mr. Romney characterized Mr. Obama's intentions during a recent speech. Instead, the account indicates Mr. Obama was complaining that what he suggested was the Bush administration's unwillingness to challenge the Israelis had reduced the American government's leverage over Israel and hurt its reputation with Muslim countries. At the same time, a plain reading of the account would also suggest that Mr. Obama wanted for his administration to be seen as less of a rubber stamp for Israel than the Bush administration was.
Obama administration officials have said that there is no daylight whatsoever between the United States and Israel on the issue of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
A broader question is how much "daylight" there has been between the two countries since Mr. Obama took office. Mr. Obama angered some Israeli leaders, like Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, by publicly stating that Israel's 1967 borders adjusted though land swaps should be the starting point for settlement negotiations with the Palestinians, and by pushing Israel to curb settlement construction in the West Bank.
But many experts are puzzled by the Romney camp's claim that Mr. Obama has been weak on Israel, saying the opposite is actually true. Even Israel's own defense minister - and former prime minister - Ehud Barak has repeatedly and enthusiastically praised Mr. Obama's support, telling CNN in July: "I should tell you honestly that this administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can remember in the past." Other experts cite Mr. Obama's extensive military aid to Israel, as well as his unwavering opposition at the United Nations to Palestinian statehood.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 10:35 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney on Immigration 
What is Mr. Romney's strategy on illegal immigration? His positions have varied over the past year, but he says he opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants in most cases.
President Obama said that Mitt Romney's "main strategy" to curb illegal immigration would be to "encourage self-deportation."
Mr. Romney has never precisely clarified what he would do about more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. During the Republican primaries he called for tough enforcement to pressure them to leave the country. Since June he has moderated that position, saying he could support some measures that would allow a limited group of illegal immigrants to remain here legally.
Mr. Romney says he opposes any amnesty. During a primary debate in January, he said he would seek a mandatory nationwide program to verify the legal status of all new hires, expanding an existing federal program known as E-Verify, which currently is voluntary. With that program in place, he said, illegal immigrants would soon discover they could not get jobs and "they're going to self-deport."
Mr. Romney was pressed for more details on the self-deportation strategy during a town hall meeting last month in Miami with Univision, the Spanish language network. But he did not provide them. "I believe people make their own choices as to whether they want to go home," he said.
But he said he would not favor "a mass deportation effort, rounding people up, 12 million people." Mr. Romney said, "Our system is not to deport people."
He has said he would support giving permanent resident green cards to illegal immigrants who serve in the military - probably a group numbering tens of thousands. Mr. Romney has said he would "put in place a permanent solution" for illegal immigration, but he has not described what it would look like or how he would get around the roadblocks in Congress that stalled President Obama's efforts to pass legislation. Most Republican lawmakers in Washington have rejected any legal status for illegal immigrants, calling it amnesty.

 10:31 P.M. | Fact-Check: 'Pioneers of Outsourcing?' 
Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of investing in companies that were pioneers in outsourcing to China. Is this true?
This is a tweak of a long-running attack line the Obama campaign has used against Mr. Romney, based on investments made by the private equity firm he founded, Bain Capital. This time Mr. Obama softened the blow by accusing Mr. Romney of merely investing in the companies, as opposed to being more directly involved in those outsourcing decisions.
Fact-checkers, including Politifact.com, FactCheck.org and the Washington Post's Fact Checker column, had questioned the more direct line of attack on outsourcing, because most of the companies cited by the Obama campaign were investments that occurred after Mr. Romney had left day-to-day management of Bain in 1999 to run the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Mr. Romney was indisputably involved with at least one Bain-owned company that outsourced jobs overseas - to China, in particular - Holson Burnes Group, a picture frame and photo album manufacturer that Bain owned from 1987 to 1995. 
But FactCheck.org, which examined the issue, pointed out that it was unclear whether the company's outsourcing increased or decreased under Bain, or if the manufacturing overseas came at the expense of American jobs.
The question of whether Bain Capital ever invested in such companies, with Mr. Romney benefiting as an investor, is a much less controversial one. Several of Bain's investments did have operations in China, although it would be a stretch to call them "pioneers" in the practice.
It is also important to point out that since 2002, when he was elected governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney's investments have been managed through an independent trustee.

 10:31 P.M. | Obama Takes Responsibility on Libya Security 
One question heading into the debate: how would the president handle Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's acceptance of responsibility for the violence in Libya?
His decision was to embrace the responsibility.
"Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job," he said. "But she works for me."
He also was aggressive in pushing back against Mr. Romney's accusation that his administration has played politics in the aftermath of the killings of four Americans in Libya.
Looking straight at Mr. Romney, he said: "The suggestion that anybody on my team, the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team, would play politics or mislead, when we've lost four of our own, is offensive, Governor."

 10:29 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Blame and Evasion 
LARGO, Fla. - On the issue of the recent attack on American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, Mr. Romney is criticizing the president.
"I'm waiting for him to say it was the president's fault, which it seems he is hinting at," Mr. Bach said.
Mr. Romney was critical of Mr. Obama for taking many days to acknowledge that the attack was terrorism.
But when Ms. Crowley supported the president's assertion that he called the attack an act of terror in the Rose Garden on the day after it happened, Mr. Bach said, "That's right, no distortions tonight, my friend!" 
It seems clear by now that Mr. Bach is leaning toward favoring the president. But he is not completely on board.
When the question turned to gun control and Mr. Obama began a long anecdote, Mr. Bach spoke loudly toward the television: "O.K., O.K. What's your policy, sir? Answer!"
"He broached it but didn't answer it completely," Mr. Bach said.
Mr. Nystrom added: "It's such a tough issue. It's like a lost cause."
Mr. Fechko said: "You could see Obama sort of dancing around it, because he knows he can't come flat out for gun control in the current environment."

 10:26 P.M. | Romney and Obama Spar Over Terrorism Label 
Mr. Obama had the look of a man who was watching his rival walk right into a trap.
The president had just said that he declared the killings in Libya to be an act of terror the day after the attack.
Mr. Romney started to correct the president, saying that he wanted to get that on the record. He turned to the president, asking for him to say it again.
"Continue, Governor," Mr. Obama said, looking confident.
Mr. Romney again accused the president of waiting 14 days before he declared the incidents in Libya to be the work of terrorists.
"Check the transcript," Mr. Obama said.
And then Ms. Crowley, the moderator, piped up.
"He did call it an act of terror," Ms. Crowley said.
"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?" Mr. Obama said.

 10:24 P.M. | Fact-Check: Terrorism and Security in Libya 
The Obama administration has drawn criticism for shifting assessments of what really happened in Benghazi, Libya, and for questions of security at the diplomatic mission there.
Asked who had denied added security that was requested for embassies in Libya, Mr. Obama did not directly answer, although he did say, "I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there." Mr. Romney questioned why "it took a long time" for the facts to come out.
The Obama administration has come under fire for shifting assessments of what really happened in Benghazi - and what happened before Benghazi.
The administration initially described the attack on the diplomatic post as a spontaneous outgrowth of protests against an anti-Islam video made in the United States. Days later, officials termed it a terrorist attack planned by Islamic extremists and dropped references to any protest.
Journalistic reporting from Libya indicates that the video was a motivating factor for many who participated in the attack but there was no protest; the assailants have been described as members of Ansar al-Shariah-Benghazi, a local Islamist extremist group that shares ideological commonalities with al Qaeda but not its international aspirations and has not been shown to have direct organizational ties.
Americans on the ground sounded increasing alarms about the dicey security situation in the months leading up to the attack, and two security officials testified before Congress last week that they sought to keep more security personnel for Libya but were turned down by the State Department in Washington.
 
 The requests were for more guards in Tripoli, rather than in Benghazi, and State Department officials testified that they would not have stopped the attack even if the requests had been approved. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at last week's debate that the White House was not made aware of those requests.
The Obama team has hit back at Republican critics by claiming that House Republicans cut $300 million from embassy security. Congress did make relatively small cuts after Republicans took control in the 2010 elections. For the current fiscal year, House Republicans voted to increase spending on diplomatic security by about $250 million, still about $220 million less than Mr. Obama requested. A State Department official testified that security decisions in Libya were not affected by budget constraints.
- Peter Baker 
 10:21 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney and Arizona Immigration Law 
Mitt Romney's statements about immigration measures in Arizona have been widely misquoted by Democrats - and were misquoted again Tuesday night by President Obama - to make it appear he embraced as his "model" a tough and polarizing police enforcement law in that state.
It is true that Mr. Romney has spoken favorably of Arizona's police law, known as S.B. 1070. He defended the state's decision to pass it and he criticized President Obama for bringing a lawsuit to try to stop it. But what Mr. Romney calls his model is a less controversial law that made it mandatory for Arizona employers to use a federal electronic verification system, known as E-Verify, to check the immigration status of new hires.
"What I like about the Arizona law was a measure that says we're going to have an employment verification system so that employers know who they're able to hire and who they're not able to hire," Mr. Romney said last month, speaking to a Latino audience in a televised town hall meeting in Miami.
President Obama is right that Mr. Romney embraced some immigration hard-liners early in the campaign. During the primaries Mr. Romney welcomed the endorsement of Kris Kobach, a conservative lawyer who is now secretary of state of Kansas, and who was an author of Arizona's police law. He has also provided templates for tough immigration enforcement bills in many other states. Mr. Kobach's law-and-order views are regarded as extreme by many Latino and immigrant rights groups. More recently Mr. Romney has played down the role of Mr. Kobach in his campaign.
By the way, President Obama also supports mandatory worker verification, but only as part of a package that includes legal status and work authorization for millions of illegal immigrants.
- Julia Preston 
 10:20 P.M. | Fact-Check: Contraceptive Coverage 
Mr. Obama mentioned a provision of his signature health care law that requires most insurance plans offered by employers to provide free birth control. Mr. Romney, he said, opposes the requirement and believes that "employers should be able to make the decision" as to whether their female workers get contraceptive coverage.
Mr. Obama was correct: Mr. Romney is against the requirement, which he has described as an attack on religious liberty Mr. Romney has said he would abolish the requirement.
Churches were exempt from the requirement when theObama administrationannounced it last year. Still, it provoked furious criticism from Roman Catholic institutions and other religious and conservative groups, who called the exemption too narrow.
In February, the administration offered what Mr. Obama described as "an accommodation" for church-affiliated schools, universities, hospitals and charities that object to the requirement. Under that plan, which has yet to be finalized, such institutions would not have to "pay for, provide or facilitate the provision of" contraceptive coverage. But their female employees could get such coverage directly from their insurance companies at no cost.
Roman Catholic bishops and other conservatives were not appeased by the compromise proposal. One of their concerns is that some religiously affiliated organizations choose to insure themselves. They also say it is impossible to guarantee that the premiums paid by objecting organizations for their employees' overall medical coverage would not help finance birth control.
Mr. Romney supported a Republican effort, known as the Blunt amendment, that would have let any employer or insurance company deny coverage for contraceptives and other items they objected to on religious or moral grounds. But the Senate in March narrowly voted to kill the effort.
Opponents have filed at least 35 lawsuits around the country seeking to have the contraception requirement overturned.

 10:15 P.M. | Fact-Check: Tariff on Chinese Tires 
President Obama said, "We had to make sure that China was not flooding our market with cheap tires" and therefore took action to save 1,000 jobs. It is true that in 2009, the Obama administration imposed a duty on Chinese tires, but last month the administration let the tariff expire.
The United Steelworkers Union, an Obama political supporter, sought the action, and many economists criticized it as politically motivated.
A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariff protected at most 1,200 American jobs. But last year alone. the institute found, it cost American consumers $1.1 billion in higher-priced tires.
Moreover, China responded by imposing tariffs on imports of American chicken parts that cost American poultry producers an estimated $1 billion. Last month, the Obama administration quietly let the tire tariff expire. Critics say that it recognized the economic costs of the sanction were too great.

 10:14 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Better Off, or Worse? 
LARGO, Fla. - Will the next four years be like the last four years? And has Mr. Obama kept his promises? An unenthusiastic audience member who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 wanted to know.
Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Obama's policies had crushed the middle class, but Mr. Obama stated a list of his accomplishments, what he called promises kept, including killing Osama bin Laden and passing health care reform.
"The question, are you better off?'' Mr. Bach said. "Nobody's asking, 'Are you worse off than four years ago?' That's what I want to know." 
Ms. Siegrist, who is taking notes on a legal pad with a pencil, interjected: "Well, there are an awful lot of poor people. The numbers keep multiplying."
The topic turned to immigration.
Now Mr. Bach is furiously scribbling on his notepad as Mr. Obama describes the Dream Act.
"We have a prime example in Florida of what Obama is talking about, a high school valedictorian who finished at the top of his law class and can't get a license because he's illegal," Mr. Bach said.
After a tense exchange between the candidates about overseas investments that diverted significantly from the topic of immigration, Mr. Nystrom asked: "Did the moderator just ask them to sit down? What's going on?"

 10:14 P.M. | Fact-Check: Doubling the Deficit? 
Mr. Romney just repeated the false charge - which he also made during the first debate - that Mr. Obama has doubled the deficit.
"He said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half," Mr. Romney said of Mr. Obama on Tuesday night. "Instead he's doubled it."
The just announced that the federal budget deficit was about $1.1 trillion in 2012, approximately $200 billion less than the shortfall recorded in 2011. Measured as a share of the economy, as economists prefer, the deficit has declined more significantly - to 7.0 percent of the economy's total output in 2012 from 10.1 percent in 2009.
- Michael Cooper 
 10:12 P.M. | Fact-Check: Obama Unemployment Promises? 
Mr. Romney charged that Mr. Obama promised the unemployment rate would be 5.4 percent by now. (It is currently 7.8 percent.) This is an old canard based on a report released before Mr. Obama even took the oath of office. 
Two economists with the incoming administration, Jared Bernstein and Christina Romer, ran some numbers estimating the job creation potential of a stimulus bill to arrest the economy's free fall. They forecast that if such a bill were enacted, unemployment would never rise above 8 percent and would fall to about 5.4 percent by now.
But that was a projection made before economists really understood the severity of the recession, the historic plunge in output and huge job losses. Moreover, it was a projection by White House economists, not a promise Mr. Obama made.

 10:10 P.M. | Fact-Check: Changes in Romney Tax Policy? 
Has Mr. Romney's position on tax cuts for the wealthy changed? While he said here that "I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people," this is a shift from his statements during the Republican primary race.
Mr. Romney said Tuesday night that "I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people" - which, as Mr. Obama noted, is a change from how he described his tax plans during the Republican primaries.
At a Republican primary debate this winter, when Rick Santorum charged that Mr. Romney might raise taxes on "the top 1 percent," Mr. Romney countered, "We're going to cut taxes on everyone across the country by 20 percent, including the top 1 percent."
Mr. Obama noted the change Tuesday night. "And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said, 'I'm going to give tax cuts' - he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said 'tax cuts to everybody,' including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history," Mr. Obama said.

 Mr. Romney just landed on what is the strongest argument any challenger running against an incumbent, particularly an incumbent in charge during difficult times. He ran through a list of statistics showing the extent to which the economy has struggled under Mr. Obama and offered a compliment that would have sounded discordant at the last debate: That Mr. Obama is a great speaker.
 But, he added, "We have a record to look at."
- Adam Nagourney 
 10:02 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney Investment in Chinese Company 
President Obama said Mr. Romney invested in a Chinese company that conducted video surveillance on citizens. Is that correct?
The investment was actually made through a fund managed by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mr. Romney founded and ran until 2001. Mr. Romney has as much as $2.25 million invested in three Bain Capital funds with sizable stakes in at least seven Chinese companies,including an electronics retailer accused of selling computers with pirated Microsoft software. He has millions more invested in Bain funds that control an auto parts company that is closing a United States factory and moving equipment and jobs to China.
Mr. Romney says his fortune is managed by a blind trust over which he has no control. However, the trust, managed by a law firm that also works for Bain Capital, would most likely not meet federal requirements for independent management should he become president because of the close relationship between the law firm, Mr. Romney and Bain.

 10:03 P.M. | Obama Attacks Romney on Contraception 
Mr. Obama aggressively raised the issue of contraception - an issue that he all but ignored at the first debate with Mr. Romney.
Focusing on the impact of Mr. Romney's policies on women - and with an eye, no doubt, on the all-important women's vote - Mr. Obama accused him of doing harm to women and families.
"A major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care decisions" for women, Mr. Obama said.
He accused Mr. Romney of wanting to eliminate financing for Planned Parenthood and of opposing the policies that make contraceptives affordable.
"These are not just women's issues; these are family issues. These are economic issues," Mr. Obama said. "I've got two daughters, and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anyone's sons have."
When he got the chance, Mr. Romney accused the president of distorting his proposals.
"I just note that I don't believe bureaucrats in Washington" should control health care decisions for women, he said. "Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives."

Twitter, the social network of choice among political reporters, pundits and those who love them, is also the new spin room - and it saw a tremendous reaction to President Obama and Mitt Romney's first few answers to voter questions about jobs and energy.
The first questioner, a college student named Jeremy, was quickly christened the new "Joe the Plumber" - a reference to the Ohio man who asked Mr. Obama about taxes during a campaign stop in 2008 and became a metaphor for the middle class. The candidates' heated exchange a few minutes later was accompanied by one-word reactions - "wow" chief among them.
The social network was a virtual spin room, one used especially aggressively by surrogates for Mr. Obama to assert that he had improved since the debate two weeks ago, when his performance was widely derided.
A few minutes into the debate Stephanie Cutter, the Obama deputy campaign manager, reposted a comment from a supporter who said, "Welcome back, Mr. President." Then she reposted another: "Obama is back."
Commentators who had criticized Mr. Obama two weeks ago - most notably Andrew Sullivan of The Daily Beast - seemed to agree.
"Obama's back on," Mr. Sullivan wrote on his live blog at 9:07 p.m. "I recognize this guy. Energy; focus; ability to relate."
Obama campaign aides also promoted a hashtag with the phrase #RealRomney, pushing the point of view that Mr. Romney's real opinions are unknowable - foreshadowing Mr. Obama's claims that Mr. Romney's answers on Tuesday night were not accurate.

 10:00 P.M. | Fact-Check: Candidates on Coal 
President Obama said that coal jobs and coal production was up. True, but the increases are modest.
Mr. Romney said that Mr. Obama was hostile to coal and that the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency had said that no future coal-burning plants would be built in the United States. In fact, the administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, proposed emissions standards for future coal-burning plants that would require them to be as clean as a plant using natural gas as a fuel. The technology to accomplish this does not yet exist, but utilities are swiftly shifting from coal to natural gas anyway because natural gas is now so plentiful and cheap.
Mr. Obama said that coal jobs and coal production were up during his administration, which is true, but the increases are modest and much of the additional coal production is being shipped overseas.
Mr. Obama also noted that as governor of Massachusetts Mr. Romney had cracked down on one coal-burning plant, saying that coal "kills people." Mr. Romney did in fact accuse a utility of failing to live up to its promises to clean up emissions from one Massachusetts coal plant, saying, "I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people. And that plant kills people and PG&E has been given a notice to have it cleaned up by 2004 and they have thumbed their nose at the people of Massachusetts and Salem Harbor by not cleaning it up on time. "

 10:00 P.M. | Romney Stresses Moderate Positions on Reproduction 
Mitt Romney's campaign, in an effort to appeal to women who hold more moderate views on reproductive issues, is releasing a new commercial that highlights his support for contraception and abortion in limited circumstances.
"You know, those ads say Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme, so I looked into it," says a woman identified as Sarah Minto, who is shown on camera searching on Google for "Romney on abortion."
Ms. Minto adds: "It turns out Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all. In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life."
The ad is Mr. Romney's most aggressive attempt to rebut attempts by the Obama campaign to paint him as extreme on women's rights. Read more...

 9:58 P.M. | Romney Distances Himself From Bush 
Mr. Romney pretty much threw President Geoge W. Bush under the bus.
Among the things he said about Mr. Bush:
* That he didn't crack down on Chinese trade practices.
* That he increased the deficit.
* That he didn't balance the budget.
* That he didn't increase trade with Latin America.
* That he didn't focus on small business.
"President Bush and I are different people," he said. "President Bush had a very different path for a very different time."

 9:56 P.M. | Fact-Check: Spending, Borrowing and Higher Taxes? 
Mr. Romney just charged that "a recent study has shown that people in the middle class will see $4,000 a year higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration" - a claim that FactCheck.org recently examined and labeled "nonsense."
The figure is derived from a study by the American Enterprise Institute that attempts to calculate "the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income." A blogger with the institute laterwrote that the results "could mean a $4,000 a year middle-class tax hike."
- Michael Cooper 
 9:50 P.M. | Fact-Check: Oil and Gas Drilling 
Mr. Romney repeated his assertion that all the increase in domestic oil and gas production had come on private, not public lands, and that the Obama administration had cut the number of oil and gas drilling permits on public lands in half. Neither assertion is fully true.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama engaged in a sharp exchange on energy policy, sparked by a question on gasoline prices that never got answered. They disagreed about oil production on public as well as private lands, a dispute they have had throughout the campaign.
Oil and gas production on public lands has fluctuated during the Obama administration, but it has increased modestly (about 13 percent for oil and about 6 percent for gas) in the first three years of the Obama presidency, compared to the last three years of the Bush administration, according to an analysis from the Energy Information Administration. Production on private lands has increased more quickly, particularly through hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas in Texas, North Dakota and the Marcellus Shale formation in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
Regarding drilling permits, the Department of Interior produced a report earlier this year showing that drilling permits received and issued by the agency had indeed declined from the last years of the Bush administration to the first years of the Obama administration. In fiscal year 2007, the government issued 8,964 permits to drill on public lands; in 2008 the figure was 7,846. The numbers for 2009 and 2010 were 5,306 and 5,237. This is a reduction, but not by half, as Mr. Romney asserted.
Mr. Obama said here that 7,000 permits had been granted but were not being used by oil companies, an accurate figure, according to the Interior Department.
The administration froze all deep-water drilling and slowed shallow-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon blowout and spill in 2010. Since then, the Interior Department has approved more than 750 drilling permits for the gulf and production is approaching pre-spill levels, although it is below what was projected before the accident.
Before Deepwater Horizon, gulf oil production was 1.75 million barrels a day, and it was projected to increase to 2.2 million barrels a day by this year.
Instead, because of the yearlong halt on new drilling, production is about 700,000 barrels a day lower than forecast. Much of that oil is being replaced by Saudi imports, experts said.
Mr. Obama stated that renewable energy production had doubled during his presidency, which is true, and that oil imports were at their lowest level in 16 years, also accurate. He also said that the boom in natural gas production could produce 600,000 new jobs, a highly optimistic estimate, but he qualified it with the word "potentially."
But Mr. Obama mischaracterized Mr. Romney's energy plan, saying it was written by oil companies and favored only traditional sources of energy - oil, gas and coal. But Mr. Romney's energy plan does include a place for renewables, although he would sharply cut back on federal subsidies for wind, solar and other alternative energy sources.
Mr. Romney, to illustrate his charge that Mr. Obama was hostile to the oil industry, said that the Obama administration had criminally prosecuted oil companies working in North Dakota for killing migratory birds. True. In September 2011, the United States attorney for North Dakota charged seven oil and natural gas companies for killing 28 migratory birds found dead near oil waste lagoons.

 9:50 P.M. | Voters' Voices: The Peanut Gallery Speaks 
LARGO, Fla. - When the topic turned to Mr. Romney's tax plan - and Mr. Romney said, "I'm not looking to cut taxes on wealthy people" - Mr. Obama's comeback answers drew kudos.
"The president seems much more comfortable now, speaking on knowledge and experience now, not on the script," Mr. Bach said.
Speaking about the Romney tax plan, Mr. Obama said, "Nobody who looks at it, who's serious, thinks it adds up."
The crowd here said, "Details, details!" 
But just as quickly, the candidates and the moderator began speaking over each other and the viewers said, "Quiet!"

 9:48 P.M. | Fact-Check: Balancing the Budget 
Mr. Romney correctly stated that he produced a balanced budget during each of his four years in office. But that's hardly unusual: every governor does it. The Massachusetts constitution requires that the budget be balanced. 
- Michael Wines 
 9:46 P.M. | Fact-Check: No Tax Increases? 
Can Mr. Romney keep his promise not to increase taxes on working-class families? Studies show that is a promise that might be hard for him to keep.
"I will not under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class," Mr. Romney promised at the debate, taking aim at Democratic arguments that he would raise taxes on working-class families to finance tax cuts for the rich.
But studies show that is a promise that might be hard for Mr. Romney to keep. Mr. Romney has said he wants to get rid of the alternative minimum tax and cut marginal tax rates by 20 percent, without widening the deficit. He would accomplish that goal by clearing out the underbrush of credits, loopholes and preferences in the code, though not those for investment and savings. He has also promised that his plan will be "distributionally neutral" - that he will not raise the tax burden on the poor or middle class.
But, according to a study by the respected Tax Policy Center, if you cut tax rates by 20 percent, you give the wealthy a multibillion-dollar tax break. Even if you take away all of their credits and loopholes and preferential rates, the gap is still about $86 billion in 2015. If the rich are paying less, then the poor and middle class must pay more if you're going to raise the same amount of money.
In the debate, Mr. Romney said that he might put a cap on deductions - $25,000 per household, he suggested - to raise money to pay for the rate cuts. But tax economists said such a proposal still might not raise enough money from the wealthy and might result in an increased tax burden on the middle class or a bigger deficit.

 9:44 P.M. | Reaching Out to the Middle Class 
The middle class should feel loved.
Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are doing their best to connect with middle-class voters, each saying that his entire tax plan caters to them.
Mr. Romney repeatedly talked about "middle-income" folks, saying that his tax plan would lower taxes on them.
"Middle-income taxpayers have been buried during the last four years," Mr. Romney said. "The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the past four years."
Mr. Obama chimed in, too.
"I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families and for small business," he said.
Of course both men disagreed that the other was genuine about his interest in the middle class. Both aggressively accused the other of lying about his intentions.
"What he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he doesn't raise middle-class taxes," Mr. Obama said of his rival.
"You're going to be paying for it," Mr. Obama said, looking at the television audience. "You can't buy this sales pitch."
Mr. Romney retorted that "I will not under any circumstances reduce the share that's being paid by the higher incomes."
And he added, "The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cause the taxes to go up" for the middle class.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:41 P.M. | Fact-Check: College Graduates Without Jobs? 
Mr. Romney said that "with half of college kids graduating this year without a college - or excuse me, without a job and without a college-level job, that's just unacceptable." Is it true that half the students graduating from college this year don't have a "college-level job"?
It's not clear what numbers he is referring to, but Mr. Romney might be talking about numbers from last year. An analysis of 2011 Labor Department data by researchers at Northeastern University, Drexel University, and the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, found that about 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of people with bachelor's degrees under the age of 25 last year were jobless or employed in jobs that did not require a college degree. That was the highest share in at least 11 years.
- Catherine Rampell 
 9:38 P.M. | Fact-Check: Tax Increase on Small Business 
Mr. Romney just warned that Mr. Obama's plan to let the Bush-era income tax cuts for the highest-earning Americans expire would hurt small businesses. But 97 percent of small businesses do not earn enough to be hit by the higher rates.
Mr. Romney just warned, as he often does, that Mr. Obama's plan to let the Bush-era income tax cuts for the highest-earning Americans expire would hurt small businesses. But 97 percent of small businesses do not earn enough to be hit by the higher rates, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation of Congress.
Mr. Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on income above $200,000 for individuals and income above $250,000 for households, raising the top marginal rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent now. Some small businesses, who file taxes as "S corporations," would be hit by the higher rates, but the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that only 3 percent would earn enough to be hit by the new, higher top marginal rates. And not all of those businesses are exactly small: thousands of them would have receipts of more than $50 million a year, the committee found. 
The Romney campaign noted that those few businesses play an important role and said that they should not be burdened with higher taxes.
Of the businesses that would be subjected to the higher rates, many are sole proprietors - a classification so amorphous it can include everyone from corporate executives who earn income on rental property to entertainers, hedge fund managers and investment bankers.
Pluralities of likely voters and independent voters have said in that they supported letting the Bush-era tax cuts on higher earners expire.
Would repealing those tax cuts kill jobs? Economists generally agree that raising taxes, and taking money that would otherwise cycle through the economy, can cost jobs; that is one of the reasons Mr. Obama's stimulus plan included tax cuts. But it is worth noting that the rates Mr. Obama wants to return to were last seen during the Clinton administration - a time when the nation created 22.7 million jobs, as the Romney campaign itself has noted.
- Michael Cooper 
 9:35 P.M. | Voters' Voices: The Moderator's Job 
LARGO, Fla. - Mr. Obama's first aggressive-looking jabs at Mr. Romney, on the issue of oil and gas, drew some praise. "Throw it back at him, baby!" Mr. Bach said.
When the candidates stepped toward each other and traded questions directly, Mr. Fechko wondered when the moderator would step in. "The aggression is making Romney look rude, to me. He's speaking and I didn't notice Candy Crowley recognize him."
Well, Mr. Nystrom said, "Candy looks like she wants to interject. Here she goes."
And she did. They traded words about who would have the last words. Mr. Romney said he deserved to give the last answer.
"The aggression is not working tonight, Romney," Mr. Bach said. Referring to Ms. Crowley he added, "You're dealing with a strong woman there."
- Susan Saulny 
 9:30 P.M. | Against the Rule, Candidates Engage Directly 
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama are blatantly and repeatedly breaking the rules.
Under the memorandum agreed to by both campaigns, the two candidates are not to engage each other directly.
So much for that.
On the issue of energy production, both men have turned to each other and repeatedly accused each other of lying.
"Not true," Mr. Obama said directly to Mr. Romney about the production of oil. "We have actually produced more."
Mr. Romney responded directly, and aggressively, saying that oil production is down.
"It's just not true," Mr. Obama said.
"It's absolutely true," Mr. Romney said, looking directly at the president.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:24 P.M. | Fact-Check: 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt'? 
Did Mitt Romney really say "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"? Yes. Though he did not write the headline that continues to haunt him - that task fell to an editor - he did argue in a New York Times op-ed article that General Motors and Chrysler should go through a managed bankruptcy. 
But while those companies did ultimately file for bankruptcy, Mr. Romney's claim ignores key facts about the automaker's stability at the time.
Detroit was so fragile at the time that without the government assistance it received before heading into a court-supervised bankruptcy process, it could have collapsed. 
At the time Mr. Romney wrote that article (he did not write the headline himself, but had to approve it per a New York Times policy allowing outside op-ed writers the chance to veto any editors' changes), the financial markets had ground to a halt. It was November 2008, and there was little available liquidity for anyone seeking financing. There were certainly no financial institutions - not even Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's private equity firm - looking to invest to the tune of the $80 billion the car companies needed at the time.
No private companies would come to the industry's aid, and the only path through bankruptcy would have been Chapter 7 liquidation, not the more orderly Chapter 11 reorganization that the company ultimately followed, people inside and outside the car companies have said.
In fact, the task force asked Bain if it was interested in investing in General Motors' European operations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions.
Bain declined, this person said, speaking anonymously to discuss private negotiations.
- Jeremy W. Peters 
 9:23 P.M. | Candidates Not Holding Back 
 Here's another bit of conventional wisdom that we can throw out the window: That candidates would be restrained from attacking each other, directly and intensely, because there is an audience in the room. Already, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are facing each other, challenging each other and acting as if there is not another person in the room. "You'll get your chance in a moment," Mr. Romney said.

 9:20 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Scripted or Authentic? 
LARGO, Fla. - After Mr. Obama's first couple of answers, Mr. Bach had an observation: "It seems that he's trying really hard to include his talking points, but it's not coming from the heart."
But Ms. Siegrist interjected, "That's what they're both doing."
Listening to Mr. Obama's third answer, about oil and gas, Mr. Bach continued, "He's worried too much about the scripted points."
- Susan Saulny 
 9:18 P.M. | Fact-Check: Pell Grants for College 
Mr. Romney said he wanted to keep the Pell Grant program growing. This a new position for him 
Barely a minute into his first reply of the debate, Mr. Romney said, "I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing" a new position for him. In the first debate, he said, "I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college," and even that position came as a surprise to many analysts.
The governor and his campaign have repeatedly criticized President Obama's expansion of the Pell Grant program, which they have said is unsustainable. Mr. Romney's says he would "refocus Pell Grants dollars on the students who need them most." For months, this was widely interpreted as meaning that fewer people would qualify for Pell Grants - a question the Romney campaign declined to clarify.
Mr. Romney would also restore banks to their role in making student loans. Mr. Obama eliminated that role and used some of the savings to pay for the Pell Grant expansion.

 9:17 P.M. | Candidates Begin With Sharp Exchanges 
It took less than a minute for Mr. Obama to take a swing at his rival, accusing Mr. Romney of saying that he wanted Detroit to go bankrupt four years ago.
"When Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I bet on the American auto industry," Mr. Obama said.
That dig produced exactly the expected response from Mr. Romney, who indignantly charged that the president eventually pushed to take the auto companies through bankruptcy too.
"That was precisely what I recommended and what happened," Mr. Romney said.
But the president fired right back, quickly becoming aggressive the way his supporters said he did not during the first debate.He accused Mr. Romney of supporting a bankruptcy for the auto industry without supporting the financial resources that made it possible. And he quickly attacked Mr. Romney as an elitist who cares about the rich.
"Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan," Mr. Obama said. "And that is to make sure folks at the top play by a different set of rules."
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:17 P.M. | Voters' Voices: You Aren't What You Wear 
LARGO, Fla. - The first few moments of the debate brought an observation: "So Romney has a blue tie on but the President is wearing red?" Mr. Fechko said, sounding a bit amused. "I just find it odd. But it probably has no real meaning. It's nothing official, but we associate red with Republicans and blue with Democrats. They don't do anything without calculation, so perhaps it does mean something."
- Susan Saulny 
 9:14 P.M. | Fact-Check: 12 Million Jobs 
Mr. Romney has promised to create 12 million jobs over the next four years if he is elected president. That is actually about as many jobs as the economy is already expected to create, according to some economic forecasters.
In its semiannual long-term economic forecast released in April, Macroeconomic Advisers projected that the economy would add 11.8 million jobs from 2012 to 2016. Moody's Analytics, another forecasting firm, projects similar job growth. That means Mr. Romney believes his newly announced policies would add an extra 200,000 jobs on top of what people already expected, or a jobs bonus of about 2 percent.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that he expected the economy to remain on about the same path regardless of who is elected, under the assumption that whoever wins will "reasonably gracefully address the fiscal cliff, increase the Treasury debt ceiling without major incident, and achieve something close to fiscal sustainability."
Mr. Romney's camp may be suggesting that his policies would create 12 million jobs in excess of those already on track to be produced.
When asked by The Washington Post how the 12 million number was produced, the campaign cited three studies, all of which were problematic in this context.
One study finding that seven million jobs would be created by Mr. Romney's tax plan refers to job creation over a decade, not four years.
Another apparently intended to support the claim that Mr. Romney's energy policies would create three million jobs, but that number referred to an eight-year projection for policies largely already in place, not a four-year time frame for an alternative policy proposed by Mr. Romney.
Finally, Mr. Romney and his campaign have said that two million jobs could be created if the United States got tougher on China's infringement of intellectual property rights. That number has been sourced to a May 2011 report from the International Trade Commission.
It did not specifically analyze a Romney proposal; it simulated what would happen if China enacted a "substantial improvement" in intellectual property rights so that intellectual property was about as protected in China as it is in the United States. It found that the United States would gain about 2.1 million full-time equivalent jobs, at least under the economic conditions the country faced in 2011. It is not clear how the United States could force China to effect this change, though.

 8:58 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Undecided in Florida 
LARGO, Fla. - Here on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, in a swing county in an important swing state, the leader of the local Independent Party has gathered several friends to debate the debate - coffee, red sangria and beers in hand. 
"Well, we'll see how many distortions come out tonight," said Ernie Bach, the Independent Party's state chairman and a longtime political activist. "Perception is reality. Say something over and again, and people will believe it."
He was readying his troops, all independent voters. Chuck Fechko, 63, a retired accountant, Alyse Siegrist, 76, a retired food broker for grocery stores, and Scott Nystrom, 33, a restaurant server, voiced their agreement.
Mr. Nystrom's not entirely unserious idea of the moment is to start his own "super PAC" to counter the weight of the Democratic and Republican fund-raisers who have, in his words, "so distorted this race." 
Mr. Fechko offered some advice regarding a name: "You'll needs words like Future, America, Together and Action. But personally, I'd go for something funny and sarcastic. Let's keep thinking about it."
For now, with the naming issue on the back burner, attention has turned to what people want to see Tuesday night, in what they expect will be yet another crucial night for both President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. 
"This one should be pretty good, given what's already happened," Mr. Fechko said. "Common wisdom in the past has been that debates are entertaining and interesting. But these seem to actually change poll numbers. So anything is possible."

 8:52 P.M. | A Fresh Round of Spin Before Debate Begins 
Pencils sharpened? 
Fresh batteries in voice recorders?
O.K., let's go. It's time to pre-spin the debate. And here they come, into the blue-carpeted pit at the front of the press center, a thundering herd of Republican and Democratic surrogates to foreshadow themes and amplify their candidates' messages. 
(Reader warning: some mature content to follow) 
Gov. Bob McDonnell, Republican of Virginia, asked how Mr. Romney would parry President Obama's effort to paint him as unfriendly to women: "The whole theory that Republicans are somehow engaged in a war on women is very much contrived. Everybody knows that. The recent polls show women have actually given Mitt Romney his bump.''
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts (and stand-in for Mr. Romney in the president's debate prep), on how Mr. Romney would portray himself: "Tonight I'll bet you'll hear him stand up there and say, 'Wow, was I bipartisan in Massachusetts, I want to do for the country what I did in Massachusetts.' Well, country, be warned. What he did in Massachusetts according to the speaker was give marching orders. According to the Senate president, was be disengaged.''
John H. Sununu, a former Republican governor of New Hampshire, asked what he thought of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's accepting responsibility for American deaths in Benghazi, Libya: "She deserves credit for trying to save the president's butt and throwing herself under the bus. But shame on the president for having her do that.''
Alan Simpson, the former Wyoming Senator, on why Representative Paul D. Ryan rejected the bipartisan report of the Simpson-Bowles debt reduction commission: "I said, 'If you voted against it because you're afraid of Grover Norquist, I have no respect for you whatsoever.' He said, 'No, we feel if you get rid of the employer deduction of employee health care, the employers will panic and go to Obamacare'. I said, 'That's good enough for me.' "
Hey, this guy's pretty good. Let's ask another question: Is Mr. Romney being honest with voters about how he will pay for his tax cuts? 
"Nobody's honest with anybody. It's mush all around. They haven't mentioned Social Security solvency once. These kids" - indicating Hofstra University students looking on - "will be picking crap with the chickens when they're 65."
And now, let the combat begin.

 8:43 P.M. | Advice From Obama's Debate Coach 
What are Mr. Obama's top advisers telling him ahead of Tuesday night's debate?
For the most part, that's a secret. But a memo from Ron Klain, the president's chief debate coach, may give some clues.
The memo of debate-prep "rules," penned years ago and posted online again recently by Third Way, a Democratic-leaning think tank in Washington, urges candidates to write their "dream post-debate headline" as they prepare.
"As you consider potential answers, or lines, or any other element of debate strategy and tactics, ask yourself: Is this approach helping to win that "dream" headline?" Mr. Klain writes.
Mr. Obama got none of his dream headlines after the first debate. Nor did he satisfy Mr. Klain's second rule in the seven-page memo: to develop a list of "three items you MUST say in the debate."
The president was roundly criticized after the first debate for failing to mention any of his top priorities: Mr. Romney's "47 percent" comment; the abortion issue; Bain Capital; or Mr. Romney's taxes. It's possible Mr. Klain has stressed rule No. 2 in the days leading up to this debate.
And then there's rule No.10, which gets at one of the other criticisms of Mr. Obama's initial performance - that he was sleepwalking through the first debate. "Punches are good, counterpunches are better," says rule No. 10.
"If you develop five zippy replies to your opponents' five most commonly used lines, the odds are high that you will get a chance to use two or three," Mr. Klain writes. "And remember to also game out your opponents' likely replies to your most common lines: nothing is more effective in a debate than a counter-counter punch!"
There are 21 rules in all. The entire memo can be seen here.
Among some of the more interesting ones: Rule 3 encourages candidates to study what their opponent has been saying in the days just before the debate. "All candidates are creatures of habit. You can use that to your advantage: 90% of what your opponent will say in the debate will have come out of his mouth in the week before the debate," Mr. Klain writes.
Or Rule 13, which says that a candidate can lose a debate at any time during the event, but that "you can only win it in the first 30 minutes." He explains: "The viewers, the reporters and even your opponent form a sense of the debate dynamic in the early going. Indeed, for debates held at night, reporters (on deadline) usually write first drafts of their stories before the debate is half over."
And, finally, Rule 20: "If in doubt, don't." Candidates are often uncertain if something they say will come out right, Mr. Klain writes.
"At that moment remember the advice that some elementary school teacher once gave you: 'If in doubt, don't,' " Mr. Klain writes. "Better to fail to make a point during a debate (leaving open the possibility it can be made post-debate) than to make a point that goes awry."

 8:19 P.M. | Romney's Practice Sessions 
Mitt Romney may have a unseen weapon for this town hall-style debate: dozens of secretive practice sessions that began many months ago.
Aides to Mr. Romney began organizing frequent, off-the-record discussions with voters six months ago, with a specific goal in mind: making the candidate comfortable talking to ordinary people about their troubles and supplying him with anecdotes to tell during crucial moments of the campaign.
The sessions, typically held before or after public events in far-flung locales, around a small table with light food and beverages, had the advantage of being shielded from reporters, so that any of Mr. Romney's awkward moments or offhand remarks remained private. Aides said he had witnessed - and learned to react to - men and women become emotional about everything from foreclosed homes to their children's academic achievements.
Most important, the roundtable discussions offered Mr. Romney a chance to become a practiced retail politician in intimate settings, something at which he is likely to excel Tuesday night at Hofstra.

President Obama's campaign has sent dozens of fund-raising e-mails to supporters from Michelle Obama, the first lady.
But the one that arrived in in boxes at just before 8 o'clock tonight uses a word that none of them did before in describing her husband.
"Fighting."
In the fund-raising pitch, Mrs. Obama describes herself as proud of her husband and eager to see him on the stage facing Mr. Romney for a second time. And she obliquely acknowledges the criticism that Mr. Obama did not seem to be aggressive the last time.
"Tonight at the debate, you're going to see the guy who will always be out there fighting tirelessly for you," she writes. "Show Barack you're with him by donating $5 or more."

What happens when you are quoted saying something unflattering about the president just days before a critical second debate?
Well, if you're the leader of a Democratic-leaning think tank in Washington and one of the president's most visible supporters, you apologize, fast.
That's what happened to Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress.
Ms. Tanden was quoted in a New York Magazine article this week as saying the following about Mr. Obama: "The truth is, Obama doesn't call anyone, and he's not close to almost anyone. It's stunning that he's in politics, because he really doesn't like people. My analogy is that it's like becoming Bill Gates without liking computers."
That's pretty tough stuff, especially coming from the leader of an organization dedicated to implementing policies that Mr. Obama supports. (Ms. Tanden was a top supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primaries.)
It's a sure bet that folks at the White House, and in Mr. Obama's Chicago headquarters, were not happy at all.
And so Ms. Tanden tweeted her apology Tuesday morning: "I was trying to say how President Obama, who I admire greatly, is a private person, but I deeply regret how I said it. I apologize."

 6:59 P.M. | Predebate Scenes From the Postdebate Spin Room 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - Two hours before the candidates step on the stage at Hofstra University here, the cavernous spin room is already crackling with narratives and counternarratives - most about how pugilistic President Obama is likely to be.
"They all say he's going to come out swinging," said Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who played Mr. Obama in mock debates to prepare Mitt Romney. "He's going to be a new Barack Obama - new, different, improved."
But an hour earlier, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, insisted, "He is not looking to come here to score punches on Mitt Romney; he's coming in here to describe what a second term of an Obama presidency would look like."
She said the expectations of a very combative Mr. Obama were largely a creation of the Romney campaign. At the same time, Ms. Cutter said the president would be "passionate" about making his case for a second term. She said that Mr. Obama would hold Mr. Romney to account for his statements, but that it would not be his primary thrust.
"We'll do our best to keep Mitt Romney honest," she said, "but that could take all night." Read more...

 6:56 P.M. | Town Hall Format Poses Risks for Candidates 
If either President Obama or Mitt Romney had a robotic sidekick like the one in the campy, 1960s television show "Lost in Space," it might now be bleeping wildly and warning: "Danger! Danger!"
The threat? Voters.
Both candidates have had some of their most awkward and politically fraught moments when confronted directly by voters.
Mr. Obama was caught off guard during a 2010 economic town hall forum on CNBC when an African-American woman declared herself profoundly disappointed in him. He grinned awkwardly and then rambled for four minutes, providing new evidence of the political peril from a still sluggish economy.
At the Iowa State Fair in 2011, Mr. Romney's answer to a combative voter provided one of the most enduring - and damaging - moments in his campaign. "Corporations are people, too, my friend," a defensive Mr. Romney responded, a line that would dog him in the months ahead.
Tonight, there will many opportunities for such a moment, as described in the following piece. Read more ...

HEADLINE: In New Ad, Romney Stresses Moderate Positions on Reproductive Issues


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign, in an effort to appeal to women who hold more moderate views on reproductive issues, is releasing a new commercial that highlights his support for contraception and abortion in limited circumstances. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign, in an effort to appeal to women who hold more moderate views on reproductive issues, is releasing a new commercial that highlights his support for contraception and abortion in limited circumstances.
"You know, those ads say Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme, so I looked into it," says a woman identified as Sarah Minto, who is shown on camera searching on Google for "Romney on abortion."
Ms. Minto adds: "It turns out Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all. In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life." 
 The ad is Mr. Romney's most aggressive attempt to rebut attempts by the Obama campaign to paint him as extreme on women's rights.
 Mr. Romney has long struggled with women. All year polls have shown President Obama with a sizeable advantage. But as the race tightens in the final three weeks before the election - and one major poll showing this week that the Republican nominee is significantly narrowing the gender gap - the Romney campaign is moving dramatically to showcase its more moderate positions.
 This strategy is not without risk. Many socially conservative Republicans have long been wary of Mr. Romney, who as a candidate for United States Senate said that abortion should be "safe and legal" and touted his pro-gay rights positions.
 Reproductive rights have continued to bedevil Mr. Romney over the course of this election. Just last week he raised eyebrows when he denied to the editorial board of The Des Moines Register that he would pursue anti-abortion legislation. "There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda," he said.
 Mr. Romney's advisers have long said that they believed the election would turn on the economy, and that is where Ms. Minto ends her statement in the ad.
 "I'm more concerned about the debt our children will be left with," she says as she looks into the camera. "I voted for President Obama last time. We just can't afford 4 more years."

HEADLINE: In Demanding Homes, Help in High Demand

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
DELORES BETHELMIE seemed perfect to work as a nanny for the 1 percent.
A legal immigrant, she was willing to live anywhere in New York -- uptown or downtown -- and didn't mind adding housekeeping to her list of child care tasks. She was good at e-mail, certified as a baby nurse, had letters of reference from her former employers and had gone to college for two years in Trinidad before coming to America. At 41, she agreed to work on the books and overtime and was amenable to occasional weekend trips. She could even cook -- her culinary specialty was pelau, a spicy West Indian dish made of chicken, beans and coconut milk.
Unfortunately, the longer her interview at the Pavillion Agency lasted, the more problematic issues kept emerging. For one thing, Ms. Bethelmie didn't own a smartphone: Strike 1. Nor did she have a driver's license: Strike 2. And she only spoke one language: English, not Mandarin Chinese in addition to English, which is currently the vogue among employers.
That being three strikes, had she just struck out? 
''Hmm, I also see here that you don't swim,'' said Jennifer Mallano, a placement specialist at the agency, frowning slightly at the application that accompanied her rsum. ''Well, there are some positions I just won't be able to consider you for. When our families go to the Hamptons, swimming is something they typically require.''
After a steep decline following the financial crisis, the domestic staffing business -- that elite niche industry that screens and hires nannies, drivers, butlers, chefs and personal assistants on behalf of wealthy clients -- is once again booming, this time in a market that heavily favors the employers. At the Pavillion Agency in Midtown Manhattan, for instance, a dozen applicants were jammed into the lobby on a recent afternoon, scribbling on clipboards, patting down their hair and polishing presentations, waiting to be interviewed for jobs.
It was a far cry from 2009 when annual revenue at Pavillion -- not unlike its sister staffing firms -- decreased by nearly half. Last year, in fact, was the company's best year ever since being established in 1962, said Cliff Greenhouse, its president. ''And this year is turning out to be just as good,'' he added, ''maybe even better.''
The definition of ''better'' depends, of course, on which side of the hiring line you happen to be standing. If the extremely rich are again bringing workers in substantial numbers into their homes, one reason they can do so is because so many poorer people are willing to work there. As Ms. Mallano interviewed Ms. Bethelmie, there were 32 three-by-five notecards tacked to a corkboard behind them in the cubicle. The cards bore the names of others looking for work, and their number -- and diversity -- was instructive.
''This is actually one of the saddest times I've ever experienced in this business,'' said Keith Greenhouse, who helps his brother run the agency. ''I've just never seen this number of people who are practically begging us for work.''
In an era of luxury for the masses, a full-time domestic staff is a status symbol that truly sets one apart, a tangible way of separating the genuinely loaded from the simply well-to-do. With tongue-in-cheek candor, the owners of many staffing companies recalled that members of this upper class, their highest-net-worth clients, suddenly discovered in the fall of 2008 that something called the Economy existed and that -- who knew? -- it could violently head south.
This discovery, the owners said, produced in their customers a desire to rein in staffing costs (if not the staffs themselves). It also created social discomfort with appearing too privileged at a moment of national hardship. ''People became skittish,'' said David Crimmins, a manager at the Lindquist Group, another staffing agency in Manhattan. ''Even though they had money to spend, they felt they had to pull back slightly because it wasn't in vogue to have three or four people in your home.''
Job applicants have clearly felt the combined effects of this anxiety and increased fiscal shrewdness. The Pavillion Agency, for one, receives about 300 phone calls from applicants each week and another 300 queries over e-mail. Of these 600 inquiries, Keith Greenhouse said, many, if not most, are rejected out of hand. Of those that remain, he added, perhaps a dozen or so will actually find jobs.
''The superrich are never going to clean their own homes -- they're still going to hire,'' said Al Martino, who has run the Al Martino Domestic Staffing Agency in Manhattan since 1972. ''But what you find today is that they're -- how should I say it? -- very, very particular about who they want to hire.''
Because the available pool of labor is exceptionally deep and because the competition is particularly fierce for the most secure and highest-paying jobs, the superrich, Mr. Martino and others said, are beginning to scrimp on salaries and to require employees to take on multiple duties. Employers are looking to combine household tasks into economizing hybrids: the nanny who can also whip up dinner for the children and their parents, or the driver who can double as a handyman.
The best domestic jobs still pay exceedingly well. European nannies with college educations and the command of several languages (mere bilingualism is pass) can earn as much as $120,000 a year on top of room and board. Private drivers can take home annual salaries of up to $75,000, with bonuses for overtime. Top chefs with experience in three- or four-star restaurants and the ability to handle special dietary needs can make as much as $140,000 a year.
Frequently, however, the trade-offs for obtaining these positions are salaries that are open for negotiation, flexible work hours and enhanced scrutiny of the applicant's personal and professional lives. Background checks delving into driving, credit and criminal histories are the standard in the industry. But now, more and more agencies are keeping private investigators on retainer, owners say, to conduct more thorough searches of those applying for jobs.
Staffing specialists are also being asked by clients to look into potential employees' use of social media. ''Their Facebook pages or what they may be tweeting,'' said Steven Laitmon, the owner of the Calendar Group in Westport, Conn. ''Whether it's a Hollywood C.E.O. or the manager of a hedge fund, this is a very discreet client base. They don't want candidates who are superactive on social media. They want to make sure their privacy is protected.''
Because of privacy concerns, a number of wealthy families declined to discuss the issues involved in bringing workers into their homes, but every now and then tantalizing stories emerge about employees -- and even staffing agencies -- crossing the line. Last winter, for instance, Adrian Smith, the self-described ''domestic broker to the stars'' who had hired staff members for Robert DeNiro, George Soros and Mariah Carey, was convicted in State Supreme Court in Manhattan of harassment after he threatened Tania Higgins, the wife of a successful hedge fund magnate, when she turned down his suggestion of a maid.
''I will have a really great laugh when I see your house crumble,'' Mr. Smith ranted in a voice mail message to Ms. Higgins in September 2010, according to evidence presented in the case. ''I will have my revenge.''
In part to avoid misunderstandings with clients, firms like Pavillion undertake highly detailed interviews of their candidates, 30- or 40-minute sessions where the questions asked indicate, by inference, the needs, desires and, some might say, the neuroses of employers.
Can the private chef cook organic, gluten-free, locally sourced, no-salt vegan cuisine? Would the nanny mind blowing out the lady of the house's hair before she steps out for a night on the town? Has the driver ever had tuberculosis or a bum knee?
Ms. Bethelmie went through this process the first week in October, answering similar questions (yes, she would in fact mind working for a family that traveled frequently to 27 different countries) and being asked for a photo of herself (''Something wholesome,'' Ms. Mallano said, ''maybe outside in a park?'') By the middle of the month, her references had been checked -- they turned out to be excellent -- and her rsum was sent to three potential families.
She was hoping for a job with an annual salary of at least $75,000 -- in the lower register of the uppermost bracket.
''But the competition's tough,'' Ms. Mallano said. ''It isn't easy. Most of these families see five or 10 or even 15 applicants before they make a decision.''
Needless to say, Ms. Bethelmie was waiting.

HEADLINE: Financial Survival In a Time Of Fiscal Peril

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
BETWEEN now and the end of the year, investors who are paying even the slightest bit of attention to the news will hear the term ''fiscal cliff'' repeated so often that it will surely either strike fear into their hearts or numb them to possible risks ahead.
For some, it may sound like the warning they wished they had received ahead of the 2008 crash, or a signal that it is time to retrench. For others who have their money in cash or bonds, the chatter may confirm their worst fears about living in an uncertain time and persuade them to wait longer to invest in stocks. It should do neither.
The phrase itself refers to a confluence of tax increases and spending cuts that will happen automatically on Jan. 1, 2013, if Congress and the president do not come to an agreement to avert them. Think of skid marks ahead of a precipice. 
If the government does not hit the brakes and all the provisions that make up the fiscal cliff come to pass, however, the impact on gross domestic product will be to reduce it 4 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center made the impact more personal: 90 percent of Americans will see their taxes rise, with an average increase of $3,500. The United States economy will slide back into recession.
As if this were not scary enough, the news from other major economies is not encouraging. China appears to be slowing down
just as its leaders are distracted by the once-a-decade leadership change. While events in Europe are not making headlines as they did last year, the debt situation there is not vastly improved. And don't forget the numerous flash points of the Middle East and the peril they could pose to global energy markets.
What should investors do? Neeti Bhalla, head of the tactical asset allocation team at Goldman Sachs, said they needed to learn to live with uncertainty for quite some time. ''We won't have an answer to the fiscal situation after the election,'' Ms. Bhalla said. ''We won't have an answer to the European crisis after they come up with some fiscal union. We won't have an answer to China after they transfer power. The issues everyone is concerned about don't have a finite end to them.''
That's the bad news. The good news is no analyst interviewed for this article thought the government would drive over the fiscal cliff, since many of the expiring provisions have bipartisan support.
''Our belief is Congress is going to punt,'' said Thorne Perkin, a managing director at Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management, which advises very wealthy investors. ''They will turn the fiscal cliff into a fiscal hill and do some form of compromise people can live with. I don't think anyone wants to go through the full shock.''
But even a hill implies some pain to an economy that is not experiencing strong growth now. ''You might not get compromise on capital gains rates going from 15 to 20 percent, but Lockheed Martin's stock price does not reflect $500 billion in defense cuts over the next 10 years,'' said Rex Macey, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, referring to mandatory defense budget cuts in the worst case. ''We're not ones to believe it makes sense to panic at this point.''
However sober that view is, Mr. Macey said he still had days when he was concerned that lawmakers seemed ambivalent about addressing the tax and spending issues at hand. ''I feel like I'm in this bus heading over the fiscal cliff, and I'm looking at everyone and I'm nervous but no one else is,'' he said. ''I know they see the cliff because everyone's pointing at the cliff.''
This is one of those times when fretting about all of these bad things may be useless: average investors cannot control them. That still leaves the question of what to do with their money.
There are two complementary schools of thought on getting through the turmoil of the next six months. Both involve restraint and planning. The first requires investors to return to their plan.
What advisers are asking is not that investors necessarily take big risks in the face of the fiscal cliff -- after all, really bad economic things could still come to pass at the beginning of 2013. But they are asking that they return to a normal asset allocation and get back to being broadly diversified.
This sounds simple. But it may not be for investors who have been putting their money in cash, whose value is eroded by inflation, and low-yielding United States Treasury bonds.
''The people we are advising have been overallocated to asset classes that they consider to be safe and conservative -- cash and fixed income,'' said John Taft, head of RBC Wealth Management in the United States. ''Cash has the certainty that your purchasing power will be eroded by the rate of inflation. Bonds have the risk that when and if monetary policy tightens, rates will go up and they'll be exposed to principal loss.''
Bond interest rates move in the opposite direction of bond prices, so a one percentage point increase in rates on new bonds would result in about a 15 percent loss in the price of a previously issued bond on the open market.
For those who are skittish, and want to cling to their cash and low-yielding bonds, G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advises a mental accounting fudge. He has told clients to have enough money in cash to pay expenses for a period of years that makes them comfortable and put the rest into an investment plan meant to increase the value of the portfolio for years after that.
''If an investor has set aside three years of spending needs, she's bought three years of time horizon for the rest of the portfolio,'' he said.
He acknowledged that it was tough to tell people to put money into low- or negative-yielding assets, but he saw it as a trade-off.
''This is the price I have to pay for liquidity,'' he said. ''It's a measure of comfort. You won't worry what the market does tomorrow.''
Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Private Bank, has a more daring way of urging clients to return to diversification: adopt a hit-and-run strategy.
''It's like when you see a bully in the schoolyard -- you hit him and run away,'' Mr. Nerbrand said. He is telling clients now, ''You sit with a very conservative portfolio and from time to time you add a bit of risk.''
For those with more gumption, who think the fiscal cliff will lead to buying opportunities when falling asset values prompt sell-offs, recommendations vary.
One favorite is dividend-paying stocks, which may seem counterintuitive because the tax rate on dividends could increase to as high as 43.4 percent from the current 15 percent.
But Barbara Reinhard, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse Private Bank, sees two reasons to favor dividend stocks: First, the stocks themselves are inexpensive relative to their historical earnings, and second, companies that are paying and increasing dividends now are strong and often diversified, so they are best positioned to weather any volatility over the next few months.
Ms. Reinhard said that all else being equal, an increase in the dividend and capital gains rate to 20 percent would be preferable to having capital gains taxed at 20 percent and dividends taxed as income, which could go as high as 43.4 percent for the highest earners.
She and other analysts were not worried about the impact of an increase on most investors. Mr. Taft estimated that a third of dividend-paying stocks were owned by foreign investors and another third were owned in pension funds or retirement accounts that did not pay taxes.
For the other third, particularly those who depend on the dividend for income, the increased taxes will be a hit. ''If you have a $40 stock and it's been paying you 85 cents after taxes, next year it will pay you 60 cents,'' Mr. Macey said. ''That's a big difference. But we'll know early enough next year, maybe after one or two dividend payments, what's going to happen, so we'd rather wait.''
On a less positive note, Keith Voight, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying group running a 'defend my dividend' campaign in warning of the fiscal cliff, said his group feared a domino effect in which higher earners sell their dividend-paying stocks, depressing the value for all owners.
But Rob Lutts, president and chief investment officer for Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass., said he was not worried about the long-term effects of a tax increase on capital gains or dividends. ''We can adapt to that,'' he said. ''The market could have some indigestion when we get there, but the valuations are so lopsided toward bonds that it supports equities going forward.''
Still, he has moved 10 to 12 percent of his clients' money into gold and precious metals as a hedge against the effect on the dollar of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low. ''There is a cost to that support,'' Mr. Lutts said. ''We are going to create a fairly high level of inflation down the road.''
There are other hedging strategies for people worried about volatility. Harry Clark, chairman and chief executive of Clark Capital Management, which oversees $3 billion for smaller investors, said his firm had bought a combination of exchange-traded funds and notes to cap any loss for clients at about 10 percent. ''We don't worry about a massive decline,'' he said. ''But there are other ways to make a portfolio defensive, like buying companies in the materials, energy, consumer essentials and utilities spaces.''
The thinking here is that if the worst happens, there are still some essential things, like soap and gas, that people will need to buy. ''I think the biggest risk is in the bond market,'' Mr. Clark said. ''That's the next disaster waiting to happen. They're going to drop like a rock when rates go up.''
For those with the deepest risk appetite -- or deepest wallets -- the best strategy is one that allows them to look beyond all the noise the fiscal cliff will create. Real estate and private equity come to mind.
Mr. Perkin said he was putting together a group to invest in a unique way in the oil boom in North Dakota: lodging.
''Every oil company in the world is going gaga over the Bakken oil fields,'' he said. ''The problem is there is zero infrastructure: terrible roads, no restaurants, nowhere to stay, the airport is awful, no hospitals or schools, nothing.''
Despite all that, he said, he has a group of clients investing $60 million into a hotel project with another $40 million of investments planned.
''It's the kind of thing people are looking for -- infrastructure and a hard asset,'' he said. ''It's like the California gold rush. Who made the most money on the gold rush? Levi Strauss. We're looking at the ancillary businesses that come out of the demand for oil.''
This is not without risks beyond the lack of liquidity in the deal. If the price of oil drops below $60 a barrel, the demand for Bakken crude could slow, he said. But now, he said, clients like investments that appear uncorrelated with the market volatility the fiscal cliff could cause.
Still, for most investors, even those with many millions of dollars, the best strategy may be to take a similarly long view without as much risk.
''Most investors are best served by the following strategy, and I say this with 100 percent conviction,'' Mr. Taft said. ''Sit down with yourself or your adviser and figure out what you're trying to accomplish over the rest of your life. Develop a plan with as few moving parts as possible and then stick to that plan.''
''Individual investors are notoriously bad about making tactical, short-term changes to their portfolios,'' he added. ''That's basic advice, but it's the best advice there is.''

HEADLINE: Small Increase For Social Security

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
More than 56 million Americans on Social Security will receive an average $19 more a month starting in January, one of the smallest annual increases since automatic adjustments for inflation were adopted in 1975, the government said Tuesday. Much of the 1.7 percent increase could be erased by higher Medicare premiums, which are deducted from Social Security payments. At the same time, about 10 million workers earning more than $110,100 will face a tax increase next year because more of their wages will be subjected to Social Security taxes.

HEADLINE: Strong Dollar Dents Coca-Cola's Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Coca-Cola reported third-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations on Tuesday. It was pulled down by declines in Europe and Asia, where it sold more lower-priced drinks because of economic uncertainty that the company expects to continue into 2013. 
The company, the world's biggest soft drink maker, with brands like Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, also said revenue and profit were hurt by the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales.
Still, Coca-Cola's earnings, which rose 4 percent, were in line with analysts' expectations.
Coca-Cola gets most of its sales from outside the United States, so shifts in currency can have a big effect. In the third quarter that ended on Sept. 28, the strong dollar shaved five percentage points of growth from net revenue and seven points from operating income.
Aside from currency, Coca-Cola's results in Asia, particularly China, disappointed some analysts. But Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said these results were not surprising, given the softening of consumer sentiment and the slowing of Asia's economies, which had been a growth engine for multinational companies in recent years.
''China is slowing down a little bit for the long-term benefit of China. As China will settle, there's a little bit of adjustment,'' the company's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said in an interview.
Coca-Cola said its sales volume rose 3 percent in the Pacific region. A JPMorgan Chase analyst, John Faucher, expected 4.5 percent growth.
In addition, European consumers have been hurt by the sovereign debt crisis. In the latest quarter, consumers were buying bottled soft drinks to take home, which is less profitable for the company than drinks sold in restaurants.
''Go to Madrid and look at the cafes. There aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking Cokes or coffee or whatever,'' Gary Fayard, the company's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts and investors.
Coca-Cola reported third-quarter net income of $2.31 billion, or 50 cents a share, up from $2.22 billion, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 51 cents a share, in line with the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Revenue rose 1 percent to $12.34 billion. Analysts were expecting $12.41 billion.
Worldwide sales volume rose 4 percent in the quarter, reflecting gains in all regions. Volume rose 1 percent in Europe, 2 percent in North America, 5 percent in Latin America and 11 percent in the Eurasian and African regions.

HEADLINE: Reid Cuts Losses While He Still Can

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
It was just a few days after training camps had opened, and Andy Reid was noticeably jovial and relaxed. He was starting his 14th season as Philadelphia's coach -- 14 years, he said at one point for emphasis, maybe with a touch of wonder -- and was convinced that the team that jelled at the end of last season had carried over its momentum into this one.
But on that humid late summer day, Reid cringed when he was asked if he was comfortable. That, he said, is a rough word for a coach. 
''If you get too comfortable,'' he said, ''you stay the same, and we weren't good enough.''
A few days later, Reid's wariness seemed like awful foreshadowing. His son Garrett was found dead in his room at training camp. Not long after Reid returned to work, the team's owner, Jeffrey Lurie, made clear that another 8-8 season would not be enough for Reid to keep his job. It was a chilling reminder that whatever Reid's coaching faults, he had learned after so many years that there was little place for sentiment in his line of work.
There certainly wasn't on Tuesday, when Reid fired the defensive coordinator Juan Castillo, a close friend, and replaced him with the defensive backs coach Todd Bowles, two days after the Eagles blew a 10-point lead with five minutes to play in a loss to the Detroit Lions. Reid did not like the word comfortable back in the summer, but he did describe his team as ''settled'' then. It turns out neither term was correct, and the one that seems to apply best to Reid and the Eagles now, more than two months later, is desperate.
''I have to do what I think is right,'' Reid said at a news conference. ''I've always tried to stick with that. Whether it was with public opinion or against public opinion, I tried to do what I thought was right and the best thing for the Philadelphia Eagles and the best opportunity it gives us to win football games.''
A shake-up of some dimension seemed inevitable in the moments after the Lions game, as Reid monosyllabically answered questions about how he would review every facet of his team during the bye week, with the Eagles' record at 3-3. Reid said that this move was his call alone. Read: Lurie did not order it. That it was Castillo who took the fall, though, was a surprise and a very public admission that Reid had erred significantly in giving him the post in the first place and was now scrambling to save not just the season, but his own job.
This was a decision that came at least 10 months too late. Reid made the unorthodox decision to elevate Castillo, a longtime offensive line coach, to defensive coordinator before the 2011 season. And it was Reid who stuck with him after the 2011 season ended with Castillo under fire. That the defense was often predictable, that Castillo's lack of experience almost certainly contributed to his struggle making in-game adjustments, could not have been news to Reid. When cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha questioned the defensive decision making after the loss to the Lions, it was surely not the first time Reid grew concerned.
''I thought we were making progress,'' Reid said of why he kept Castillo after last season. ''I saw us making progress. We made progress through the last four games. I kind of liked the direction that we were going. I thought we started off pretty good and then I started seeing some trends come back that I wasn't real happy about, and so I just wanted to make sure that we took care of those. I'm not going to go into detail. There were just things that I saw that I didn't want to go in that direction. Tough call.''
Reid signaled Tuesday that more of them could be coming. Castillo's unit has largely carried the Eagles this season as the offense has floundered, casting Castillo even more sharply in the role of convenient scapegoat. The Eagles have blown two straight fourth-quarter leads -- and seven over all under Castillo. Castillo's unit hasn't had a sack in three games, but it is the best in the league on third and fourth downs. It ranks 13th in points allowed a game, hardly the position of a unit that would seem to demand the sudden -- and highly unusual in the N.F.L. -- midseason dismissal of a top assistant.
Castillo was most definitely not responsible for the Eagles' most glaring problem: Michael Vick's 13 turnovers. Vick is completing less than 60 percent of his passes, and the Eagles are 31st in scoring. If Vick is not benched in the next week or two, he is surely on ice as thin as the slab Reid is teetering on. Since the Eagles signed Vick after his release from prison, he has been Reid's project. But it did not escape notice that Reid gave Vick and Castillo tepid endorsements Monday and that 24 hours later, Castillo was gone.
"I'm just telling the truth," Reid said Tuesday. "That's what I'm saying to you. Right now, Michael Vick is the starting quarterback."
He might not deserve to be much longer. Benching Vick for Nick Foles, though, would shine the spotlight on an uncomfortable reality for Reid: he would have blundered on the two most critical decisions he has made in recent years, one on each side of the ball. At the end of the season, when Lurie evaluates whether Reid will return, those things will stand out, for better or worse. And then, Reid might not just be uncomfortable. He could be unemployed.

HEADLINE: How To Score The Debate

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
I had to write this column before the presidential debate was finished, so I thought the most useful thing I could do is to offer the scoring system I'll be using to determine who did best. You can fill in your own scores. My system is not based on zingers or extra points for energizing the base, but rather on what I believe many Americans really want from the next president. You see, I believe this time is different -- that many Americans understand something is very wrong, that we could go the way of Greece or Japan if we don't shape up, and that they will embrace a candidate who trusts them with the truth, that is, an honest diagnosis of where we are and how we get out of this mess. Up to now, neither candidate has been willing to do that. 
So, first, I'll be looking for that honest diagnosis. We are where we are today, in part, because the merger of globalization and information technology has transformed how goods and services are bought and sold, made and designed. This merger makes old jobs obsolete faster and spins off new jobs faster, but all the good new jobs require higher skills. As a country, notes Lawrence Katz, the Harvard University labor economist, we have historically ensured that our work force kept up with new technology by steadily expanding public education -- first universal primary education and then universal secondary education. But since the 1980s, says Katz, when we needed to move to some form of universal postsecondary education to keep pace with globalization and I.T., we didn't. Instead, he points out, ''our high school graduation rates stopped improving and our growth in college graduates slowed substantially -- far below what we need for rapid growth and shared prosperity.'' Today, our workers ages 50 and over are the most educated in the world; our younger workers are in the middle of the global pack for industrialized countries; and our national dropout rate remains stubbornly high, around 25 percent.
So what did we do? We created employment for our unskilled workers by a massive injection of subprime credit that created a large number of home construction and retailing jobs. Meanwhile, Wall Street also ballooned, in part by shifting from an industry that funded ''creative destruction'' of new firms to an industry, as the economist Jagdish Bhagwati put it, that funded ''destructive creation'' of unproductive financial instruments.
''For too many years, our job creation engines were excessively reoriented from competitive global markets to inwardly oriented sectors that were taken to unsustainable levels, (e.g., construction, finance, housing and retail),'' wrote Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, in The Atlantic.com. ''The result was an unbalanced and vulnerable labor force. Our generation also overdosed on debt and credit entitlement. We got seduced by financial engineering. ... Too little genuine growth, too much debt, and a risk culture gone crazy culminated in the very messy global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath -- a costly shock to society whose impact will be with us for quite a few years still. ... For years, Western societies have under- and mal-invested in education. As we slipped down global rankings, we convinced ourselves that our traditional global edge in entrepreneurship and innovation'' could compensate for our declines in educational attainment. They can't.
All of this came to a head during the terrible 2000s. The housing/credit markets exploded, creating a systemic banking crisis and a painful recession, which coincided with our sharpening education deficit, which coincided with two wars and a big tax cut that dramatically worsened our national deficit. The result is a deep hole.
That hole requires us to now cut spending, raise and reform taxes; stimulate the economy by investing in infrastructure, research and teachers; spur more start-ups; and offer more people postsecondary vocational or college education. So, first, listen for anything like that diagnosis from the candidates.
And, second, listen for a plan that rises to the true scale of that challenge, one that proposes job-creating infrastructure investments tied with a program to stimulate more start-ups (which have slowed) tied with a credible deficit-reduction plan -- that would be phased in as the economy recovers -- tied with a plan to get more Americans postsecondary education. Yes, I know, Obama has many such initiatives, but he has not made them the centerpiece of his campaign, or highlighted them in his commercials, or tied them together into a compelling package that gets people out of their chairs, saying: ''Yes, he's got the answer!'' Instead of campaigning on how good is his plan, he has campaigned on how bad is Romney's.
Third, the country wants a plan that is fair. The wealthy have to pay more, but everyone should contribute something. And, fourth, the country wants a plan that is aspirational -- a plan that is about making America a great country for the next generation, not just ''balancing the budget.''
So I am scoring the debate with these criteria in mind. I have argued for a year now that the candidate who offers such a plan wins the election. If neither does, someone will still win -- probably narrowly -- but the country will lose by a mile.

HEADLINE: John Hoffman, a Force in Energy Efficiency, Dies at 62

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
John Hoffman, who helped shape an international treaty in the 1980s to protect the ozone layer and later developed the Energy Star program, a widely recognized government stamp of approval for energy-efficient products, died on Sept. 24 in Washington. He was 62.
The cause was complications after surgery for a perforated peptic ulcer, said his wife, Lucinda McConathy. 
Mr. Hoffman was working at the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1980s when he became one of the first federal environmental officials to begin looking for ways to address climate change. He conceived of Energy Star as a way to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. Introduced in 1992, the voluntary program encouraged manufacturers to produce more environmentally friendly products, in part by assuring them that consumers would understand the benefits of buying them.
''He looked around his office and saw all these computers running all the time,'' Ms. McConathy said. ''He thought: 'Couldn't they have some low-energy mode? Couldn't they go to sleep when I'm at lunch?' Out of that came the first Energy Star labeling.''
Energy Star initially focused on computers and monitors, but it quickly expanded to other products and even entire homes. Now the Energy Star logo is prominently stamped on qualifying products, whether an office phone, a light bulb or a gas furnace.
According to the program's Web site, in 2011 Energy Star products helped prevent 210 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions -- equivalent to the emissions from 41 million vehicles -- and reduced utility bills by $23 billion.
Former colleagues said Mr. Hoffman believed that the E.P.A. too often had an adversarial relationship with industry -- that it was locked in a pattern of penalizing polluters after they broke laws. Worried about the long-term impact of climate change, he wanted to motivate manufacturers and consumers not to pollute in the first place.
''Now you sort of think, 'Well, of course, you would do that,' but at the time John was really fighting an established way of thinking,'' said Maria Tikoff Vargas, who led the brand management of Energy Star for 15 years and is now the director of the Energy Department's Better Buildings Challenge, which encourages energy efficiency in commercial and industrial buildings.
''It really was an amazing way to thread the needle,'' she added, ''so that everyone benefited, including, and perhaps most importantly, the environment.''
Mr. Hoffman's work on Energy Star followed another accomplishment that some of his colleagues consider more important: the passage in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which were depleting the ozone layer and increasing the earth's exposure to dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
Mr. Hoffman convinced the Reagan administration of the threat and played an influential role when the United States eventually helped shape and secure approval of the protocol, which was expanded in later years.
''Because of that, the ozone layer not only didn't get worse, it's beginning to repair itself,'' said Stephen Seidel, a former colleague of Mr. Hoffman's who is now a senior adviser for the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.
John Steven Hoffman was born on Feb. 16, 1950, in New York. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in Yonkers and earned a bachelor's degree in urban studies from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970 and a master's in systems modeling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972. At his death he was working on a doctorate in economics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Alla, and a brother, James.
Ms. McConathy, a lawyer, said she and her husband moved to Washington from Chicago in the late 1970s after she found a job with a law firm. Mr. Hoffman had not been particularly environmentally minded, she said, but he needed a job, and the E.P.A. was interested in his experience in Chicago as a consultant who had studied how businesses made decisions and the impact they had.
''He had kind of a philosophy of life, which is that you make choices,'' Ms. McConathy said. ''Everything you do, you're making a choice, and those choices matter. You should be trying to improve things as you go along.''

HEADLINE: Don't Forget NATO

BYLINE: By JAMES GOLDGEIER

 BODY:
In awarding this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union, the Nobel committee quite rightly noted the E.U.'s critical role in Europe's transformation ''from a Continent of war to a Continent of peace.'' But as Europeans celebrate what they have accomplished since World War II, they should not forget that without the United States and NATO, they could not have been successful.
By creating economic interdependence and then building deep political, cultural and societal ties, the Union enabled Western Europeans -- and later Central and Eastern Europeans -- to build prosperity. The horror of two world wars receded into the past. But prosperity is only possible when security is assured. And without the United States and NATO, peace would not have been possible. 
Founded in 1949, an alliance built among the United States, Canada and Western Europe guaranteed Western Europeans that they would not be overrun by Soviet tanks. During the four decades of the Cold War, the knowledge that the United States would come to their defense allowed the Europeans to focus on building their miracle.
When the Cold War ended, the West's attention turned to helping Central and Eastern Europeans join the zone of peace and prosperity that Western Europeans had enjoyed. The European Union provided assistance to ensure that the Poles, Czechs, Estonians and others could build a market economy, develop democracy and the rule of law, and provided protection for human rights in the aftermath of Soviet domination.
But without security, none of this would have been possible. And NATO led the way after the Cold War ended. First the Atlantic Alliance developed the Partnership for Peace program, designed to ensure that the militaries in those formerly Communist countries understood what it meant to build a democratic society. And then the alliance provided a path to membership for a dozen countries in the region, providing hope to nations that had been forced to live under autocratic rule that they could live in peace and that their peoples would know their individual liberties would be protected.
Had NATO not ensured security, it is doubtful that the European Union could have expanded. Would the Union have been willing to allow Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to join in the face of Russian intimidation and in the absence of NATO protection? Those countries would have been deemed too insecure to be admitted. They would have been in a situation similar to that of Georgia, whose conflict with Russia is preventing Tbilisi from following a similar path.
Then there is Bosnia. The war in the early 1990s raged for nearly four years. The United States hoped that the European Union would stop the carnage inflicted by the Serbian government and its allies, but the organization had neither the will nor the capability to do so. In 1995, the United States led NATO to end the war and help promote the peace. It was not the European Union that put an end to the most horrific violence since World War II. It was not the European Union that ended a genocide reminiscent of the crimes committed by the Nazis. It was NATO, just as it was four years later when the Kosovar Albanians were under assault by the Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic.
We should celebrate all that the European Union has done, and the Nobel Peace Prize committee clearly wanted to send a signal that European leaders cannot let the current economic crisis lead to an unraveling of what their predecessors achieved. But peace in Europe has not simply been the result of greater prosperity, it has also been the prerequisite for economic growth. U.S. leadership of NATO helped make both peace and prosperity possible.
James Goldgeier is dean of the School of International Service at American University.

HEADLINE: Croatian Curators Make Mark by Working Together

BYLINE: By GINANNE BROWNELL

 BODY:
ZAGREB, CROATIA -- Sabina Sabolovic knew the answer before she asked the question. ''Instead of quoting us individually, could you just credit what each of us says as said by WHW?'' she asked, sitting outside a cafe in a courtyard in central Zagreb. When told that would not be possible, the curator gave a broad smile. ''I figured, but I had to at least ask.''
Ms. Sabolovic, along with her fellow curators, Ana Devic, Ivet Curlin, Natasa Ilic and the designer Dejan Krsic in the curatorial collective What, How and for Whom, or WHW, prefers to answer questions as a unified collective identity. The importance of equality within the curating group (Ms. Ilic is based in Berlin while the other members are based in Zagreb) is the cornerstone of Croatia's best-known curatorial collective.
''They have a clear concept of collective curating,'' said Zdenka Badovinac, the director of the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana, Slovenia, which runs both the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, or MSUM. ''The goals of WHW are somehow related to this history of Yugoslav artists collectives that were critical of fake collectivism imposed under Communism. They are more about this genuine collectivism.'' 
WHW has had critical success curating local shows at Galerija Nova, a non-profit gallery owned by the city of Zagreb but run by WHW, as well as international exhibitions, including the 2009 Istanbul Biennial and the Croatian pavilion at the Venice Biennale last year.
This autumn, WHW is putting together exhibitions across Europe including ''How Much Fascism?,'' part of which opened at the Basis voor Actuele Kunst gallery in Utrecht, the Netherlands, on Sept. 29 and runs through Dec. 23. (Another part at Extra City Kunsthal in Antwerp, Belgium, runs though Nov. 11). There is also the ''Dear Art'' exhibition at the MSUM in Ljubljana, which opens on Nov. 29 and examines the question as to whether society still needs art and what makes contemporary art truly contemporary.
Next year, WHW will tackle putting together the seventh edition of ''Meeting Points,'' a biannual contemporary arts festival focusing on artists from the Arab world. Organized by the Young Arab Theater Fund, the event will open in Cairo in September 2013 and travel to eight cities, including Beirut, Amman, Athens and Brussels.
''They are deeply influential for a few reasons,'' said Nato Thompson, the chief curator of Creative Time, a nonprofit art organization in New York. ''They have introduced lots of artists and thinkers who many people were unfamiliar with before. But more than that, by their work ethic, their level of commitment -- on a shoestring budget -- and their sheer force of will, WHW has managed to make a major contribution to the intellectual skill sets and conversations that are out there.''
It was a shared interest in politics that initially brought the members of WHW together. With the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalist rhetoric -- including politics and culture -- was rife across the western Balkans. ''One of the focal points around which we came together was trying to figure out how we found ourselves in a country that was so closed into itself and self-obsessed,'' said Ms. Curlin. ''We always considered ourselves Yugoslav where there had been strong links between Zagreb, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Ljubljana. We wanted to reopen those links. We were not interested in reinforcing this notion of a state organized exclusively on nationality.''
WHW initially came together in 1999 -- minus Ms. Curlin, who at that time was studying in New York -- to organize an exhibition titled ''What, How and for Whom,'' following the 150th anniversary of the publishing of the 1848 Communist Manifesto. Though none of them had high profiles as curators before they began the project -- all of them had studied comparative literature and art history and had worked in various cultural fields including journalism, art criticism and cultural management -- the show, which focused on questions of economics, met with critical success. ''What started as a plan to encompass local artists,'' said Ms. Devic, ''ended being a big international show with something like 50 artists.''
On the heels of that show, which inspired the name of their collective, they put together ''Broadcasting'' in 2001-2002, a series of cultural events in various formats looking at issues related to the media. Around that time, the curators -- now joined by Ms. Curlin -- decided to begin WHW as a nonprofit organization in its own right.
''We felt that working together, we could gain a certain momentum and a certain visibility that we would not have been able to do on our own,'' said Ms. Curlin. ''We did not decide then that we would work together for another 10 years, but we worked on that project and then another one.''
What has evolved over the last decade -- aside from a strong and cohesive curatorial platform focused around politics, philosophy, history and theory -- is how the group has learned to work together. It takes, said Ms. Devic, lots of negotiations and trial and error. Despite various members' strengths, they share all responsibilities -- from doing budgets to speaking at public presentations and answering e-mails -- so that everyone feels they have an equal voice.
''This fact of not having it like, 'This is your sector, I do not have anything to do with that' is strengthening,'' said Ms. Sabolovic. ''Of course, sometimes it is exhausting and you have a feeling that WHW is almost like this additional member that asks for another kind of attention, time and consideration and somehow also participates in all of it.''
Since 2003, WHW has not only been balancing working on international exhibitions and publications, but also has been organizing shows at Galerija Nova in Zagreb. Its exhibitions include ''Looking Awry'' (2003) at Apexart in New York and the project ''Art Always Has Its Consequences'' (2008-2010) with contemporary art institutions in Poland, Hungary and Serbia.
The gallery, which is showcasing the exhibition ''Monuments in Transition -- Destruction of People's Liberation War Monuments in Croatia'' through Nov. 17, has been one of the most highly regarded art spaces in Croatia since the 1970s.
''We always try to link the gallery project to what we are doing abroad,'' said Ms. Sabolovic. ''We really liked to be rooted here in the space that we know and it also helps in terms of visibility and having a certain continuity. On the other hand, the pressures of production can be difficult.''
Those pressures, including budgetary constraints, are things WHW have made a concerted effort to be open about in the work that they do. Controversially, they published their budget for the Istanbul Biennial, a decision that was met with mixed reaction within the international contemporary art community.
''It was really remarkable that they published the budget showing where the money came from and where it went,'' said Trevor Paglen, a New York artist who has collaborated on several projects with WHW. ''That, in and of itself, was incredible. I have never heard of anyone doing that before, taking these questions of politics and society and not glossing over them.''
Mr. Thompson, the curator at Creative Time, believes WHW's global influence will continue to grow. ''They are more revolutionary than a lot of curators,'' he said. ''I think in terms of the models they are developing and proposing and the ideas of what it means to be a curator, I do not see other curators developing to nearly the same extent at all.''

HEADLINE: Tuvalu: A Pacific Landscape Befouled

BYLINE: By MATT SIEGEL

 BODY:
FUNAFUTI, TUVALU -- The sun is setting over the Pacific islet, casting the isolated lagoon in brilliant shades of red, orange and topaz. Towering palm trees sway slowly in the warm tropical breeze. Out in the distance, fishermen in a small boat slowly troll the coral atolls for reef fish, much as the people of Tuvalu have done for hundreds of years or more.
But none of these things are what hit you first about this neighborhood on the edge of the water. What hits you first is the smell. Household garbage mingles with wastes both human and animal in open pits that, when filled with seawater during high tide, turn into a fetid soup under the blistering sun. It is in one of the dozens of precariously balanced stilt houses over those pits that Kalalisa Uilese lives with her husband and three children.
''There's not enough land,'' Ms. Uilese, 47, said matter-of-factly inside her dark, makeshift living room. ''That's why we build our houses on them.'' 
Tuvalu, a tiny cluster of nine coral atolls and islands about halfway between Australia and Hawaii in the South Pacific, is one of the smallest countries on the planet, and many scientists say it is getting smaller. Its population of fewer than 12,000 people inhabits a landmass of 26 square kilometers, or 10 square miles, about a third the size of Manhattan. On Funafuti, the main atoll and Tuvalu's capital, the widest point between the lagoon around which the town spreads and the ocean beyond is just half a kilometer.
The lowest point is just above sea level, a spot from which you can be tricked into thinking that you are somehow standing below the vast Pacific, looking up rather than out into it.
Data from the U.S. National Research Council predict that global sea levels could rise by as much as 140 centimeters, or 55 inches, by 2100 as a result of climate change, which, when combined with damage to the coral roots of Tuvalu by rising acidity in seawater, could threaten the country's very existence. Then there is coastal erosion, a result of rising water and harsh weather but also human activities like excavation for construction and other development projects.
During World War II, as fighting between the United States and Japan raged across the Pacific, the British government granted the U.S. military the use of its colony on what is now Tuvalu but was then known as the Ellice Islands. Massive antiaircraft guns, the concrete base of at least one of which still stands a lonely vigil in the surf, were quickly erected. But for the islands to reach their full wartime potential, they needed an airstrip. Large quantities of coral were dug up and carted off to be crushed and mixed for the tarmac. The gaping pits that were left behind across Funafuti, called ''borrow pits,'' were never filled and eventually began to be used for refuse. Add to this the doubling of Tuvalu's population since 1980, and it is easy to understand why, as usable land dwindled, homes like Ms. Uilese's started to stretch across the pits.
For Betty Vuva, 49, the head teacher at Nauri Primary School, the borrow pits and their attendant health problems are a constant source of anxiety. As the changing tides have steadily encroached on the island from without, she says, the land around the pits has become more crowded.
''Well, so far no houses have collapsed,'' she said with a wry laugh.
The government of Tuvalu, which survives on a combination of foreign aid and dividends from the sale in 1998 of the .tv Internet domain name, has repeatedly asked the U.S. government for assistance in refilling the borrow pits. In 2003, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers carried out a site assessment and cost study at the behest of the State Department. The 152-page report acknowledged the provenance of the pits and starkly identified their cost to the island.
''Solid waste disposal sites surrounding residential homes and animals have developed into a health hazard for nearby residents,'' the report said. ''An engineered solid waste landfill site and management plan needs to be implemented for the safety of the people and longevity of the island.''
Three options for refilling the pits were considered in the document, ranging in cost from $14,950 to $28.5 million, but the issue has gone no further. Tuvalu, which has an annual gross domestic product of about $35 million, says it is ill-equipped to act on the report by itself.
''The government has never had the financial resources needed to fill in the borrow pits,'' Prime Minister Willy Telavi said in an e-mailed response to questions. ''We just don't have the money. Not even close.''
He added: ''Over the years we have approached many donor countries, including the U.S., about filling in the borrow pits but without success. If the U.S., which to us has always been the likely donor to fix the problem, was willing to revisit the issue of filling in the borrow pits we would welcome their efforts with open arms.''
That, however, seems unlikely, at least in the short term, according to a senior U.S. administration official who cited the costs of carrying out the project using environmentally sound methods.
''In order not to cause further environmental damage to the land or surrounding seas, material may have to be imported, which would increase the cost considerably,'' the official said in an e-mail on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to comment publicly. ''We continue to work on this with the government of Tuvalu and we look forward to finding a mutually acceptable, affordable and environmentally responsible solution.''
For James Conway, 53, an adviser on energy policy to the Ministry of Economic Planning and Foreign Affairs, that kind of solution has already been too long in coming. Mr. Conway, an American who moved to Tuvalu as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer more than 20 years ago, is now married to a Tuvaluan woman with whom he has a teenage daughter, and he worries about the health effects of the borrow pits.
''People in greater numbers are starting to build next to them, over them and in them with houses on stilts,'' he said in an interview inside his sweltering office in the island's main government building. However, Mr. Conway dismissed the idea that Washington somehow owes it to Tuvalu to fill in the pits, pointing out that the runway has brought enormous economic benefits to the country.
The idea of the Americans ''filling in the borrow pits as some kind of war reparations is probably stretching it a little bit,'' he said. Still, he added, ''it is valuable land. If the borrow pits could be filled in, there would be economic value associated with it. It would dramatically improve public health by decreasing water-borne illnesses.''
For Ravina Falemi, 27, and her three small daughters, that would be a blessing. On a recent afternoon she stood holding her youngest daughter, Emma, as about a dozen half-naked children splashed around in the acrid water. One small boy stood on the narrow dirt path leading to the cluster of homes where Ms. Falemi lives, fishing in the muck with a homemade rod.
''The common sickness is diarrhea,'' she said. ''We always advise the children not to come here because of that, but sometimes small kids wash their hands in it and then come home and take a biscuit or something.''
Should the United States help with the pits? Yes, she said. But will anyone ever actually do anything about them?
''Who knows?'' she said. ''Maybe we'll just migrate for good.''

HEADLINE: Costs Seen In Income Inequality

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Income inequality has soared to the highest levels since the Great Depression, and the recession has done little to reverse the trend, with the top 1 percent of earners taking 93 percent of the income gains in the first full year of the recovery.
The yawning gap between the haves and the have-nots -- and the political questions that gap has raised about the plight of the middle class -- has given rise to anti-Wall Street sentiment and animated the presidential campaign. Now, a growing body of economic research suggests that it might mean lower levels of economic growth and slower job creation in the years ahead, as well. 
''Growth becomes more fragile'' in countries with high levels of inequality like the United States, said Jonathan D. Ostry of the International Monetary Fund, whose research suggests that the widening disparity since the 1980s might shorten the nation's economic expansions by as much as a third.
Reducing inequality and bolstering growth, in the long run, might be ''two sides of the same coin,'' research published last year by the I.M.F. concluded.
Since the 1980s, rich households in the United States have earned a larger and larger share of overall income. The 1 percent earns about one-sixth of all income and the top 10 percent about half, according to statistics compiled by the respected economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics.
For years, economists have thought of such inequality in part as a side effect of policies that fostered the country's economic dynamism -- its tax preferences for investment income, for instance. And organizations like the World Bank and the I.M.F., which is based in Washington, have generally not tackled inequality in the world head on.
But economists' thinking has changed sharply in recent years. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this year warned about the ''negative consequences'' of the country's high levels of pay inequality, and suggested an aggressive series of changes to tax and spending programs to tackle it.
The I.M.F. has cautioned the United States, too. ''Some dismiss inequality and focus instead on overall growth -- arguing, in effect, that a rising tide lifts all boats,'' a commentary by fund economists said. ''When a handful of yachts become ocean liners while the rest remain lowly canoes, something is seriously amiss.''
The concentration of income in the hands of the rich might not just mean a more unequal society, economists believe. It might mean less stable economic expansions and sluggish growth.
That is the conclusion drawn by two economists at the fund, Mr. Ostry and Andrew G. Berg. They found that in rich countries and poor, inequality strongly correlated with shorter spells of economic expansion and thus less growth over time.
And inequality seems to have a stronger effect on growth than several other factors, including foreign investment, trade openness, exchange rate competitiveness and the strength of political institutions.
For developing economies, the channels through which inequality might drag down growth seem clear. Inequality might foster political instability and lead to violence and economic destruction, for instance, a theme that fits for Arab Spring countries, like Egypt and Syria.
For the United States, such channels are now the subject of intense research interest, with economists examining whether and how the gap between the rich and the poor fueled the recession and what it might mean.
In the last few years, research by the Brookings Institution, the I.M.F. and dozens of economists at top research universities has started to coalesce into a compelling narrative.
Starting in the 1970s, earnings were squeezed for low- and middle-income households. They borrowed to improve their standards of living -- buying bigger houses than they could afford and using those houses as piggy banks. Families bet that housing prices would keep rising, making a three-bedroom outside Phoenix a safe store of wealth. But the housing bubble collapsed, and took the rest of the economy with it.
Research by Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago has also underscored the importance of deregulation. ''Starting in the early 1970s, advanced economies found it increasingly difficult to grow,'' he wrote this year. ''The shortsighted political response to the anxieties of those falling behind was to ease their access to credit. Faced with little regulatory restraint, banks overdosed on risky loans.''
Thus, inequality might help explain the recession and the sluggish recovery after it. But now, economists and policy experts are facing the thorny and politically freighted question of what the United States' inequality might mean over the next several years.
The recession seems to have cemented the country's income and wealth inequality, not reversed it. The top 10 percent earn a larger share of overall income than they have since the 1930s. The earnings of the top 1 percent took a knock during the recession, but have bounced back. In contrast, the average working family's income has continued to decline through the anemic recovery.
The distribution of wealth has become more concentrated as well. The lower income a family earns, the more wealth they tend to hold in their housing. Housing values have plummeted, and are not expected to recover for years if not decades. At the same time, many bond prices have soared and stock prices have performed well, aiding the upper-income households that tend to hold investments.
A new study by the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington, has found that the top 1 percent of households now hold a larger share of overall wealth than the bottom 90 percent does.
Policy experts and politicians across the political spectrum -- including President Obama and Mitt Romney -- argue that restoring the middle class will be crucial to driving growth. But they disagree sharply on the proper policies to do so, particularly when it comes to taxes and government transfer programs.
''What worries me is the idea that we're in a vicious cycle,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who has studied inequality extensively. ''Increasing inequality means a weaker economy, which means increasing inequality, which means a weaker economy. That economic inequality feeds into political economy, so the ability to stabilize the economy gets weaker.''
Rea S. Hederman, an economist at the right-of-center Heritage Foundation, a Washington research group, said that ''the problem is that the policies that encourage growth also encourage inequality,'' citing the preferential tax rates for investment income as an example. ''That means redistributing income is going to restrict growth.''

HEADLINE: Strong Earnings Reports at Bellwether Companies Bolster Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied on Tuesday, giving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index its best two-day advance in a month as strong earnings from Johnson & Johnson and other bellwether companies raised hopes for the rest of the quarterly reporting season.
Johnson & Johnson also increased its full-year profit outlook. Its shares rose 1.38 percent, to $69.55, helping the Dow Jones industrial average register its best day since Sept. 13, when the Federal Reserve announced its third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing. 
Goldman Sachs's earnings also beat expectations, its revenue more than doubled and it raised its quarterly dividend. But it earned less money from customers' trading, and the stock lost 1 percent, to $123.22.
Goldman's results followed upbeat earnings from Citigroup in the previous session. Shares of Citigroup rose 1.6 percent, to $37.25, after the surprising resignation of the chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. An S.& P. financial-sector index rose 0.7 percent.
The reports were among a flood of results from 80 S.& P. 500 companies as the third-quarter earnings season picks up. A spate of corporate warnings heading into the period raised worries that slower growth in Europe and China might be affecting corporate America more than previously thought.
''Financials have proven to be fairly good, and that has given the market a second push this week, compared to declines last week,'' Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam Capital Management in New York, said.
''There may be a push upward, depending on results, but we'll be waiting until economic indicators improve.''
The quarterly earnings of companies in the S.& P. 500 are expected to decline 2.3 percent from a year ago, but the forecast is a slight improvement from estimates last week, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 127.55 points, or 0.95 percent, to 13,551.78. The S.& P. 500 advanced 14.79 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,454.92. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.99 points, or 1.21 percent, to 3,101.17.
The S.& P. 500 has gained 1.8 percent in the last two days, rebounding from last week's slide of 2.2 percent. That was the benchmark index's worst week in four months.
After the bell, shares of I.B.M. fell 3 percent after the release of its results. I.B.M. closed at $211, up 1 percent in regular trading.
Shares of Intel also declined after the bell. Intel slipped more than 3 percent after the chip maker forecast gross margins for the current quarter below expectations.
During the regular session, Coca-Cola shares slipped 0.6 percent, to $37.90, after it reported a rise in earnings. The company reported quarterly revenue that was short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia.
Among other earnings reports, the insurer UnitedHealth reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, but it gave a cautious outlook. Its shares fell 1.1 percent, to $56.88.
The American economy came under pressure from abroad in September as weak global demand appeared to hold back factory output and a surge in gasoline prices dented consumers' spending power, government reports showed on Tuesday.
Other data showed only mild underlying inflation pressures, giving the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates low to revive the economy.
The Fed said industrial production rose only 0.4 percent in September, which analysts said was a sign that the cooling global economy was affecting American manufacturers.
''At a time when the economy needs all the help it can get, business spending is stalling,'' Wells Fargo said in a research note.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said a surge in the cost of gasoline pushed the Consumer Price Index up 0.6 percent in September.
Higher gasoline costs have forced many consumers to cut back on other spending.
The inflation report also showed that consumer prices excluding food and energy costs, representing the core rate of inflation, rose only 0.1 percent in September for a third consecutive month.
The government said weekly earnings for workers were flat in September when adjusted for inflation.
Another report suggested that the Fed's stimulus plan was gaining traction in the housing sector. Homebuilder sentiment reached a six-year high in October, the National Association of Home Builders said.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32, to 99 4/32, and the yield rose to 1.72 percent from 1.67 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: California Ballot Initiatives, Born in Populism, Now Come From Billionaires

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Next month, California voters will be asked to consider 11 ballot propositions whose passage would carry the full force of law, an exercise in direct democracy that traces back to the Progressive Era of the early 20th century.
This time around, though, four of them are initiatives of single rich individuals, while others are being challenged by equally wealthy critics pouring in millions of dollars to defeat them -- a sign, in this era of ''super PACs'' and Citizens United, of the increasingly sophisticated use of the populist tool by the wealthy to influence politics in the nation's most populous state.
Tom Steyer, the founder of Farallon Capital Management, a hedge fund based here, has spent $22 million on Proposition 39 to rescind a three-year-old tax benefit given to out-of-state companies. In an interview, Mr. Steyer said he decided to finance the initiative after leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature failed to eliminate the break themselves. 
''I'm someone who believes that actually the best thing we can have is a highly respected and competent Legislature,'' Mr. Steyer said. ''But it seemed as if there was a need for somebody to do something, and I have a bad enough temper that I figured I wasn't going to wait any longer.''
Joining Mr. Steyer on their own deep-pocketed crusades are George Joseph, a billionaire insurance executive hoping to change the state's auto insurance laws; Chris Kelly, a former Facebook executive who has spent $2.1 million on a proposal to crack down on human traffickers that critics say is intended to burnish his own future political prospects; and Molly Munger, the wealthy daughter of Warren E. Buffett's partner at Berkshire Hathaway, who has mounted a tax initiative aimed at derailing Gov. Jerry Brown's tax initiative.
To be sure, rich individuals have sponsored ballot initiatives to advance pet projects in the past. But now they are doing so in greater numbers and using their resources to build coalitions with like-minded groups to increase the success rate of their initiatives and actually help set government policy, experts said.
''Their level of giving is something we haven't seen before,'' said Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a private organization that has long tracked the money behind ballot initiatives. ''We've seen companies giving that much, and unions and PACs that have a lot at stake giving $10, $20 million in an election, but you didn't see that so much for individual donors. So that's something that is bringing us to a new level this cycle.''
Supporters say the ballot initiatives will help break the partisan gridlock in Sacramento. Critics say that the increasing involvement of rich individuals perverts the original intent of the initiatives, established by reformers like California's Gov. Hiram W. Johnson to empower the electorate and curtail the influence of the Gilded Age's special interests.
''Hiram Johnson would probably be turning over in his grave, since he gave us the initiative process to fight the railroad barons,'' said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. ''There has been no ballot in modern history with this type of concentration of millionaire and billionaire wealth behind it. If this was a reality TV show, we'd call it the billionaire ballot.''
Consumer Watchdog has spent $72,500 to fight the initiative to change auto insurance laws, Proposition 33, which is being bankrolled almost single-handedly by Mr. Joseph, the insurance executive. He has funneled $16 million into the initiative, which would lower rates for drivers with continued coverage. Opponents argue that the measure, which could raise rates for drivers who have not maintained coverage, would hurt the poor.
Mr. Steyer's opponents argue that repealing the out-of-state tax break would make California less competitive in attracting businesses from other states. But they appeared to have given up the fight against Proposition 39, having spent a total of just $56,000.
''What was it they say in 'The Untouchables'?'' Mr. Steyer said, explaining that he did not regret his lopsided spending. ''Don't take a knife to a gunfight.''
The popularity of ballot initiatives has kept growing since the passing of the landmark Proposition 13 in 1978, which capped property tax rates and cut $5 million in taxes. But the cost of placing an initiative on the ballot and waging a campaign has grown exponentially, so nearly no initiatives have been driven purely by volunteers in recent decades, said Mark Baldassare, president of the Public Policy Institute of California.
An industry of political consultants and signature-gathering companies supports a thriving business in which just placing an initiative on the ballot can cost $3 million.
For the rich, even though voters endorse only a third of ballot initiatives, the process provides a more direct, high-profile way of exercising political influence than running for office or backing a candidate. The potential impact can also go beyond California's borders because of its history as a bellwether.
''You're not sure of winning, but if you do, it's a huge win,'' said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at University of California, San Diego. ''You can spend $15 million of your own money and change a fundamental law in one of the world's biggest economies.''
Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor in part after establishing his political credentials by spending $1 million to sponsor an education initiative in 2002. The initiative has since become an attractive option for those with political aspirations.
Mr. Kelly, a former chief privacy officer at Facebook who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general of California in 2010, has spent his millions on Proposition 35, which would establish longer sentences for human traffickers. Some, including advocates for human trafficking victims, have opposed the initiative as well intentioned but poorly formed. But none have raised money to challenge it.
Others have questioned the motive behind the initiative, which experts say is the kind that could pass the Legislature.
''It could be something that makes Chris Kelly say: 'Hey, I brought you this initiative. It was backed by 80 percent of the people, and this is going to help launch my career,' '' Mr. Kousser said.
Even before Californians vote yes or no, the self-financed initiatives are having an outsize impact on government.
With more than three weeks left before Election Day, Ms. Munger, the daughter of Charles Munger and a civil rights lawyer, has already spent $31 million on her tax-raising initiative, Proposition 38, which could derail Governor Brown's own tax-increase plan, Proposition 30. Her brother, Charles Jr., a physicist, has funneled $22 million into efforts against the governor's measure and in support of yet another initiative to outlaw political donations by labor unions.
Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Proposition 38, which would redirect the extra tax revenues toward education, waved away criticism that rich individuals like Ms. Munger have an undue influence through the ballot initiatives. He said that the political establishment behind the governor's plan was also attacking Ms. Munger, whom a leader of the campaign against Proposition 38 compared to Marie Antoinette.
''This is a classic battle between an idealistic outsider and the Praetorian Guard of the status quo,'' Mr. Ballard said.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Project Survives a Case of Bad Timing

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- An $8.5 billion city within a city called CityCenter Las Vegas -- built in this gambling town's heyday but opened after the recession had set in -- continues to struggle, though it is benefiting from growing numbers of visitors to the area.
One of the largest privately financed developments in the United States, the 67-acre project on the Strip took five years to design and build, and opened in late 2009 to much fanfare. But the towers at CityCenter brought about 5,900 hotel rooms to Las Vegas, expanding its hotel inventory by almost 5 percent at a time when the number of visitors had fallen by about 2.85 million since 2007.
At the same time, CityCenter also loaded the ravaged Las Vegas market with nearly 2,400 high-end condos, including condo-hotel units, and an upscale shopping center with potentially half a million square feet of luxury shops. 
Nearly three years since it opened, CityCenter is seen as, at best, a qualified success. A majority of the hotel rooms have been filled, but at much lower room rates than originally planned. Condominium sales have not taken off, though, and the units that have sold have gone at big discounts. Many luxury retailers have moved into the shopping center, but about 12 percent of the mall is still vacant.
As sales trickled in, CityCenter eventually turned about 1,350 units at its condo-hotel Vdara into regular hotel rooms, while it leases out to vacationers about 70 percent of the approximately 150 units that it sold, said Bill McBeath, president and chief operating officer of CityCenter.
At CityCenter's sixth tower, the Harmon, which was intended to be a 49-story condo-hotel, construction was stopped by Clark County because of construction defects in mid-2008. At the time, CityCenter's owners -- MGM Resorts International, the publicly held casino operator, and Dubai World, an investment arm of the Dubai government -- announced they would cap the structure at the 26th floor and kill plans for the approximately 200 condos. The Harmon never opened.
Since then, the Harmon has been embroiled in a lawsuit over contractor payment, and MGM Resorts has announced plans to demolish the building -- plans that have been held up by the lawsuit. Residents and businesses on the Strip have been watching the building's continuing plight, debating whether it will end with a potentially colorful trial, now scheduled for mid-2013.
Many have also been trying to assess CityCenter's full impact on the local economy.
CityCenter ''opened at a bad moment,'' said John Stater, a research and geographic information systems manager at Colliers International-Las Vegas. ''It was something that MGM really wanted to do, but in terms of the local economy, I think it's debatable whether it was pulling a lot of new visitors into Las Vegas.''
Mr. Stater said he believed CityCenter was obviously ''cannibalizing other businesses in Las Vegas'' and may have contributed to the closing of the Sahara Hotel and Casino in 2011. But Mr. Stater said he also believed that CityCenter had finally been fully absorbed by the local economy.
According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the gambling city has nearly recovered the visitors lost because of the recession. Michael Mixer, a managing partner of Colliers International-Las Vegas, said that by dropping hotel rates drastically, CityCenter has kept its occupancy up, and Las Vegas has been able to absorb the new hotel rooms.
''When CityCenter opened, Las Vegas was at the depth of the recession,'' he said. ''The initial forecast room rates were unachievable at that time, and a lower-than-market average occupancy was experienced.'' But as they discounted their hotel rates, he added, ''they achieved a higher occupancy at the expense of lower-tiered properties, within the MGM family and others. This was a flight to a higher quality when given similar price points.''
At Aria, CityCenter's 4,000-room hotel and casino, results announced by MGM in the second quarter of 2012 showed occupancy at 93 percent and an average daily rate of $201. At Vdara, occupancy was 89 percent and the average daily rate was $161. In May 2009, Aria initially was booking rooms ranging from $179 to $799 a night, and suites ranging from $500 to $7,500 a night.
CityCenter's condos tell a similar tale of slashed prices, but in their case, prices may not yet be low enough. Tony Dennis, an executive vice president for the residential division at CityCenter, said CityCenter will soon introduce a new marketing effort, aimed largely at international buyers. This effort will most likely occur in the new year and will offer condos at even lower prices. At the same time, CityCenter has taken on the role of financier, assisting about a third of its buyers with loans, he said.
Currently, at CityCenter's Mandarin Oriental, 65 units out of 225 have sold; at the two-tower Veer, 272 units of 669 have sold; and at Vdara, about 156 of the 1,495 units sold before the conversion to a hotel.
''Back in the day, at Mandarin, we were priced at about $1,600 a square foot on average, and today we're priced at $840 a foot,'' Mr. Dennis said. ''And I think that still is a little high for the market. At Veer, in 2007, we were priced at $1,000 a foot, and we're now at just over $600 a foot.''
Total residential revenue to date from condos and condo-hotel units is about $393 million, Mr. Dennis said.
Given the adverse conditions of the Las Vegas real estate and tourism market in 2008 and 2009, CityCenter's condo sales and hotel bookings stand out in comparison to some other Las Vegas businesses. There are plenty of examples of half-finished or never-started hotels and commercial projects in Las Vegas, both on the Strip and off.
At Crystals, CityCenter's 500,000-square-foot luxury mall, upscale retailers have been slowly leasing storefronts, from Gucci and Prada to Hermes and Tiffany & Company. The center still has to lease its 30,000-square-foot third floor and is close to leasing the last three spaces on the lower floors, Mr. McBeath said.
''As the retailers have enjoyed the success, and the growth in same-store sales,'' he said, demand for the remaining spaces has risen. CityCenter doesn't release its leasing rates or revenue-per-square-foot figures.
CityCenter officials said that the development had created about 11,000 jobs for Las Vegas, and added a significant $40 million public art program on its campus, with work by artists like Henry Moore, Maya Lin, Claes Oldenburg and Frank Stella.
While Las Vegas is a city of novelty and reinvention, real estate experts said the city cannot support much new development. Construction has started on two giant Ferris wheels modeled after the London Eye, and a third one is rumored. Some smaller hotels and shopping centers have also started construction, but there is almost no new hotel casino development anywhere on the Strip, Mr. Mixer said.
''The rising occupancy and rate numbers we are beginning to see in our market still won't support new development,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pregnant Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Why Women Hide Their Pregnancies'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 7): 
Kudos to Alissa Quart for highlighting the fact that most pregnant workers are not in the position of Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's new chief executive, and often experience negative treatment during their pregnancy or childbirth recovery period, or both. But combating pregnancy discrimination is more than an issue of ethics; it's an issue of women's health and economic security.
Pregnant workers, especially women in physically demanding jobs, are often pushed out on unpaid leave or, even worse, fired from their jobs for simply following doctor's orders.
No pregnant woman should have to choose between her job and a healthy pregnancy. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would make clear that employers must provide reasonable accommodations for ''pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions,'' just as they do for disabilities under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Ultimately, the legislation would not only create a more honest and equitable society, but it would also create a healthier, more economically secure one for women and families.

HEADLINE: The Truth That Was Obscured After Protesters Were Killed

BYLINE: By DAVID ROONEY

 BODY:
Sociopolitical themes are invariably woven into the fabric of the great contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel's works, but few are as direct in their focus as ''The Freedom of the City,'' which is being given a trenchant revival at the Irish Repertory Theater. 
Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates this 1973 play's multiple perspectives, the drama steadily tightens its grip, right up to its shattering conclusion. Given that the outcome is revealed from the start, and that there are somewhat didactic detours along the way, the play's emotional impact is especially noteworthy.
Echoing the events of Jan. 30, 1972, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, Mr. Friel's play concerns the fictional shooting of three unarmed civilians by British soldiers after a civil rights march in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, -- referred to here, and by Irish nationalists, as Derry -- in 1970.
As a British magistrate (John C. Vennema) conducts a fact-finding inquiry into the deaths, the action mainly flashes back and forth between the inquiry and the aftermath of a peaceful protest, when three strangers ducked into a building for cover as the police and military amped up the aggression, and tear gas saturated the air. The three find themselves in the Lord Mayor's private parlor of the Guildhall, unaware that their presence is perceived as a terrorist occupation by the gathering forces outside.
The undercurrent of sorrowful anger in Mr. Friel's writing here makes it emphatically evident that no one but the three people in the mayor's chambers that day has an accurate picture of what took place.
That is certainly the case with the judge, who willfully ignores inconsistent testimony in the interests of swiftly exonerating the British. It applies equally to the sympathetic Irish priest (Ciaran Byrne), who is convinced of the injustice but ready to blame subversives within the protest movement; and the balladeer (Clark Carmichael) beatifying the victims as folk heroes.
The same goes for a television news reporter providing purple commentary and an American sociologist offering patronizing insight into the subculture of poverty, both played by Christa Scott-Reed, who veers into caricature.
Charlie Corcoran's set and Michael Gottlieb's mercurial lighting help create an immersive atmosphere in this taut production. But the play is distinguished most of all by the incisive characterizations of the Guildhall three, their contrasting outlooks elucidated in the piercing monologues that herald their deaths.
Michael (James Russell) is an unemployed idealist clinging to a heartbreakingly misguided belief that their innocence will prevail. Skinner (Joseph Sikora) is a self-described ''freeman of the city,'' rough in manners but eloquent in his conviction that everyone has a basic right to live with dignity. And Lily (Cara Seymour) is a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water.
Those three lead performances -- Ms. Seymour's the most quietly wrenching -- put a haunting human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
''The Freedom of the City'' continues through Nov. 25 at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org.

HEADLINE: Courting the Next Generation of the Rich

BYLINE: By CHARLES PAIKERT

 BODY:
ON most weekday afternoons, Jason Franklin is frenetically busy in his crowded office on West 38th Street in Manhattan, fielding calls or pushing projects forward as the executive director of Bolder Giving, a nonprofit organization that promotes philanthropy.
But for several days in mid-August, Mr. Franklin, 32, decamped to a radically different environment, the bucolic Sundance Resort near Park City, Utah, where he happily unplugged to attend a biannual conference sponsored by the Threshold Foundation for young adults from wealthy families.
''You're able to learn new skills, which is certainly valuable,'' said Mr. Franklin, who has participated in a number of similar so-called next-generation programs over the last eight years. ''But these types of programs, especially the one at Threshold, are also about community. It's a network of individuals with wealth, and it's a place where you can become comfortable with that part of your identity.'' 
Programs for the next generation of wealth holders have exploded in popularity. Covering topics as various as financial literacy, prenuptial agreements and managing family dynamics, the programs are offered by large financial institutions like Citi Private Bank, business schools and organizations for wealthy families like the Family Office Exchange and the Institute for Private Investors. Family offices, the professional organizations that manage the financial and personal affairs of wealthy families, are also sponsors.
A big reason for the popularity of ''NextGen'' programs is fear among financial institutions of losing the children of their wealthy clients as future customers. The concern is well founded. According to Victor Preisser, co-founder of the Institute for Preparing Heirs, more than 90 percent of heirs change financial advisers after receiving their inheritance.
What is more, a lot of wealth is expected to pass from one generation to another over the next several decades, about $40 trillion worth, according to ''The Race for Next-Generation Assets,'' a report released by Aite Group in July.
All that wealth creates a robust demand for educational programs to help young people deal with its complexities.
The mind-set of baby boomer parents has contributed to the popularity of NextGen programs, said Jamie McLaughlin, a former wealth management executive who is a consultant to wealthy families and financial advisory companies that cater to them.
''The age of the effete trust fund kid is over, due to the boomer parents' collective drive and ethos as well as this dismal economic cycle,'' said Mr. McLaughlin, who is based in Darien, Conn. ''Conspicuous consumption is out; purposefulness is in.''
For the children of boomers, networking with peers around the world is a major selling point of NextGen events, said Edouard Thijssen, 25, an entrepreneur from Brussels. He most recently attended a NextGen program at the annual fall forum of the Chicago-based Family Office Exchange, a profit-making group providing education and consulting to wealthy families and family offices.
''It's great to connect with people from all over the world who have the same issues as you do and exchange ideas,'' Mr. Thijssen said. ''You can ask advice about things you would never ask at home.''
Given privacy concerns, especially in the social media era, wealthy families are reluctant to discuss personal issues outside the safe confines of peer programs. That makes scions like Mr. Thijssen and Mr. Franklin, himself a media-wise promoter of philanthropy, exceptions in discussing their experiences.
''I recently received a small distribution from my grandfather's estate, and I wanted to explore socially responsible investing options,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''The first people I called were those I had met at events who I knew had more experience in the field than I did.''
One of the most prominent programs is Citi Private Bank's next-generation program. Started 10 years ago with about 20 young people attending, the weeklong summer programs are now presented in New York, London and Singapore, drawing nearly 150 people this year.
The participants, mostly in their 20s, are invited by a family financial adviser to learn investing fundamentals like asset classes, the yield curve, entrepreneurship and family legacy planning. They take part in mock trading exercises and go to Christie's for a simulated auction to learn about investing in art.
''People take positions and it gets very animated,'' said Money K, who runs Citi's Global program. (A Tamil Indian based in Singapore, Money is his real first name and K, his preferred last name, is the first letter of his long and hard-to-pronounce surname.) ''We want the program to be interactive as much as possible.''
He described the generation of wealthy children born in the 1980s as ''very digital, very entrepreneurial and very global.''
''A big selling point for them is meeting like-minded people from around the world,'' he said, adding that a third of the participants in each city live elsewhere.
Joseph Schorr, 27, a co-founder of a technology business in New York who attended Citi's program in June, said via e-mail that he liked its educational content, ''in particular the overview of the current market and its investment structures.'' But he said ''the biggest benefit by far was the people we met, both attending the program as well as those invited to speak.''
Some degree of marketing from financial firms comes with the territory at NextGen programs, ''but nobody does a hard sell,'' Mr. Franklin said. He has also attended events hosted by Redwoods Initiative, a nonprofit organization specializing in educating younger members of wealthy families; the Council on Foundations, a trade association for philanthropic groups; and Resource Generation, an organization of socially conscious heirs.
Those who have attended NextGen programs enthusiastically recommended them, and offered advice. ''No one program you sign up for will answer every question you have,'' Mr. Franklin cautioned. ''But think of the different programs as a continuing learning process.''
Mr. Thijssen urged those considering a NextGen program to think hard about what they want to achieve. ''Speak with people who have similar profiles and implement what you've learned when you come back,'' he said.
Some programs are free. Classes offered by organizations tend to charge a fee. NextGen programs at a Family Office Exchange event, for example, can cost $1,200 to $3,200.

He waited all of 45 seconds to make clear he came not just ready for a fight but ready to pick one.
President Obama, who concluded that he was ''too polite'' in his first debate with Mitt Romney, made sure no one would say that after their second. He interrupted, he scolded, he filibustered, he shook his head.
He tried to talk right over Mr. Romney, who tried to talk over him back. The president who waited patiently for his turn last time around forced his way into Mr. Romney's time this time. At one point, he squared off with Mr. Romney face to face, almost chest to chest, in the middle of the stage, as if they were roosters in a ring.
''What Governor Romney said just isn't true.'' 
''Not true, Governor Romney, not true.''
''What you're saying is just not true.''
For a president teetering on the edge of a single term, making a more forceful case at Hofstra University on Long Island on Tuesday night could hardly have been more imperative. Thirteen days after he took presidential decorum to a Xanax extreme, he tucked away a dinner of steak and potatoes and then went out on stage with plenty of red meat for anxious supporters.
Whether it will decisively reroute the course of the campaign remains to be seen, but the president emerged from the encounter having settled nerves within his panicky party and claiming a new chance to frame the race with just three weeks left.
Heading into the evening, the Obama camp said that he needed at least a draw to mute the commotion over the first debate and drain some of the potential drama from the final meeting next Monday. But the risk, of course, was that an acerbic confrontation could turn off the very swing voters he covets.
The strategy for Tuesday night was clear: undercut Mr. Romney's character and credibility by portraying him as lying about his true positions on issues like taxes and abortion. Time and again, Mr. Obama questioned whether the man on stage with him was the same ''severely conservative'' candidate who tacked right in the Republican primaries.
He painted Mr. Romney as a tool of big oil who is soft on China, hard on immigrants, politically crass on Libya and two-faced on guns and energy. He deployed many of the attack lines that went unused in Denver, going after Mr. Romney's business record, his personal income taxes and, in the debate's final minutes, his comments about the 47 percent of Americans he once deemed too dependent on government.
''Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan,'' Mr. Obama charged. ''He has a one-point plan,'' which is to help the rich, he said.
He mocked Mr. Romney by noting that he once closed a coal plant as the governor of Massachusetts. ''Now suddenly you're a big champion of coal,'' he said.
As for trade, he said, ''Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.''
And he pressed Mr. Romney for not disclosing how he would pay for his tax and deficit reduction goals. ''We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood,'' he said.
Mr. Romney held his own and gave as good as he got, presenting Mr. Obama as a failed president who has piled on trillions of dollars of debt, left millions of Americans without work, bungled security for American personnel in Libya, done nothing to reform entitlement programs and deserted a middle class ''crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.''
But it was Mr. Obama who was the central story line of the night, his performance coming across as a striking contrast to that of his first face-off with Mr. Romney. For days leading up to Tuesday night's encounter, Mr. Obama huddled in a Virginia resort with advisers to practice a more aggressive approach without appearing somehow inauthentic or crossing over a line of presidential dignity. It was a line he would stride up to repeatedly over the course of more than 90 minutes, and some will argue that he slipped over it at times.
Along the way, he ducked some questions. He never directly answered a voter who asked whether it was the government's responsibility to try to lower gasoline prices, instead giving his stump speech on energy. Nor did he respond directly to another voter who asked who denied extra security to diplomats in Libya and why, although he did say, ''I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there.''
Nor did he offer an extensive articulation of what his forward-looking agenda would be for a second term beyond, essentially, arguing that electing his opponent would be moving back to failed policies of the past.
His aggressive approach came as no surprise to Mr. Romney's camp. It was clear from the start when Mr. Obama made sure to use the first question -- from a college student worried about finding a job -- to jab Mr. Romney for opposing the way the president went about the auto industry bailout of 2009.
With each question that followed came another attack. When it was not his turn, Mr. Obama sat on a stool and looked at Mr. Romney as he talked, rather than staring down and taking notes as he did in Denver. There was little smirking, though he did project at times an air of tolerant dismissal.
Evidently intent on redeeming himself by getting in all the points he failed to get in last time, Mr. Obama pushed right past time limits and at one point even refused to yield when the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, tried to rein him in.
''I want to make sure our timekeepers are working,'' he complained when she tried to stop him on another occasion -- never mind that at that point CNN's time clock showed that he had spoken 19 minutes and 50 seconds, compared with 17 minutes and 17 seconds for Mr. Romney.
By the end, he had dominated the clock, consuming 44 minutes and four seconds to 40 minutes and 50 seconds for Mr. Romney.
If that sort of score keeping gave it the feel of an athletic competition, Mr. Obama might not object. Aides and friends have long said he is a clutch player on the basketball court, the kind who turns in listless performances during practice but raises his level when the game is on the line.
The game was on the line Tuesday night, and he scored some points. But the final buzzer is still 20 days away.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy For Maker Of Batteries

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and MATTHEW L. WALD; Matthew L. Wald reported from Washington.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The troubled battery maker A123 Systems filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, dealing a blow to the Obama administration's program to jump-start a domestic battery industry and spur development of electric vehicles.
The company's bankruptcy filing was unexpected, since it struck a deal in August to sell a majority stake to a Chinese auto parts manufacturer. That agreement, with the Wanxiang Group, provided an apparent lifeline to the company. But A123, which has received federal grant money, said the Wanxiang deal was never completed, and on Monday, it failed to make a debt payment due on $75 million it had borrowed from Wanxiang.
In announcing its bankruptcy filing, A123 said it had agreed to sell its automotive assets and factories to Johnson Controls, another American battery producer that has benefited from federal assistance, in a deal it valued at $125 million. 
A123, based in Waltham, Mass., was once considered one of the most promising grant recipients under the administration's $2 billion stimulus program for electric car development. The Department of Energy awarded the company a $249 million grant to establish battery manufacturing operations in Michigan, although A123 had received only about $132 million of the grant before its bankruptcy.
The company's failure may well become a political football in the presidential campaign, in which energy policy has been a leading topic. The Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, has repeatedly criticized President Obama for his heavy spending on green-energy programs, including a $528 million loan to Solyndra, a solar module maker that went bankrupt last year.
''A123's bankruptcy is yet another failure for the president's disastrous strategy of gambling away billions of taxpayer dollars on a strategy of government-led growth that simply does not work,'' said Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney's press secretary, in a statement on Tuesday.
The Energy Department defended the federal grant to A123 as one of many bipartisan efforts to support American manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. A department official, Dan Leistikow, said in a blog post that the administration had awarded $2 billion in grants to 29 companies involved in the electrification of vehicles, creating thousands of jobs.
A123 has used about $132 million of its grant to date, plus another $6 million given in 2007 by the Bush administration, said Mr. Leistikow, the agency's director of public affairs. Michigan has also given A123 a $9 million grant, plus various tax breaks.
Mr. Leistikow said the federal money would not be wasted because A123's two Michigan factories would now be operated by Johnson Controls.
''In an emerging industry, it's very common to see some firms consolidate with others as the industry grows and matures,'' he said.
The department previously gave Johnson Controls, based in Wisconsin, its own $299 million federal grant for an electric-car battery project.
The Solyndra bankruptcy, which became the subject of Congressional hearings, stoked concerns about oversight of government-backed energy programs.
Another battery manufacturer that received federal help, Ener1, went bankrupt in January. It had approval for $118.5 million in grants from the Energy Department but had received only about half of that when it entered bankruptcy.
A123 was a centerpiece of the government's electric-vehicle program, opening two factories in Michigan and securing contracts to supply batteries to automakers including General Motors and the start-up firm Fisker Automotive.
But its financial stability has been in question for more than a year. The company suffered a major setback when it had to recall defective batteries in Fisker cars. And despite orders from carmakers, A123 could not generate sufficient revenue or profit from the slowly growing market for electric vehicles.
In August, A123 surprised industry experts by agreeing to sell up to 80 percent of the company to the American arm of the Wanxiang Group, China's largest auto parts manufacturer.
Political opponents of the Wanxiang deal asserted that the Chinese company would get access to technology and products made possible by the support of American taxpayers.
One of the critics, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the sale of A123's factories to Johnson Controls was ''something positive'' because it kept the company's assets out of Chinese hands.
But Mr. Grassley and Senator John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, criticized the Energy Department, saying it ignored warning signs that A123 was faltering.
''The bankruptcy raises the prospect that the taxpayers will get little or no return on their investment in A123 and will lose millions of dollars,'' Mr. Grassley said.
The Energy Department countered that A123's employees and customers would be absorbed by a larger, stronger competitor in Johnson Controls.
''A123's manufacturing facilities and technology will continue to be a vital part of America's advanced battery industry,'' said Mr. Leistikow.
Wanxiang, which has its United States headquarters outside Chicago, pledged in August to invest up to $465 million in A123, but the deal fell apart for undisclosed reasons.
''We determined not to move forward with the previously announced Wanxiang agreement as a result of unanticipated and significant challenges to its completion,'' said David Vieau, A123's chief executive, in a statement.
Instead, the company found a new suitor in Johnson Controls, which analysts say is now in position to be the dominant American battery manufacturer.
A123 said filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection would ease the sale of its automotive assets to Johnson Controls. The deal includes Michigan plants in the Detroit suburbs in Livonia and Romulus, as well as A123's equity interest in battery facilities in China.
Johnson Controls said it would provide $72.5 million in financing for A123's reorganization in bankruptcy.
''We believe that A123's automotive capabilities are a good complement to our existing portfolio and will further advance Johnson Controls' position as a market leader in this industry,'' said Alex Molinaroli, head of the power systems unit of Johnson Controls.
Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, said in a research note that the deal would help Johnson Controls become ''the U.S.-based player'' in the market for lithium-ion batteries.
A123 has also received ''significant interest'' for its remaining assets, primarily its electric-grid technology and products for commercial and government entities, said Mr. Vieau, the company's chief executive
Whether Wanxiang will bid on those assets during bankruptcy is not known. The head of the Chinese firm's United States operations, Pin Ni, said in an e-mail on Tuesday, ''Our interest and commitment has not changed'' regarding A123.

HEADLINE: In a Slow Market, Intel Exceeds Lowered Expectations

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Intel crossed an earnings bar it lowered for itself last month, but the problems plaguing its main market for semiconductors -- personal computers -- seemed no closer to ending.
Intel, the world's biggest maker of chips, is feeling pain from a global downturn in demand for personal computers. While Intel makes many kinds of chips, the ones that go into PCs are among its most profitable. The PC market is eroding, however, because of economic weakness and a shift to devices like smartphones and tablets.
Intel has fought the trend by investing in new styles of PCs that work more like tablets, by selling chips for the servers in big cloud computing data centers that connect PCs and the new devices, and by finding new uses for more powerful chips. So far, little of this has worked. 
''The problem is demand,'' said Ken Dulaney, vice president at Gartner, a technology research firm. ''People are buying other things with their disposable income for electronics, like tablets, televisions, smartphones, e-readers and gaming devices. Intel is trying to take its technology to these consumers, but this is a transition period.''
Almost no one is counting Intel out, but the rough market transition will not end soon. In a conference call with securities analysts, Paul Otellini, Intel's chief executive, said that he expected PC demand would grow at half the normal rate in the fourth quarter.
At the same time, he expressed optimism about demand because of a new computer operating system from Microsoft called Windows 8 that will be released Oct. 26. Over 100 new, lighter types of PCs with tabletlike functions would be produced by computer manufacturers using Windows 8, Mr. Otellini said. That could renew demand in 2013.
''It's pretty hard to say that in good economic cycles we wouldn't get into normal growth,'' Mr. Otellini said. ''The tablet is not the end state of computing.''
The chip maker, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said net income in the third quarter fell 14.3 percent to $3 billion, or 58 cents a share, from $3.5 billion, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $13.5 billion, down 5 percent from $14.2 billion a year earlier.
On Sept. 7, Intel warned that third-quarter revenue would be $13.2 billion after earlier projections of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Industry analysts were expecting earnings of 50 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. The stock, which fell about 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, closed in regular trading up 62 cents, or 2.85 percent, at $22.35.
For the fourth quarter, Intel projected its revenue would be $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and that its gross profit margins would shrink.
Last week the International Data Corporation, a market research firm, estimated that the worldwide PC market contracted 8.6 percent in the third quarter. The smartphone and tablet manufacturers that Intel sells to tend to have more competition and lower volumes than those in the PC market, which is about 350 million units a year.
Intel has tried to revive the PC market with a small, thin design called the ultrabook, but so far this has been unsuccessful. Recently IHS iSuppli, a market research firm, forecast that just 28 million ultrabooks would be sold in the second half of 2012, down from an earlier estimate of 35 million units.
The pain was being felt by other chip makers, too. Last week AMD said its third-quarter revenue would fall about 10 percent from the $1.4 billion recorded in the second quarter. AMD was expected to lay off a significant number of its staff. Mr. Otellini did not indicate that Intel would be laying people off.
Away from PCs, which accounted for $8.6 billion of total revenue, Intel reported revenue of $2.7 billion in its data center group, an increase of 6 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at Some of the More Hotly Disputed Assertions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, JOHN M. BRODER, SHARON LaFRANIERE, RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr., RICHARD PREZ-PEA and JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
At the second presidential debate, everyone played fact-checker.
President Obama said, ''Not true, Governor Romney'' to dismiss his rival's charge that oil and gas production permits and licenses on federal lands and waters had been cut in half over the past four years. (They have declined, but not by half).
Mitt Romney said at one point, ''Let me go back and speak to the points that the president made, and let's get them correct'' after Mr. Obama falsely charged that he had called the strict Arizona immigration law ''a model for the nation.'' (Mr. Romney has spoken favorably of the state's immigration law, but the ''model'' Arizona law he talked about was the mandatory use of a federal electronic verification system to check the immigration status of new hires.)
And the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, got into the act, too, when Mr. Romney challenged Mr. Obama's assertion that he had gone into the Rose Garden the day after the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and called it an act of terror. 
''You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror?'' Mr. Romney said disbelievingly. He later added: ''I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.''
''Get the transcript,'' Mr. Obama replied.
Ms. Crowley interjected: ''He did in fact, sir.''
To which the president added, ''Can you say that a little louder, Candy?''
The Obama administration has been criticized for shifting assessments of what really happened in Benghazi, which continued to change over the course of two weeks. But the day after the attacks, Mr. Obama did say, ''No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.''
There were plenty of questionable assertions at the second presidential debate. Here is a look at some of them:
Energy Policies
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney carried out an extended dispute over energy policy that wandered into a thicket of half-truths, started by a question about gasoline prices that was never fully addressed.
Mr. Romney, describing Mr. Obama as hostile to traditional energy sources, repeated his assertion that all of the increase in domestic oil and gas production in the past three years had come on private, not public, lands and that the Obama administration had cut the number of oil and gas drilling permits on public lands in half. Neither assertion is quite true.
Oil and gas production on public lands has fluctuated during the Obama administration, but it has increased modestly (about 13 percent for oil and about 6 percent for gas) in the first three years of the Obama presidency, compared with the last three years of the administration of President George W. Bush, according to an analysis from the Energy Information Administration.
The Interior Department produced a report this year showing that drilling permits received and issued by the agency had indeed declined from the last years of the Bush administration to the first years of the Obama administration -- but not by half. (In the 2007 fiscal year, the government issued 8,964 permits to drill on public lands; in 2008 the figure was 7,846. The numbers for 2009 and 2010 were 5,306 and 5,237.)
Mr. Obama said that 7,000 drilling permits had been granted but were not being used by oil companies, an accurate figure, according to the Interior Department.
Mr. Obama stated that renewable energy production had doubled during his presidency, which is true, and that oil imports were at their lowest level in 16 years, also accurate. He also said that the boom in natural gas production could produce 600,000 new jobs, a highly optimistic estimate, but he qualified it with the word ''potentially.''
But Mr. Obama mischaracterized Mr. Romney's energy plan, saying it was written by oil companies and favored only traditional sources of energy: oil, gas and coal. But Mr. Romney's energy plan does include a place for renewables, although he would sharply cut back on federal subsidies for wind, solar and other alternative energy sources. JOHN M. BRODER
Tariff on Chinese Tires
Mr. Obama said, ''We had to make sure that China was not flooding our market with cheap tires,'' and therefore took action to save 1,000 jobs. It is true that in 2009, the Obama administration imposed a duty on Chinese tires, but last month the administration let the tariff expire.
The United Steelworkers Union, an Obama political supporter, sought the action, and many economists criticized it as politically motivated.
A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariff protected at most 1,200 American jobs. But last year alone, the institute found, it cost American consumers $1.1 billion in higher-priced tires.
Moreover, China responded by imposing tariffs on imports of American chicken parts that cost American poultry producers an estimated $1 billion. Last month, the Obama administration quietly let the tire tariff expire. Critics say it recognized that the economic costs of the sanction were too great. SHARON LaFRANIERE
Relations With Israel
Mr. Romney said that ''the president said that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.'' Is he correct?
Mr. Romney's campaign cites a newspaper account of a meeting with Jewish leaders at the White House in 2009 as evidence for Mr. Romney's statement. In that account, published in The Washington Post, people at the meeting said Mr. Obama had said that ''there was no space between us and Israel'' during the Bush administration, which he said had hurt the ability of the United States to influence Israeli actions or cajole Arab nations. ''When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Obama as saying.
An Obama administration official said they did not know whether Mr. Obama made that statement during a private meeting.
The newspaper account did not quote Mr. Obama as explicitly stating that his ''goal'' was to put distance between the United States and Israel, as Mr. Romney characterized Mr. Obama's intentions during a recent speech.
Instead, the account indicates that Mr. Obama was complaining that what he suggested was the Bush administration's unwillingness to challenge the Israelis had reduced the American government's leverage over Israel and hurt its reputation with Muslim countries. At the same time, a plain reading of the account would also suggest that Mr. Obama wanted for his administration to be seen as less of a rubber stamp for Israel than the Bush administration was.
Obama administration officials have said that there is no daylight whatsoever between the United States and Israel on the issue of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
Pell Grants for College
Mr. Romney said he wanted to keep the Pell Grant program growing. This is a new position for him.
The governor and his campaign have repeatedly criticized Mr. Obama's expansion of the Pell Grant program, which they have said is unsustainable. Mr. Romney's position paper on education says he would ''refocus Pell Grants dollars on the students who need them most.''
For months, this was widely interpreted as meaning that fewer people would qualify for Pell Grants -- an issue the Romney campaign declined to clarify.
Mr. Romney would also restore banks to their role in making student loans. Mr. Obama eliminated that role and used some of the savings to pay for the Pell Grant expansion. RICHARD PREZ-PEA
Illegal Immigration
Mr. Obama said Mr. Romney's ''main strategy'' to curb illegal immigration would be to ''encourage self-deportation.''
Mr. Romney has never clarified precisely what he would do about the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. During the Republican primaries he called for tough enforcement to pressure them to leave the country. Since June he has moderated that position, saying he could support some measures that would allow a limited group to remain here legally.
Mr. Romney says he opposes any amnesty. During a primary debate in January, he said he would seek a mandatory nationwide program to verify the legal status of all new hires, expanding an existing federal program known as E-Verify, which is now voluntary. With that program in place, he said, illegal immigrants would soon discover that they could not get jobs and that ''they're going to self-deport.''
Mr. Romney was pressed for more details on the self-deportation strategy during a town hall-style meeting last month with Univision, the Spanish language network. But he did not provide them. ''I believe people make their own choices as to whether they want to go home,'' he said.
But he said he would not favor ''a mass deportation effort, rounding people up, 12 million people.'' Mr. Romney said, ''Our system is not to deport people.''
He has said he would support giving permanent resident green cards to illegal immigrants who serve in the military, a group probably numbering in the tens of thousands.
Mr. Romney has said he will ''put in place a permanent solution'' for illegal immigration, but he has not described what it would look like or how he would get around the roadblocks in Congress that stalled Mr. Obama's efforts to pass legislation. Most Republican lawmakers in Washington have rejected any legal status for illegal immigrants, calling it amnesty. JULIA PRESTON

HEADLINE: As Two Iowa Incumbents Compete, the White House Race Reverberates

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
CRESTON, Iowa -- As the sun fell behind a nearby barn, Representatives Tom Latham and Leonard L. Boswell nipped at each other with unconcealed disdain begotten by months of negative advertisements and campaign miles.
The setting, a tiny radio station situated more or less in an open field, could not have felt farther from Washington and the race for the presidency.
But the two men, locked in one of the hardest-fought House races in the country, are finding their campaign inextricably tied to the race for the White House as Iowa emerges as one of the most contested states between Mitt Romney and President Obama. Just last week, Mr. Latham, a Republican, appeared with Mr. Romney at a rally near Van Meter, Iowa, and former President Bill Clinton came to Des Moines to stump for Mr. Boswell, a Democrat.
Mr. Boswell, who has struggled to raise money, is depending on Mr. Obama's extensive operation in the state, which exceeds Mr. Romney's, to help him. ''I would say his campaign has an impact on mine,'' Mr. Boswell said. 
Mr. Latham, in contrast, has generally labored to keep his campaign largely independent from the fight for the White House, no doubt hopeful that if Mr. Romney fails to win Iowa, he can still prevail in his own southern part of the state. ''I don't see Governor Romney getting more of the vote than I would here,'' Mr. Latham said. ''Some undecided people are going with us.''
Mr. Latham's positioning reflects not only what is needed to win independent voters in his district, but also the problem Mr. Romney has created for some Republicans in Iowa with his opposition to subsidies for wind power, a major economic force here. Mr. Latham has openly disagreed with Mr. Romney on the tax break.
Redistricting, which cost Iowa one of its five House seats, has left these two long-serving incumbents vying for a new district with roughly the same number of Republicans, Democrats and independent voters and stretches through a rural area from Des Moines to the Nebraska border.
For all its local vim, this race has been a remarkable mirror of the federal campaign, with copious spending by outside groups, murky polling data and escalating nastiness.
Just as many voters in swing states remain undecided about the presidential race, interviews with voters in Des Moines -- the heart of Polk County, where both sides believe this race will be won -- show that some hyper-informed voters from both parties are torn about this election, too.
Mr. Boswell ''has done a lot of great things over the years,'' said Patrice Maurer, an independent voter who works as a fund-raiser for a nonprofit. She said she believes that Mr. Boswell would be more favorable to nonprofits than Mr. Latham. But Mr. Latham did a lot to save the 132nd Fighter Wing of the Iowa Air National Guard, she added.
She is torn, unnerved even. ''I am going to vote,'' Mrs. Maurer said, but for whom, well, who knows. She is also undecided about the presidential race.
Mr. Boswell has an advantage: Des Moines is in his current district. Further, his campaign hopes he will benefit from the nearly 30,000 ballots cast by Democrats so far in early voting, versus roughly 16,500 by Republicans.
But at 64, Mr. Latham is 14 years younger, has more money, and has a slight edge in Republican registration in the district. ''My hunch is that it is more possible for both President Obama and Congressman Latham to win than it is for Governor Romney and Congressman Boswell to win,'' said Chuck Offenburger, who runs a Web site with a focus on Iowa, citing those factors.
Mr. Boswell, he said, ''is better known across the district than Latham,'' and ''does have a proven record of winning in past races where he looked like he was whipped. But Latham is younger, a handsome devil, and is actually a moderate, as Iowa Republicans go. People in Des Moines and across southwest Iowa will be comfortable aligning with him.''
In fact, both men are moderates vis--vis their parties in Iowa, though Mr. Latham now tries to paint Mr. Boswell as Mr. Obama's policy handmaiden, and Mr. Boswell takes delight in mentioning Mr. Latham's friendship with House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, repeatedly implying that somehow their shared taste for cigarettes and golf should have produced a farm bill.
''I've always had crossovers,'' Mr. Boswell said, referring to voters. ''I'm not far left or far right.''
Given their more than 30 years of combined experience in the House, the two candidates tend to argue over their legislative records, sometimes going back to the mid-1990s to argue the fine points of what a voucher is.
Often these debates circle back to the White House race. For instance, Mr. Latham enjoys pointing out that Mr. Boswell supported the president's health care law, and Mr. Boswell, unlike some Democrats, is unapologetic. ''I did!'' he interjected in one debate.
Mr. Latham also tries to blame the White House for the stalemate over the farm bill, which House Republicans have refused to bring to the floor, saying that the administration has ''not said a word on what their position is'' on the bill. Mr. Boswell will happily campaign with anyone from the administration, which some Democrats avoid.
''We talk frequently,'' he said of Mr. Obama's campaign. ''Joe Biden was in Council Bluffs and I was included.''
Mr. Latham is quick to point out that ''we have our own operation here,'' and does not often mention Mr. Romney, preferring to talk with voters about corn prices and to attack Mr. Boswell's record. ''Mr. Romney has a pattern of changing his mind,'' Mr. Boswell said. ''How much Mr. Latham wants to tie himself to that I'm not really sure.''
Then there is the money game. Mr. Latham more than doubled Mr. Boswell's fund-raising from July through September, and began October with $1.5 million, nearly five times as much as Mr. Boswell reported on Monday. That advantage will probably give Mr. Latham more spending flexibility during the final days of the campaign.
Mr. Boswell will need any boost he can get from Mr. Obama's extensive advertising campaign and get-out-the-vote operations.
''I think I'm going back to Congress,'' he said.
Mr. Latham says the same about himself.
Only one will be right.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Squeezes Out a Profit as Its Revenue Declines

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. delivered a mixed and somewhat unsettling quarterly performance on Tuesday. Profits barely exceeded Wall Street's expectations, while revenue fell well below.
The results, analysts said, were unlikely to reassure investors concerned about the global outlook for technology spending. In a conference call with analysts, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said the revenue shortfall came from a slowdown in business, especially in September, in certain markets including the United States, where revenue fell 5 percent.
''It was surprisingly disappointing,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''All the businesses were light.'' 
In after-hours trading, I.B.M. shares fell $7.10 a share, or 3.4 percent, to $203.90. In the regular session, the company's stock price rose 1 percent, or $2.07 a share, to close at $211.00 a share.
I.B.M. is the world's largest supplier of information technology -- computer hardware, software and services -- to corporations and governments. So the company's results are watched as a gauge of technology spending trends.
But I.B.M., more than other computer companies in the corporate market, has steadily shifted its business in recent years to software and services. As a result, an estimated 40 percent of the company's revenue and 60 percent of its profits come from steady subscriptionlike businesses, mainly software license fees and services contracts. That means I.B.M. is more insulated from industry cycles than most other technology suppliers.
I.B.M. has also shed hardware businesses with low profit margins including personal computers and disk drives.
The strategy, analysts note, has been a disciplined focus on profit growth rather than enlarging its yearly revenue. The latest such step came in August, when I.B.M. sold its computerized cash register business to Toshiba.
For the third quarter, net income was flat at $3.8 billion. The reported net profit included a $160 million charge to take account of a London court ruling against I.B.M. last week involving pensions. The court ruled that some British workers could retire at 60 years old and still receive their full pensions. The company had maintained that only employees who retired at 63 should receive full pensions.
The company's operating profit of $3.62 a share, up 10 percent from the year-ago quarter, came in just above the average estimate of analysts of $3.61 a share, compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Revenue for the quarter fell 5 percent, to $24.7 billion, well below the Wall Street consensus of $25.4 billion. Excluding the effect of currency translation, revenue fell 2 percent in the quarter.
In a statement, Virginia M. Rometty, I.B.M.'s chief executive, pointed to the solid profit performance. ''In the third quarter,'' Ms. Rometty said, ''we continued to drive margin, profit and earnings growth through our focus on higher-value business, strategic growth initiatives and productivity.''
The company's gross profit margin rose 1.2 percent from the year-earlier quarter, to 48.1 percent.
I.B.M. reiterated its forecast for the year of operating earnings per share of ''at least $15.10.'' Some analysts had expected I.B.M. to raise its guidance for the year, if the quarter showed encouraging strength.
There were strong businesses in the mix for I.B.M. While many analysts had worried that the recent slowing of the Chinese economy might hit the technology sector, the company's revenue in China increased 19 percent in the quarter. New businesses that I.B.M. has earmarked for growth seem to be thriving.
Hardware revenue fell 13 percent, to $3.9 billion. But Mr. Loughridge noted that a new model of mainframe computer, which began shipping in mid-September, and other new offerings, should restore the hardware business to growth.
Software revenue slipped 1 percent, to $5.8 billion. Mr. Loughridge said a handful of software deals failed to close at the end of the quarter, and they should add to revenue in the fourth quarter.
I.B.M.'s big services business declined about 5 percent, to $14.5 billion. Signings of new contracts, an indicator of future business, reached $13.3 billion, an encouraging performance. And Mr. Loughridge said I.B.M. has been extracting itself from less-profitable deals and that revenue would suffer in the short term.
But Mr. Loughridge also said there was weakness in services for helping companies install and run traditional business software applications for human resources, procurement and managing customer relationships. That, according to Mr. Sacconaghi, the Bernstein analyst, suggests companies may be moving from traditional software applications to software provided over the Internet from remote data centers, so-called cloud computing.
I.B.M. has its own cloud offerings. But putting traditional software in place, Mr. Sacconaghi notes, is a big business for I.B.M. services. ''It at least raises a basic question about the future of that business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Health? It's Relative

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
With financial markets careening around the world, in January 2009 a newly inaugurated President Obama acknowledged he had to fix the problem pretty fast. ''If I don't have this done in three years,'' he told NBC's Matt Lauer, ''then there's gonna be a one-term proposition.''
Today, Republicans around the country are largely campaigning on the president's words. Conservative economists like Michael Bordo of Rutgers and John B. Taylor of Stanford have written columns for op-ed pages and blogs arguing that by the standard of previous American recessions, the economy should have rebounded much more strongly.
Running with this argument, Glenn Hubbard and Kevin Hassett, economic advisers to the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have accused the administration of providing a misguided short-term fiscal stimulus that ultimately contributed to a long period of below-par growth. And Mr. Romney has borrowed a tactic used by Ronald Reagan to defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980, using his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to intone ''this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off today than when he took office.'' 
Whether you are better off today than in 2009 may not be the most useful question to ask about an economy emerging from its most severe downturn in 80 years. A more illuminating question is how we have done relative to other countries that were caught in the global financial cataclysm. By that standard, economic growth in the United States has done surprisingly well.
The president's early assessment of our economic troubles was wildly optimistic. By the administration's early forecast the economy would be growing by 4.6 percent this year. Instead, it is probably going to expand just over 2 percent this year and next. Economic production per person has not recovered to its level before the recession. Unemployment is still painfully high, at 7.8 percent. The share of the population with a job remains near its lowest in 30 years.
But glance across the Atlantic. The economy of the European Union will shrink by 0.2 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. It is smaller than it was five years ago, while the American economy is 2.9 percent bigger. Even Europe's most competitive countries are slipping. The Dutch economy is shrinking. Germany and Austria are expected to grow at half the rate of the United States this year and next.
Some will argue that Europe makes for an easy comparison. The European Central Bank held the economy back for many months by refusing to slash interest rates aggressively or pump money into the economy. Germany's insistence that indebted Mediterranean countries cut government spending deepened recessions in those nations. And some other developed countries are growing faster than the United States: Canada, which didn't have a banking crisis to begin with; Australia, a big exporter of raw materials that benefited greatly from China's growth; the oil exporter Norway.
Yet the United States has recovered more quickly than other countries that don't use the euro -- including Japan, New Zealand, Denmark and Britain. The performance is all the more remarkable considering that the financial crisis that sent much of the world into recession was set off by American homeowners defaulting on their mortgages, taking down a big chunk of the nation's banking sector.
The one crucial area in which the United States has performed worse than its peers is in jobs. Joblessness is at record highs in countries like Spain and Greece. But many European countries have done a much better job of protecting employment than the United States. In Austria, Germany and Belgium, the governments paid companies to put workers on short-time work rather than lay them off. Sweden also has a longstanding wage subsidy.
Alongside stronger unions and stiffer employment regulations that make it tougher to fire workers, these countries managed to prevent soaring unemployment. Total employment in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, France and even Italy has recovered more since the financial crisis than it has in the United States. Though the United States has grown faster than France since 2007, the unemployment rate has risen higher here.
Yet the president's critics are not suggesting the government should have subsidized wages or financed more public works. Rather, they have championed the type of budget-cutting policies that have played such a large role in thwarting economic growth in Europe.
Federal Reserve officials today concede they were too slow to respond to the crisis. The Fed was nonetheless far more aggressive than the European Central Bank, quicker to drop interest rates to zero and pump money into the economy, buying government debt and other bonds. Fiscal stimulus -- an initial $800 billion package in 2009 followed by about $600 billion in payroll tax cuts and other efforts -- was bigger and more sustained than in other advanced countries. Banks in the United States were forced to raise billions in new capital, which allowed them to cope with the turbulent financial markets better than their European peers.
Every step was an uphill battle. The Republicans who took control of the House of Representatives in 2010 argued that fiscal stimulus was wasted and counterproductive, and pressed for German-style austerity. During the Republican primaries, the Texas governor, Rick Perry, accused the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, of treason for debasing the currency by printing money to buy debt.
Today, most economists say they believe that these policies provided vital support to the economy. In its most recent World Economic Outlook, published this month, the I.M.F. acknowledged that the fiscal stimulus was probably much more effective at bolstering growth than it had previously allowed.
So where does this leave President Obama's record? The Harvard economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, whose 2009 book ''This Time Is Different'' is the most comprehensive study of financial crises and their aftermath, contend that the comparison by Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Bordo and others is flawed. It mixes relatively mild recessions with deep financial crises that blew up the banking system. Recovering from the latter, they say, is painfully slow and difficult.
By Ms. Reinhart's and Mr. Rogoff's accounting, the Obama administration's record on economic growth is pretty good: ''If one really wants to focus just on United States systemic financial crises, then the recent recovery looks positively brisk,'' they conclude. Among countries that suffered as deep a financial crisis as we did since 2008 -- from Greece and Iceland to Germany and Britain -- ''the United States' output performance is, in fact, among the best.'' Even the American jobs market looks brighter when compared with other big financial crises in history.
Charles Dumas, chairman of the economic consulting firm Lombard Street Research in London, sees an American economy poised to rebound in the next presidential term. Household debt has fallen from its peak, and rock-bottom interest rates mean homeowners are spending only 14 percent of their disposable income on debt payments, the lowest level since 1992. The budget deficit is already down to 8.7 percent of economic output, from 13.3 percent in 2009. Even China is less of a problem, as high inflation has mostly eliminated its currency undervaluation.
According to most polls, President Obama is still the favorite to lead the country through such a rebound. If he loses in November, it won't be because he provided too much fiscal stimulus. It will more likely be because on arguably the most important economic variable for American voters, jobs, he didn't try hard enough.

HEADLINE: Party of Independents Analyzes and Criticizes

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
LARGO, Fla. -- Here on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, in a swing county in an important swing state, the leader of the local Independent Party gathered with several friends Tuesday night to watch the debate.
''Well, we'll see how many distortions come out tonight,'' said Ernie Bach, the Independent Party's state chairman and a longtime political activist. ''Perception is reality. Say something over and again, and people will believe it.''
He was readying his troops, all independent voters: Chuck Fechko, 63, a retired accountant; Alyse Siegrist, 76, a retired food broker; and Scott Nystrom, 33, a waiter. 
If undecided voters are sometimes seen as ''low-information voters,'' then the independents here were just the opposite -- high-information voters eager to be engaged.
They were active participants in what became their own secondary debate, providing as many questions as the on-air audience and as many answers as the candidates. They were frustrated by what they viewed as nonanswers and evasions by President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. They thought both men did well but gave the edge to the president.
Mr. Obama redeemed himself from his first debate performance, they concluded.
''If people are using the debates only as their guide as to how they will vote, then Obama certainly helped himself tonight,'' Mr. Fechko said.
Scripted, or Authentic?
The first few moments of the debate brought a discussion of appearances: ''So Romney has a blue tie on but the President is wearing red?'' Mr. Fechko said, sounding a bit amused. ''I just find it odd. But it probably has no real meaning.''
And after Mr. Obama's first several answers, Mr. Bach had an observation: ''It seems that he's trying really hard to include his talking points, but it's not coming from the heart.''
But, Ms. Siegrist interjected, ''That's what they're both doing.''
Counterpunching
Mr. Obama's first aggressive-looking jabs at Mr. Romney, on the issue of oil and gas, drew some praise.
''Throw it back at him, baby!'' Mr. Bach said.
When the candidates stepped toward each other and traded questions directly, Mr. Fechko wondered when the moderator would step in. ''The aggression is making Romney look rude, to me. He's speaking and I didn't notice Candy Crowley recognize him.''
Well, Mr. Nystrom said, ''Candy looks like she wants to interject. Here she goes.''
And she did.
As the debate became more substantive, the topic turned to Mr. Romney's tax plan. Mr. Obama said, ''Nobody who looks at it, who's serious, thinks it adds up.''
The crowd here said, ''Details, details!''
But just as quickly, the candidates and the moderator began speaking over one another.
''Somebody needs to give Crowley a cut switch for the mics,'' Mr. Bach said.
The exchange seemed frustrating and unresolved to those listening here.
Better Off, or Worse?
Will the next four years be like the last four years? And has Mr. Obama kept his promises? The group watched intently as an unenthusiastic audience member who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 pressed him on his performance.
Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Obama's policies have crushed the middle class, but Mr. Obama stated a list of his accomplishments, including killing Osama bin Laden and passing health care reform.
''The question, are you better off?'' Mr. Bach said. ''Nobody's asking, 'Are you worse off than four years ago?' That's what I want to know.''
Ms. Siegrist, who was taking notes on a legal pad with a pencil, interjected, ''Well, there are an awful lot of poor people. The numbers keep multiplying.''
Blame and Evasion
On the issue of the recent attack on American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, Mr. Romney was criticizing the president.
''I'm waiting for him to say it was the president's fault, which it seems he is hinting at,'' Mr. Bach said.
Mr. Romney was critical of Mr. Obama for taking many days to acknowledge that the attack was terrorism.
But when Ms. Crowley supported the president's assertion that he called the attack an act of terrorism in the Rose Garden on the day after it happened, Mr. Bach said, ''That's right, no distortions tonight, my friend!''
It seemed clear by now that Mr. Bach was favoring the president. But he was not completely on board.
When the question turned to gun control and Mr. Obama began a long anecdote, Mr. Bach spoke loudly toward the television: ''O.K., O.K.. What's your policy, sir? Answer!''
''He broached it but didn't answer it completely,'' Mr. Bach said.
Mr. Nystrom added: ''It's such a tough issue. It's like a lost cause.''
The Final Wrapup
Three of the participants here Tuesday night are retirees who spend a lot of their time reading news. Mr. Nystrom, the waiter, is a close follower of economic data across the states because he is hoping to leave Florida for a better job. He has a college degree in technology, and he has not been able to use it around Largo.
As such, they were highly engaged, with reactions ranging from frustrated to amused to impatient. On the issue of trade with China, for instance, Mr. Bach, Ms. Siegrist, Mr. Nystrom and Mr. Fechko had so much to say, they drowned out the television for a moment.
''China is never...
''Romney doesn't....
''Guys, guys!''
''Quiet.''
Then came the concluding statements.
Mr. Romney was faulted for reversing himself too much.
''I've watched 20 of the 22 Republican debates and I don't like that Romney has positions now that he did not have previously,'' Mr. Fechko said, listing issues such as abortion, immigration and taxes.
But Mr. Obama was also faulted for his ''wishy-washy'' position on gun control, and because his statement on the attack in Libya seemed weak.
The crowd did not want to use the terms ''winner'' and ''loser,'' but in the end, Mr. Obama seemed to have persuaded four people to give him their votes.

HEADLINE: Which Changed First, The Polls or the Markets?

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
While Wall Street has thrown the bulk of its donations behind Mitt Romney, it is not viewing his potential ascent as an entirely good thing for the markets.
Some market participants who are generally supportive of Mr. Romney's economic policies, including the influential strategist James Bianco, argue that his rise in some polls since the first presidential debate, on Oct. 3, has been a drag on the markets because of Mr. Romney's opposition to the Federal Reserve's efforts to aid the economy with monetary stimulus.
The market returns over the last two weeks provide some support for this minority view. Leading American stock indexes fell 1.5 percent in the seven days after Mr. Romney delivered his strong performance in the first debate and began to rise in some national and swing-state polls.
Tying the movement of the markets to one thing, like the election, is difficult and dangerous. And there is no shortage of other issues occupying investors these days, from China to the European debt crisis to American economic data. But the tightening of the race in the last two weeks has led to more talk about the influence the election is exerting on the markets, and vice versa. The results of the second debate on Tuesday, and its effect on the polls, will only increase the conversation. 
Even strategists who don't see Mr. Romney's prospects influencing broad stock indexes say the candidates' changing fortunes have hit asset prices in more subtle ways, in specific sectors that could be helped or hurt by a change of administration.
''By and large, white-collar finance people want to see Romney in there, but there are a number of subplots within that,'' said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.
Perhaps the sector that has seen its fortunes buoyed most clearly by the Oct. 3 debate is the coal industry, which won a mention from Mr. Romney onstage when he said: ''I like coal. I'm going to make sure we're going to be able to burn clean coal.''
The next day, coal companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index halted a slide that had lasted most of the year, and began to rise while the broader market was falling. Since then, coal stocks have been up as much as 20 percent, more than any of the 154 other sectors in the index.
Mr. Ablin said that along with other developments working against coal stocks, like the increased availability of natural gas, coal companies had been hurt by President Obama's support for alternative energy sources. Now, he said, they are being helped by the perception that Mr. Romney ''is really more fossil fuels.''
Traders have not suddenly concluded that Mr. Romney is a sure bet for the White House -- most prediction models still give Mr. Obama better-than-even odds of winning. But few people are more attuned to the subtle movements of polls than the number crunchers on Wall Street.
On trading floors, there is constant discussion and occasional wagering on the changing odds of the election outcome on Intrade, the betting Web site. After the first debate, Mr. Obama's odds of victory on the site fell from about 80 percent to about 60 percent last Friday.
Mr. Bianco, the strategist, said at an investment conference last week that the pessimism overtaking the market was a direct result of Mr. Romney's success after the first debate. He argued that investors had been scared off by Mr. Romney's promise not to reappoint the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, when his term is up in 2014. Mr. Bianco, no fan of the Fed's current policy, said the market had become addicted to the Fed's stimulus and was frightened by the prospect of losing it.
''The further that Romney surges, the more you could see the market struggle,'' he said in an interview.
Jared Dillian, the author of a popular investing newsletter, said he, too, thought Mr. Romney's success was worrying investors. In addition to Fed policy, Mr. Dillian said, investors are concerned about the budget cuts that Mr. Romney has promised.
''You can pretty much point to exactly that debate and when the stock markets started acting poorly,'' Mr. Dillian said.
Monday and Tuesday provided a bit more support for these claims. After a weekend in which Mr. Obama's odds on Intrade turned up again, rising about 3 percent, the markets also reversed course. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index made up last week's losses, closing up 1.03 percent, or 14.79 points, at 1454.92 on Tuesday.
But there are several other ways to explain the market's recent movements. On Monday, investors were buoyed by a report showing that retail sales rose 1.1 percent in September, more than expected. The Federal Reserve provided another reason for optimism when it said Tuesday that industrial output rose in September. And the pessimism of the previous week was fed in part by the weak profits reported by the first companies to announce their third-quarter financial results.
Many strategists believe that the markets reflect all of the economic data, and that it is these indicators that are moving polls, with a rallying market producing confidence in Mr. Obama, rather than the other way around.
''The direction of the economy and the market influences the success of the candidates,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at S&P Capital IQ. ''The candidates don't necessarily influence the economy and the market.''
But there is little question that the election, and the positions of the candidates, can play a role in the movement of particular corners of the market.
The firm LPL Financial has created an index of companies whose performance has been correlated with the shifting poll results. LPL's ''Wall Street Election Poll'' index consists half of sectors that would be expected to do well in the case of a Democratic win and half of sectors that would be expected to benefit from a Republican victory.
LPL has predicted that, along with the coal industry, the financial industry will benefit if Mr. Romney wins, given his promises to loosen regulations on banks. After the debate, the financial stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 were up 2.4 percent, while the broader market fell.
The firm has put homebuilding stocks and health care facilities stocks among those that could be helped by a victory for Mr. Obama. John Canally, the economist for LPL's research department, said that homebuilders might be helped by another four years with Mr. Obama because he is less likely to disrupt the housing market by pushing for drastic reforms of the government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These stocks fell 6.5 percent in the week and a half following the debate, after rising for most of the year.
Mr. Canally and many others say the more significant impact of the election will be felt when the results are in and the winners begin to grapple with the most immediate threat to the markets: the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year. The outcome of Senate elections could have more of an impact on that than the presidential vote.
''The bigger issue for the markets in this election is the lame duck session that will follow it,'' Mr. Canally said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama Comes Back

 BODY:
There is a price to pay when a president appears disengaged, and President Obama obviously learned how much his diffidence cost him in the first debate this month. On Tuesday night, in the second debate, he regained full command of his vision and his legacy, leaving Mitt Romney sputtering with half-answers, deceptions and one memorable error.
Instead of windy and lethargic answers, the president was crisp in reciting his accomplishments and persuasive in explaining how he has restarted economic growth. Instead of letting Mr. Romney get away with a parade of falsehoods and unworkable promises, he regularly and forcefully called his opponent wrong. Having left many supporters wondering after the first debate whether he really wanted another four years, he finally seemed like a man who was ready to fight for another term. 
What he did not do was describe how a second term would be more successful than his first has been, and, in particular, show how he would cut through the thicket of Republican opposition if re-elected. He missed opportunities to call for a more forceful opposition to assault weapons in another term, and to put forward a clear immigration policy.
But the contrast with the weak and failed ideas that Mr. Romney proposed could not have been clearer. The president noted that he had signed legislation that increased pay equity for women; Mr. Romney not only refused to say whether he would have done so, but condescendingly said he had hired many women when he was the governor of Massachusetts and had given them flexible schedules.
Mr. Obama pointed out that Mr. Romney's tax numbers did not add up, and called the plan a ''sketchy deal''; Mr. Romney responded in a huff. ''Of course they add up,'' he said. ''I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget.'' Apparently he thinks it should be self-evident that a private equity mogul knows how to cut taxes drastically and still balance the budget, but it is not evident to any of the independent experts who have looked at his plan, as Mr. Obama icily pointed out.
The president reminded listeners that Mr. Romney's immigration adviser was the author of Arizona's radical, unconstitutional immigration law. And Mr. Romney himself repeated his cruel prescription to have undocumented immigrants ''self-deport'' by making it impossible for them to find work and aggressively demanding their identification papers. Mr. Obama offered the better, broader view on fixing immigration, though his own administration has also deported tens of thousands of noncriminals through a crackdown similar to Arizona's law.
The president even got off a few good lines, pointing out that his pension was considerably smaller than Mr. Romney's, and that his opponent was far more extreme than President George W. Bush in proposing to turn Medicare into a voucher system and to eliminate financing for Planned Parenthood. He finally took the opportunity to bring up Mr. Romney's dismissal of 47 percent of the country as people who consider themselves victims and do not take personal responsibility for their lives.
But the most devastating moment for Mr. Romney was self-inflicted. Continuing his irresponsible campaign to politicize the death of the American ambassador to Libya, he said it took two weeks for the president to acknowledge that it was the result of an act of terror. As the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, quickly pointed out, the president referred to it as an act of terror the next day, in the Rose Garden. ''Can you say that a little louder, Candy?'' asked Mr. Obama, having fully regained his stride and confidence.
Voters who watched the first debate might have been left with an impression that Mr. Romney was the candidate of ideas and that Mr. Obama's reserves of energy and seriousness had been tapped out. On Tuesday night, those roles were reversed.

HEADLINE: Free to Be a Sexual Predator?

BYLINE: By LARRY WOLFF. 
Larry Wolff, a professor of history at New York University and director of its Center for European and Mediterranean Studies, is the author of ''Paolina's Innocence: Child Abuse in Casanova's Venice.''

 BODY:
LAWYERS for Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French economist and politician who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund last year after he was charged with sexual assault, are now depicting his involvement in sex scandals on both sides of the Atlantic as the actions of a libertine.
''I long thought that I could lead my life as I wanted,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who no longer faces criminal charges in the United States but remains a suspect in an investigation into a sex ring in France, said in an interview. 
To the American ear, the word libertine has an archaic ring; it's not a term we would generally use to describe the dubious behavior of a major public figure. But the libertine has played a powerful if sometimes dark role on the stage of European culture.
Libertinism originated in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, but found its most celebrated and notorious exemplars in the 18th century. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's invocation of libertinage -- a life without moralistic limits -- bears some striking similarities to the 18th-century credo of the man whose name became a synonym for libertinism, Giacomo Casanova: ''I began to live truly independently of everything that could place limits on my inclinations. As long as I respected the laws it seemed to me that I could despise prejudices. I thought I could live perfectly free.''
Casanova's notions were notably modern, for the ''prejudices'' and ''limitations'' he rejected were those of traditional religion and conventional morality. He believed that anything was acceptable that was not explicitly against the law. Faced with an alleged opportunity for a sexual encounter with a housekeeper in a Manhattan hotel room -- as Mr. Strauss-Kahn was in May 2011 -- he would not have thought twice about taking advantage of the situation. In the first volume of his memoirs, which enshrined his exploits for posterity, Casanova described meeting a girl who addressed him this way: ''I am Lucie, the daughter of the gatekeeper. I have neither brothers nor sisters, and I am 14 years old... I will be your little maid, and I am sure you will be pleased with me.'' Of course, he was.
Casanova's insistence on freedom within the boundaries of the law reminds us that the definition of what is libertine, and what is legal, changes with history. For instance, Casanova's interest in very young girls (and 14 was by no means the youngest) would be classified as a crime today, even if it was legally ambiguous in 18th-century Europe. Then, there were no elaborately codified statutes for the sexual protection of those who were defenseless, dependent or vulnerable to exploitation because of their youth and social status.
Take the case of one of Casanova's Venetian contemporaries, who was charged with having sex with an 8-year-old girl. Upon his arrest, the man defiantly insisted on his right to lead his life as he wanted. He said, simply, ''I am a free man.''
Furthermore, many of the extreme and brutal sexual behaviors valorized by people like the Marquis de Sade as ''libertine'' would probably be classified by psychiatrists today under the umbrella of sexual psychopathology. (The marquis himself died in an insane asylum.)
France has historically been more tolerant of sexual license in high places than the United States. But even Mr. Strauss-Kahn acknowledged that his conduct, which included sex parties, was ''out of step'' with contemporary French society.
In America, libertinism under other names has not always been an absolute obstacle to men in public life. In 1999, an American president who some might have called a libertine survived impeachment with more favorable public approval ratings than those of the current, and by all accounts, more virtuous incumbent. Other American political figures have found that libertinism cut short their political ambitions, as it clearly did in the case of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who might well be president of France today -- were he not a libertine.
Casanova took pleasure in the retelling of his libertine adventures and assumed that readers might also enjoy them. Of course, as the narrator of his escapades, he controlled how they were presented. He did not have to worry, as the libertine does today, that the public exposure of his adventures in the modern media might be relished by readers not because they find him gallant and charming, but rather because they find him predatory and even ridiculous.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Mount Biting Attacks in Debate Rematch

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
President Obama and Mitt Romney engaged Tuesday in one of the most intensive clashes in a televised presidential debate, with tensions between them spilling out in interruptions, personal rebukes and accusations of lying as they parried over the last four years under Mr. Obama and what the next four would look like under a President Romney.
Competing for a shrinking sliver of undecided voters, many of them women, their engagements at times bordered on physical as they circled each other or bounded out of their seats while the other was speaking, at times more intent to argue than to address the questions over jobs, taxes, energy, immigration and a range of other issues.
Mr. Obama, criticized by his own party for a lackluster debate performance two weeks ago, this time pressed an attack that allowed him to often dictate the terms of the debate. But an unbowed Mr. Romney was there to meet him every time, and seemed to relish the opportunity to challenge a sitting president. 
Mr. Obama's assertive posture may well have stopped the clamor of concern from supporters that had been weighing on his campaign with three weeks and one more debate to go before the election.
The president's broadsides started with a critique of Mr. Romney for his opposition to his administration's automobile bailout in his first answer -- ''Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt'' -- and ended more than 90 minutes later with an attack on Mr. Romney's secretly taped comments about the ''47 percent'' of Americans who he said did not take responsibility for their own lives.
''When he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considers themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility -- think about who he was talking about,'' the president said toward the end of the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
It was as if a different, highly charged president had taken the stage rather than the reluctant, disengaged-seeming candidate who showed up to meet Mr. Romney at their first debate two weeks ago.
Mr. Romney stayed acutely focused on Mr. Obama's record in the face of it all, saying that the president had failed to deliver what he promised in his 2008 campaign and arguing repeatedly and strenuously, ''We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.''
He credited Mr. Obama for being ''great as a speaker and describing his vision.'' But then he brought down the ultimate hammer in a challenge to an incumbent: ''That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.''
The two took pains to fashion their arguments toward female voters, with the debate seeming at times directed entirely at them. Mr. Obama mentioned Mr. Romney's vow to cut government funding for Planned Parenthood at least four times; Mr. Romney repeatedly mentioned that under Mr. Obama: ''There are three and a half million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office. We don't have to live like this.''
And Mr. Romney sought to broaden his appeal to women by softening his tone on reproductive issues, saying: ''Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.''
Emphasizing his record of diversity as governor based on his own recruiting, he said, ''I brought us whole binders full of women.''
It is a bit of conventional wisdom that undecided voters seek comity in their leaders. There was none of that Tuesday.
At times the back and forth was personal in small ways. Having already invoked the 14 percent effective tax rate that Mr. Romney personally paid, Mr. Obama mentioned Mr. Romney's investment in Chinese companies. Then Mr. Romney asked if Mr. Obama had looked at his own pension for its investments.
''I don't look at my pension,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's not as big as yours.''
But at other moments the verbal sparring took on a deeper, emotional resonance, such as when Mr. Romney suggested that the administration was intentionally misleading in its shifting explanations for the attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the deaths of the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans there.
''The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive,'' Mr. Obama said, standing and looking intently at his opponent. ''That's not what we do. That's not what I do as president.''
Mr. Obama noted that he had gone to the Rose Garden the day after the attack to say ''this was an act of terror.''
Mr. Romney asserted that Mr. Obama had not said that until 14 days later, prompting the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, to interject, ''He did in fact, sir.'' Mr. Obama, interjected with a hint of anger, ''Can you say that a little louder, Candy?'' (She said Mr. Romney's broader point, about shifting explanations, was ''correct.'')
The vitriol that has been coursing through the campaign for months, in television ads and dueling speeches, played out at exceptionally close range for much of the 90-minute debate.
The exchanges were intense and personal, with Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney repeatedly leaving their stools and invading each other's space on the stage, Mr. Romney frequently looking at the president intently from his stool and interrupting as much as the president interrupted him.
At times they were within striking distance of each other as they forcefully made their points.
''If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney,'' Ms. Crowley said. ''Thank you.''
But while Mr. Romney was on the defensive for much of the debate, his arguments were built around a theme he returned to again and again: the Obama administration's record and its failure to restart the economy, saying his business know-how was what was called for now. He used a litany of statistics to make his case that the economy has not improved and that the president has not lived up to his pledges.
At least a half-dozen times, Mr. Romney said that 23 million Americans are out of work. And he said that 580,000 women had lost jobs in the last four years.
''The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked,'' Mr. Romney said, calling Mr. Obama a great speaker with a poor record.
The two tangled over tax policy, health care and spending, delivering what have become familiar arguments at this late stage in the campaign, but they also covered new ground under questioning from an audience of undecided voters. One woman said she was disappointed by Mr. Obama, but worried that Mr. Romney would return to policies of the Bush administration.
In blunt terms, Mr. Romney distanced himself from former President George W. Bush, criticizing him for leaving behind a rising budget deficit, failing to deal aggressively on trade deals with China and for favoring big business over small ones.
''President Bush and I are different people,'' he said, ''and these are different times.''
Ms. Crowley, the moderator, defied the rules of the Commission on Presidential Debates -- negotiated by the two campaigns -- pressing the candidates for a follow-up after the very first question. Ms. Crowley had made it clear that she would do that and had not signed anything agreeing to those conditions, but she also stood to the side and let the two men go after each other throughout the debate.
The questions came from voters who said they had not decided between Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney or were open to changing their minds in the final three weeks of the race. A question about the nation's immigration laws prompted one of the longest exchanges between the men, with Mr. Romney pointing out that the president did not meet his promise of achieving comprehensive immigration legislation during his first term.
''This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do,'' said Mr. Romney, who pledged to pass an immigration overhaul in his first year as president, a sharp departure from his anti-immigration tone in the Republican nominating fight one year ago.
The pressure on both men was intense.
Three weeks before Election Day, there was a sense within both parties that Mr. Romney had succeeded in using the first debate to break an important psychological barrier by putting himself on equal footing with Mr. Obama and showing a presidential bearing before an audience of roughly 70 million people. And Tuesday night was Mr. Obama's opportunity to try to restore his campaign's momentum.
Mr. Obama's performance came just as the Romney campaign was starting its own huge advertising blitz -- after months of lopsided pummeling by Mr. Obama on television -- in the closing phase of the race.
On Tuesday his campaign placed $12 million more in commercials in the nine major battlegrounds.
And, unannounced, it began running a new commercial featuring a woman who identifies herself as a former Obama voter who researched Mr. Romney's record on abortion and found it was not as anti-abortion as Mr. Obama has said, noting, for instance, that he supports abortion in cases of rape and incest.

HEADLINE: Easing Path Out of Country, Cuba Is Dropping Exit Visas

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Havana, and Jacqui Goddard from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- In a country of limits, it is the restriction that many Cubans hate the most: the exit visa that the government requires for travel abroad, discouraging all but the favored or fortunate from leaving the island.
Now that bureaucratic barrier is on its way out. The Cuban government announced on Tuesday that it would terminate the exit visa requirement by Jan. 14, possibly letting many more Cubans depart for vacations, or forever, with only a passport and a visa from the country where they plan to go.
The new policy -- promised by President Ral Castro last year, and finally announced in the Communist Party newspaper -- represents the latest significant step by the Cuban government to answer demands for change from Cubans, without relinquishing control.
Like some recent economic openings in Cuba, it allows the government to carefully calibrate the flow of change. 
Even Cubans with passports will need to have them renewed, and the law says that applicants can be prevented from leaving for several reasons, including ''national security''; enough, experts say, to keep dissidents from traveling.
Cuba's doctors, scientists and other professionals, who have long faced tight restrictions on movement, might be held back as well because the new policy includes a caveat allowing the government to limit departures to ''preserve the human capital created by the Revolution.''
And yet, the new migration law also gives Cubans latitude to stay abroad longer, letting them remain outside the country for two years, and possibly longer, before losing their rights to property and benefits like health care -- an increase from 11 months under the current policy.
Analysts say the government is encouraging a larger class of Cubans to travel, partly so that they can earn money elsewhere and return, injecting capital into the island's moribund economy. The benefits of such an arrangement are already clear: remittances to the island have grown to an estimated $2.3 billion a year, from $1 billion in 2004.
But whether the new law will create a temporary or permanent mass exodus, Cubans and experts say, will be determined by how many people have the means and passports to leave, and which countries welcome them.
''The decision to lift the exit visa is a significant one for several reasons, although like most of the new reforms, it depends a great deal on how it is implemented,'' said Robert Pastor, professor of international relations at American University. ''Nonetheless, by removing a state barrier to leave, this reform could lead to a large outflow -- many of whom will eventually want to come to the United States -- or it could begin to allow a circular flow of people that could enhance the economic opening of the island.''
The Cuban government's earlier steps toward a market economy have mostly fallen short of expectations. There are now hundreds of thousands of small business owners on the island of 11 million people, but not nearly the numbers the government initially said it needed to cut back on the nation's bloated public payrolls.
Experts say fears of instability have often hampered the push for a rapid economic opening, leading celebrated new laws -- allowing for property sales and entrepreneurship, for example -- to be later larded with restrictions and taxes.
Cubans in Havana and Miami say they are convinced the same dynamic will apply to travel. They mostly greeted the end of the exit visa after 51 years with their usual stance of ''we'll see.''
On Tuesday, there were no long lines at the passport office in Havana or at foreign embassies, and many Cubans said they still faced hurdles to a legal departure.
''It's all very good,'' said Laydis, 30, an employee at a bank in Havana who gave only one name to avoid government reprisals. ''But which interesting country is going to give me a visa?''
Her colleague Maricel, 44, who is eligible for a Spanish passport because her grandparents were from Spain, identified another problem. ''Sure, I can go,'' she said, ''but where am I going to get the money?''
After all, the new law, despite cutting a bureaucratic hurdle, might not mean lower costs to leaving: Yoani Snchez, the well-known Cuban blogger whose exit visa requests have been repeatedly denied, said on Twitter that the cost of a Cuban passport will nearly double, to just over $100.
American officials said they were still studying Cuba's new rules to determine what the impact might be. Immigration is one of the few issues that Cuba and the United States regularly discuss, having occupied a spot at the top of their agendas since at least 1980, when hundreds of thousands of Cubans took to the sea during the Mariel boatlift.
That human flood -- encouraged by the Cuban government -- eventually contributed to a series of migration accords in the mid-'90s, with an annual quota of 20,000 resident visas for Cubans emigrating to the United States.
The United States then adopted a policy known as ''wet foot, dry foot,'' in which any Cuban who reaches American soil is given legal status. It is a constant source of anger for the Cubans, who say it leads people to make the perilous journey across the Straits of Florida, but American officials say they have no plans to change the policy because of the new travel rules.
''We remain committed to the migration accords under which our two countries support and promote safe, legal and orderly migration,'' said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman.
The impact may be felt first by newly arrived Cuban immigrants. Because the new law will let Cubans live abroad for two years, they could obtain American legal residency, which takes at least a year, without giving up their rights in Cuba. ''Many recent Cuban immigrants will jump at this chance,'' said Ted Henken, a professor of Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York, adding that the change ''will allow for a more normal back and forth.''
Other countries are also likely to see an immediate impact.
Spanish officials have said there are 200,000 Cubans with rights of dual nationality, meaning they can apply for Spanish passports and citizenship. Many of them travel already, but others who had been discouraged by the exit visa requirement -- including a 50-year-old peddler named Juan Carlos -- said Tuesday that the new law might lead them to Central America, to buy jewelry or other items to sell in Cuba.
Mexico, which has already let in more than 30,000 Cubans this year, could also face a surge in Cuban arrivals, many heading north to cross the border.
Mr. Pastor, a former Latin America adviser for President Jimmy Carter, said the new travel rules for Cubans could ''put indirect pressure on the United States to adjust its immigration policies either to reduce the level of Cuban immigrants or to allow other immigrant groups to obtain as positive treatment as the Cubans get.''
Or the new rules may be an effort to release pressure for change on the island itself.
''Every once in a while they open up the pressure cooker and let out some steam,'' said Raul Hernandes-Morales, 65, a lawyer in Miami who left Cuba at 15. He added: ''It's 'Show them the cheese, but don't actually give them the cheese.' They raise hope, then they kill off that hope -- it's very tragic.''

HEADLINE: Iran Sanctions May Cut Supply Of Currency

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Western economic sanctions imposed on Iran over its disputed nuclear program have severely depressed the value of its national currency, the rial, causing higher inflation and forcing Iranians to carry ever-fatter wads of bank notes to buy everyday items. But the sanctions have also presented a new complication to Iran's banking authorities: they may not be able to print enough money.
At least three European companies that have been providing currency production services to Iran say they have stopped doing business there. One of the companies, Koenig & Bauer AG of Wrzburg, Germany, also says it has not responded to an Iranian request for bids to make presses to print new rials. 
Koenig & Bauer's disclosure was contained in a mailed response to a query by United Against Nuclear Iran, a New York-based sanctions advocacy group, which seized upon the 40 percent drop in the rial's value this month to begin a campaign aimed at the currency itself.
The group began by pressing the Europe-based bank note industry, which has historically counted Iran as a client, to further ostracize the country by denying its central bank the basics of a functioning currency system: the printing presses, engraving paper, anticounterfeiting technology and other services needed to provide enough rials.
''By manipulating and increasing the printing volume of the rial, the regime can bolster its floundering currency and mask the disastrous impact of its political decisions, economic mismanagement and isolation,'' Mark D. Wallace, the chief executive of United Against Nuclear Iran, said in announcing the campaign.
In letters to Koenig & Bauer and two other companies in the bank note business, De La Rue P.L.C. of Hampshire, England, and Flint Group of Luxembourg, he said that European Union sanctions already prohibit Europe-based bank note companies from providing such services to Iran's central bank.
Rob Hutchison, a spokesman for De La Rue, said on Tuesday in a telephone interview, ''We don't provide technical support or services to Iran.''
Nathan Carleton, a spokesman for United Against Nuclear Iran, said in an e-mail that it had been contacted on Tuesday by Flint Group, which said it was no longer active in Iran.
As inflation erodes the rial's purchasing power, Iran's central bank must increase the supply of money, which risks hyperinflation, a cycle of rising prices and rising volumes of money in circulation. Denying the bank's ability to increase the supply of money would theoretically hasten an economic crisis.
Some economists, however, say the campaign to restrict rial circulation may have the unintended consequence of helping Iran. They point to hyperinflation in the former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1994 and Zimbabwe in 2007 and 2008. In both cases, the authorities could not print money fast enough to outpace their currency's falling value and the systems collapsed; Yugoslavs began using a new currency tied to the German mark, and Zimbabweans used the American dollar. And the cycle of higher prices ended.
Steve H. Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said that in Iran's case, limiting the amount of rials in circulation ''would solve the biggest problem they have: inflation.''
But Mr. Wallace said that in Iran's economic system, the authorities ''must maintain the ability to manipulate their money supply and must maintain the integrity of their currency.'' Without sophisticated security and printing technology, he said, ''Iran may not be able to do either -- hastening the demise of the rial.''

HEADLINE: BlackRock Will Expand Exchange-Traded Funds

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: The giant money management company benefited from the strong interest among investors in less risky bond funds and passively managed exchange-traded funds 

 BODY:
 8:22 p.m. | Updated 
BlackRock, the giant money management firm, is making a big push to expand its business in exchange-traded funds after benefiting from strong investor interest.
The firm said on Wednesday that investments had increased in most of the products it manages, pushing its third-quarter profit up 17 percent, to $610 million, from the period a year earlier.
But the biggest increases came in BlackRock's iShares business, the world's largest provider of E.T.F.'s, which are single stocks that contain baskets of other assets like stocks or bonds.
At a time when many popular investment products are offering disappointing returns, the low fees of the exchange-traded funds have been attractive to investors. In September, the industry drew in more money than in any other month since late 2009.
BlackRock executives said that the company attracted 31 percent, or $25.2 billion, of all new E.T.F. business in the third quarter. More money flowed into iShares than at any time since BlackRock acquired the business from Barclays in 2009.
Earlier this week, BlackRock announced that it was introducing a new lower-cost brand of the popular funds for retail investors, after some of its competitors, including Charles Schwab and Vanguard, made similar moves in recent weeks. In a conference call on Wednesday, BlackRock executives said they were also making an expanded effort to sell their exchange-traded funds using the company's first television ads.
"We have the pedal to the metal here," said Robert S. Kapito, BlackRock's president.
BlackRock has grown into the world's largest money manager over the last decade thanks to its acquisition of iShares. Its traditional stock and bond mutual funds have also grown, as have its more sophisticated offerings for larger, institutional investors.
The company has managed to avoid the scrutiny that other parts of the financial industry have faced because it is focused on managing client money rather than taking big trading risks.
In recent quarters, the company has shown unusual signs of struggling with risk aversion among investors worried by a continuing European debt crisis and slow economic growth in the United States. In the second quarter of this year, both revenue and assets under management fell at BlackRock.
But in the third quarter, the company arrested that decline. The company increased the total pool of money it was managing for investors by 10 percent from a year earlier. Revenue across the company rose to $2.32 billion, up 4 percent from the previous quarter and also 4 percent from the third quarter of 2011.
The firm earned $3.47 a share on a diluted basis, a record for the company, and exceeded the $3.32 a share expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Eric Berg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients on Wednesday that iShares had been popular with professional investors and traders but had been lagging with retail investors - something the new marketing push should help to correct.
"Everything announced by BlackRock is being done to get the company back on a high-growth trajectory in the retail channel," Mr. Berg said.
BlackRock's retail investors reflected broader trends by showing a preference for the fixed-income products that are viewed as more stable in uncertain times.
But the institutional investors who account for a larger portion of the money managed by BlackRock showed a renewed willingness to go into riskier equity, or stock-based products, which drew $22 billion of total new investment.
"The preference for equities represents a major shift in sentiment from the fixed-income bias we were seeing across the platform in prior quarters," said Anne Marie Petach, the company's chief financial officer.
Most of the money that was invested in stock-based products went into exchange-traded funds. One of the few disappointing areas during the quarter was actively managed stock funds, which have grown less popular as E.T.F.'s have risen.
Some analysts fear that declining E.T.F. fees could eat into BlackRock's revenue, but BlackRock executives said the lower fees could help the company's overall business strategy of drawing in clients who want broader help managing their portfolios.
"Thanks to the work we've done in the past few years, we are better positioned than any time in our history," said the firm's chief executive, Laurence D. Fink.
BlackRock shares rose sharply when markets opened on Wednesday, but were down about 0.4 percent at closing.

HEADLINE: Housing Prices and Income Inequality

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Two researchers argue that the cost of living in areas with the greatest economic opportunities has forced low-wage workers to migrate instead to areas with inferior opportunities. 

 BODY:
Why is the gap between rich and poor in America yawning ever wider?
The issue is urgent. As my colleague Annie Lowrey writes, there is growing evidence that income inequality impedes economic growth.
And one interesting explanation boils down to the high price of housing.
A recent paper by researchers at Harvard University argues that the prohibitive cost of living in the areas with the greatest economic opportunities has forced low-wage workers to migrate instead to areas with inferior opportunities. 
"The best places for low- and high-skilled workers used to be the same places: California, Maryland, New York," said Peter Ganong, a doctoral student in economics, who wrote the paper with Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy. "Now low-skilled workers can no longer afford to move to the high-wage places." 
In this account, people aren't moving to the Sun Belt because they want to live there. They are moving because they can't afford to live in Boston. And the result isn't just second-best for them; it also slows the pace of economic growth.
Basically, the economy works best when people can move where their skills are most valued. But for low-skill workers, the high price of housing means the cost of living in those places often exceeds the benefits of working there.
The trends are beautifully illustrated by three time-lapse graphics.
The first shows that average incomes by state converged between 1880 and 1980 as low-skilled workers moved to wealthier states. The second shows the pattern of migration, which has changed significantly over the last 30 years.
The third shows the increase in land-use regulations in rich states.
And here's the crucial point: It doesn't have to be this way. High housing prices are the result of public policies that discourage new development. Those policies are generally embraced by the residents of wealthy areas, who benefit, at least in the short term, from restrictions on the supply of new housing. But this paper is one more reason to worry about the long-term economic consequences.

HEADLINE: Testifying in Britain, Volcker Questions Bank Innovation

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: A parliamentary commission investigating recent banking scandals in Britain heard testimony from Paul Volcker, who pushed for tighter banking rules. 

 BODY:
LONDON - If complicated financial trades have a benefit for the wider economy, the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker isn't sure he has seen it.
"The economic and social value of much of the trading and innovative financial engineering is questionable," Mr. Volcker said during almost two hours of testimony before a British parliamentary commission on Wednesday.
Mr. Volcker, the 85-year-old statesman of American banking regulation, had been invited to address the commission, which is investigating a recent spate of British bank scandals. He said that if left to their own devices, banks would find ways to intertwine their trades for their own accounts with the retail businesses in potentially dangerous ways.
His statements came as United States authorities move closer to enacting the so-called Volcker Rule, which would restrict the ability of banks, whose deposits are federally insured, from trading for their own benefit.
Banks and other Wall Street firms have fiercely opposed the proposed legislation, and have lobbied hard to alter how it would be put in place.
When asked by British politicians whether those changes have watered down the measure's effectiveness, Mr. Volcker dismissed the concerns.
"I don't believe that the thrust of it has been chipped away," Mr. Volcker said on Wednesday.
British regulators have proposed similar rules that would cordon off firms' retail operations from their riskier investment banking units. Mr. Volcker expressed doubt that such a system would work, as firms would continue to look for ways to combine their different operations in an effort to reduce cost and increase profitability.
The division between banks' businesses "tends to break down over time because of pressures from the institution itself," he said. "If you want to keep them separate, you should put them in two different organizations."
Mr. Volcker also raised doubts over the benefit of complicated trading activities, which contributed to the global financial crisis.
London has been hit with scandals that have put banks' riskier operations back in the spotlight. The British bank Barclays, for example, agreed to a $450 million settlement with authorities in June connected to the manipulation of crucial interest rates by some of its traders. Losses connected to bungled trades at JPMorgan Chase's London office also now total billions of dollars.
The commission that heard Mr. Volcker's testimony is expected to hear from other prominent finance officials, including Martin Wheatley, the chief British regulator, and Martin Taylor, a former Barclays chief executive.
On Wednesday, Andrew Tyrie, the British politician leading the parliamentary panel, joked that Mr. Volcker could be in London to discuss taking over as the new governor of the Bank of England, the country's central bank. Mervyn A. King, the current governor, will step down from his post next year.
Mr. Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, smiled at the remark, saying that he was too old to become the Bank of England's new chief.
"It's a job for someone younger than 85," he said.

HEADLINE: KCET Joins Link TV in New Venture

BYLINE: ELIZABETH JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The two California-based public television businesses will join forces in a new venture known as KCETLink. 

 BODY:
Two California-based public television businesses are merging. Link Media, the San Francisco-based parent of the Link TV satellite-distributed network and online international news portal, and KCET, the independent Los Angeles public television station that quit PBS last year, said they would join forces in a new venture known as KCETLink.
After the merger, effective Jan. 1, the two brands and most of their programming will remain separate. But Link TV, which airs cultural and news shows and series like the Danish import "Borgen," will get an immediate visibility boost in Los Angeles, where KCET will begin to broadcast it on one its digital multicast channels.
Currently, Link TV is available in just 33 million DirecTV and Dish Network homes nationwide. "We have a bit of a cult following and we want it to be bigger," said Paul S. Mason, Link TV's chief executive and president, who will be chief strategy officer of the new company.
Al Jerome, the head of KCET who will become the chief executive of KCETLink, said the merger would create a more sustainable economic model for both entities, and entice more production partners with the promise of both local and national distribution for shows, some of which may end up being shared between the two.
No money will change hands and the new company will be based at KCET's new Los Angeles headquarters. Between them, the two have about 150 employees and that number will be reduced as some business functions, including fund-raising, are consolidated, Mr. Jerome said.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Accuses Hedge Fund of Lying About Performance

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The agency said that a New Jersey-based fund, Yorkville Advisors, lied to its investors about its performance and asset values in order to earn higher fees. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint Wednesday against a hedge fund that once managed as much as $1 billion in assets, accusing the firm of lying to its investors about performance and asset values to earn higher fees.
The agency said that as a result of the misrepresentation, the fund, Yorkville Advisors, persuaded investors to give them $280 million to manage, which translated into more than $10 million in excess fees. The complaint also names its founder and president, Mark Angelo, and its chief financial officer, Edward Schinik.
In a sharp defense, the firm put out a lengthy statement attacking both the S.E.C.'s case and its tactics, calling the efforts a "free money shakedown."
"Yorkville Advisors is deeply disappointed that the S.E.C. has elected to file this litigation," the firm, which is based in Jersey City, N.J., said in a statement. "Yorkville vigorously disputes all of the allegations contained in the S.E.C.'s complaint as they lack merit and are entirely without support."
In recent years, the S.E.C.has made a concerted effort to proactively root out fraud at hedge funds. Instead of relying solely on tippers and industry sources, a new unit was established to track so-called aberrational performance for signs of potential fraud. The case against Yorkville is the seventh such cause brought by the unit, and one of the larger funds to be charged. 
"The analytics put Yorkville front and center on our radar screen," said Bruce Karpati, head of the enforcement at the commission's asset management unit. "When we looked further we found lies to investors and the firm's auditors as well as a scheme to inflate fees by grossly overvaluing fund assets."
The S.E.C. says that Yorkville did not abide by its own policies for valuing assets, disregarded poor returns and withheld some of those returns from its auditor. It also lied to investors about how easily it could sell off its assets, according to the complaint. 
Some of these issue touch on the very heart of investor distress during the 2008 financial crisis. Hedge funds often tucked hard to sell assets away in their investment vehicles, and when liquidity dried up, were left holding unsellable items. In some cases, these assets were valued at a far higher price than they could have actually fetched on the open market, which required investors to continue paying high fees.
"Yorkville at all times has acted appropriately and implemented robust control procedures to ensure the proper valuation of assets. This has included employing two former S.E.C. enforcement attorneys to sit on its valuation committee," the firm said. "This is yet another example of the S,E.C. wasting taxpayer dollars conducting an investigation and initiating a baseless enforcement action solely for the purpose of appearing proactive as opposed to taking on the difficult task of addressing the real issues that face our markets."

HEADLINE: Teacher Fined for Rewarding Pupils for Buying Soap From Him

BYLINE: DANIELLA SILVA


HIGHLIGHT: The teacher was fined $4,000 for the scheme, in which he sold at least seven homemade bars of soap for $3 or $4 apiece to his sixth-graders. 

 BODY:
A Brooklyn sixth-grade teacher has been fined $4,000 by New York City for an odd scheme in which he awarded his students prizes, including a "no homework pass," for buying his family's homemade soap, as part of a character-building program at the school.
The teacher, Marlon Scanterbury of Public School 66 in Canarsie, began the sales last year, when the school rolled out a "character incentive program," according to a settlement he reached with the city's Conflicts of Interest Board. As part of the program, intended to encourage students to improve their social and academic skills, teachers gave students stickers that they could trade in for items that were displayed in the school's lobby.
Mr. Scanterbury offered his students a deal: for each bar of soap they bought, at $3 or $4 apiece, they would receive 10 stickers. After two months, he threw in a "no homework pass" for soap buyers, according to the settlement, which was announced on Wednesday. 
At least three students purchased one bar of soap each, receiving 10 stickers each, while at least one more student bought three bars, and got 30 stickers, and at least one student received a no-homework pass, the conflicts board said.
Mr. Scanterbury, 43, who has taught in the city schools since 2001, was also given a letter of reprimand from the Education Department for his actions.
In other action against city workers, the board announced that a former engineering auditor had been fined $7,500 for selling sneakers on city time using a city computer. 
Beginning in 2010, the auditor, Jonathan Lim, then employed by the city's Economic Development Corporation, used his work computer and e-mail address to contact potential buyers and to sell sneakers on eBay, according to a settlement he reached with the board.
During one three-month period, Mr. Lim clicked on or refreshed a sneaker-related site 57,578 times, the settlement said.
Mr. Lim made a total of 106 eBay sales while on the job, for a total of $9,724.99. He was terminated by the Economic Development Corporation in January for the sneaker sales, the corporation said.

HEADLINE: Instant Reaction Polls Show Narrow Obama Advantage in Second Debate

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Scientific polls conducted after the Tuesday night's presidential debate in New York give a modest edge to President Obama. 

 BODY:
Polling data is often very noisy -- so it makes my job easier on those rare occasions when there is some agreement. Scientific polls conducted after Tuesday night's presidential debate in New York give a modest edge to President Obama.
A CBS News/Knowledge networks poll of undecided voters who watched the debate found 37 percent giving an advantage to Mr. Obama, 30 percent favoring Mitt Romney and 33 percent calling the debate a tie. That represents a narrower lead for Mr. Obama than Mr. Romney had after the first debate in Denver, when a similar poll gave Mr. Romney a 46-22 edge.
A CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debate -- not just undecided voters, as in the CBS News survey -- also gave the debate to Mr. Obama by a seven-point margin, 46 percent to 39 percent. Mr. Romney had won by a much larger margin, 67 percent to 25 percent, in CNN's poll after the first debate.
Mr. Obama may have benefited in the CNN poll from diminished expectations: 73 percent of voters in the poll said he performed better than they expected, against just 10 percent who said he did worse.
Two other polls gave Mr. Obama a somewhat clearer advantage. A Battleground poll of likely voters in swing states who watched the debate had him winning 53-38.
An online poll by Google Consumer Surveys gave Mr. Obama a 48 percent to 31 percent edge among registered voters.
There were also two scientific surveys about the debate conducted among voters in particular states.
A Public Policy Polling survey of Colorado voters who watched the debate found 48 percent declaring Mr. Obama the winner, and 44 percent for Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama's advantage was clearer in the poll among independent voters, who gave him a 58-36 edge. However, the candidates were roughly tied when Public Policy Polling asked them how the debate swayed their vote, with 37 percent saying the debate made them more likely to vote for Mr. Obama, with 36 percent for Mr. Romney.
Finally, a poll of California voters who watched the debate, conducted by SurveyUSA, found a 56-32 edge for Mr. Obama. It it is no surprise that Mr. Obama won a poll of California voters, and the poll showed a tie, 44-44, among independents in California. Still, a similar poll of California voters by SurveyUSA had given an edge to Mr. Romney after the first debate.
How much will the debate move the head-to-head polls between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama? Actually, the instant-reaction polls may not be very much help in answering that question. The relationship between the quick-reaction polls and their eventual effect on the horse-race polls has historically been very modest, and has sometimes even run in the opposite direction of what the initial polls suggested. Debates sometimes look different in the rear-view mirror, depending on news media coverage, YouTube and cable news highlights, word of mouth, and subsequent developments on the campaign trail.
Another complication is that it is possible -- although by no means guaranteed -- that there will be some reversion to the mean because of the first presidential debate, meaning that Mr. Obama will benefit from memories of Denver fading as much as any new ones that were forged in New York.
But if you want my best guess: Throughout this election cycle, you would have done very well by predicting that the polls would eventually settle in at an overall lead for Mr. Obama of about two percentage points. Whenever his lead has been larger than that, it has come back to earth. But Mr. Obama has also rebounded at moments when the polls seemed to suggest an even closer race.
A two-point lead for Mr. Obama is also close to what might be suggested by recent economic data as well as Mr. Obama's net approval ratings.
The FiveThirtyEight forecast had Mr. Obama as a 64.8 percent favorite to win the Electoral College in advance of the debate, but it will take several days for it to incorporate any of its effects.
Prediction markets, which had nearly identical odds to the FiveThirtyEight model in advance of the debate, had Mr. Obama's stock improving slightly over the course of the evening and put his odds at about 67 percent as of midnight on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: What Happened to Vikram Pandit?

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: The Citigroup chief executive was one of India's international corporate stars. 

 BODY:
In a surprise move, Citigroup announced on Tuesday that Vikram S. Pandit, the bank's chief executive, had resigned, effective immediately.
Mr. Pandit, 55, was born in Nagpur and had been the chief executive of Citigroup since December 2007. He was one of India's shining overseas corporate success stories, part of a growing group of executives of Indian birth or ancestry who have led American institutions in recent years, and his unexpectedly fast departure has raised many questions, but answers, so far, are not forthcoming.
As IBNLive reports, Mr. Pandit left India for the United States when he was 16, earned bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from Columbia University and went on to get a doctorate in finance from the same institution. In July 2007, Citigroup acquired his hedge fund and private equity firm, Old Lane Partners, and Mr. Pandit took the top job at the company late that year.
In a 2007 interview with The Times of India, Mr. Pandit's father, Shankar Pandit, talked about his son with pride after he was named Citigroup's chief executive. "He was a brilliant boy," the senior Mr. Pandit said. "In school, he always stood first in his class. He is very astute and focused. I saw him rise. Vikram has stood to my expectations. I am so happy that everyone is sharing my happiness, today." He said his son was "a very simple person at heart" who "derives pleasures from simple things in life."
In 2008, Outlook magazine wrote that the financial crisis had damaged the reputations of corporate leaders who had, until then, been the "faces of 'India shining' abroad." "Thanks to the ravaging financial turbulence, Pandit could well be described as the most visible India-origin face for receiving bouquets and brickbats in equal measure," the article said.
Old Lane's history after Citigroup purchased it for $800 million was short and disappointing - the fund was shuttered in the summer of 2008 after losing money for investors.
The timing and the abruptness of the announcement Tuesday were surprising, but Mr. Pandit's departure itself was less so. Questions about his appointment to the top spot were raised soon after he was named chief executive, Eric Dash reported in 2007. Mr. Pandit, he wrote then, is "known more as an analytical technocrat than a charismatic leader."
Weeks before his resignation, "frustrations of the board members had been building," Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig wrote in Dealbook Tuesday.
In a piece titled "Vikram Pandit Takes a Powder at Citigroup," James Greiff of Bloomberg reports that many in the financial world had long thought that "Vikram Pandit was never the right man for the top job." He says Mr. Pandit's hedge fund background left him unsuited to running a commercial and consumer bank, and says his rise to the top was "by default as much as anything." The Telegraph in Britain makes a similar argument in "Vikram Pandit: The academic 'hedge fund guy," noting that some also saw Mr. Pandit as "too timid and academic to run a global bank."
His abrupt departure has sparked speculation about what lay behind it, in part because his resignation came a day after Citigroup announced stronger-than-expected earnings. The New Yorker writes of "The Mystery of Vikram Pandit's Resignation," noting that "it's a bit unusual for the C.E.O. to quit without notice, effective immediately".
The resignation followed "a clash with the board over strategy and performance," according to The Wall Street Journal. The Economic Times reports that Citigroup directors replaced Mr. Pandit because they believed he had "mismanaged operations," which led to "setbacks with regulators and a loss of credibility with investors."
Analysts and investors have reacted with some consternation to the suddenness of the announcement, as NDTV reports. "Our view has always been that he was not really adding much value. So, in that sense we are not sorry to see him leave," said Gautam Dhingra, chief executive and founder of High Pointe Capital Management in Chicago. "However, the abruptness of the resignation does cause a bit of worry. Why did it have to be an abrupt, rather than a graceful exit?"
Martin Mosby, a stock analyst at Guggenheim Securities, told NDTV, "If it was a natural transition of any sort, the timing would not be now. You would announce it in January and you would set up a transition period that would be completed in probably April."
The Business Standardreports that investors had expected Mr. Pandit to remain, given the bank's improved outlook. "I would have expected he wanted to stay around and see some of the fruits of his labors there," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of Oakbrook Investments in Illinois.
Mintreports that while senior executives at Citigroup were shocked by Pandit's departure, investors apparently were not sorry to see him leave, as Citigroup shares rose as much as 2 percent. "It's not a shock that (Pandit) is no longer there, but the surprise is this is all happening very quickly. Why is he leaving immediately?" said Mike Holland, chairman of Holland and Co. in New York.
Mr. Pandit's successor is Michael L. Corbat, former head of Citigroup's European and Middle Eastern division.
In the statement announcing his departure, Mr. Pandit did not provide much more explanation: "Given the progress we have made in the last few years, I have concluded that now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup," he said.

HEADLINE: Measuring Employer Confidence

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: While a lack of confidence about the economy is surely deterring some employer hiring, the effect is far smaller than some contend, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "." 
The labor market effects of employer confidence are probably real but have been exaggerated.
American employers have hiredmore than 230 million times since the recession began, but need to hire even more for employment per person to return to what it was five years ago. 
One explanation for this state of affairs, according to the Mitt Romney campaign, has been a supposed lack of confidence among employers who are worried about taxes and new regulations, especially those associated with the Affordable Care Act (often referred to as Obamacare) as it is fully put in effect.
It is easy to find a businessman worried about government intervention, but the prevalence of such worries does not by itself tell us whether a lack of employer confidence depresses employment 10 percent, 1 percent or 0.1 percent.
Presumably if we have two employers who can hire workers at $20 an hour for the same task, the more confident of the two will hire more people than the less confident one, all else being the same. To put it another way, the less confident employer will require a greater immediate profit from his next $20-an-hour hire than the more confident employer, to compensate the less confident employer for the extra tax and regulatory costs associated with the hire that he anticipates in the future.
To the degree that an erosion of employer confidence has depressed the entire labor market, we should see the immediate profit from employees grow over time, as employers perceive more tax and regulatory costs on top of the cash and fringes they already owe their employees.

The gap between labor productivity and inflation-adjusted employee compensation is one way that economists measure the immediate profit from hiring, because the immediate benefits of hiring come from the production of the workers and the immediate costs include the employees' compensation. (This measure is also sometimes called the "inverse of real unit labor cost.")
The chart below shows indexes of labor productivity (red) and inflation-adjusted hourly employee compensation (black) since the recession began. Both indexes are measured after taxes and employee subsidies according to single marginal tax-rate series, so their gap reflects changes in the immediate profit from hiring. (For more information on these measures, see my previous post and my recent book on the labor market since 2007.)
About the time the Affordable Care Act was debated, after-tax productivity began to recover, and more quickly than after-tax real wages did. By the end of 2011, wages had still not recovered as much as productivity had. 
(Another issue potentially depressing wages more than productivity is the anticipation of a new-employee tax credit, like the one proposed by President Obama in September 2011 and seriously discussed as early as 2009 and analyzed on this blog.)
Something prevented wages from keeping up with productivity, and perhaps eroding employer confidence is part of the story. But even if employer confidence were the whole story, it still explains less of the labor-market depression than do taxes on employees and subsidies for people who do not work. In early 2010, for example, after-tax real wages had been depressed more than 11 percent, of which only two percentage points were because of a failure of wages to keep up with productivity.
As I explained in a previous blog post, subsidies for people not working are the primary reason that wages fell so much after taxes and subsidies.
It would be incorrect to attribute all of the deviation between productivity and wages to employer confidence. A change in the composition of demand in the direction of less labor-intensive industries would have a similar effect, even if employer confidence had remained constant. New Keynesian economists also blame some of the deviation on a failure of employers to adjust their prices fully to their production costs.
Moreover, it is possible that employer fears of future regulatory and tax costs would not depress employment even while they depressed wages to the degree that employees eagerly anticipate benefits they would receive from those regulations and taxes.
While traces of eroded employer confidence are seen in labor market outcomes, it also appears that eroded employer confidence explains less than one-quarter of the overall depression of the labor market.

HEADLINE: 2 Senators Call for Greater Bank Capital Requirements

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: In a new letter to be sent to regulators on Wednesday, Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and Senator David Vitter, a Republican, argue for tougher rules for bank capital, the cushion that financial institutions must keep against losses. 

 BODY:
The debate over Wall Street regulation has tended to divide politicians along party lines. But on one issue at least, two senators, a Democrat and a Republican, see eye to eye.
In a new letter to be sent to regulators on Wednesday, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, argue for tougher rules on bank capital reserves, the cushion that financial institutions must keep against losses. The current proposal does not go far enough, they say.
"With financial regulators considering a host of new domestic and international capital requirements, we write today to urge your agencies to simplify and enhance the capital rules that will apply to U.S. banks," reads the letter from the two lawmakers.
Stricter requirements would "properly align incentives for megabanks by lessening government support for the financial sector, and reassure financial markets that the U.S. financial system is healthy," the lawmakers write.
The two men, who sit on the Senate Banking Committee, addressed the letter to three prominent regulators: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman; Martin J. Gruenberg, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and Thomas J. Curry, head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Regulators have been grappling with the issue of bank capital since the financial crisis led the government to rescue the largest banks in a taxpayer bailout. The financial industry has pushed back against calls to increase capital buffers, arguing that more equity financing would be burdensome for their business.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Vitter took up the issue in August in a letter to Mr. Bernanke, responding to the Fed's decision to support capital rules drafted by an international group of officials known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Those rules, called Basel III, would require banks to hold the equivalent of at least 7 percent of their assets in so-called Tier 1 common capital. Banks considered "systemically important" -- those whose failure could threaten the financial system - would be required to hold capital above that amount.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Vitter write in their letter on Wednesday that these standards may not be tough enough.
They also take issue with the so-called risk weights in the Basel rules, which allow banks to hold less capital against assets deemed less risky, calling that system flawed.
"Accounting gimmicks may help institutions appear to have higher regulatory capital levels and avoid raising more equity, but when risk weights are gamed, the markets lose faith in banks' balance sheets," they write.
"In this case," they say, "simpler really is better."
The complexity of the current proposal also puts an unnecessary burden on community banks, the lawmakers say.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Vitter often find themselves on opposite sides. But Mr. Brown said in an interview that the idea of an alliance occurred to him during a hearing in July, when he admired the questions Mr. Vitter was putting to Mr. Bernanke.
The pair began discussions that led to the letter in August.
"I'm sure we were both shocked at some point to notice common threads in our thinking," Mr. Vitter said, with a laugh. "We explored those over time."
He said he and Mr. Brown were like an "odd couple" in the Senate on this issue.
Mr. Brown added, "I think both conservatives and progressives believe the government shouldn't be subsidizing Wall Street banks."
A draft of the full letter is below.

HEADLINE: The Pressure Is On at Citigroup

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Investors want Citigroup's new leader to speed up the bank's overhaul. | Bank of America manages a slim third-quarter profit. | Two senators are raising concerns about bank capital rules. | Two pioneers of the high-speed trading industry are shutting down their firm. 

 BODY:
PRESSURE IS ON AT CITI | The new chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, "may have to impress quickly, given the pent-up frustrations among shareholders," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. With the stock price having fallen 89 percent under Mr. Corbat's predecessor, Vikram S. Pandit, investors want the new leader to speed up the bank's overhaul and be more transparent about the process. But it was not clear on Tuesday what his actual plan was. "Today's changes do not alter the strategic direction of Citi, which we believe is a good one," Mr. Corbat said during his first public conference call as chief executive. Still, he suggested the personnel change itself signaled change: "I wouldn't minimize the impact you can have on a place."
The transition on Tuesday caught Wall Street off guard, surprising even the bank's employees. But the board had been preparing for weeks, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig report for DealBook. The chairman, Michael E. O'Neill, and other board members "had been mapping out the transfer of power during meetings that occurred, in part, while Mr. Pandit was in Japan last week attending a gathering of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank," DealBook reports. Mr. Pandit, though, said in an interview that the decision to resign was his alone.
 Shareholders seemed to welcome Tuesday's news. Christine Harper of Bloomberg News noted on Twitter: "Citigroup ousts C.E.O., shares rise 1.6%. Goldman Sachs reports profit that beats analyst estimates, shares fall 1%." Citigroup's board, wrote James Greiff of Bloomberg View, seemed to have arrived at "the same conclusion that many in the financial world had settled on long ago."
BANK OF AMERICA EKES OUT A PROFIT | Bank of America managed to post a slim third-quarter profit after agreeing to settle legal claims stemming from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The bank reported net income of $340 million, compared with $6.23 billion in the quarter a year ago. The earnings amounted to zero cents a share, better than the loss of 6 cents a share that analysts were expecting. The conference call on Wednesday to discuss the results is being held at 8:30 a.m.
 BlackRock said its third-quarter profit rose 17 percent on an adjusted basis, to $610 million. The firm's diluted earnings amounted to $3.47 a share, beating analysts' expectations of $3.32 a share.
LAWMAKERS FOCUS ON CAPITAL | Two Senate lawmakers, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of Louisiana, are raising concerns about bank capital rules in a letter to be sent to regulators on Wednesday morning. The letter, which was obtained by DealBook, elaborates on one the pair sent to Ben S. Bernanke in August. And it is notable for its bipartisan nature: Mr. Brown, a Democrat, and Mr. Vitter, a Republican, tend not to agree on many issues. "We write today to urge your agencies to simplify and enhance the capital rules that will apply to U.S. banks," they say in the letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Vitter is appearing on CNBC at 10:30 a.m.
The debate over Wall Street regulation has been a feature (although perhaps not a huge one) in the presidential race, with Mitt Romney arguing that the Dodd-Frank law should be repealed. But getting rid of the regulatory overhaul "will turn back the financial clock to 2006" for big banks, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "That doesn't seem very smart given what happened, something that Mr. Romney recognizes when he talks of replacing the act rather than repealing it. The problem is that possible replacements are unlikely to work."
ON THE AGENDA | Knight Capital, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp and PepsiCo report earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday. American Express, eBay and Kinder Morgan are reporting after the market closes. Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, is set to testify on banking before a British parliamentary commission at 9 a.m. John Mack, Morgan Stanley's former leader, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, is on CNBC at 12:30 p.m. Martha Stewart is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m. Solyndra, the failed solar company, is seeking bankruptcy court approval of its plan to pay creditors.
HIGH-SPEED FIRM SHUTTERS | Computerized traders are beginning to look less mighty. Two pioneers of the industry, Steve Swanson and Peter Kent, are shutting down their firm, Eladian Partners, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. The official reason is "market conditions." In any case, it is the latest sign that the high-speed trading industry may be shrinking.

HEADLINE: The Pressure Is On at Citigroup

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Investors want Citigroup's new leader to speed up the bank's overhaul. | Bank of America manages a slim third-quarter profit. | Two senators are raising concerns about bank capital rules. | Two pioneers of the high-speed trading industry are shutting down their firm. 

 BODY:
PRESSURE IS ON AT CITI | The new chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, "may have to impress quickly, given the pent-up frustrations among shareholders," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. With the stock price having fallen 89 percent under Mr. Corbat's predecessor, Vikram S. Pandit, investors want the new leader to speed up the bank's overhaul and be more transparent about the process. But it was not clear on Tuesday what his actual plan was. "Today's changes do not alter the strategic direction of Citi, which we believe is a good one," Mr. Corbat said during his first public conference call as chief executive. Still, he suggested the personnel change itself signaled change: "I wouldn't minimize the impact you can have on a place."
The transition on Tuesday caught Wall Street off guard, surprising even the bank's employees. But the board had been preparing for weeks, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig report for DealBook. The chairman, Michael E. O'Neill, and other board members "had been mapping out the transfer of power during meetings that occurred, in part, while Mr. Pandit was in Japan last week attending a gathering of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank," DealBook reports. Mr. Pandit, though, said in an interview that the decision to resign was his alone.
 Shareholders seemed to welcome Tuesday's news. Christine Harper of Bloomberg News noted on Twitter: "Citigroup ousts C.E.O., shares rise 1.6%. Goldman Sachs reports profit that beats analyst estimates, shares fall 1%." Citigroup's board, wrote James Greiff of Bloomberg View, seemed to have arrived at "the same conclusion that many in the financial world had settled on long ago."
BANK OF AMERICA EKES OUT A PROFIT | Bank of America managed to post a slim third-quarter profit after agreeing to settle legal claims stemming from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The bank reported net income of $340 million, compared with $6.23 billion in the quarter a year ago. The earnings amounted to zero cents a share, better than the loss of 6 cents a share that analysts were expecting. The conference call on Wednesday to discuss the results is being held at 8:30 a.m.
 BlackRock said its third-quarter profit rose 17 percent on an adjusted basis, to $610 million. The firm's diluted earnings amounted to $3.47 a share, beating analysts' expectations of $3.32 a share.
LAWMAKERS FOCUS ON CAPITAL | Two Senate lawmakers, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of Louisiana, are raising concerns about bank capital rules in a letter to be sent to regulators on Wednesday morning. The letter, which was obtained by DealBook, elaborates on one the pair sent to Ben S. Bernanke in August. And it is notable for its bipartisan nature: Mr. Brown, a Democrat, and Mr. Vitter, a Republican, tend not to agree on many issues. "We write today to urge your agencies to simplify and enhance the capital rules that will apply to U.S. banks," they say in the letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Vitter is appearing on CNBC at 10:30 a.m.
The debate over Wall Street regulation has been a feature (although perhaps not a huge one) in the presidential race, with Mitt Romney arguing that the Dodd-Frank law should be repealed. But getting rid of the regulatory overhaul "will turn back the financial clock to 2006" for big banks, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "That doesn't seem very smart given what happened, something that Mr. Romney recognizes when he talks of replacing the act rather than repealing it. The problem is that possible replacements are unlikely to work."
ON THE AGENDA | Knight Capital, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp and PepsiCo report earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday. American Express, eBay and Kinder Morgan are reporting after the market closes. Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman, is set to testify on banking before a British parliamentary commission at 9 a.m. John Mack, Morgan Stanley's former leader, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, is on CNBC at 12:30 p.m. Martha Stewart is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m. Solyndra, the failed solar company, is seeking bankruptcy court approval of its plan to pay creditors.
HIGH-SPEED FIRM SHUTTERS | Computerized traders are beginning to look less mighty. Two pioneers of the industry, Steve Swanson and Peter Kent, are shutting down their firm, Eladian Partners, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. The official reason is "market conditions." In any case, it is the latest sign that the high-speed trading industry may be shrinking.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney, Oil and Science

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Obama and Romney spar over gas prices, as if their policies could influence gas prices. 

 BODY:
The second debate between President Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was perhaps most notable for its macho choreography -- with the two men circling, jabbing and interrupting -- and the intense Benghazi moment.
The need for reinvestment in science and basic research made an appearance, albeit fleetingly, in the context of the exodus of jobs to China. I'll get to that in a second, but first, a reality check on another big focal point -- fights over policies related to high gasoline and oil prices. [2:31 p.m. | Update | As Will Oremus wrote today, the debate came close to touching on global warming, as well. See an excerpt below]
It's not surprising that the first substantive energy exchange between the two candidates dealt with gas prices, given -- as a national poll by the University of Texas just found -- that this is by far the most pressing energy issue on voters' minds (to the consternation of climate hawks).
Here's a relevant snapshot from the university's survey, posted by Sheril Kirshenbaum, director of the polling project: 
@Revkin Don't forget about what Americans want to hear specifically about energy - the topic a president can't manage http://t.co/r4zQvdVr
- Sheril Kirshenbaum (@Sheril_)17 Oct 12
Hidden behind the flurry of conflicting claims and spins on who's drilling, or would drill, more or less was the reality -- known mainly to energy economists and analysts, it seems -- that presidents essentially have no power to affect gas prices. Tom Zeller, Jr., formerly of The Times and now at Huffington Post, has written an excellent piece, "Energy Facts, And A Few Fibs, On Display At Presidential Debate," laying out the forces that do have an impact, and pointing to a valuable 2011 study from the Federal Trade Commission, Gasoline Price Changes and the Petroleum Industry: An Update, which I just read and encourage you to explore.
This morning, Michael Levi, who analyzes energy and the environment for the Council on Foreign Relations, answered my question about the limits of presidential influence in a way that says Obama got it right by insisting that cutting demand through policies aimed at energy efficiency and the next generation of energy technologies had to be part of a long-term American energy (and oil) agenda. Here's Levi:
It's tricky. U.S. oil production is a bigger part of the gas price picture than it was a few years ago. But it's still just one part of the puzzle -- ultimately, if others restrain production in the face of higher US output, the impact on gas prices can be small. In the long run, the most powerful way to reduce U.S. exposure to expensive oil by using less of it.
He has a relevant post earlier this week titled "The Global Oil Market Isn't Going Away." I tweeted on another useful primer on gasoline basics during the debate:
11 Factors That Determine Gas Prices (White House, #kxl not on list): http://t.co/IF0RdLis via @themoneygame
- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)17 Oct 12
Science made its brief appearance in Obama's answer to a question was about jobs flowing to China. Obama acknowledged job loss, but noted that the source of American economic growth remained innovation, and innovation requires investment in basic science and research and development.
Romney rebutted this with an odd chant:
Government does not create jobs. Government does not create jobs.
And of course he's right (outside of the context of temporary direct stimulus projects). But government is able, and often uniquely able, to invest in the basic sciences and large-scale research and development projects that create the menu of insights and technologies that can be turned by the private sector into TomToms and more efficient turbine blades.
Via Twitter, I praised Obama's acknowledgment of a federal role in creating the underpinnings for innovation, but noted that, particularly in basic inquiry on areas of science relevant to energy, we've been in a decades-long slumber party no matter who's controlled the White House or Congress:

- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)17 Oct 12
 2:31 p.m. | Update | On the Future Tense blog, Will Oremus described how the moderator, Candy Crowley, mentioned that a climate question almost got asked. Here's a snippet from his post and a link to the rest:
...Crowley pressed them twice to address whether it was in fact the government's job to lower gas prices. The correct answer: It isn't, and it shouldn't be. The United States already has some of the cheapest gas of any developed country. And for anyone who believes that even cheaper oil is the route to economic prosperity, just look at the countries with the lowest gas prices in the world: Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iran. Cheap oil isn't a long-term energy policy. It's something that autocrats throw around to keep their grip on restive populations.
For what it's worth, Crowley did say after the debate that an audience member had wanted to ask a climate change question. "Climate change, I had that question," she said. "All you climate change people. We just, you know, again, we knew that the economy was still the main thing." [ Please read the rest; Oremus ends with a potent* kicker. ]
[* I liked the main point of Oremus's conclusion -- that climate change can have economic impacts -- but a reader helpfully noted the lack of scientific support for the line asserting that warming has already been linked to cyclones.. and tsunamis.]

HEADLINE: Regulators Propose Capital Rules for Derivatives Trading

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would have to bolster their capital cushion and post additional collateral for certain derivatives trades under the new plan proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 BODY:
Federal authorities moved a step closer to overhauling the derivatives market on Wednesday, as regulators proposed tougher standards for the nation's biggest banks. 
Firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would have to bolster their capital cushion and post additional collateral for certain derivatives trades. The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed the crackdown as part of a broader effort to rein in the opaque derivatives business, a main player in the financial crisis. 
"Together, these rules are intended to make the financial system safer, and the derivative markets fairer, more efficient, and more transparent," Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said in a statement. 
Ms. Schapiro and the agency's commissioners voted unanimously, 5-0, to advance the plan. It now enters a 60-day public comment period, after which the S.E.C. and other federal regulators must finalize the rules.
The effort was part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory law passed in response to the financial crisis. The law mandated an overhaul of swaps trading by requiring that many such derivatives contracts go through a regulated clearinghouse that serves as a backstop in case one trading party defaults. Regulators, until recently, had little authority to set any rules for this market.
The vote on Wednesday, Ms. Schapiro said, signaled that the S.E.C. had turned the corner in the derivatives overhaul. The agency has proposed or adopted nearly the entire "regulatory regime for derivatives."
The S.E.C., which has more Dodd-Frank duties than any other Wall Street watchdog, fell behind its fellow regulators in changing the regulations for swaps. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and banking regulators proposed similar versions of the capital rules more than a year ago. 
The rules take aim at one of the great calamities of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lead-up to the crisis, banks bought billions of dollars in credit default swaps as protection on mortgage-backed investments. When the investments soured, the American International Group and other insurance companies that churned out swaps contracts lacked the capital to honor their agreements.
Under the S.E.C.'s plan, banks and other so-called swaps dealers that arrange derivatives contracts would face a fixed-dollar capital threshold. The firms would also set aside a ratio equal to 8 percent of the collateral required for swaps contracts. The rules, Ms. Schapiro said, emphasize that swap dealers must hold liquid assets "readily available in times of crisis."
The rules separately require banks to post margin, or collateral, for riskier swaps that do not go through clearinghouses. The banks would use a complex calculation to collect cash or securities from their trading partners. 
Luis A. Aguilar, a Democratic commissioner, praised the effort. 
"We are considering these rules because a grave financial crisis," he said, adding that the crisis "imposed immense costs on the American economy, with tragic effects on American workers and families."

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Increase Taxes

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Broadening the tax base is a better way to address inequality than increasing marginal tax rates, the author writes. 

 BODY:
The French know that wine and cheese are healthy enough in moderation. If only President Franois Hollande understood that the same should go for taxes. 
As Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote last week, Mr. Hollande has proposed a 75 percent marginal tax rate on all income over $1.3 million. Marginal tax rates on capital gains could rise to about 60 percent. French entrepreneurs, bankers and private equity professionals have responded by threatening to move their businesses to London. 
Mr. Sorkin concluded, "The idea of soaking the rich is often a popular one. But if there is a lesson in the French experience, despite the economic models, it is that there are limits." 
What are the limits? What would happen if we copied the French? In the United States, the populist case for redistribution of wealth is stronger now than it has been for generations. Income inequality is the highest it has been since the 1920s, in no small part because of income gains for corporate executives, investment bankers and fund managers. Tax policy and other factors have made the inequality trend more pronounced here than in, say, France. 
The French proposal is half right. Broadening the tax base is a good idea. But the point is to allow for lower overall tax rates, not to confiscate wealth. We could do more to address inequality by making sure that all income is taxed, rather than increasing rates on the already burdened.
The way we know that tax rates are too high is to look at changes in behavior, like decisions whether to work longer or retire early, or to spend money or save it for later. All taxes cause economic distortions, but some distortions are worse than others. The two main behavioral responses to higher tax rates are the income effect and the substitution effect. The income effect occurs when a taxpayer works harder, earning more income to offset the tax and maintain a level rate of consumption. The substitution effect occurs when taxpayers work less to avoid the higher tax, substituting untaxed activity like leisure, household work or off-the-books work. Which effect dominates depends on the circumstances.
Consider how three different activities react to higher tax rates - investment income, labor income and entrepreneurial income.
The first category, investment income, is pretty sensitive to tax rates. Capital is highly mobile, and for this reason the United States generally taxes foreign investors at a low rate, or not at all. American investors also face a reduced rate on capital investments held for more than one year, although it is less clear that this preferential rate is necessary. American investors are taxed on their worldwide income, so mobility is not the issue. The main concern is lock-in - that investors could react to higher tax rates by holding on to assets to defer paying taxes on their gains.
The second category, labor income, is not as sensitive to tax rates. Labor is not as mobile as financial capital, and the income effect helps offset the substitution effect. The optimal tax rate on labor income is probably higher than the optimal tax rate on capital income, although economists differ on this point. 
But economists agree that there can be unwanted effects from high tax rates on labor income as well as capital income. Consider the situation of the second earner in a household. Because we do not tax the imputed income from providing household services to ourselves, it can be cheaper for a second earner to stay home and cook, clean and care for children rather than working outside the home, paying tax and then using after-tax income to pay someone else to assist with those household services. A decision to stay home to take care of children should be motivated by personal preference, not tax policy.
The third category is entrepreneurial income, like small-business income, founders' stock and carried interest for fund managers. The income here is mostly a return on labor, not capital, but it is often lightly taxed as investment income. And this is where the debate tends to get heated. 
The case for a low tax rate on founders' stock is weaker than you might think. When Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg started their companies, the capital gains preference was hardly the motivating factor. Evidence suggests the rate of entrepreneurial entry is not very sensitive to tax rates. Taxing founders at a high rate may be impractical, however, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between investors and founders.
We should start by plucking the low-hanging fruit. Carried interest is labor income, not investment income, and it's not as mobile as financial capital. Few New York-based fund managers will give up United States citizenship and move permanently to Singapore just to avoid paying tax on carried interest. 
The instinct of the French to tax all income at the same rate is a good instinct. The mistake is in setting the rate at 75 percent.
 For further reading on the tax treatment of founders' stock and carried interest, see Victor Fleischer, Taxing Founders' Stock, UCLA Law Review (2011), and Victor Fleischer, Two and Twenty: Taxing Partnership Profits in Private Equity Funds, NYU Law Review (2008).

HEADLINE: 'Binders Full of Women' Now Has a Binder Full of Jokes

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney used the phrase to explain his recruitment efforts of women after becoming governor of Massachusetts. But the awkward phrasing -- conjuring up the image of a three-ring binder stuffed with female job seekers -- exploded quickly. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's comment about having received "binders full of women" while searching for members of the Massachusetts cabinet has become an instant punch line -- and a fresh line of attack for President Obama's campaign.
Mr. Romney used the phrase in the debate on Tuesday night as he tried to explain his recruitment efforts after becoming governor of Massachusetts. But the awkward phrasing -- conjuring up the image of a three-ring binder stuffed with female job seekers -- drew immediate attention.
On Twitter, the phrase took off quickly, with many people mocking Mr. Romney. One said, "Thank you Romney for putting the LOL back into politics. 
Another said,"LOL, Check out who else has a #binderfullofwomen." It linked to a picture of Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner.
The phrase immediately became a "meme" on the Internet, inspiring jokes that marry Mr. Romney's words with all sorts of funny pictures. One showed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reading her BlackBerry with the added words "Romney still uses binders? LOL." Another wrote that "binders are so like 1990s."
The Facebook page "bindersfullofwomen" had nearly 300,000 "likes" by noon.
Even the Republicans got into the act -- in a way. A Web page put up by the Republican National Committee on Wednesday afternoon was headlined "Obama's Second-Term Agenda." Under it was an empty binder.
Joking aside, Democrats seized on the phrase and Mr. Romney's answers during the debate as evidence that his policies would be worse for women than the president's.
In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday afternoon, the Democratic National Committee criticized Mr. Romney's "binders" comment as proof that he does not understand the economic issues that women face.
Lilly Ledbetter, who fought for a law, which bears her name, that made it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases, said she was offended by the binder comment, charging that Mr. Romney did not say anything that would have helped her.
"That binder didn't help me at Goodyear, and it's not helping the woman across this country making 77 cents for every dollar that a man gets," Ms. Ledbetter said.
Jesse Mermell, who ran MassGAP, the nonprofit women's advocacy group that compiled rsums of potential female employees for Mr. Romney in Massachusetts, said he should not have needed the group's research.
"Why did Mitt Romney need binders full of rsums?" Ms. Mermell said. "Were there no women in his 25 years of experience that he had worked with who he thought might be qualified?"
Ms. Mermell said that Mr. Romney appointed women to 42 percent of his cabinet posts in his first year in office, but that later appointments of women dropped to 25 percent.
Mr. Romney's campaign called that kind of criticism nonsense. They said Mr. Romney's comments demonstrated his interest -- and his success -- in expanding the number of women in high positions in state government. And they said his use of the "binders" was not different from efforts by Mr. Obama's administration to encourage gender diversity in hiring.
"Absent a vision or plan for the next four years, President Obama's campaign has little to talk about beyond senseless political attacks, such as criticizing Gov. Mitt Romney for increasing the number of women in Massachusetts state government," said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. "Women across the country are supporting Governor Romney because he will turn our economy around, strengthen the middle class and create 12 million new jobs."
Republicans also noted that officials at MassGAP praised Mr. Romney in 2006, at the end of his term. They pointed to the following quote from the group:
"I think he put more terrific women into high-level jobs because of our project," the group's chairwoman, Liz Levin, said in 2006, according to an article in The Boston Herald.

HEADLINE: Another Debate Postscript: Voters and Gasoline Prices

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: While high gasoline prices are always useful debate fodder, most of the swing states are seeing gas prices below the national average. 

 BODY:
 Gasoline prices are as predictable a political issue in a presidential election campaign as taxes or unemployment, even though presidents have little if any control over them. So it's hardly news that Mitt Romney noted in Tuesday night's debate that gas prices are roughly twice as high as they were when President Obama came to office. 
The president had a ready rejoinder: gas prices plummeted along with the economy in general in 2008 (which is true), and both might skid again if Mr. Romney were to take the reins over the economy (which is debatable).
 So how big an impact might gas prices have on the outcome of the election? 
 The answer is mixed. Republicans are right when they say gas prices are very high this year. According to AAA, the national average price for regular gas is more than 25 cents a gallon higher than it was this time last year, and 2011's prices were not low. More money spent at the pump means less money to spend at the mall and at restaurants.

 But President Obama is lucky: prices at the pump have come down about 11 cents in the last month, and energy experts say they should continue to fall as the election approaches. Prices normally decline in the fall, and high gas prices in California are now easing after a series of refinery accidents a few weeks ago tightened supplies just when refiners were refitting their plants for seasonal changes in gasoline blends.
 Perhaps more to the point, gasoline prices are below the national average of $3.75 per gallon in most of the swing states -- Virginia, Florida, Iowa, Colorado, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- that could determine the victor. Ohio, potentially the most pivotal state, has a price of $3.55 - among the cheapest in the nation. 
 The big exception is Nevada, where the average gallon of regular gasoline is $3.95, 20 cents above the national average. 
 Most of the states that have the highest gas prices - California, New York, Oregon and Washington - are Obama strongholds. And most of the states with the cheapest gas prices tend to be Southern and Romney strongholds, like Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama. The differences have little to do with national politics and more to do with the states' proximity to big refineries and to new bountiful shale fields in the center of the country. 
 So while gasoline prices make for an easy line of attack in a debate or stump speech, it remains to be seen whether they will influence the election outcome.

HEADLINE: Romney Says Obama 'Has Failed America's Women'

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney returned to the campaign trail and made an economic argument for female support. 

 BODY:
CHESAPEAKE, Va. -- At his first public event since Tuesday night's debate, Mitt Romney made no mention of the Obama administration's handling of the deadly attack last month in Libya -- an issue on which he had hoped to score some points during the face-off at Hofstra University on Long Island -- and instead refocused his attention on President Obama's record on jobs and economic issues.
"I think it's interesting that the president still doesn't have an agenda for a second term," Mr. Romney told supporters at an outdoor rally here Wednesday. "Don't you think that it's time for him to finally put together a vision of what he'd do in the next four years if he were elected? I mean, he's got to come up with that over this weekend, because there is only one debate left, on Monday."
Mr. Romney continued: "I just think the American people had expected that the president of the United States would be able to describe what he's going to do in the next four years. But he can't. He can't even explain what he's done in the last four years. I mean, he spends most of his time trying to talk about how my plan won't work. Well, what about his plan? We know his plan has not worked."
Signaling the importance that both campaigns place on the women's vote, Mr. Romney also hit hard on the notion that women have fared particularly poorly under the Obama administration. "This president has failed America's women," he said. "They've suffered in terms of getting jobs. They've suffered in terms of falling into poverty. This is a presidency that has not helped America's women."
But economists have questioned important aspects of Mr. Romney's argument that the Obama administration has been particularly hard for women. Mr. Romney has suggested Mr. Obama is to blame because most jobs lost the past four years had been held by women. However, that argument has been called misleading by economists who say the reason women lost proportionally more jobs in recent years was because male-dominated industries more sensitive to the business cycle like manufacturing and construction were hit heavily, and first, in the recession, before Mr. Obama's inauguration. Later on, state and local governments clobbered by the recession's impact on tax revenue passed budgets that cut education and other government work forces that are more disproportionately composed of women. 
Some economists also say that Republican policies that call for greater shrinkage of governments - where women are more highly represented in jobs like teachers and administrators - may well be worse for female employment than Democratic policies that do not advocate the same government austerity.
Mr. Romney also made light of Mr. Obama's explanation during Tuesday night's debate why gasoline prices had risen sharply the past four years. (Gas prices plunged during the 2008 collapse as the economy sputtered to a halt.)
"The president's answer -- you remember this -- he said, 'Well, the economy has gotten stronger,' " Mr. Romney said. "Now, on that basis, when we have a real recovery he would suggest that gasoline prices are going to go up to six or eight dollars -- is that what he is saying? I mean, this was the most classic of the nonanswers of the night."
He added, "I think it's pretty clear that when it comes to his policies and his answers and his agenda, he's pretty much running on fumes."
Mr. Romney also hit on some of his stock campaign-trail themes. But he did not make mention of what his campaign has sought to capitalize on as its first significant opening on foreign policy in recent months: what Obama administration critics have characterized as the White House's slow, grudging willingness to admit that the attack in Benghazi last month that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans was an act of terrorism and not a spontaneous reaction to a YouTube video offensive to Muslims.
At the debate, Mr. Romney had sought to use the administration's shifting accounts of the attack against Mr. Obama, but the president called "offensive" the suggestion that the White House misled anyone. Mr. Romney's aides were left arguing after the debate that Mr. Obama had not really described the attack early on as an act of terror, after the moderator, Candy Crowley, during the debate had backed up Mr. Obama when he said he had done so.

HEADLINE: Crumbling Deal Exposes Clash of Wealthy Family Dynasties

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: A powerful family in Indonesia appears to have outmaneuvered the British financier Nathaniel Rothschild in a battle for control of the coal mining giant Bumi. 

 BODY:
For more than two centuries, the Rothschild name has stood for a deft touch in European cross-border finance, as well as representing great wealth and influence.
Today, the family name, one of Europe's banking dynasties, has become ensnared in a nasty dispute after a powerful family in Indonesia appears to have outmaneuvered Nathaniel Rothschild, the five-times great-grandson of the dynasty's founder.
After an inauspicious start as a young investment analyst at Gleacher in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, Mr. Rothschild's rise as a moneymaker in his own right has been fairly rapid. He was co-chairman of the hedge fund Atticus Capital before striking out on his own and engineering a series of international deals.
 In late 2010, he announced what was expected to be his most ambitious project yet, a $3 billion deal with the Bakrie family, an Indonesian dynasty whose vast interests include both mining and politics, to create the London-listed mining giant Bumi.
"We've announced the creation of an Indonesian coal champion," Mr. Rothschild said at a news conference at the time.
That partnership now lies in ruins.
Mr. Rothschild, a 41-year-old British financier, has resigned from Bumi's board amid allegations of financial misconduct at some of the company's Indonesian subsidiaries. The owners have been caught in a yearlong feud over the running of the company. And questions have been raised about the corporate governance that allowed Bumi to trade on the London Stock Exchange.
In the latest round of infighting, Mr. Rothschild - a descendant of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who helped finance the British victory over Napoleon at Waterloo - has accused Samin Tan, Bumi's chairman, of not protecting the rights of minority shareholders.
"I have lost confidence in the ability of the board to stand up for investors," Mr. Rothschild, who owns roughly a 12 percent stake in the company, said in a letter announcing his resignation from Bumi's board.
In response, the Bakries said Mr. Rothschild should return his shares and other financial benefits connected to the mining company.
"What a disappointment Mr. Rothschild has been to us," said Christopher Fong, a spokesman for the Bakrie family.
Mr. Rothschild is insisting that any decision about Bumi's future be delayed until an investigation is finished into ostensible financial misconduct at its subsidiaries, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
The alliance with the Bakries had been part of a bet by Mr. Rothschild on the surging demand for coal by fast-growing economies in Asia. He raised 707 million, or $1.1 billion, in the 2010 initial public offering of Vallar, a London-listed investment company that was created to make acquisitions in the natural resources sector.
Later that year, Mr. Rothschild organized a cash-and-stock deal worth $3 billion that would give his company access to a number of Indonesian coal mining assets. The takeover also gave the Bakries a controlling stake in Bumi, the renamed Vallar that remains listed in London.
Since the deal was completed, not much has gone right for Bumi, as Mr. Rothschild's effort to profit from an expected commodities boom has floundered.
With demand for coal falling because of the global financial crisis, the company's share price has plummeted more than 80 percent over the last 18 months. In the first half of this year, the company reported a net loss of $106 million, a slight improvement on the $296 million loss in the same period last year. The value of Mr. Rothschild's own investment of $148 million has more than halved, to $86 million.
Mr. Rothschild and his Indonesian business partners also have clashed over how the company should be run.
In a terse letter to the board late last year, Mr. Rothschild called on Bumi's chief executive at the time, Ari Hudaya, to resign. Mr. Rothschild said the company's head had failed to attend board meetings, dismissed investors' questions and neglected his duties as chief executive.
"It has become abundantly clear that he is neither fit nor suitable to carry on as C.E.O.," Mr. Rothschild said.
The Bakries, however, have been calling the shots.
Late last year, the family sold a 24 percent stake in Bumi to Mr. Tan, a fellow Indonesian mining mogul, for $1 billion. The deal helped the Indonesian dynasty to repay outstanding loans owed to a consortium of lenders led by Credit Suisse.
After calling a shareholding meeting to reshuffle Bumi's executives, Mr. Tan took over as chairman, while Mr. Rothschild was reduced to a nonindependent director.
Controversy has continued to follow the ill-fated partnership.
Last month, Bumi announced an investigation into accusations of financial misconduct totaling $500 million at several of its Indonesian subsidiaries. The accusations relate to financial accounting records for last year in which certain investments were marked down to zero, according to a company statement.
The Bakries have been quick to respond. Last week, the family offered a combined $1.2 billion to acquire all of Bumi's mining assets. The deal would involve a partial share swap for a 10.3 percent stake in PT Bumi Resources, a subsidiary. The Indonesian family would then offer to buy Bumi's remaining 18.9 percent stake in the Indonesian coal mining company for cash by the end of the year.
The Bakries also want to buy Bumi's majority control of PT Berau Coal Energy, another Indonesian mining company, in the next six months.
"A lot of investors may want to sell up and move on," said Richard Knights, an analyst with Liberum Capital in London.
Those shareholders do not include Mr. Rothschild. The British financier has ridiculed the proposal, saying the board should not review the deal until the investigation into financial misconduct is completed.
He also has accused his Indonesian partners of giving Mr. Tan, Bumi's chairman, preferential treatment under which he could receive more than double what has been offered to other shareholders.
"It would be a disgrace to proceed with, or even to entertain, the proposal made by the Bakries," Mr. Rothschild said.
A spokesman for Bumi said the board would continue to look at the proposal.
The problems facing Mr. Rothschild have again raised concerns over natural-resources companies that want to list in London. Analysts say many of these companies are eager to tap the British capital's large investor base, but have often restricted the amount of shares offered to new shareholders so that majority owners can retain control.
Eurasian Natural Resources, a London-listed mining company part owned by the Kazakh government, for example, has run into a series of governance problems in recent years. That includes the ousting of some of its British board members last year after the majority Kazakh owners opposed their reappointment.
Scrutiny also has centered on so-called reverse takeovers, in which a private firm can obtain a London listing by acquiring a publicly traded company. Mr. Rothschild's deal to create Bumi allowed the Bakries to avoid many of the checks that would have been required if the Indonesian family had tried to take the company public on its own.
Last year, Mr. Rothschild also helped the Turkish company Genel Energy to float in London after it was acquired by Vallares, an investment company co-founded by Mr. Rothschild and BP's former chief executive Tony Hayward, for $2.1 billion.
British regulators are moving to clamp down. This month, the Financial Services Authority, the country's regulator, completed plans to restrict the ability of firms to complete reverse takeovers in London. Authorities also are demanding greater separation between a company's controlling shareholder and the daily operations of the business.
"There's been a misunderstanding in the market because many of these rules were unwritten," said John Hammond, head of capital markets at the consultancy Deloitte in London. "Now they've been laid out for everyone to see."

HIGHLIGHT: An affirmative-action hearing that ought to embarrass both the Supreme Court and the state of Texas. 

 BODY:
On reading the transcript and listening to the audio of last week's Supreme Court argument in the University of Texas affirmative action case, my primary reaction was one of embarrassment - for the court and also for Texas.
First the court. Of the four justices most intent on curbing or totally eradicating affirmative action - Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Clarence Thomas - the three who spoke (minus Justice Thomas, of course) failed to engage with the deep issues raised by Fisher v. University of Texas. Instead, they toyed with the case.
Chief Justice Roberts, after posing only one question to the lawyer representing Abigail Fisher, the rejected white applicant who filed a lawsuit claiming she was unconstitutionally discriminated against, flung 27 questions at the university's lawyer, Gregory G. Garre, many seemingly designed to make the university's commitment to assembling a diverse student body look silly. "Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the Hispanic box or some different box?" the chief justice wanted to know. "What about one-eighth?" he persisted. "Would it violate the honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and says 'I identify as Hispanic' to check the Hispanic box?"
Justice Scalia piled on: "Did they require everybody to check a box or they have somebody figure out, oh, this person looks one thirty-second Hispanic and that's enough?"
On it went, and it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that ridicule rather than a search for understanding was the name of the game. "How many people are there in the affirmative action department of the University of Texas?" Justice Scalia asked Mr. Garre. "Do you have any idea? There must be a lot of people to, you know, to monitor all these classes and do all of this assessment of race throughout the thing." Justice Scalia mused that if the court invalidated the program, "there would be a large number of people out of a job," a prospect that seemed to tickle his fancy.

It doesn't take a genius to point out that it's inherently problematic for the government to count people by race ("It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race," as Chief Justice Roberts famously expressed the thought during his first term on the court, dissenting from a 2006 Voting Rights Act decision that found that Texas had improperly diluted Latino voting strength). That's why the Supreme Court has insisted that any affirmative action plan must meet the test of "strict scrutiny" - that is, that the plan must be "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling interest."
But the fact is, as the justices obviously know, that the court has concluded that affirmative action in higher education admissions can clear that high bar - as it did nine years ago in Grutter v. Bollinger, the University of Michigan Law School decision. In other words, there was a context in which the Regents of the University of Texas, following upon the Michigan decision, chose to act, a history they sought to acknowledge, and a better future they hoped to achieve for their diverse state by supplementing the unsatisfactory and mechanical "top 10 percent" admissions plan with one that considers each applicant as an individual - with race as "only one modest factor among many others," according to the university's brief. It was this context that was almost entirely missing from the justices' questions to the university's lawyer. The questions were not so much hostile as trivializing.
By reference to context, I mean context outside the confines of this case - some recognition that although we may wish otherwise, there is still such a thing as race in America, still problems to solve and barriers to overcome. After all, nine years ago in the Michigan decision, from which Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented (Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito were not on the court), the court said it expected that affirmative action would need to continue for another quarter century. To quote Justice Stephen G. Breyer's acerbic comment from the bench: "I know that time flies." (Or, as Justice Scalia said with equal asperity to the university's lawyer, "Sixteen more years and you're going to call it all off.")
By coincidence, on the day the Supreme Court was hearing the Texas case, three federal judges sitting a mile or so down Constitution Avenue issued an opinion in another racially freighted case, a challenge by the federal government to South Carolina's new voter ID law. The judges, convened as a special Federal District Court under the Voting Rights Act, concluded that South Carolina's law, at least as it exists on paper, will not have a racially discriminatory effect. But they were sufficiently uncertain about the state's ability to live up to its promise of ready availability of photo identification that they barred the law from taking effect for the 2012 election.
"Racial insensitivity, racial bias, and indeed outright racism are still problems throughout the United States as of 2012," the opinion said. "We see that reality on an all-too-frequent basis. The long march for equality for African-Americans is not finished." Not only the opinion's language but its authorship was striking: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the federal judiciary's most high-profile conservatives. (At age 47, Judge Kavanaugh is a likely future Republican Supreme Court nominee. On Tuesday of this week, he wrote an important opinion for the D.C. Circuit overturning the military commission conviction of a prominent one-time detainee at Guantnamo Bay, Salim Ahmed Hamdan.) Would it have been too much to expect something similar from Chief Justice Roberts and his allies on the Supreme Court bench, some acknowledgment in passing that the Texas Regents didn't pluck the notion of affirmative action out of thin air and were trying to do what they believed was not only appropriate but, under the Supreme Court's precedents, perfectly legal?
The notion of "critical mass" figured prominently in the argument, the university's point being that it needs to be able to take measures to address the "racial isolation" experienced by many of the minority students scattered by ones or twos among the small classes that predominate at the Austin campus. This would not seem to be a difficult concept to grasp, yet Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia and Justice Alito appeared baffled by it. 
Mr. Garre noted that in 2002, when the university was relying simply on admitting the top 10 percent of students in every Texas high school, only 3 percent of the student body was African-American. (It is now about twice that.) Well, the chief justice wanted to know, if that wasn't a critical mass, what was? His various questions included these: "When will we know that you've reached a critical mass?" "What is the logical end point?" "At what level will it satisfy the critical mass?"
Mr. Garre, an experienced Supreme Court advocate who served as President George W. Bush's last solicitor general, was too canny to fall into the trap. He knew that the minute he offered a number, the justices would pounce and call it an illegitimate quota. Back in the Michigan case, in which the concept of critical mass also played a role, the justices seemed to get it. At one point Mr. Garre, referring to the Michigan decision, said to Justice Scalia in evident frustration: "Well, your honor, Grutter is this court's precedent. We're guided by it here. At least the advocates are."
(You may have noticed, perhaps with surprise, that I haven't mentioned Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. He asked very few questions, and actually seemed to be working to figure the case out. Of course, that may just be a relative question of style. In 25 years on the court, Justice Kennedy has never voted to uphold a government program that counts people by race. The question in this case isn't whether Justice Kennedy will vote to limit the Texas plan, but how far he - and therefore possibly the court - will go.)
At the beginning of this column, I said I was embarrassed not only for the court, but for Texas as well. Here's why. The university freely concedes, as it must, that the "top 10 percent" plan provides its modicum of diversity only because the high schools in Texas are so segregated. A high school in south Texas sends Latino students to U.T. just as an inner-city high school in Dallas sends black students. That much is obvious - in fact, it was part of the original understanding when the state came up with this approach in the mid-1990s after a federal appeals court invalidated a more typical affirmative action plan. 
What is perhaps less obvious is something the university concedes only obliquely: that the top 10 percent of students graduating from under-funded and under-performing high schools are often ill-equipped to get the most from - or offer the most to - a major research university. Further, the 10 percent plan deprives the university of better-prepared students of all backgrounds who, like Abigail Fisher, just miss the cut-off at better high schools, students that Texas would very much like to attract and keep. 
In its brief, the university talks about its supplement to the 10 percent plan, under which a quarter of the entering class is selected via "holistic" consideration, as serving the goal of "increasing diversity within diversity." Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., arguing for the federal government as a friend-of-the-court for Texas, explained that the university "will look for individuals who will play against racial stereotypes just by what they bring: the African-American fencer, the Hispanic who has mastered classical Greek." The problem, he said, was that the university "can't control" the diversity produced by the 10 percent plan.
That is certainly an accurate description of the painful reality that Texas faces as the result of huge disparities in educational opportunity brought about by huge disparities in wealth among its hundreds of school districts. Texas is hardly alone in this: financing local schools through the local tax base is, after all, the American way. 
But there is a particular historical irony to the fact that it is Texas that has to admit to the world that students in the top 10 percent of numerous public high schools aren't good enough for the state's flagship university. Next year will be the 40th anniversary of a hugely important but little-remembered Supreme Court decision, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez. The case was a challenge, brought on behalf of Mexican-American children in an underfinanced San Antonio school district, to the state's system of relying largely on local wealth to pay for local schools. 
The San Antonio litigation was part of a movement aimed at persuading the Supreme Court to recognize a constitutional basis for economic rights. The notion didn't seem far-fetched in the closing years of the Warren Court era. But by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, that era was over, and President Richard Nixon had made four Supreme Court appointments in rapid succession. Texas defended its system and prevailed, with the support of all four Nixon appointees. The vote to reject what the majority properly recognized as a profound challenge to the status quo was 5 to 4. 
How different public education might be today had the San Antonio case gone the other way is, of course, impossible to say. But to my mind, at least, that was the question that hung in the air as the state struggled to explain why the top-10-percent plan fell short.
And thinking about the legacy of the San Antonio decision brought to mind the words that William H. Rehnquist, as an associate justice, wrote in dissent from a decision upholding an affirmative action plan in the steel industry. The future chief justice argued passionately that by upholding the plan, the court was violating the letter and spirit of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. "The court has sown the wind," he wrote. "Later courts will face the impossible task of reaping the whirlwind." The case was United Steelworkers of America v. Weber. The year was 1979. The next year, a young law school graduate arrived in the Rehnquist chambers as a law clerk. His name was John Roberts.

HEADLINE: Larry Page on Regulation, Maps and Google's Social Mission

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: In his first public appearance since the company said he lost his voice for undisclosed health reasons, Larry Page, Google's chief executive, answered questions about antitrust and privacy investigations, Google Maps on the iPhone and Google's company culture. 

 BODY:
Google welcomes regulatory scrutiny but is worried that too much regulation could hurt its business and the prospects for Internet innovation, Larry Page, Google's chief executive, said Tuesday.
Mr. Page, speaking publicly for the first time since Google said in June that he had lost his voice and would avoid public appearances, was at Google's annual Zeitgeist conference for advertisers and partners in Paradise Valley, Ariz. His voice sounded weak. "I'm still a little hoarse, but I'm here and I'm happy about that," he said.
Mr. Page responded to questions about investigations by regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, into both privacy violations and whether Google violates antitrust rules by favoring its own services over others.
"We've had a pretty good debate with the regulators, we've taken an approach to work with them," Mr. Page said. "I think that's been working, and you know, I'm hopeful that will continue to work well."
"I do think overregulation of the Internet and restriction of what people can do is a big risk for us," he said.
"We don't actually know how the Internet's going to work 10 years from now, so it's kind of, I think, a mistake to start carving out large classes of things that you don't really understand yet," Mr. Page said. "That's kind of the approach a lot of regulators are taking, which I think is sad."
It is essential for Google's core business, search, for it to enter some of its customers' businesses, he said, including maps, local search and comparison shopping.
"If you type 'Sony digital camera,' do you want a list of links to other search engines?" Mr. Page said. "I don't think that's really right. You probably want product information, you want to buy something. So our job is to serve users, to serve all of you, and to do a really good job doing that, and a lot of times that requires us really answering the question and understanding deeply the underlying information."
Mr. Page spoke at a resort in the shadow of Camelback Mountain, along with speakers like Sean Penn, the celebrity economist Austan Goolsbee, the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and Bill Clinton, who joined virtually via Google Plus Hangout.
Mr. Page addressed other controversial issues for Google, including the recent uproar over maps after Apple removed Google's maps from the iPhone and replaced them with its own version, which many people said was inferior.
He did not say when Google would release a maps app for the iPhone, but subtly goaded Apple when he said, "We're excited that other people have started to notice that we've worked hard on that for seven years."
Mr. Page also spent a lot of time talking about Google's social mission, beyond making money, a new theme for him to discuss publicly as chief executive. He said it affects everything from YouTube's controversial decision to selectively block the anti-Islam video that provoked riots to Google's generous employee benefits.
"We have somewhat of a social mission, and most other companies do not," Mr. Page said. "I think that's why people like working for us, and using our services."
Companies' goals, he said, should be to make their employees so wealthy that they do not need to work, but choose to because they believe in the company.
"My grandfather was an auto worker, and I still have a lead hammer that he would carry to work everyday to protect himself from the company that he worked for," Mr. Page said.
"Hopefully, I believe in a world of abundance, and in that world, many of our employees don't have to work, they're pretty wealthy, they could probably go years without working," he said. "Why are they working? They're working because they like doing something, they believe in what they're doing."

HEADLINE: BlackRock Will Expand Exchange-Traded Funds

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
8:22 p.m. | Updated
BlackRock, the giant money management firm, is making a big push to expand its business in exchange-traded funds after benefiting from strong investor interest.
The firm said on Wednesday that investments had increased in most of the products it manages, pushing its third-quarter profit up 17 percent, to $610 million, from the period a year earlier.
But the biggest increases came in BlackRock's iShares business, the world's largest provider of E.T.F.'s, which are single stocks that contain baskets of other assets like stocks or bonds. 
At a time when many popular investment products are offering disappointing returns, the low fees of the exchange-traded funds have been attractive to investors. In September, the industry drew in more money than in any other month since late 2009.
BlackRock executives said that the company attracted 31 percent, or $25.2 billion, of all new E.T.F. business in the third quarter. More money flowed into iShares than at any time since BlackRock acquired the business from Barclays in 2009.
Earlier this week, BlackRock announced that it was introducing a new lower-cost brand of the popular funds for retail investors, after some of its competitors, including Charles Schwab and Vanguard, made similar moves in recent weeks. In a conference call on Wednesday, BlackRock executives said they were also making an expanded effort to sell their exchange-traded funds using the company's first television ads.
"We have the pedal to the metal here," said Robert S. Kapito, BlackRock's president.
BlackRock has grown into the world's largest money manager over the last decade thanks to its acquisition of iShares. Its traditional stock and bond mutual funds have also grown, as have its more sophisticated offerings for larger, institutional investors.
The company has managed to avoid the scrutiny that other parts of the financial industry have faced because it is focused on managing client money rather than taking big trading risks.
In recent quarters, the company has shown unusual signs of struggling with risk aversion among investors worried by a continuing European debt crisis and slow economic growth in the United States. In the second quarter of this year, both revenue and assets under management fell at BlackRock.
But in the third quarter, the company arrested that decline. The company increased the total pool of money it was managing for investors by 10 percent from a year earlier. Revenue across the company rose to $2.32 billion, up 4 percent from the previous quarter and also 4 percent from the third quarter of 2011.
The firm earned $3.47 a share on a diluted basis, a record for the company, and exceeded the $3.32 a share expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Eric Berg, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients on Wednesday that iShares had been popular with professional investors and traders but had been lagging with retail investors - something the new marketing push should help to correct.
"Everything announced by BlackRock is being done to get the company back on a high-growth trajectory in the retail channel," Mr. Berg said.
BlackRock's retail investors reflected broader trends by showing a preference for the fixed-income products that are viewed as more stable in uncertain times.
But the institutional investors who account for a larger portion of the money managed by BlackRock showed a renewed willingness to go into riskier equity, or stock-based products, which drew $22 billion of total new investment.
"The preference for equities represents a major shift in sentiment from the fixed-income bias we were seeing across the platform in prior quarters," said Anne Marie Petach, the company's chief financial officer.
Most of the money that was invested in stock-based products went into exchange-traded funds. One of the few disappointing areas during the quarter was actively managed stock funds, which have grown less popular as E.T.F.'s have risen.
Some analysts fear that declining E.T.F. fees could eat into BlackRock's revenue, but BlackRock executives said the lower fees could help the company's overall business strategy of drawing in clients who want broader help managing their portfolios.
"Thanks to the work we've done in the past few years, we are better positioned than any time in our history," said the firm's chief executive, Laurence D. Fink.
BlackRock shares rose sharply when markets opened on Wednesday, but were down about 0.4 percent at closing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Student-Loan Borrowers Average $26,500 in Debt

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The average student-loan debt of borrowers in the college class of 2011 rose to about $26,500, a 5 percent increase from about $25,350 the previous year, according to a report by the Institute for College Access and Success's Project on Student Debt. 
The project said that about two-thirds of those who earned bachelor's degrees last year had loans. About one-fifth of the debt was from private student loans, which have fewer consumer protections and repayment options than federal loans.
Although federal data show that graduates of for-profit colleges are far more likely to borrow, and borrow more, than those who attend other types of colleges, the report's findings focus only on public and nonprofit colleges, because only nine for-profit colleges (less than 2 percent) reported the necessary figures.
Over all, this year's report, the institute's seventh, was based on responses from 55 percent of the institutions surveyed. But many colleges, including a quarter of those singled out for high debt levels in the previous report, did not report their debt figures for the class of 2011.
The College Board's debt estimates, based on a different survey, will not be released until next week, but Sandra Baum, the economist who writes that report, said they would be slightly lower than the figures in the Project on Student Debt report.
The project's report stresses the need for the federal government to gather and disseminate information on every college's average debt at graduation.
''Voluntarily reported data is all that we've got to shed light on how debt at graduation varies from school to school and year to year,'' said Matthew Reed, the primary author of the report. ''Twelve percent of the colleges that reported debt data for 2010 didn't report for 2011, and virtually no for-profit colleges reported at all.''
''The need for federal collection of key debt information at all colleges could not be more clear,'' Mr. Reed added.
While a college degree remains the likeliest route to employment and good wages, Lauren Asher, who heads the student-debt project, said that at a time of rising tuition and low employment rates for young people, fear of debt might stop some students from getting the education they needed. Better consumer information could help address that problem, she said.
Average debt varied widely from college to college, as did the share of students graduating with loans. Of those that reported their data and had more than 100 graduates, Lawrence Technological University, in Michigan, had the highest average debt: $46,677, with 74 percent of graduates having borrowed. York College, part of the public City University of New York, had the lowest: $2,996, with 24 percent of graduates having borrowed.
There were 64 colleges where more than 90 percent of graduates had debt.
Average debt at graduation also varied from state to state, from a high of $32,450 in New Hampshire to a low of $17,227 in Utah.
As in previous years, the high-debt states were concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, and low-debt states in the West and the South.

HEADLINE: With a New Menu and a Makeover, a Promise to Keep Going

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio
A 1957 Buick Special, burgundy and white, its chrome strips reflecting like fun-house mirrors. A 1955 Pontiac Star Chief, bronze and cream, with a translucent hood ornament that glows in the dark. A 1963 Ford Thunderbird, the color of a vanilla shake, just waiting to be floored to some dreamlike drive-in.
These American-made wonders preen at the edge of Ely Square Park, some with tail fins audacious enough for spaceflight, others with open hoods boasting of the muscular engines beneath. Their proud owners watch from folding chairs like protective parents, ready to pounce at any violation of the code to look but not touch.
It is a midsummer Sunday in Elyria, and Donna Dove, the harried owner of Donna's Diner, right here on Middle Avenue, has somehow managed to stage another classic car show. She arranges the event every year because she wants to enliven the bustle-free downtown, and because old American cars remind her of better days in a city that once helped to build them. 
Better days behind us, she says, and better days to come.
Once the ideological tug-of-war of this presidential campaign comes to its final pull, the decisions made by the winner will become real in places like Elyria, affecting everything from city services to health care. If soldiers are again needed, some will come from here, where the names of those who served are engraved on park brick, near the soaring Civil War monument.
But if there were film in the oversize mock camera above the Loomis Camera store on Broad Street -- the one that has been trained on the park for decades -- it would capture the constant that transcends presidential politics: the shared determination to make it through this day and into the next.
It would record the fits of earnest energy along Middle Avenue, which faces the park: the hard-up workers, leaving the Minute Man temp agency before dawn for day jobs at a greenhouse in Oberlin, or a nursing home in Lorain; the civic-minded volunteers of Main Street Elyria, gathering to discuss how to revive downtown; the no-nonsense city laborers, polishing the city gem that is Ely Square.
Like characters out of a Thornton Wilder play -- or maybe a short story by Sherwood Anderson, who once lived here -- the denizens of Middle Avenue play out their roles under the watchful eye of that looming Loomis camera. The customers of Lorain National Bank, checking on savings, seeking loans. The clients of the divorce lawyer John Haynes, dividing assets, nursing wounds. And, at the end of the block, the owner of Donna's Diner, taking orders, cooking food, trying to stay open.
Up Against the Wall
Donna opened her diner a dozen years ago, and did all right for a while, if all right means working six days a week and spending the seventh day shopping for supplies. But the recession, set against the steady decline of Elyria's downtown, finally caught up with her this year. She's all in -- 401(k) gone, health insurance nonexistent -- and very nearly out. Just paying the electric bill has become a monthly cliffhanger.
She is torn about what to do. Some days she tends to agree with a loyal customer known as the Judge: James M. Burge, the administrative judge of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. Over his daily routine of grilled chicken and cottage cheese, he has suggested that Donna close the diner and run the courthouse cafeteria for a captive clientele, no pun intended.
Other days, though, she resolves to remain open for her family of regulars, including the mostly older customers called the Breakfast Club. Where would Speedy Amos, the former Marine who fought in both World War II and the Korean War, get his morning coffee? And Bill Balena, the bankruptcy lawyer? And Jack Baird, the councilman? And Janice Haywood, from Brandau Jewelers, now closed, like so much else in downtown?
Donna, 57, is flirting with a third option that she is keeping to herself. But first she has to get through her car show.
This Sunday morning begins for Donna at 5:45, with the cooking of the bacon for breakfast and the ribs for lunch. Soon, she and various family members are hustling to serve eggs and coffee to the car owners who have already parked their precious commodities along the edge of Ely Square. But ratcheting up the morning tension is Donna herself.
The rule of the house is: When Donna's unhappy, watch out. And she is unhappy.
The Chronicle-Telegram of Elyria barely mentioned the car show, so the turnout of car owners and visitors will be low. The city promised help, but didn't deliver much. Donna spent $1,000 of her own money on trophies and door prizes and printed fliers, and will wind up being out $300.
One of her helpers has boiled eight dozen eggs -- eight dozen! -- instead of the three dozen requested. Another electric bill has arrived, with another late charge. Donna's 21-year-old granddaughter, Bridgette Harvan, a college student who works as a waitress at the diner, is announcing to customers that she is pregnant -- a boy, it turns out. Donna, who got pregnant at 16, has received this news with mixed emotions.
And the meal orders just keep coming.
''It's like this force holding me down,'' Donna says. '' 'Let's see if you can get past this one. ...' ''
But then, from the park's gazebo, a band called Johnny Aces and the Wingmen launches into a version of ''Cara Mia'' that rings through the city square, and Donna's mood brightens. More classic cars are pulling into downtown, people are stopping to admire this Buick and that Studebaker, and a moribund stretch of Elyria comes alive.
''The thing is, I did it myself,'' she says.
Tail Fins and Chrome
A 1966 Ford Galaxie, sky blue. A 1956 Chevy Bel Air, blue and white. That 1957 Buick Special, with its requisite touches: fuzzy dice dangling from the rearview mirror and an American flag at full-staff on the antenna. Their gleaming chrome can blind.
Cars matter to Elyria, especially cars like these. Beyond their evocation of open-road possibility, they have the aerodynamic brawn to carry one's expectations through any wall, into the future. They remind the city of when thousands worked at the General Motors plant here; when automobile subcontractors peppered the city; when, a century ago, the Elyrian industrialist Arthur Lovett Garford produced a horseless carriage called, simply, the Garford.
Take the Breakfast Club, for example. Speedy Amos announces his Marine fealty on the license-plate frame of his Chrysler Concorde. Dale Price, retired from the telephone company, has a flapping American flag painted on the hood of his black Volkswagen Jetta. And Jim Dall, who ran the local Ford dealership for decades (a Ford banner for Distinguished Achievement, 1961, hangs in his garage), incorporates great pomp in the annual summertime unveiling of his 2002 turquoise Thunderbird convertible.
But Donna outpaces them all. On a shelf behind her cash register are displayed 27 miniature car models, including a 1957 Ford Thunderbird and a 1959 Chevy Impala. In her driveway, she parks a 1975 black-and-white Chevy Camaro that, when she guns it, makes her feel 40 years younger.
And in her subconscious, the search continues for the car of her childhood: her mother's 1963 Chevy Impala convertible, a buffed-red thing of beauty that -- when its top was down -- could blow away the daily woes of a troubled household.
But this magical convertible vanished one day to become Donna's enduring symbol of the almost. Her mother says that Donna's hard-drinking father got drunk in Cleveland one night and forgot where he had parked it, but Donna has always assumed that it was repossessed.
''We lost the car, we lost the house,'' Donna says.
So, as if to reclaim that car, as if to resurrect the way things used to be -- if only for a day -- Donna arranges for this classic car show, an event whose defiant undercurrent is expressed by the revving-engine arrival of six more cars, including a 1955 Ford pickup and a souped-up 1971 Chevy Nova. Even Johnny Aces and his Wingmen cannot compete.
The automobile afternoon continues. The sprays of the park fountain cut shimmering arcs in the air, the passing freight trains sing of their burdens, and the characters of Elyria strut across the stage just outside Donna's Diner.
Here, admiring the classic Fords and Buicks, is Pete Aldrich, 52, a Donna's regular who, only a few months ago, was out of work and living a little rough, spending the occasional night in his car. Nearly every morning he'd hustle out of the diner for another job interview, no matter that his eyeglasses were missing an arm.
But his life has improved since then. He has a job as a sales representative for a restaurant-service company, an apartment a few blocks from Donna's -- and a pair of eyeglasses with both arms intact.
Here, lingering in front of Donna's is Ike Maxwell, 59, once an all-everything football hero for Elyria, class of '72, and now a downtown denizen with a brain injury from a baseball-bat attack three decades ago. Wearing shorts, white socks and sandals, he is shouting again, in his never-ending conversation with all of Elyria.
Donna makes a deal with him. Stop yelling and I'll feed you. Soon Ike is sitting at a picnic table in the park, eating a roast beef sub from a plastic foam container, while someone nearby nods in his direction and says, ''He could have been great, man.''
Here, eating a chili dog, is Holly Brinda, 54, the mayor of Elyria, her hometown. No matter where she looks, she sees an issue needing attention. If she gazes out her office window, she sees a homeless couple sleeping outside the First Congregational Church. If she walks through the city's core, she sees vacancies.
But Ms. Brinda, in only her first year of office, also sees hope, in the global industries based in her city, in the local think tank that is Lorain County Community College, even in the clean-slate possibilities of this profoundly challenged downtown. When someone asks her what's going on, she answers with unmistakable cheer. ''All of it,'' she says.
Finding a Way Forward
And here is Donna Dove herself: a small--business woman in northeastern Ohio who feels as though the faster she runs, the more she falls behind. Her diner, the business she always dreamed of, is a few bad lunch crowds from closing down for good.
Though she hasn't made it public, she now knows what she is going to do. No, she will not shut down for good. Nor will she take the advice of a customer, the Judge, to move her business to the courthouse cafeteria. Instead, she'll close the diner for a week or so, redecorate it, change its menu -- add a macaroni-and-cheese bar, for example -- and reopen. New and improved.
In a few weeks, she will be hobnobbing in the back of her diner with Mark Ondrejech of US Foods, her wholesale food supplier and unofficial business adviser. She will lay out her vision of a new menu, a new look, a new -- Donna's.
''Just so that it's ...,'' she will say, trailing off in search of the key word.
''Different,'' Mark will volunteer.
''Different,'' she will agree.
And then, one Sunday afternoon in late September, Donna will go to Office Depot to buy rolls of shipping paper, some tape, and two pieces of poster board. She will cover the plate-glass windows of her diner with brown paper, and write out the words for two signs, her black marker squeaking with each stroke:
CLOSED
Coming Soon
NEW Donna's Diner
Re-opening
Monday Oct 1 7am
This small, modest diner, in a 19th-century brick building on the corner of Middle Avenue and Second Street, is not merely a business for Donna Dove. ''That diner is me,'' she says.
''I'm just going forward,'' Donna adds. ''I'm not looking back.''
This resolve of hers -- this determination to reinvent herself -- can sometimes seem particularly Elyrian. It is seen, for example, in Tianna Madison, an Elyria track star who would win an Olympic gold medal a couple of weeks after the car show. It is seen, too, in Howard Foxman, the owner of Loomis Camera, who will soon close his store after 62 years -- that oversize mock camera will come down -- but who, at 91, will continue his business, on eBay.
For now, Donna is keeping her plans to herself, as she supervises the final moments of a car show that has temporarily perked up the downtown of her city.
Soon the lead singer of Johnny Aces and the Wingmen is calling out the day's trophy winners, and then summoning Donna to the bandstand to take a bow. She tends to loom large in her diner, but here, in the park's gazebo, she seems smaller somehow. She is also not wearing her ever-present apron.
''One more time for Donna,'' the bandleader says. ''She works very, very hard.'' Then, chuckling, he says, ''Now get off the stage.''
The band closes with some Roy Orbison. A fleet of American-made beauties start their engines. And Donna Dove steps down from the stage to melt back into Elyria.
Donna's Diner: Articles in this series have examined the expectations, disappointments and challenges that shape the lives of Donna Dove, her customers and the city they know intimately, Elyria, Ohio.

HEADLINE: U.S. Home Construction Climbs to a 4-Year High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Builders started construction on homes in September at the fastest rate since July 2008 and made plans to build even more homes in the coming months. The gains show the housing recovery is strengthening and could help the economy grow. 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that home construction rose 15 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000. Single-family construction rose 11 percent to the fastest rate in four years. Apartment building increased 25.1 percent.
Applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, jumped nearly 12 percent to an annual rate of 894,000, also the highest since July 2008.
''If there was any doubt that the housing market was undergoing a recovery, even a modest one in the face of the terrible 2008 decline, those doubts should be erased by now,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.
The construction rate has increased by more than 38 percent over the last 12 months.
Housing starts are now 82.5 percent above the recession low rate of 478,000 hit in April 2009. That is still well short of the 1.5 million that economists consider healthy and far below the more than two million built in 2007 -- the peak of the housing boom. But the steady upward trend suggests builders believe the housing rebound is durable.
''This is a good report,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist at HIS Global Insight. ''It is telling us that the housing market is improving and there is no reason to think that this will not continue going forward.''
Record-low mortgage rates, stable price increases and a limited supply of previously occupied homes have made newly built homes more attractive to buyers. Builder confidence is at a six-year high, according to a survey released Tuesday by the National Association of Home Builders. And the Federal Reserve's aggressive policies should keep long-term interest rates low, making home-buying affordable for the foreseeable future.
Construction activity rose in three of the nation's four regions. The biggest increases came in the West and South. Housing starts increased by nearly 20 percent in both regions. Construction of new homes and apartments rose 6.7 percent in the Midwest. Housing starts fell 5.1 percent in the Northeast.

HEADLINE: Man Is Charged With Plotting to Bomb Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged a 21-year-old Bangladeshi man with conspiring to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saying he tried to remotely detonate what he believed was a 1,000-pound bomb in a van he parked outside the building in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday.
But the entire plot played out under the surveillance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Police Department as part of an elaborate sting operation, according to court papers. 
The man, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, who arrived in the United States in January on a student visa, tried to make contacts and recruit people to form a terrorist cell to help him carry out an attack, according to a criminal complaint in the case. But one of these recruits was an F.B.I. informer, who later introduced him to an undercover F.B.I. agent who helped him with the plot.
In addition, the complaint said, Mr. Nafis spoke of a desire to ''attack and kill'' a high-ranking government official. A senior law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the official was President Obama, but that Mr. Nafis's desire never got past the talking stage.
Mr. Nafis was charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and providing material support to Al Qaeda. He could face up to life in prison if convicted.
Mr. Nafis arrived at Federal District Court in Brooklyn, looking boyish despite his trim beard. He spoke quietly when answering the questions of the magistrate judge, Roanne L. Mann.
The case appears to be the latest to fit a model in which, in the process of flushing out people they believe present a risk of terrorism, federal law enforcement officials have played the role of enabler. Agents and informers have provided suspects with encouragement, guidance, money and even, the subjects of the sting operations are led to believe, the materials needed to carry out an attack. Though these operations have almost always held up in court, they have come under increasing criticism from those who believe that many of the subjects, even some who openly espoused violence, would have been unable to execute such plots without substantial assistance from the government.
Both F.B.I. leaders and federal prosecutors have defended the approach as valuable in finding and stopping people predisposed to commit terrorism.
In a prominent case in 2009, several men, urged by an unusually persistent government informer, planted what they believed to be homemade bombs in front of synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Four men were convicted, but the judge who oversaw the trial also criticized the law enforcement agents who helped push the plot forward: ''The government made them terrorists.''
The court papers describe Mr. Nafis as a man of persistence, who wanted to be respected by Al Qaeda leaders.
The undercover agent began meeting with Mr. Nafis in July, first in Central Park and later in hotels in Queens, secretly recording Mr. Nafis's statements. Mr. Nafis had grand but vague plans, according to the indictment. ''I don't want something that's like, small. I just want something big,'' he said, according to the complaint. ''Very, very, very, very big, that will shake the whole country.''
He settled on the financial district as a target, hoping to shake the American economy. The original plan was for a suicide mission but that changed when Mr. Nafis said he wanted to go home to Bangladesh first to put his affairs in order. The undercover agent told Mr. Nafis that he could use a remote-control device, so that he could stage the attack and then return to Bangladesh.
On Wednesday morning, they drove to a warehouse and assembled the fake bomb, placing supposedly explosive material in trash bins they had bought, then putting the bins in a van, according to the complaint. They assembled a fake detonator that was to be triggered by a cellphone and drove to the fortresslike Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the largest bank structure in the world when it was completed in 1924, about two blocks from Wall Street.
Mr. Nafis and the undercover agent parked the van outside the bank and walked to a nearby hotel, where Mr. Nafis recorded a video statement addressed to the American people, which he planned to publicize after the attack. In the statement, he said, ''We will not stop until we attain victory or martyrdom.''
Then he tried again and again to detonate the bomb, dialing the cellphone repeatedly until agents arrested him.

HEADLINE: Reviving U.S. Influence in the Middle East

BYLINE: By MARWAN MUASHER

 BODY:
THERE was a time when American power was viewed as decisive in the Middle East. If Washington sneezed there was a sense that the region would catch a cold.
Times have changed. Many factors brought us to this point. Perhaps most important is the fact that though the region has changed, U.S. policies have not adapted.
The debate in America surrounding the presidential elections once again signals nostalgia for a time when Washington could dictate outcomes -- reward friends and punish enemies. If the United States wants to remain relevant in the region, it needs to move beyond this outdated view of its role and adapt to a new Middle East where citizens are increasingly aware of their own power and of the gaps between U.S. policies and American values. 
Today, the United States is perceived by the Arab public as increasingly irrelevant to the issues Arabs care about. This perception is reinforced by Washington's reluctance or inability in recent years to take decisive action in several areas.
On the political front, the United States is seen, rightly or wrongly, as supporting whoever the West finds the least-scary option, rather than backing a dynamic process of change toward pluralism and elected government. In addition, the failure of successive U.S. presidents to engage seriously on the issue of Israeli-Palestinian peace has reinforced perceptions of Washington's irrelevance.
Despite a near consensus among Arabs and Israelis that the United States holds most of the cards on the peace process, U.S. leaders appear unwilling -- or unable -- to play them. As a result, the United States is seen as increasingly on the sidelines -- not because it isn't needed, but because it continues to shy away from a leadership role. The perception that American presidents are not able, or willing, to take independent action in order to pursue peace has created a situation where most people in the region have given up on Washington in this regard.
In the military arena, perceptions of U.S. power remain damaged by the war in Iraq -- a war that was won on the battlefield within weeks, but still has not achieved its stated political objectives. Many Arabs logically wonder what relevance the U.S. military has if 10 years after the invasion and occupation of Iraq, U.S. troops withdrew without leaving behind a functioning democracy.
America's reduced economic strength has weakened U.S. soft power on the ground. Even if the United States wanted to generously devote funds to help build new Arab democracies, its ability to do so is severely hampered. There is little expectation today that U.S. assistance can be a decisive factor in the economic transformations that the region must undergo.
These setbacks have reinforced an image of a weakened power increasingly on the sidelines in the Middle East. But even as U.S. policymakers need to accept the new reality of Washington's diminished influence, they must also recognize that America still matters.
Despite conventional wisdom, it's not anti-Americanism that limits U.S. influence. People still identify very positively with American values. But in the new Middle East, Arab citizens are increasingly looking for evidence that U.S. policy matches American values.
What will it take to revive American relevance in the region?
First, the next president must embrace the challenge of Israeli-Arab peace. No other country can play this role. The United States, staunch ally of Israel and defender of the principles of international law, is still the only partner that can garner the credibility of both sides. Arabs and Israelis need Washington's leadership to arrive at an agreement over a two-state solution and to create the opportunity for genuine compromise before it is too late.
Second, America needs to embrace the political transformation process playing out in the Arab world today. The United States needs to contribute to the development of a pluralistic culture in the region by supporting the democratic process and the building of new institutions that will establish the primacy of law and the principles of international human rights. Washington must support the process, not individual leaders -- both in countries that are transitioning and those that have not started to transition.
Finally, America needs to recognize that political Islam is not the enemy -- the enemy is intolerance, extremism and dogmatism wherever it exists in religious or secular form. If the United States wants to rebuild its credibility, it needs to embrace a policy that rewards performance over ideology and recognizes that Arab citizens should choose their own leaders. America and other members of the world community can help keep these leaders accountable to international norms and human rights.
The United States needs to concentrate on where it can make a difference, instead of focusing, as some conservatives have suggested, on an old notion that it should dictate outcomes. Now's the time to incorporate U.S. values into American foreign policy.
As the Middle East undergoes historic transformation, America must stand up for peace and for change that will lead to the development of open, pluralistic cultures. This is the critical project of Arabs and it will be far from easy. But failure is unthinkable. Washington should engage as a friend, acknowledging that the process is largely a responsibility the region must assume for itself.

HEADLINE: The Thirst for Learning

BYLINE: By JOHN M. RODGERS

 BODY:
YEOLSIMHI haeyo, Koreans say. Work hard. The phrase is spoken endlessly and serves both as a rallying call and a reminder that no one likes whiners. And no matter how hard a student is working, he or she can always work harder -- or so goes the theory.
After all, the nation itself rose from decades of Japanese colonization and the ashes of the Korean War through hard work. South Korea became a model for economic growth and host of the Olympic Games and the World Cup in a feat known as ''The Miracle on the Han River.'' 
Every weekday morning for well over 200 days a year the students arrived at the elite South Korean prep school where I taught English by 7:40 a.m. Teachers and supervisor students were waiting outside the entrance to check their hair (for length and style -- no perms or dying allowed) and attire (uniform shirts tucked in, skirts at the knee, formal shoes).
Then they climbed the stairs to their homerooms where they mopped floors, scrubbed desks, wiped windows and cleared trash. The academic day would begin at 8, pausing for 10-minute breaks, a 50-minute lunch and an hour-long dinner at 5 p.m.
At 6 p.m. when I usually shut down my computer, the students would be settling into their seats for four more hours of self-study during which teachers would monitor them to make sure they did not surrender to sleep, chat or do anything other than study. At 10:20 p.m. classes emptied. Liberated kids headed to waiting buses for their ride home (few lived nearby). Most students wouldn't see bed until after midnight. An old adage recommends four hours of sleep a night in order to enter a top university.
Throughout the years that I taught at the high school, I both marveled and cringed at what the school, parents and the country expected of the students -- and how the students tried to live up to those expectations.
Sometimes when I would leave school late -- 8 or 9 p.m. -- I'd glance into classrooms to watch the students busy at work, perusing their books, some standing at the back of the room to ward off sleep, all seemingly determined to live up to the expectations placed upon them. What about their youth?, I sometimes thought as I walked down the hill with the lights of the school behind me.
Upon returning to America, an old professor offered me the opportunity to speak to his freshman philosophy classes about my years in Asia. Excited, I assembled a presentation while thinking of my Korean classes where students would soak up material, sometimes too quietly.
In front of a class of 20 college freshman, the first thing I noticed were electronic devices on nearly every desk -- cellphones, laptops, an iPad. A few minutes into my presentation, I saw a boy fiddling with his phone under the desk, another typing on her laptop and a third typing on her phone in full view. ''Would you mind?'' I asked. With a bothered look they returned their attention to the discussion, but not for long -- they were at it again some minutes later. Subsequent classes differed little.
Later, in the professor's office, I asked about the general demeanor of students while mentioning the kids in Korea.
''When I retire I will write a book about the collapse of the American university,'' he told me. ''There is little thirst for learning, for doing the hard work.''
''What about the devices?'' I asked.
''They're everywhere,'' he answered, ''and even when they're banned the kids use them somehow.''
A dire assessment for sure, but the professor, who's been teaching for 30 years, went on to say that I was there for five kids, more or less. That those kids -- the ones who asked questions, expressed interest -- would go on to do great things because they ''take themselves and you seriously,'' as he put it.
My presentation finished, I walked across the quiet New England campus, breathing in the cool autumn air, thinking that across the ocean it would be about 9 a.m., the students would be seated at their desks listening attentively, working hard and, most likely, taking things a bit more seriously than a lot of kids in America, for better or worse.

HEADLINE: Progress in Fight to Keep Night Skies Dark

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, TEXAS -- Rachel Carson, the great American naturalist, once wrote of seeing ''the misty river of the Milky Way flowing across the sky'' as she gazed upward on a moonless night.
More than half a century after she wrote those words, it has become harder than ever to see the stars, as cities with their 24-hour lights continue to sprawl. Many children learn about the Milky Way only through books or films, a 2010 Council of Europe report warned.
A combination of economics and preservation efforts is slowing the trend toward excessive lighting in a few areas. A ''dark skies'' movement, aimed at increasing the public's appreciation of stargazing, has gained strength in recent years, while cities are rediscovering that turning off streetlights can save money. 
''Everywhere, light pollution is an increasing problem,'' said Andrej Mohar, an amateur astronomer in Slovenia who has lobbied for lighting regulations there. A 2007 Slovenian law aimed at barring light fixtures from sending light upward has made the night sky above the capital, Ljubljana, about 20 percent darker, he said.
An Arizona-based group called the International Dark-Sky Association has led advocacy efforts worldwide for preserving the night skies.
Since 2006, the group has designated 10 ''dark sky'' parks globally, as well as another four reserves. The idea is to single out areas that offer excellent stargazing and also work to keep night lighting minimal. One of the latest-certified areas, added in May, is the NamibRand Nature Reserve in Namibia, where the dry air and remote location make for clear skies and good nighttime viewing.
The site is the first dark-sky reserve in Africa -- or in any developing country. Before receiving the designation, local officials worked to reduce lighting within the reserve's bounds. That included requiring vehicles traveling on remote roads at night to dim their headlights if moonlight could be used instead.
Asia has no certified dark-sky areas yet, partly from a lack of awareness there, although that is starting to change, according to Scott Kardel, the managing director for the International Dark-Sky Association.
Three of the dark-sky areas are in Britain. The first, designated in 2009, was the Galloway Forest Park in Scotland. It got ''massive media coverage'' -- far more than expected -- which invigorated the movement, said Steve Owens, a dark-sky consultant in Scotland. Since then, Exmoor National Park in England and the Isle of Sark in the Channel Islands have also received dark-sky designations, and representatives of a number of other British parks and communities have expressed interest in applying for the status, Mr. Owens said.
In Britain, the dark-sky cause has been aided by fiscal problems. Local governments, like the Somerset County Council, have begun turning off or dimming some streetlights late at night as a money-saving measure. By doing so, they can also earn credits for greenhouse gas reduction.
However, change can be slow, not least because switching off lights may cause the public to worry about crime and roadway accidents. The Somerset government notes on its Web site that such concerns have not been borne out.
Technology is making some changes easier. The importance of minimizing light pollution is ''one of many attributes that we think about'' nowadays when designing products, said Cheryl English, the vice president of government and industry relations at Acuity Brands, a lighting company. She is also a member of the International Dark-Sky Association.
However, even though the industry follows light-pollution issues, ''if it hurts their sales, of course they're not going to be very happy with that,'' said Terry McGowan, a consultant to the American Lighting Association who also serves on a technical committee of the dark-sky group.
In addition to better fixtures, Mr. McGowan said, a key technological improvement is the rise of so-called smart grid systems, which can turn the lights off when sensors indicate no one is around, saving energy as well as light.
The biggest battle of all, of course, involves getting enough people to care, especially because new fixtures and sensors can be costly. That requires intensive campaigns by observatories and stargazing advocates.
''What keeps me going is I see the effort to raise public awareness succeeding,'' said Bill Wren, an astronomer and special assistant to the superintendent at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas. Recently, he said, a gas station about 30 miles, or 48 kilometers, from the observatory had planned to use ''just awful'' globe-style light fixtures. But after discussing their plans with him, they changed to a design that emits half the amount of light.
Last year, despite some concerns from private-property advocates, Texas passed a law that required new subdivisions being built within 57 miles of the McDonald Observatory to minimize the effects of their lighting on the observatory's operations.
Most dark-sky advocates recognize that they are fighting a tough battle. ''Everywhere on our planet is more or less the Wild West'' for lighting, Mr. Mohar said, though he argued that Slovenia was an exception.
On the positive side, excessive lighting, unlike many environmental problems, is ultimately reversible, at least in theory.
Light pollution is ''not destroying the nighttime sky,'' said Ms. English, the Acuity Brands executive. ''We can recover it.''

HEADLINE: In Sole Debate, Senate Rivals Don't Agree on Much

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and her Republican challenger, Wendy E. Long, left their first and only debate on Wednesday in agreement on one issue: There was little that they agreed about.
On matters like drilling for natural gas and reducing gun violence, Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Long, a Manhattan lawyer, offered two very different approaches for New York voters to choose between in a Senate race that has attracted little statewide attention.
Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat from Rensselaer County who has a wide lead in polls and an impressive fund-raising account, sought to project confidence and rarely acknowledged her opponent by name. But Ms. Long came out swinging, attacking Ms. Gillibrand from the first minutes of the program and frequently interrupting her over the course of the debate. 
The hourlong debate, which was hosted by the cable networks NY1 and YNN and held at Skidmore College, was perhaps the best opportunity for Ms. Long to attract attention to her long-shot candidacy. But no moment in the program appeared to change Ms. Gillibrand's status as a clear front-runner.
One of their more personal clashes came over women's issues like abortion rights and access to contraception, topics that occupied a large chunk of the debate. Ms. Gillibrand suggested that Republicans in Congress were seeking to trample on women's rights and that electing Ms. Long would further enable their efforts.
But Ms. Long said Ms. Gillibrand was portraying herself as a crusader for women only as a means of ''trying to distract attention from her terrible record on jobs and the economy.''
''I can't believe we are spending this much time talking about these issues when the people of New York are out of work,'' Ms. Long said.
Ms. Long also confronted Ms. Gillibrand over the sexual harassment scandal that has consumed Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat, at one point ignoring a question about health care to return to the subject. She urged Ms. Gillibrand to join her, onstage, in calling for the resignation of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, for agreeing to a confidential settlement using taxpayer money.
Ms. Gillibrand, who has called for Mr. Lopez's resignation, declined to do so and cited the continuing investigation by prosecutors and the state ethics commission. But she called the allegations against Mr. Lopez ''outrageous'' and ''disgraceful'' and added, ''My view is Vito Lopez should have paid those fines himself -- taxpayer money should not have been used.''
The candidates also took different views on fiscal issues, with Ms. Long pressing for spending cuts and no tax increases and Ms. Gillibrand criticizing that view as inflexible. ''We can cut spending, but we have to do it precisely and carefully,'' the senator said. ''We cannot have a slash-only approach, as my opponent has.''
Ms. Long interjected: ''What would you cut? Can you suggest something you'd cut?'' Ms. Gillibrand did not respond.
Hydraulic fracturing, a controversial form of natural gas extraction, was another major point of division. Ms. Gillibrand called the technique, known as fracking, ''a significant economic opportunity,'' but she struck a position similar to that of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, saying officials first needed to ''understand the facts'' before proceeding with drilling.
''One of the many things we have going for us in New York State is we have clean drinking water,'' Ms. Gillibrand said. ''We have to make sure that we can protect that drinking water.''
But Ms. Long said there ''aren't any health risks'' with the drilling and suggested the state was missing out on an urgent opportunity to create jobs upstate.
''All these concerns that you cite are just phony concerns,'' Ms. Long said. ''This thing has been studied; it has been completely studied.''
A lightning round of questions from the moderators, Errol Louis of NY1 and Liz Benjamin of YNN, revealed the few areas where Ms. Long agreed with Ms. Gillibrand, who was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton and easily won election the following year to complete Mrs. Clinton's term.
Both women said there should not be a national ban on large sugary drinks. Both declined to describe Mr. Cuomo as the best New York governor in their lifetimes. And both said they had not read the erotic novel ''Fifty Shades of Grey.''

HEADLINE: A Vision Enabling A Clover To Bloom

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- A familiar sort of preservation battle has been stewing for months here over the fate of the old Prentice Women's Hospital, a concrete, cloverleaf structure from 1975 by Bertrand Goldberg, the Chicago architect. It's a groundbreaking, wonderful oddball among the architectural monuments in this city. High-profile designers like Frank Gehry, Jeanne Gang, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien have signed petitions entreating Northwestern University, which owns the building, not to tear it down, arguing for landmark status and pleading for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to step in.
The university says it needs new biomedical research facilities and that Prentice is too small, old and quirky to feasibly retrofit. A new building, the university argues, would bring to the city millions of investment dollars, create jobs and save lives.
No surprise, Northwestern has been winning the debate. On Monday Brendan Reilly, an alderman representing the Chicago ward that includes Prentice, announced that he was leaning toward demolition. ''I remain open to suggestions,'' he added, according to The Chicago Tribune. ''And believe me, if there's a eureka moment, I'm all ears.'' 
So here is a suggestion: Build a research tower on top of Prentice.
I brought up this notion with Ms. Gang, probably the most celebrated architect of the current generation here in Chicago, when we stopped to look at the building the other afternoon. I was curious about a strategy of accretion, layering. Although an advocate for preservation, Ms. Gang embraced the thought and ran with it. I'll get to her plan in a moment.
First things first: Why save Prentice? Many Chicagoans hate it. The taste for concrete buildings from the '70s is unpopular outside architectural circles, although it's spreading, and rightly so. Great late-Modernist buildings, innovative and ruggedly beautiful, deserve respect and, increasingly, careful custody. Prentice is a good example. Beyond relieving the monotony of nearby glass towers, Prentice mixes muscle with sensuous curves. Goldberg, who died in 1997, used a pioneering form of computer modeling to engineer a tour de force: an open, seven-story maternity ward inside the cloverleaf shell, cantilevered 45 feet from the supporting core. The building can suggest a flower adorned with sets of twinned oval portholes.
It also translated new ideas about hospital ''villages'' of care into unobstructed floors around a central nurses' station. Goldberg's design had a practical logic, in other words, beyond jolting the cityscape.
That said, the building is not suited for 21st-century research labs, and preservationists straining to prove otherwise have not helped their own cause. A suggestion to erect a tower atop Prentice's broad podium, alongside the cloverleaf (think of the wing next to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York) went nowhere, too, struggling unpersuasively as it did to salvage Goldberg's plan. Meanwhile, the Women's Hospital decamped five years ago for a new building, and the psychiatric institute that occupied the rectangular podium moved out last year. So Prentice has become a sitting duck.
Leaving aside whether Northwestern ought to reconsider putting the lab it wants elsewhere in Streeterville, as the neighborhood is called, a long history of architecture points toward a different line of argument. Great buildings have often survived the wrecking ball by being added to, incorporated into larger structures or updated for a new era -- in Rome and Istanbul, New York and Chicago.
Certain buildings, even neighborhoods, can't be altered without being ruined. But all buildings exist in the real world, as do we.
And however morphing compromises an original design, buildings can become more fascinating and attractive as they accumulate new lives.
Adding on top of the old Prentice is intended as a thought exercise in what might be called a third way that may not always get its due in preservation battles.
And this is where Ms. Gang comes in, compellingly. After our conversation she rapidly crafted a concept for a 31-story skyscraper atop the cloverleaf.
There would be almost 600,000 square feet of new space inside a scalloped tower, rising to 680 feet,adding a shapely new landmark to the skyline. I telephoned Christina Morris, senior field officer for the Chicago office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and without showing her Ms. Gang's concept drawing, floated the tower idea. She was receptive. Many preservationists would welcome ''any creative solution that we all could talk about,'' she said.
Al Cubbage, Northwestern's spokesman, said preservationists had never proposed building on top of Prentice. ''The conversation has been that it must be preserved as is,'' he emphasized. He would not say whether the university would entertain such a notion, but he reiterated that on the Prentice site the university wants 300,000 to 500,000 square feet for research labs on open floors with high ceilings -- all achieved in Ms. Gang's plan -- that could connect to the Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center next door.
Her skywalks connecting the two buildings probably don't allow enough links to satisfy the university, but the connections the university says it wants sound roughly conceived, and this could be worked out.
In Ms. Gang's concept, Goldberg's building -- with the removal of an ugly 1980s addition that obscured the cloverleaf's concrete arches -- provides 250,000 additional square feet for medical offices, classrooms, restaurants, whatever. The university says it wants to be a good neighbor. Diversifying the neighborhood while incorporating Goldberg's building into some new structure would allow the university to save lives, develop a healthier urban plan and sustain a special work of local culture, which is also what great universities do.
The serendipity of Prentice is that it is formally and structurally suited for adaptation. Its core, like the stem of a flower, provides a ready-made means to fortify the building's foundation, reduce vibrations and install elevator shafts and other support to a tower, which could have its own access.
Ron Klemencic, president of Magnusson Klemencic Associates, an international structural engineering firm with an office in Chicago (he has worked with Ms. Gang), told me that the tower plan seems practicable and maybe even economical. He cited 111 South Wacker, a Chicago skyscraper on which he worked, which reused and bolstered the existing foundations of a smaller building to erect a taller one; and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Tower, also here, a 30-story structure from the mid-1990s, topped off with 25 more stories a decade later.
''It's a welcoming form in the city, as opposed to another big solid box,'' Ms. Gang said of her design, with its inward-swerving scallops doing a pas de deux with the lobes of the cloverleaf.
The building becomes a totem pole, with different strata of history. Ms. Gang describes it as a strategy, instead of a metaphor, similar to stacked solutions in computing. ''More uses in the same tall site are better for the city,'' she translated. ''But in any case, this is not about my doing the job. It's about opening up a dialogue.''
It is, and other plans ought to emerge. Chicago needs jobs and health. Northwestern needs to avoid the ignominy of having torn down a landmark. And sometimes a third way is the best way.

HEADLINE: Crumbling Deal Exposes a Clash of Wealthy Family Dynasties

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
For more than two centuries, the Rothschild name has stood for a deft touch in European cross-border finance, as well as representing great wealth and influence.
Today, the family name, one of Europe's banking dynasties, has become ensnared in a nasty dispute after a powerful family in Indonesia appears to have outmaneuvered Nathaniel Rothschild, the five-times great-grandson of the dynasty's founder.
After an inauspicious start as a young investment analyst at Gleacher in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, Mr. Rothschild's rise as a moneymaker in his own right has been fairly rapid. He was co-chairman of the hedge fund Atticus Capital before striking out on his own and engineering a series of international deals.
In late 2010, he announced what was expected to be his most ambitious project yet, a $3 billion deal with the Bakrie family, an Indonesian dynasty whose vast interests include both mining and politics, to create the London-listed mining giant Bumi. 
"We've announced the creation of an Indonesian coal champion," Mr. Rothschild said at a news conference at the time.
That partnership now lies in ruins.
Mr. Rothschild, a 41-year-old British financier, has resigned from Bumi's board amid allegations of financial misconduct at some of the company's Indonesian subsidiaries. The owners have been caught in a yearlong feud over the running of the company. And questions have been raised about the corporate governance that allowed Bumi to trade on the London Stock Exchange.
In the latest round of infighting, Mr. Rothschild - a descendant of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who helped finance the British victory over Napoleon at Waterloo - has accused Samin Tan, Bumi's chairman, of not protecting the rights of minority shareholders.
"I have lost confidence in the ability of the board to stand up for investors," Mr. Rothschild, who owns roughly a 12 percent stake in the company, said in a letter announcing his resignation from Bumi's board.
In response, the Bakries said Mr. Rothschild should return his shares and other financial benefits connected to the mining company.
"What a disappointment Mr. Rothschild has been to us," said Christopher Fong, a spokesman for the Bakrie family.
Mr. Rothschild is insisting that any decision about Bumi's future be delayed until an investigation is finished into ostensible financial misconduct at its subsidiaries, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
The alliance with the Bakries had been part of a bet by Mr. Rothschild on the surging demand for coal by fast-growing economies in Asia. He raised 707 million, or $1.1 billion, in the 2010 initial public offering of Vallar, a London-listed investment company that was created to make acquisitions in the natural resources sector.
Later that year, Mr. Rothschild organized a cash-and-stock deal worth $3 billion that would give his company access to a number of Indonesian coal mining assets. The takeover also gave the Bakries a controlling stake in Bumi, the renamed Vallar that remains listed in London.
Since the deal was completed, not much has gone right for Bumi, as Mr. Rothschild's effort to profit from an expected commodities boom has floundered.
With demand for coal falling because of the global financial crisis, the company's share price has plummeted more than 80 percent over the last 18 months. In the first half of this year, the company reported a net loss of $106 million, a slight improvement on the $296 million loss in the same period last year. The value of Mr. Rothschild's own investment of $148 million has more than halved, to $86 million.
Mr. Rothschild and his Indonesian business partners also have clashed over how the company should be run.
In a terse letter to the board late last year, Mr. Rothschild called on Bumi's chief executive at the time, Ari Hudaya, to resign. Mr. Rothschild said the company's head had failed to attend board meetings, dismissed investors' questions and neglected his duties as chief executive.
"It has become abundantly clear that he is neither fit nor suitable to carry on as C.E.O.," Mr. Rothschild said.
The Bakries, however, have been calling the shots.
Late last year, the family sold a 24 percent stake in Bumi to Mr. Tan, a fellow Indonesian mining mogul, for $1 billion. The deal helped the Indonesian dynasty to repay outstanding loans owed to a consortium of lenders led by Credit Suisse.
After calling a shareholding meeting to reshuffle Bumi's executives, Mr. Tan took over as chairman, while Mr. Rothschild was reduced to a nonindependent director.
Controversy has continued to follow the ill-fated partnership.
Last month, Bumi announced an investigation into accusations of financial misconduct totaling $500 million at several of its Indonesian subsidiaries. The accusations relate to financial accounting records for last year in which certain investments were marked down to zero, according to a company statement.
The Bakries have been quick to respond. Last week, the family offered a combined $1.2 billion to acquire all of Bumi's mining assets. The deal would involve a partial share swap for a 10.3 percent stake in PT Bumi Resources, a subsidiary. The Indonesian family would then offer to buy Bumi's remaining 18.9 percent stake in the Indonesian coal mining company for cash by the end of the year.
The Bakries also want to buy Bumi's majority control of PT Berau Coal Energy, another Indonesian mining company, in the next six months.
"A lot of investors may want to sell up and move on," said Richard Knights, an analyst with Liberum Capital in London.
Those shareholders do not include Mr. Rothschild. The British financier has ridiculed the proposal, saying the board should not review the deal until the investigation into financial misconduct is completed.
He also has accused his Indonesian partners of giving Mr. Tan, Bumi's chairman, preferential treatment under which he could receive more than double what has been offered to other shareholders.
"It would be a disgrace to proceed with, or even to entertain, the proposal made by the Bakries," Mr. Rothschild said.
A spokesman for Bumi said the board would continue to look at the proposal.
The problems facing Mr. Rothschild have again raised concerns over natural-resources companies that want to list in London. Analysts say many of these companies are eager to tap the British capital's large investor base, but have often restricted the amount of shares offered to new shareholders so that majority owners can retain control.
Eurasian Natural Resources, a London-listed mining company part owned by the Kazakh government, for example, has run into a series of governance problems in recent years. That includes the ousting of some of its British board members last year after the majority Kazakh owners opposed their reappointment.
Scrutiny also has centered on so-called reverse takeovers, in which a private firm can obtain a London listing by acquiring a publicly traded company. Mr. Rothschild's deal to create Bumi allowed the Bakries to avoid many of the checks that would have been required if the Indonesian family had tried to take the company public on its own.
Last year, Mr. Rothschild also helped the Turkish company Genel Energy to float in London after it was acquired by Vallares, an investment company co-founded by Mr. Rothschild and BP's former chief executive Tony Hayward, for $2.1 billion.
British regulators are moving to clamp down. This month, the Financial Services Authority, the country's regulator, completed plans to restrict the ability of firms to complete reverse takeovers in London. Authorities also are demanding greater separation between a company's controlling shareholder and the daily operations of the business.
"There's been a misunderstanding in the market because many of these rules were unwritten," said John Hammond, head of capital markets at the consultancy Deloitte in London. "Now they've been laid out for everyone to see."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Teacher Fined for Soap-Selling Scheme

BYLINE: By DANIELLA SILVA

 BODY:
A Brooklyn sixth-grade teacher has been fined $4,000 by New York City for an odd scheme in which he awarded his students prizes, including a "no homework pass," for buying his family's homemade soap, as part of a character-building program at the school. 
The teacher, Marlon Scanterbury of Public School 66 in Canarsie, began the sales last year, when the school rolled out a "character incentive program," according to a settlement he reached with the city's Conflicts of Interest Board. As part of the program, intended to encourage students to improve their social and academic skills, teachers gave students stickers that they could trade in for items that were displayed in the school's lobby.
Mr. Scanterbury offered his students a deal: for each bar of soap they bought, at $3 or $4 apiece, they would receive 10 stickers. After two months, he threw in a "no homework pass" for soap buyers, according to the settlement, which was announced on Wednesday.
At least three students purchased one bar of soap each, receiving 10 stickers each, while at least one more student bought three bars, and got 30 stickers, and at least one student received a no-homework pass, the conflicts board said.
Mr. Scanterbury, 43, who has taught in the city schools since 2001, was also given a letter of reprimand from the Education Department for his actions.
In other action against city workers, the board announced that a former engineering auditor had been fined $7,500 for selling sneakers on city time using a city computer.
Beginning in 2010, the auditor, Jonathan Lim, then employed by the city's Economic Development Corporation, used his work computer and e-mail address to contact potential buyers and to sell sneakers on eBay, according to a settlement he reached with the board.
During one three-month period, Mr. Lim clicked on or refreshed a sneaker-related site 57,578 times, the settlement said.
Mr. Lim made a total of 106 eBay sales while on the job, for a total of $9,724.99. He was terminated by the Economic Development Corporation in January for the sneaker sales, the corporation said.

HEADLINE: The Breakup Bed

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
I stopped seeing someone recently and decided, as one does in these situations, that it was time to change my life, or at least my bed. This bed and the set it is a part of have been an embarrassment to me ever since I told my mother I would take them. Big and overwrought, they are the sort of thing that might work in the European mountain house of a histrionic soprano, but in a New York City apartment they are too much. I was pretty certain that if a guy got a look at my bedroom he would reassess my character and be gone, although a good male friend, with whom I discuss this, told me that is not the case.
''Doesn't matter,'' he says. ''By the time the guy is into the bedroom, the deal is closed. He won't even notice.''
''It also creaks when things heat up,'' I say. ''I'm worried one day it will collapse.'' 
''That he would notice,'' my friend says.
Off I go, then, to find a bed with dignity. Something solid, stylish and assured, befitting a person of my age and taste, a bed that says this woman will put up with none of your nonsense, do not even think of trying it, pal. It takes about a minute and a half to find. It is dark wood, with a linen and mahogany headboard, and lots of storage drawers. Catherine the Great and the Preobrazhensky Life Guards could spend the night on this bed and it wouldn't collapse. And in the morning you could say, ''How'd ya sleep, fellas?'' and they'd pound their Wheaties bowls on the table and holler, ''++[#x201a]OE [#x20ac][#x201a]OE!!'' (''Wonderful bed!!'')
I also need a new mattress. There are seasons of mattresses, I have come to realize, that correlate with one's stages of maturity. When you are 17 and sneaking into abandoned hotels in the Catskills with your boyfriend, and the mattresses smell of mold and are so skinny they can be rolled up, you do not care one bit. You are enchanted to be on a surface that does not include rocks. When you are 24 and have your first newspaper job, you become more selective; a mattress on the floor is a sign of a very immature guy and you quickly move on. For the next few decades, there is a mattress and a human nonintervention pact: you live side by side, like the United States and Canada, without giving each other much thought. Mattresses have as much identity as gym socks.
Then you hit 60, and you wake up stiff and get out of bed in increments, as if you had extra joints, channeling your grandmother: ''Oy. Oy vey. Vey iz mir.'' You don't need one of those ''French Women Don't Do Whatever It Is You Do, You Pathetic American Slob'' books to know that this is not hot. Also, you cannot keep kidding yourself that your back aches because of the gym. Your back aches because you are in your 60s. It is serious mattress time.
I trot into a mattress store that is having a sale, searching for a brand I slept on in a friend's house, for which she paid about $1,000. The current model, with tax and delivery, will cost $1,647, which throws me, but O.K., inflation. I try it. It is soft and welcoming, perhaps too welcoming. I might soon be pulled under, like in the quicksand scene in ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' The salesman, aware that he has a live one, steers me to a firmer model. I love it. It is a magnificent mattress. Perfect. The sale price, however, with tax comes to $2,486. This is more than I paid for my first car. Say you spilled something on it. It could be like the 2008 market crash. A major investment would be wiped out.
''It's very nice,'' I tell the salesman, ''but way over what I was planning to spend.''
''Let me see what I can do -- I can make a call,'' the salesman says, and ''If there is one thing I never want to do, it is make anyone feel pressured.''
Whether this comes before or after, ''I work on commission,'' I do not recall. I do know I am not about to make a $2,400 decision in 20 minutes.
''I have to think about it,'' I say. ''I'll be back.''
''Everybody says that,'' the salesman says. ''And only nine out of 10 do.''
''Look,'' I say, ''I'm a very straight shooter. If I say I will be back, I will be back.''
Now you might argue, as any adult who has not had a table dropped on his or her head should, that a promise made to a salesman does not count and, moreover, the salesman knows it does not count. It's like when a guy with whom you have had no chemistry all evening says, ''I'll call you,'' an acceptable social lie and much nicer than the guy adding, ''When you are the last woman on earth and I have a gun to my head, and even then, when we sleep together, I'll be picturing someone else.''
And rationally, in the upper crust of my brain, I do know this. But there is a voice inside me saying: ''You made a promise, you have to keep your word.'' It is very aggravating. Shouldn't the smartness train have pulled into the station by now? And, of course, even as I am returning to the mattress store, where I do not want to go, to speak to this pushy salesman, I know the answer: This wisdom-of-age stuff is nonsense; certain things are in the hardwiring, you will do the same dumb things over and over. I go back to the store, but this serious mattress purchase is too much for me. I do not buy it.
Which is just as well, as I am having second thoughts about the bed as well. I am concerned that the drawers will make me feel as if I am sleeping on a bureau or worse, a child's bed. Also, with the headboard and the new dresser and the side table, the set will come to $3,800. And the painting contractor who carries the insurance my building demands gives me an estimate of $2,400 to paint a 13-by-15-foot bedroom. Not only that, but people are so worried about bedbugs in New York that I can't take the old mattress out of the building unless it wears something like a mattress condom. And trying to coordinate all the pickups and paint jobs and mattresses coming and going has given me a headache.
To hell with the new bedroom.
If someone comes along, we'll do it on the couch.

HEADLINE: China Reports Slower Growth in 3rd Quarter but Sees Signs of a Possible Revival

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- New economic data from China on Thursday showed that the world's second-largest economy after the United States expanded at its slowest pace since 2009 during the third quarter of this year -- though surprisingly strong data for the month of September also showed that the deceleration may, for now at least, have come to an end.
The Chinese economy has been a major engine of global growth in recent years, as the American and European economies have struggled to overcome the global financial crisis. 
The weak global environment has, however, weighed on China's export sector, slowing China's once red-hot economy. Government policies aimed at combating inflation and soaring property prices in 2010 and 2011 also have slowed growth.
Beijing released gross domestic product data for the July-September quarter on Thursday that confirmed what has been known for some time: that China's days of double-digit economic expansion had halted.
The economy expanded by 7.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier -- in line with analysts' expectations. The figure, which was below the 7.6 percent growth reported in the second quarter, was the slowest pace of growth since early 2009, when the global economy was still reeling from the financial crisis.
Separate data for September, however, appeared to show that the slowdown has been bottoming out, and that an improvement may now be on the way.
Industrial output grew 9.2 percent, compared with a year earlier, and retail sales expanded 14.2 percent, the statistics office said.
Both figures beat expectations and improved on the expansions in August, showing that stimulus measures announced by Beijing over the last year have gradually put a floor under the deceleration.
Investment in fixed assets rose 20.5 percent in the first nine months this year, from the comparable period in 2011, slightly better than analysts had expected.
''The data is mostly above consensus and confirms that growth is picking up and that China is not at risk of hard landing,'' said Dariusz Kowalczyk, an analyst at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, in a note to clients. ''Clearly, concerns over continued slowdown can now be put to rest.''
The Chinese authorities have loosened lending constraints for banks in a bid to encourage more loans and stepped up infrastructure project approvals. Two small interest rate cuts by the Bank of China in June and July also aimed to bolster growth.
This mild stimulus approach has contrasted with Beijing's approach in late 2008, when a large stimulus program of 4 trillion renminbi (about $635 billion) was announced in response to mass layoffs and collapsing exports. This time around, analysts say, the jobs market so far has not deteriorated sharply. At the same time, policy makers in Beijing are seeking to avoid reigniting an investment binge and property-price spike of the sort that occurred in 2009-10.
Still, even the more muted stimulus measures that Beijing has been feeding into the economy appears to be bearing fruit.
Thursday's data, Mr. Kowalczyk said, ''means there is no room, or need, for any further major stimulus,'' such as another cut in interest rates.
At the same time, data released on Saturday showed that export demand has started to pick up.
China's exports rose 9.9 percent in September, compared with a year earlier, much more rapidly than analysts had expected, as shipments to the United States and Southeast Asia improved.
Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, wrote in an e-mailed commentary that the September data released Thursday sent ''very positive signals'' and helped ''reinforce our view that growth will rebound visibly'' in the fourth quarter of 2012.

HEADLINE: A Rachael Ray Food Truck for the Dogs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
IN a novel effort to woo pet owners to her Nutrish line of high-end dog food, the television chef Rachael Ray is turning to something usually reserved for human gourmets: a food truck.
Ms. Ray will begin handing out samples of the newest addition to her product line from a ''Pup-Up Food Truck for Dogs'' in Manhattan on Thursday. Depending on the response, she may take the truck to other cities to draw attention to pet adoptions and to shelters crowded with cats and other animals that people do not want or cannot keep -- and to promote her dog food.
Each year, Ms. Ray donates her portion of the proceeds from the brand -- her total contributions are expected to reach $4 million by the end of 2012 -- to animal welfare organizations. She modeled Nutrish's charitable giving on that of Yum-o, a nonprofit organization she founded in 2006 to help children and their families learn about healthy food and cooking, which is financed by sales of cookbooks and other items. 
''We wanted to come up with a dedicated product, like we did for children,'' she said. ''So there are no galas, no celebrity concerts, but a product that builds awareness of a problem and generates income.''
Even though bad economic times mean more animals are landing in shelters, people who can afford it are spending increasing amounts on better quality food for their pets. Nutrish, which made its debut in October 2008, is tapping into that trend.
Manufactured by the family-owned Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, in Meadville, Pa., Nutrish was the fastest-growing dry dog food brand in grocery stores for the 26 weeks ending Sept. 29. Sales were $22.6 million, up 45.4 percent from the same period last year, according to Ainsworth. The line is expected to reach $100 million in retail sales by January 2013.
The Rachael Ray Nutrish line includes dry and wet dog food and treats that contain no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. Ms. Ray's truck will serve several varieties of her newest product, Nutrish Naturally Delish wet dog food, which comes in plastic tubs, including flavors like ''Chicken Paw Pie'' and ''Chicken Muttballs.''
''Dogs will be served their choice on a dish, and they can go home with samples and a bottle of pup water,'' Ms. Ray said in an interview this week after the filming of her daytime syndicated talk show, ''Rachael Ray.''
Samples have been an important factor in Nutrish's success, said Beth Nigro, a senior vice president at the marketing agency Engauge. Its Pittsburgh office has worked with Ainsworth for 30 years, and oversaw Ms. Ray's pet food introduction with a ''Switch to Nutrish'' campaign that has given away 1.5 million six-ounce samples since January 2009.
''We found that 50 percent of the people who tried a free sample converted to the brand,'' Ms. Nigro said. The line includes Nutrish; Just 6 food and treats, which are made from only six ingredients; and Nutrish Healthy Weight.
Ms. Ray, who also has a lifestyle magazine called ''Every Day With Rachael Ray,'' best-selling cookbooks and a line of cookware, said her blend of advocacy and commercial success helped to support shelters and animal organizations across the country.
''I've been an advocate for them all my life,'' said Ms. Ray, who dotes on her red-nose pit bull, Isaboo, and previously adopted another pit bull, Boo, who died about seven years ago. She said her mother cared for more than a dozen rescue cats.
On average, pet owners spent $254 on dog food and another $70 on treats last year, according to an American Pet Products Association survey. Some 46.3 million households owned a dog, and 38.9 million owned a cat. Most owners preferred premium dog food, a trend that has gained traction since the 2007 recalls of adulterated dog and cat food.
''Nutrish is made to human standards. I've tried the kibble myself,'' Ms. Ray said, adding that real meat was the top ingredient in three varieties. ''And the wet food looks like real food, not brown mush.''
Helping to increase awareness, she said, is the 2012 Rachael Ray $100K Challenge. The goal of the initiative, begun in August with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is for 50 animal shelters to save at least 300 more dogs and cats from August through October than they did during the same three-month period last year. The most successful shelter will win $100,000, and other shelters can win lesser amounts for their efforts.
The average age of Nutrish customers is 45, and the average household income is $135,000. But the brand is vying with established market giants like Purina for a share of the $9.5 billion in annual sales of dry dog food in grocery stores and mass-market locations like Walmart, according to 2011 figures from Nielsen ScanTrack. (Sales increased from $7.1 billion in 2007.)
Nutrish claimed a 2.8 percent share, $22.6 million, of the $823 million in dry dog food sales in grocery stores in the four weeks ending Sept. 29. In comparison, Purina One had $90.4 million in sales over the same period, up 4.4 percent from last year; Beneful had $141.7 million, up 3.3 percent; and Iams had $99.7 million, a 1.6 percent drop, according to Nielsen.
Ms. Ray worked with Engauge to create the green, yellow and brown truck she calls the ''Woof Wagon.'' She plans to post to Facebook and Twitter from the truck, which will be at Columbus Circle on Thursday before moving to Union Square.
Best Friends Animal Society, a Rachael Ray partner, and two local rescue organizations will have puppies available for adoption at the truck site.
The Nutrish campaign -- which also includes print ads in pet specialty publications and in major home magazines like Ladies' Home Journal and Country Living, as well as online ads -- increased its spending on advertising to $4 million in the first six months of 2012, compared with $874,000 in the same period last year, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP.
''For some people, pets are as important as anyone in the family,'' Ms. Ray said. ''We're going to have more Nutrish products this year and next. And we'll have food for cats, too, because of my mom.''

HEADLINE: Open Season on A-Rod

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Detroit
On the tombstone of his Yankees career, Alex Rodriguez may one day be remembered in his own words from a moment of unvarnished introspection during an interview session before the 2008 All-Star Game at the old Yankee Stadium.
''It's always been something with me,'' he said. 
He soon added, ''I've learned to put whatever issues on the front page in a small box over here.'' And, yes, for a time that carried him through an exhilarating 2009 postseason that promised to be personal vindication and career validation, Rodriguez largely stanched the flow of ''something.'' He negotiated a truce with those typically inclined to believe the worst about a man who was strangely capable of simultaneous preening and hiding; a player blessed with the richest of salaries, yet haunted by skeletons and syringes.
But now the box is one of glass, and the Yankees have locked Rodriguez inside it with all of his issues, incipient and erstwhile. Once vilified for bulking up, he has become, in a figurative sense, the incredible shrinking slugger, to the point where the growing belief is that he might soon disappear from New York, against all economic odds.
The Yankees' season remained alive after Game 4 of the American League Championship Series against the Tigers was postponed Wednesday night because of rain. One of their famous alumni coined a rather memorable phrase about it not being over till it's over, but it was difficult not to begin looking ahead to 2013 in the wake of a 3-0 series deficit. And the question of what to do with Rodriguez suddenly loomed larger than all others -- including the recovery from a broken ankle of the captain, Derek Jeter.
What do you say about a man who, in the span of a few unsightly days, has been pinch-hit for and benched on multiple occasions, essentially stripped of his professional dignity one step before the World Series? Remember the recent time of batting order innocence, when the budding controversy was whether Rodriguez should be dropped from the third position?
On Wednesday evening, General Manager Brian Cashman volunteered that Rodriguez had become a $30-million-a-year platoon player for the remainder of the season, however many hours or days that would entail. As with his manager, Joe Girardi, the discussion of the riddle nicknamed A-Rod was conducted in earnest but businesslike tones, Cashman citing a season's worth of statistics -- chiefly Rodriguez's subpar numbers versus right-handed pitchers that plummeted in the playoffs.
Were they mad at him for the recent New York Post report that had Rodriguez turning the dugout into a dating service after being pinch-hit for in Game 1 on Saturday night, perhaps compensating for the on-field emasculation by puffing up his manhood?
''Purely baseball related,'' said Cashman, who has had his own indiscreet fling with the gossip columns. ''This is all about winning, regardless of the report that is out there that is a non-baseball-related story.''
Because it has become open season on Rodriguez at the putative end of the 2012 season, any newsbreak has become possible -- and immediately deemed plausible. Cashman stamped on a so-called story that a trade was percolating with the Marlins -- though his denial said there were ''no discussions whatsoever with the Florida Marlins.''
Note to hopeful conspiracy theorists: technically speaking, they're the Miami Marlins.
Girardi added: ''It's not that I want to sit Alex Rodriguez.'' But he did just that Tuesday night against Justin Verlander even when the numbers -- Rodriguez had homered twice off Verlander this season -- suggested that he deserved to play.
For his part, Rodriguez stepped out of the dugout for batting practice with the reserves to admit his unhappiness. ''Obviously, I come to the ballpark feeling I can help the team win, and when you see your name is not in the lineup, obviously it's disappointing,'' he said. ''You've got to just sit to be a cheerleader.''
He insisted that he still had rah-rah feelings for the Yankees, saying, ''I love this organization.'' But are those feelings real? If so, can they possibly be mutual?
Cashman admitted that the decision to bench Rodriguez was ''discussed organizationally,'' though he said Girardi had the final call. Clearly no one was going out of his way to cushion the blow for Rodriguez, who wound up asking a reporter late Wednesday afternoon for information on the lineup against the Tigers' scheduled starter, Max Scherzer.
Over all, there has been little overt sympathy expressed by the Yankees for their troubled third baseman, their expensive albatross, which is really the root of the underlying tension.
They apparently blame Rodriguez for the 10-year contract that will ultimately cost at least $275 million -- unless Miami or some other team can be talked into picking up a small percentage in a trade and the Yankees not only swallow the rest, but have it count against their payroll for revenue-sharing purposes.
But if Rodriguez is not one to easily feel sorry for, whatever in-house resentment there is for him and his contract is misplaced and grossly unfair.
He didn't force the Yankees to re-sign him. Rodriguez, in fact, provided them an airtight excuse to sever all ties when he opted out of his original deal during the 2007 World Series. Be it Hank Steinbrenner acting alone or with encouragement from brother Hal and others, a disastrous decision was made because they believed Rodriguez -- then considered to be the likely future and clean home run champion -- was a potential cash cow.
They even had the audacity to officially announce the deal on the day George Mitchell released the contents of his long investigation into baseball's steroids culture -- the sort of cheesy, transparent call for attention that Rodriguez had long been known for. All things considered, the events leading to where they are now might convince a few folks to think the inscription on that A-Rod Yankees tombstone should actually read: They deserved each other.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Keep Up Attacks After Debate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Mark Landler reported from Athens and Mount Vernon, Iowa, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. reported from Chesapeake, Va. Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Mount Vernon.

 BODY:
ATHENS, Ohio -- President Obama and Mitt Romney retreated to different corners of the electoral ring on Wednesday, a day after going toe-to-toe on Long Island. But both kept flinging taunts at each other, as they girded for a final debate on Monday and the increasingly pugilistic closing rounds of the election campaign.
At college campuses here and in Iowa, an energized Mr. Obama declared that Mr. Romney's tax proposals did not add up, his job plan would not create jobs, and his deficit-reduction proposals would only add to the nation's deficit. 
''Everybody here's heard of the New Deal, you've heard of the Fair Deal, you've heard of the Square Deal,'' Mr. Obama said, before deploying a jab he used against Mr. Romney in the debate. ''Mitt Romney is trying to sell you a sketchy deal.''
Mr. Romney, speaking an hour later in Chesapeake, Va., ridiculed Mr. Obama's explanation that gasoline prices were tied to the health of the economy, saying it was the ''most classic of the nonanswers of the night.''
''Don't you think that it's time for him to finally put together a vision of what he'd do in the next four years if he were elected?'' Mr. Romney said. ''I mean, he's got to come up with that over this weekend because there is one debate left, on Monday.''
For Mr. Obama, however, it was a day to start putting his listless performance in the first debate behind him. Visibly pumped up by his showing on Tuesday, the president delighted in skewering not just his opponent's proposals but his use of words -- notably Mr. Romney's line about collecting ''binders full of women'' to diversify his cabinet as governor of Massachusetts.
''We don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven women, willing to learn and teach in these fields right now,'' Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Romney made no mention of the administration's handling of the attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya -- an issue with which he had hoped to score some points during the face-off at Hofstra University but which ended up supplying one of his most awkward moments after a dispute over whether Mr. Obama had labeled it an act of terror.
Mr. Obama poked fun at the stark difference between his first and second debates. ''I'm still trying to figure out how to get the hang of this thing -- debating,'' he said with a grin. ''We'll keep on improving as time goes on.''
The president's visit to Iowa was part of the campaign's aggressive early-voting effort. At Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, a satellite voting site was set up at a library for students to vote after his speech. The president's fiery debate performance lifted the spirits of his supporters in Iowa, some of whom had grown worried after his first encounter with Mr. Romney.
''He had so much energy and was just so much better,'' said Wendy Willits, 47, of Lisbon, Iowa. ''It was what I expected to see at the first debate.''
For Mr. Obama's aides, there was more relief than exuberance. They said the debate had reset the race to where they expected it to be: the president holding a narrow lead in enough battleground states that they hope will let him eke out victory over Mr. Romney.
David Plouffe, one of Mr. Obama's chief strategists, told reporters that after the Denver debate, Mr. Romney had closed the polling gap in several of these states. But he said he did so with Republican-leaning independent voters that a Republican nominee would have corralled anyway, though perhaps not as fast.
Polls in September that showed Mr. Obama with a lead of eight or more percentage points in Ohio and other states were a ''fantasy,'' Mr. Plouffe said. The president's margin of victory in battleground states was going to be ''1, 2, 3, 4 points at most.''
One thing the debate may have done, Mr. Plouffe said, was to plant troublesome questions that could dog Mr. Romney. Among those was his assertion that he favored giving every woman the right to contraceptive services -- a position at odds with his support of legislation that would let employers opt out of providing insurance for contraception.
The heated exchange on Libya, an area that once provided an opening for Mr. Romney to question Mr. Obama's credentials as commander in chief, instead has devolved into a confusing debate over what he labeled the attack.

HEADLINE: China's Currency Policy, an Irritant to U.S., Provides Debate Fodder

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Is China a currency manipulator?
Some of the more complicated exchanges during the presidential debate on Tuesday involved how to deal with China's efforts to increase its exports by keeping its currency at artificially low levels, an issue that has had considerable effects over the years on competitiveness, trade deficits and, some economists contend, American jobs.
Both candidates on Wednesday repeated the arguments they had voiced on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for not doing more to persuade China to stop intervening in currency markets. Mr. Obama said he was tougher toward Beijing than Mr. Romney would be if he were in the White House.
The two arguments obscure a more nuanced reality: adjusted for inflation, China's currency has strengthened considerably through much of Mr. Obama's tenure. 
Some economists who used to be critical of China for undervaluing its currency, the renminbi, are now much less so. ''Romney's vow to label China a currency manipulator is a position that is not supported by recent economic data,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell professor who specializes in Chinese currency and trade policies.
But for all the improvement, those gains have recently stopped or started to erode. At the same time, Chinese exports to the United States are strengthening again, rising 5.5 percent in September from a year ago. That partly reflects increased demand as the American economy begins to show signs of recovery.
Mr. Romney was caustic in accusing China of unfair policies.
''One of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency,'' he said. ''Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low -- and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.''
Mr. Romney promised that if elected he would immediately name China a ''currency manipulator,'' a designation that would mandate further negotiations with Beijing. It could lead to American retaliation if Congress passes legislation authorizing special tariffs for countries deemed to manipulate.
Mr. Romney was cautious, though, in threatening to actually impose tariffs on Chinese shipments to the United States, saying he would do so ''if necessary.''
''On Day 1, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers,'' he said.
Mr. Obama responded that the renminbi had strengthened 11 percent during his term of office. The value of one renminbi has actually risen 8.5 percent, to 15.9 cents, since he was sworn in.
But administration officials have tended to follow the practice of many economists in adjusting exchange rates based on the differences in inflation at the consumer level in two countries. Consumer prices have risen a little more than two percentage points more in China than in the United States since January 2009, according to official data, so the inflation-adjusted appreciation has totaled about 11 percent. Most of that took place in late 2010 and last year.
Economists say official data understates inflation in China much more than in the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has acknowledged that there are shortcomings in the way it calculates inflation and said it had begun to fix them. So the actual inflation-adjusted appreciation of the renminbi may have been even greater over the last several years.
That trend appears to be changing. As China's economy has slowed over the last year, partly in response to its stronger currency, the pressure on prices has begun to ease. Exporters interviewed at the Canton Fair on Monday in Guangzhou, China, were unconcerned about inflation for the first time in years.
''Raw material prices are flat,'' said Bob Wang, the sales manager at the Kralle Tools Company, a manufacturer in Wenzhou, in eastern China, that makes circular saw blades for lumber mills.
Through 2009 and the first half of 2010, China spent heavily to block the renminbi from rising against the dollar. China seemed to have the world's healthiest economy during the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. Its currency would have surged had it not intervened.
As it was, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves swelled by $540 billion in just 18 months. The central bank paid for those huge purchases, mostly of dollars, partly by issuing more renminbi and partly by forcing the country's state-controlled commercial banks to hand over a fifth of their renminbi deposits at near-zero interest rates.
The central bank compensated the commercial banks by ordering all of them to pay very low interest rates -- only half the rate of inflation -- to their depositors.
Obama administration officials warned at the time that China was risking inflation by issuing so much more money. China's broadly measured money supply ended up growing 55 percent in 2009 and 2010, much more than that of the United States.
Inflation in consumer prices soon accelerated to reach 6.5 percent in July last year -- nearly twice the American level, even before allowing for of China's tendency to understate inflation. Partly to brake inflation, by making imports cheaper, the Chinese authorities allowed the renminbi to start rising in the summer of 2010 after a two-year hiatus.
The combination of higher prices and a strengthening currency erased much of the undervaluation that institutions like the International Monetary Fund perceived early in the global financial crisis. The I.M.F. responded three months ago by reclassifying the renminbi to ''moderately undervalued'' from ''substantially undervalued.''
Chinese inflation has now largely disappeared because of strict controls on bank lending and a slump in the real estate market. Consumer prices are now rising at about the same pace in China as in the United States, while wholesale prices are dropping much faster in China than in the United States.
The daily fixing of the renminbi's value by the Chinese central bank is now almost exactly where it started the year, as the Chinese government has tolerated only small movements up and down this year. But there is little evidence the central bank is intervening on a large scale to suppress the value of the renminbi. It might even be acting to prevent it from going lower to avoid a political reaction in the United States.
Foreign reserves are essentially unchanged this year. The renminbi has been under downward pressure because Chinese businesses and households have been moving more money out of the country to diversify their investments and hedge against the possibility of political change at home; this has offset the tide of dollars still sweeping in from the persistent trade surpluses.
Chinese exporters have taken heart as the currency has stabilized and inflation has rapidly disappeared -- although wages are still rising at a double-digit percentage pace. Vicky Leung, the sales director at the Xiangli Home Appliance Manufacturing Company, which makes electric fans in Shunde, in southeastern China, is one who is relieved.
''The dollar is good for us,'' she said.

HEADLINE: EBay's Focus on Mobile Apps Helps Lift Revenue 15%

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Quarter by quarter, eBay defies the conventional wisdom that troubled Internet companies can never return to their former glory. The once troubled online retailer has continued a successful turnaround and cultivated double-digit growth in PayPal, its online payments system.
Just three years ago, eBay's core auction business had stalled and its stock price was down to $10, a far cry from its peak of $58 in 2004. At today's closing price of $48.20, the company's stock is up 54 percent for the year, more than the 37 percent gain of its rival Amazon. 
''That's a significant run,'' said Colin Gillis, an analyst with the brokerage firm BCG Partners. ''The core story behind eBay is that they are doing all the right things.''
Results were strong again in the third quarter. On Wednesday, eBay reported that net income rose $597 million or 45 cents a share, a 22 percent jump from the quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 15 percent to $3.4 billion.
John J. Donahoe, eBay's chief executive, attributed the company's performance in part to an early bet that mobile phones would become a platform for commerce, with PayPal providing a lead in mobile payments.
''We're the largest mobile commerce and payments provider in the world,'' Mr. Donahoe said in an interview on Wednesday. ''And we are continuing to innovate. We have a series of innovative apps that people are using. People love shopping on their smartphones and iPad, and PayPal is still the safest way to pay on a mobile phone.''
EBay's mobile apps have been downloaded more than 100 million times worldwide. EBay sellers are now posting two million items a week from their smartphones and, last quarter, over 800,000 new users made their first eBay purchase from a smartphone.
Marketplaces, eBay's biggest business, brought in $1.8 billion in revenue last quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago. PayPal -- which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion 10 years ago -- brought in $1.37 billion in revenue last quarter, a 23 percent jump from the same quarter a year ago, and it is expected to surpass Marketplaces in revenue.
''If you do the math, that will be three to five years out if current trends continue,'' Mr. Donahoe said.
The company, based in San Jose, Calif., expects each business to achieve $10 billion in volume in 2012, more than double the volume in 2011. The operating profit margin increased to 19.6 percent from 18.1 percent in the same period last year.
EBay is now experimenting with a new mobile app called eBay Now. The app, which is being tested by consumers in San Francisco, allows eBay customers to buy products -- from their phones -- from Macy's, Target and Walgreens, and have them delivered the same day.
''What our research says is that consumers like choice,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''People may want an item to come to their office that day, their house the following day and get other items in a couple days. We're giving them that choice.''
If its experiment is successful, eBay Now could mount a challenge to Amazon's shipping service, Amazon Prime, a program that offers customers unlimited free two-day shipping on millions of items for $79 a year. Increasingly, fast delivery is shaping up as the new battleground for online merchants.
But strong performance also breeds high expectations. Last quarter, analysts scrambled to raise their estimates after the company reported a 144 percent jump in profit from a year earlier. The third quarter's 15 percent revenue increase, while impressive, was just below the $3.41 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected.
The company's stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading after eBay guided analysts to trim their estimates for the fourth quarter. EBay said it expects to earn 66 cents to 69 cents a share during the holiday season; the consensus of analysts had been 68 cents.
Asked whether the company would have a hard time meeting analysts expectations in quarters to come, Mr. Donahoe said: ''Our momentum continues, even in the face of reasonable economic uncertainty.''

HEADLINE: Selling The Future By Debating The Past

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After three debates and four and a half hours of nationally televised exchanges, Americans have learned that President Obama has a smaller pension than his opponent and Mitt Romney wants to get Big Bird's beak out of the federal trough, that Joseph R. Biden Jr. likes to smile and Paul D. Ryan drinks lots of water.
But they have not learned as much about what the next four years might look like. With tens of millions of Americans tuning in to the debates, the four candidates for president and vice president have spent most of their time on the biggest public stage of the campaign fighting more about what happened in the last term than what should happen in the next. 
Mr. Obama and Vice President Biden defended their record but gave only a modest sense of their agenda should they be re-elected, beyond arguing for staying the course because the other side would return to what they called the failed policies of the past. Mr. Romney and his running mate, Mr. Ryan, did offer a vision of sorts for replacing what they called failed policies of the present, but they declined to give the kind of details that would help voters evaluate what it would mean for them.
As a result, voters are left to extrapolate from the signals sent during the debates what the future would hold under an Obama second term or a first term of a President Romney. Americans can make interpretations from the values and concepts expressed, even if there are few tangible plans to consider.
''The viewers know what these candidates believe,'' said William A. Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore who now works as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''But they don't know what these candidates would do.''
In postdebate appearances on Wednesday, both the president and Mr. Romney seized on what they saw as their opponents' deficiencies.
''The president still doesn't have an agenda for a second term,'' Mr. Romney told a rally of supporters in Chesapeake, Va. ''Don't you think that it's time for him to finally put together a vision of what he'd do in the next four years?''
He added: ''I just think the American people had expected that the president of the United States would be able to describe what he's going to do in the next four years, but he can't.''
At his own rally in Mount Vernon, Iowa, Mr. Obama said: ''Governor Romney also took another stab at trying to sell us his $5 trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy. Once again he refused to tell us how he's going to pay for it.''
''Usually when a politician tells you he's going to wait until after the election to explain a plan to you,'' he said, ''they don't have a pleasant surprise in store for you.''
Over the course of three debates, the two sides have provided clues. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, in effect, asked voters to ratify the path they have already set. They promised to finish carrying out the health care plan passed in the first term and to seek higher taxes on the wealthy to whittle away at sky-high budget deficits. They vowed to continue clean energy initiatives and fight erosion of women's rights. It has sounded like rear-guard actions preserving what they see as their accomplishments.
There was little of the sweeping ambition envisioned four years ago. Mr. Obama made clear on Tuesday that while he still wanted to rewrite the nation's immigration laws, Republicans stood in the way. The words ''climate change'' were never uttered by a president who in 2008 vowed that his watch would be remembered as the time ''the planet began to heal.'' He spoke only once, in passing, about building roads and bridges, once a key part of his jobs plan.
The agenda outlined by Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would invariably reverse the nation's direction, but voters were left to guess exactly how. Mr. Romney used the phrase ''I know what it takes'' seven times on Tuesday night to assert his ability to create jobs and fix the economy, in effect asking voters to trust him.
He vowed to repeal and replace Mr. Obama's health care law but did not say with what. He promised to repeal and replace Wall Street regulations but did not give specifics. He defended plans to lower tax rates by 20 percent but would not say what loopholes and deductions would be eliminated to offset lost revenue and keep the deficit from exploding.
The candidate with the most specific plans for the future was Mr. Ryan, who vigorously defended his proposals to revamp Medicare and Social Security even though Mr. Romney has distanced himself from the details involved. Mr. Ryan defended the vagueness of Mr. Romney's tax plan by saying, ''We want to work with Congress.''
It is certainly true that describing many details upfront could complicate negotiations with lawmakers, as well as alienate voters whose ox might get gored in carrying out the hard choices that will confront the next president. At the same time, it could make it harder for the winner on Nov. 6 to claim a mandate for action if voters do not buy into some of those hard choices.
''The debates have been mostly confirmatory rather than policy changing,'' said Tom Cronin, a political scientist at Colorado College. ''We plainly have choices and their presidencies will assuredly be different, and the vast majority of debate viewers have learned this. But that is different from winning a mandate for major policy changes.''

HEADLINE: Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEREMY W. PETERS; Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Shortly after the combative presidential debate on Tuesday, Mitt Romney's campaign began running a striking new commercial that uses a former Obama supporter to contest the notion that Mr. Romney's positions on abortion and contraception are ''extreme.''
Before dawn Wednesday, Democrats had taken to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and television to ridicule Mr. Romney's debate-night statement that he had collected ''binders full of women'' when he was a new governor in Massachusetts seeking ''qualified'' female appointees for his administration.
And on the campaign trail and on the air, the candidates and their allies argued intensely all day over who would do more to help women. At the same time, the topic of whether the heated encounter Tuesday night had alienated the very female voters they were seeking to connect with became fodder for cable TV discussions.
The level of intensity left little doubt that the election was coming down not only to a state-by-state fight for territory, but also to one for the allegiance of vital demographic groups, chief among them undecided women. 
Speaking in Mount Vernon, Iowa, Mr. Obama made his own reference to Mr. Romney's ''binders'' comment, saying that there were enough talented women in the country that finding them required no special search.
Mr. Romney, at a campaign rally in Chesapeake, Va., hit back. ''This president has failed America's women,'' he said. ''They've suffered in terms of getting jobs. They've suffered in terms of falling into poverty.''
For Mr. Romney, the imperative, with less than three weeks until Election Day, is cutting into what has been Mr. Obama's sizable lead among women.
Their goal, Romney aides said, is to keep Mr. Obama's lead among women, which in many polls has been in double digits, down to the low single digits.
Key to that effort, they said, is changing the perception among undecided women that Mr. Romney holds very conservative positions on social issues, after a Republican primary campaign in which Mr. Romney was under constant pressure from the right.
Through polling and focus groups, the Romney campaign has found that while undecided women said they were concerned primarily about economic issues, they were troubled by whether Mr. Romney's positions on issues like abortion and contraception were too unyielding.
Mr. Romney, who while running for governor in 2002 said he would govern as a supporter of abortion rights but subsequently came to shift his position, now opposes abortion except in cases of rape and incest. On access to contraception, Mr. Romney has emphasized his opposition to Obama administration policies that he says pressure religious employers to provide health insurance that covers contraception.
He has not sought to limit access to contraception but has voiced support for a provision that would give other employers the right to deny coverage for contraception on moral grounds.
Mr. Romney and his team have tried to address these concerns. They said perceptions of Mr. Romney's positions had been unfairly shaped by Mr. Obama's advertising, including ads focused on abortion rights.
According to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, the Obama campaign and Democratic groups have run commercials relating to abortion about 30,000 times since July 2 -- about 10 percent of their ads -- including one that falsely claimed Mr. Romney's opposition to abortion extended to cases of rape and incest.
Mr. Romney's latest television ad answering that barrage potentially creates the risk that it will remind voters of how Mr. Romney has altered his position on abortion over the course of his political career.
Romney campaign strategists said they decided to release the ad this week because they believe it will have maximum impact as late-deciding voters tune in.
The ad was produced within the last two weeks, after strategists identified Sara Minto of Ohio, one of their volunteers, as a plausible ''ideal everywoman.''
''You know, those ads saying Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme, so I looked into it,'' says Ms. Minto, sitting in her living room. She adds that she voted for Mr. Obama in 2008.
''Turns out Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all. In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life,'' she continues.
Joel Benenson, Mr. Obama's pollster, said in an interview he did not believe Mr. Romney would succeed in changing minds, saying, ''Perceptions are pretty baked in because of a range of positions on both the economic front and the social front.''
In a conference call with reporters, Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, accused Mr. Romney of trying to ''mislead the American people about his plan to turn women's health care decisions over to their bosses.''
She pointed to Mr. Romney's statement of support last winter for the Blunt Amendment, which would allow employers to deny health coverage for procedures they find morally objectionable. (It came after he initially told an Ohio television station that he opposed the bill.)
That conference call included a statement from Lilly Ledbetter, the retired tire worker who became the impetus for the Fair Pay Act that made it easier for women to sue over pay disparity. Mr. Obama backed the legislation and signed it into law. Mr. Romney has not taken a definite position on it, though he has said he sees no reason to change it.
The call also featured Jesse Mermell, who had been executive director of the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, which provided Mr. Romney with the ''binders'' he referred to when he said in the debate, ''I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women.'' Ms. Mermell said the binder was prepared for whomever won that election.
Obama campaign officials made it clear that they would continue to press the arguments about Mr. Romney's record on women's issues in advertisements, and they spent an additional $7 million on a final-stretch television blitz that was already costing $40 million.
Mr. Romney's campaign had its own offensive ready. In a phone call with reporters, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire said ''when the president talks about women's issues he doesn't talk about his vision for how he's going to make sure that we address the number of women who are under- or unemployed.''
And late Wednesday, the Romney campaign released an advertisement featuring women who had served in his state administration who say they were struck by his ''humanity,'' say he ''gets working women'' and stands by single mothers.

HEADLINE: Mr. Putin's Gift to Terrorists

 BODY:
There will be plenty of losers from Russia's recent decision to end two decades of cooperation with Washington on cleaning up nuclear and chemical weapons sites left over from the cold war. Russia will now have to pay for such efforts on its own. The United States will lose the most cost-effective way yet found for reducing nuclear dangers. And the world must watch as Russia's unsecured weapons and materials remain a temptation for terrorists of all varieties to buy or steal for use in future attacks. 
The cooperative threat reduction program Russia wants to walk away from next spring is the heart of the so-called Nunn-Lugar initiative, which was passed by Congress in 1991. This range of programs provides American money and expertise to countries of the former Soviet Union to help them eliminate or secure vulnerable nuclear and chemical weapons, materials and sites.
Over the past two decades, they have helped deactivate more then 7,600 nuclear warheads, destroy more than 2,000 nuclear capable missiles, convert more than 400 metric tons of highly enriched uranium bomb fuel into low-enriched reactor fuel and destroyed large stockpiles of chemical weapons. This has cost the American taxpayer less than $15 billion over the 20-year life of the program, far less than the Pentagon spends each year for defense and deterrence against nuclear attack.
But the job remains barely half-done. Cutting off this successful program now is perverse and reckless -- and all too typical of President Vladimir Putin's sour, xenophobic and self-isolating worldview. Last month, he expelled the United States Agency for International Development, which has sponsored human rights, civil society and public health programs since the fall of communism. Perhaps those civil society programs proved too successful -- and too threatening to Mr. Putin -- for their own survival. But the nuclear cleanup program affects everyone's survival.
The official explanation for ending them is based on national pride -- the wish to proclaim that Russia can take care of these issues by itself, without American help. Another may be Moscow's reflexive desire to be shielded from foreign eyes that might see things President Putin and his military commanders do not want them to see. Paranoia and xenophobia in the Kremlin predates communism and has now outlasted it by more than two decades.
If Moscow lets the cooperative program lapse, it needs to replace it with adequately financed Russian programs. The continuing cleanup must be transparent enough to earn the world's trust. Currently, that confidence comes from the participation of American contractors in the cleanup work. Maintaining it without them will not be easy. But Mr. Putin, having created that problem, must now solve it.

HEADLINE: Candidates Clash In Furious Effort To Woo Women

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama charged that Mitt Romney's policies are economically threatening to women, as the candidates in their second presidential debate on Tuesday night clashed repeatedly over who would best serve the interests of the country's largest and most critical constituency.
With some polls offering sporadic evidence that Mr. Romney is gaining support among women in the final weeks of the campaign, the president seized every opportunity during their face-off at Hofstra University on Long Island to assert that Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, would eliminate financing for women's health services, block access to contraceptives, oppose equal pay and undermine the economic recovery for families in which women are the breadwinners.
''This is not just a women's issue,'' Mr. Obama said during an exchange about equal pay for women in the workplace. ''This is a family issue. This is a middle-class issue. And that's why we've got to fight for it.'' 
Mr. Romney sought to defend his policies as better for women, denying Mr. Obama's accusations about contraception and insisting that his record as Massachusetts governor is one of inclusion and equality. Even as the debate concluded, Mr. Romney's campaign released a television ad stressing that he does not oppose contraception and believes abortion should be legal in some cases.
''Turns out, Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all,'' a woman in the ad says. ''In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life.''
But Mr. Romney's rambling description of his efforts to hire women into his administration as governor of Massachusetts became an instant Internet sensation when he said he had ''whole binders full of women'' that he considered for jobs in his cabinet and agencies.
''I said, 'Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?' '' Mr. Romney said during the debate. ''And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.''
The ''binders full'' comment was a hit on Twitter, quickly becoming a ''meme'' that generated a mocking Tumblr page and prompted a Democratic group to buy up the Web site www.bindersfullofwomen.com. The group, American Bridge 21st Century, used it to list actions by Mr. Romney that the group said were contrary to women's interests.
The appeals to women came during a debate in which Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also sought to energize their bases. Mr. Obama, in particular, delivered an aggressive performance that advisers hope will give his core supporters fresh evidence that the president is ready to fight for a second term.
Mr. Romney pressed his case for tax cuts, a favorite topic of conservatives, and remained critical of the administration's account of the deadly attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, an issue that Republicans believe gives them an advantage. And Mr. Romney repeated his campaign mantra that the country cannot afford another four years like the ones Mr. Obama has presided over.
But there was no mistaking the focus by the candidates on women. That focus has increased dramatically in the final weeks of the campaign, as the overall race has tightened nationally and in many of the most important battleground states. Mr. Obama has long maintained a double-digit lead among women in most surveys, helping him to overcome a deficit among men.
A Gallup poll this week suggested that Mr. Obama's advantage had evaporated, though other surveys -- and Mr. Obama's top strategists -- disputed that finding.
As the debate on Tuesday made clear, neither campaign is taking the support of women for granted. Mr. Obama, in particular, seemed eager to make the case for his policies -- and to criticize Mr. Romney's -- after having been criticized by many high-profile women for not doing so in the debate two weeks ago in Denver.
The president went out of his way several times to mention Mr. Romney's pledge to eliminate financing for Planned Parenthood. Mr. Obama argued that that would not only affect women's health services but would be an economic burden on families during tough times.
''Millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.''
On the question of contraception, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney would allow employers to decide whether to provide contraception coverage in their insurance plans, an option foreclosed by the president's health care law. Mr. Romney denied that.
''I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not,'' Mr. Romney said, using time from another question to try to rebut the president. ''Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.''
Mr. Romney sought to connect the interests of women to the broader issue of the economy's sluggish recovery, suggesting repeatedly that he could do better for struggling families -- and especially women -- if he is in the White House.
''There are three and a half million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We don't have to live like this. We can get this economy going again.''
But it was a question about equal pay for women that elicited the most memorable exchange of the debate. Mr. Obama focused on passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- the first bill he signed as president -- which makes it easier for women to sue if they suspect they are not being paid fairly.
''So we fixed that,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.''
When it was Mr. Romney's turn, he described the efforts he made after being elected governor to make sure that women were well represented in his administration. He said the early recommendations were mostly men, and that he pushed harder to search for qualified women to serve.
That led to the ''binders full'' comment and to a description of his willingness to be flexible about the hours that his chief of staff -- a woman named Beth Myers, who is now a top adviser to his campaign -- worked while raising children.
''She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 at night. I need to be able to get home at 5, so I can be there for -- making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school,'' Mr. Romney explained. ''So we said, fine, let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.''

HEADLINE: Experts See a Lost Chance for Romney as Young Voters Favor Obama

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
For all the Republican efforts to cast President Obama as a failed leader who created a lost generation of young people with diminished prospects for financial success, Mr. Obama has maintained a strong advantage over Mitt Romney among the crucial constituency of young voters, slightly increasing his lead in polls since the spring.
Despite the Romney campaign's message that the ''Obama economy'' -- specifically, the recession and the slow recovery -- has been detrimental to young job seekers, Mr. Romney has made very limited gains since the spring among likely voters ages 18 to 29. 
Those findings, from a national poll of young voters conducted for the Harvard Institute of Politics, highlight a lost opportunity for Mr. Romney, experts said. Earlier polls by the institute found a high level of undecided voters who, when compared with voters in 2008, were significantly more likely to identify as conservative and cite a lack of faith in government.
Mr. Romney's selection of a more youthful and conservative running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, seems to have had a negative effect on some young voters, with 40 percent saying that the nomination of Mr. Ryan, 42, made them ''much less likely'' to vote for Mr. Romney. Mr. Ryan is more conservative than most young voters on social issues and the role of government in society.
''There was an opportunity for the Republican Party and Mitt Romney to connect to this generation about economic principles, and that opportunity hasn't been seized,'' said John Della Volpe, the polling director at the Harvard Institute of Politics. ''There's no evidence in the survey that Mr. Romney has been able to transcend in the millennial segment.''
In a spring survey, 34 percent of likely young voters said they supported Mr. Romney, compared with 51 percent for Mr. Obama. The new survey, conducted from Sept. 19 to Oct. 3 and released on Wednesday, found that Mr. Romney's level of support went to 36 percent, but that Mr. Obama's support had grown to 55 percent.
Among female voters, Mr. Obama was favored, 53 percent to 33 percent, and among men his advantage was 54 percent to 38 percent. Mr. Obama was also leading among blacks and Hispanics, but Mr. Romney had a four-point advantage among young whites, a group Mr. Obama won in 2008.
Data from the poll and interviews of likely voters suggest that Mr. Obama's message that his administration has made steady progress is resonating with people under 30, whose unemployment rate for months has been higher than the national average.
The portion of young people identifying themselves as independents who said the country was headed in the right direction doubled, to 16 percent from 8 percent, since the spring. The figure among young Republican voters remained flat, at 7 percent, while among Democrats it was 48 percent.
''Barack Obama is a charismatic individual with a youthfulness about him and a way of speaking that works with young people,'' said Wade Peery, 28, a Romney supporter in Galax, Va., who said he was not surprised that his favored candidate did not have more support among young people. ''I think there are a lot of people who have been on that Obama bandwagon since he's been in office. Things have changed, and they don't want to see that there might be a better option here in Mitt Romney.''
The online poll of 2,123 18- to 29-year-olds was conducted for the Harvard Institute of Politics by Knowledge Networks and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points. The poll concluded on the day of the first presidential debate, in which Mr. Romney was viewed as having outperformed the president. The lift Mr. Romney received is not reflected in the findings.
Mr. Peery said later that he was especially pleased with Mr. Romney's performance in the first debate. ''That's like the Super Bowl of politics, and if the president isn't going to take the time to prepare and do a great job, how do I know he's going to take other important things seriously?'' Mr. Peery said. ''He took it on the chin and didn't fight back. That blows my mind.''
Mr. Peery was impressed with Mr. Obama's stronger performance in the second debate. But he said it was too little, too late.
Young Obama supporters see things differently, however. ''The way I feel, the country and the economy are on the right track, and that's a lot better than being on the wrong track,'' said James Wootten, 25, a student and restaurant server in Charlottesville, Va. ''Housing prices are going up, unemployment claims are going down, and the stock market looks pretty good.''
If Mr. Romney missed an opening with some young voters, Mr. Obama has missed an opportunity, too, in motivating young Hispanics, according to the Harvard poll. They indicate that they would support Mr. Obama by a wide margin, but of all the groups of young people, they appear the least likely to turn out to vote. While 59 percent of blacks said they intended to vote, only 31 percent of Hispanics who are registered to vote said they would definitely cast a ballot.
Hispanic voters tend to turn out at lower rates than the general public, and many are clustered in states like California and Texas that are not battlegrounds and, therefore, are not subject to the registration drives and intense campaign work that states like Virginia and North Carolina are experiencing.
Christian Del Cid, a senior at the University of Maryland who is a member of the Latino Student Union, said he was leaning toward Mr. Obama but wanted both candidates to fight for his vote until Election Day.
''I'm leaning toward Obama because he took the presidency at a very troubled time, but Latinos do feel a little bit disheartened: where was the immigration reform?'' Mr. Del Cid said. ''And there have been more deportations than under Bush. Latinos need to matter more than once every four years.''

HEADLINE: After the No-Holds-Barred Debate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama and Romney Mount Biting Attacks in Debate Rematch'' (front page, Oct. 17):
As the clich goes, what a difference two weeks make. A whole different Barack Obama showed up Tuesday night at Hofstra University, and he ''beat up'' on Mitt Romney. 
Mr. Obama was powerful, forceful and in control, and had a great command of facts and figures. Mr. Romney was flustered and was getting a little hot under the collar. Yes, he landed some direct hits on Mr. Obama's economic performance, but he lost the ''fight'' on both style and substance.
The president was obviously well prepared, and his tone and demeanor were right on. Mr. Romney was on defense much of the night and most effective when he laid out the many promises he claimed that Mr. Obama had failed to deliver on.
All in all, a good night for the president, not so for Mr. Romney. Most important, Mr. Obama has most likely broken the momentum that Mr. Romney generated after the first debate.
Stay tuned, folks; we have a real contest on our hands.
KEN DEROW Swarthmore, Pa., Oct. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
After listening to stump speeches, reading their hometown papers and following online or television news, some voters remain undecided. When these voters have the opportunity to pose thoughtful, specific questions to the candidates and receive responses that are reiterations of the candidates' stump speeches, that is disappointing and disrespectful.
LILA SUNA New York, Oct. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
I was disappointed that when the candidates were asked if they would reinstitute the ban on automatic weapons (finally!), neither candidate, especially Mitt Romney, chose to respond directly or unequivocally.
Mr. Romney evaded the question by rehashing the National Rifle Association's position that there are enough gun control laws on the books and that what's needed is enforcement. He then sidestepped the question entirely by talking about the importance of family.
President Obama's response was much better in saying that weapons intended for the military should not be available to civilians. But by saying that those committing homicide in Chicago use handguns, he watered down the importance of outlawing automatic weapons, which, by their very nature, have the capacity to cause much more harm in a short period of time.
MICHAEL KLAUSNER Bradford, Pa., Oct. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
After one vice-presidential and two presidential debates, where's the plan?
On the Republican side, there are promises of jobs, lower taxes and prosperity, but no road map other than impossible math and the same tired mantra we have heard for decades that the system will take care of itself if business is released from government controls. The Republicans' bottom line is protecting the 1 percent.
The Democrats have good ideas such as investment in education, energy sustainability, universal health care, cutting military costs and protecting Social Security. But how are they going to do this without Republican cooperation?

HEADLINE: In a Five-Part Series, The Times Movingly Explores Another America

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Dan Barry's "Donna's Diner" articles provide a window into the way many struggle to get by but don't give up hope. 

 BODY:
In a volatile election season, with candidates going for blood and the volume turned up full blast, Dan Barry's five-part series makes its appearance in The Times like a visitor from a distant planet.
The "Donna's Diner" articles, which have been featured on the front page since Sunday, are quiet, clear-eyed and thoughtful. They make no violent assertions. They merely offer a window into the way many Americans live today in parts of the country that get little attention, except as places where swing-state voters remain undecided.
The stories offer that window through skillful storytelling about good people who are struggling to get by.
The series is, indisputably, very long. Its opening piece last Sunday was 4,000 words -- beginning on the front page under an inviting headline, "At the Corner of Hope and Worry," and continuing to two full pages inside.
I wondered, for a moment, if I had misunderstood. Five parts about a diner in Ohio? A total of almost 14,000 words?
Then I began to read about 57-year-old Donna Dove of Elyria, Ohio, who "maxed out her credit cards, cashed in her 401(k) and opened a business to call her own."
You know this place: It is Elyria's equivalent to that diner, that coffee shop, that McDonald's. From the vantage point of these booths and Formica countertops, the past improves with distance, the present keeps piling on, and a promising future is practically willed by the resilient patrons.
And I will admit to being hooked. The two inside pages read like a short story.
Perhaps the most haunting piece is Wednesday's, in which the difficult subject of race is treated through a focus on Ike Maxwell. He is a one-time high school football star who now wanders the streets of Elyria shouting, and whose brother's fatal shooting by the police caused race riots decades ago.
Mr. Barry handles the subject matter, and writes about the people, with respect and sensitivity.
"This was not going to be 'here's another dying Rust Belt city,' " he told me this week, as he described how he came to decide on this particular diner in this particular city. (The photographer Nicole Bengiveno, whose fine work accompanies the stories, came across it while on another assignment and suggested it to Mr. Barry and his editor, Chuck Strum, a deputy national editor. Also important to the project were the deputy photo editor Meaghan Looram, the videographer Kassie Bracken and the multimedia journalist Jacqueline Myint.)
"The spirit of the people, their great pride - I was just enchanted," Mr. Barry said. He and Ms. Bengiveno both spent a great deal of time in the small city over the past several months. Mr. Barry said he drove there "maybe 10 times," staying for three or four days each time.
"The idea wasn't to find a sad place and tell you a sad story," Mr. Strum said. In The Times, "we write a lot about people who have money to burn," but the idea with "Donna's Diner" was to show a different America, one where difficult circumstances are balanced by enduring hope and optimism, against the odds.
The idea for the project began last year when the executive editor, Jill Abramson, told staff members that, in the coming election year, she wanted The Times to find new ways to look at the American economy and its effect on people.
"Dan took this almost as a personal assignment," Mr. Strum said. He described Mr. Barry as someone with "an enormous heart and a lot of feeling for these folks."
Ms. Abramson is justifiably pleased with the result.
"Elections turn on the balance between the hopes and struggles of the American people. Dan Barry's vivid reporting on Elyria, Ohio, brilliantly explores this balance at precisely the moment that so much political coverage focuses on candidates rather than the character of the country," she told me. Top editors felt its quality justified the generous amount of space in print.
She called the series "a majestic narrative, in words, pictures and multimedia, about Donna, her family and the people she feeds at the diner."
The last part appears in Thursday's Times. It's well worth spending the time to read all five parts of this remarkable series and see the multimedia effort, too.

HEADLINE: Queens Residents Lead the City in Optimism, Poll Finds

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: A survey finds that New Yorkers are happy with the city as a whole and with their particular neighborhoods. 

 BODY:
Is Queens looking at the world through rose-colored glasses? A new survey found that almost a quarter of Queens residents were "very optimistic" about "the future of life in New York City," up from 14 percent last year.
The survey was conducted for the Municipal Art Society of New York, which has looked at livability in the city annually for the last three years. Some things have not changed: The survey once again found that New Yorkers are happy with the city as a whole and with their particular neighborhoods. Eighty-four percent said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with life in the city, the same percentage as in 2010 and 2011. This year, 15 percent said they were "not very satisfied" or "not satisfied at all." 
Citywide, satisfaction with neighborhoods was also 84 percent, the same as last year and the year before. But some places are happier than others. Staten Islanders seemed to be happiest with their neighborhoods: 91 percent said they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied," while the comparable figures were 85 percent for Manhattan and Brooklyn, 84 percent for Queens and 77 percent for the Bronx. (The boroughs ranked in the same order last year, though the percentages were slightly different. And in 2010, Manhattan led the list, with 91 percent answering "satisfied" or "very satisfied." Staten Island was second that year, with 90 percent.)
New Yorkers, no matter how much they may complain about everyday life, are apparently more optimistic than they were a year ago. The survey found that 81 percent answered "optimistic" or "very optimistic" to a question about the future of life in the city, up from 75 percent last year.
In the borough-by-borough breakdown on that question, Queens led the city again this year with 79 percent, the same as in 2011. But there was a striking difference: This year, 24 percent said they were "very optimistic," up from 14 percent last year. The percentage that was merely "optimistic" dropped correspondingly, to 55 percent from 65 percent.
This year, Manhattan (78 percent), Brooklyn (77 percent) and the Bronx (76 percent) were close behind Queens on the optimism question, with Staten Island lagging (69 percent). Last year, the Bronx was No. 2 with 78 percent, while Brooklyn and Manhattan were tied for third place with 77 percent. Staten Island was last with 65 percent.
So why do people in Queens like it so much? "It comes up high on value, it comes up high on being family-friendly," said Vin Cipolla, the president of the Municipal Art Society. "Maybe the combination of a more affordable place to live in New York and a place that is considered to be family-oriented contributes to that."
The Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, offered much the same explanation. "It's because we love our homes and our neighborhoods," she said through a spokesman.
But enough with the smiles. What about New Yorkers' fears? Another question asked about "threats to living happily in the city." The top four concerns were employment opportunities (mentioned by 22 percent), safety (21 percent), housing (19 percent) and costs of goods and services (19 percent).
Staten Island was the most concerned about safety (mentioned by 25 percent of the respondents from that borough), while Manhattan was the least worried about it (mentioned by 15 percent of Manhattanites in the survey). But the breakdown on jobs was evenly distributed across the city. "'Employment opportunities' reflect that everybody's worried about their job, followed by other indicators of livability, which in other times might be higher than unemployment," Mr. Cipolla said.
The survey was conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which questioned 1,324 adults in New York City by telephone between Aug. 28 and Aug. 31. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: From India, Hoping to Find a U.S. College That 'Feels Right'

BYLINE: SUSH KRISHNAMOORTHY


HIGHLIGHT: Sush Krishnamoorthy, a student at Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, in New Delhi, writes that college Web sites do not help because "all of them claim to have the best of everything." 

 BODY:
I've been spending the past few weeks narrowing down the list of colleges to which I will apply.
My first parameters are the academic standard of the school and financial aid available for international students. The figures for average financial aid packages for individual colleges differ from Web site to Web site. Considering the information overload on the Internet, I have to search everything twice, just to confirm the credibility of my sources. 
Apart from these factors, finding the colleges that fit me is important. But how do I know what is a good fit? Some people say that when they visited the campus, it just felt right. Living in India, I can't visit college campuses in the United States to know how it feels to be there. 
Rankings don't describe the housing standards at a college, how lively the social scene is or the level of support for international students. Deciphering the rankings is like trying to decode Mona Lisa's mysterious smile.
If I turn to the colleges' Web sites, all of them claim to have the best of everything. Deciding where to apply could not get harder.
I've visited online college guides like College Prowler, and it has come in very handy. It offers information about everything from housing, dining, classes, connectivity, safety, the town and surroundings, as well as student reviews on several topics. My concerns may seem trivial, but these are details that may matter to me in the next four years.
Most schools that are need-blind for international students and match all of my preferences are highly selective. College admissions blogs and advisers would say that my short list is not realistic, because I hardly have any "safe schools" in mind. 
Now, I only know that I'm applying to Stanford University under single choice early action. Depending on my envelope from Stanford, I can modify my short list later if I have to. If I complete the Common App and one very demanding supplement for early action, applying to additional colleges later will not be as exacting as the first application.
I hope.

HEADLINE: Huntsman, Former U.S. Ambassador, Says China Blocked His Speech

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Huntsman Jr., the former U.S. envoy to China and ex-presidential candidate, says Beijing kept him from delivering a speech last month for political reasons. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - China was at the center of one of the harshest exchanges during the U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday night, with President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, both flashing their tough-on-Beijing credentials. But the politician who really knows about China was not on the stage, although he had tried to be.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who campaigned for the Republican nomination, has solid connections to both candidates: He served as the U.S. ambassador to China under Mr. Obama until April 2011, and when Mr. Huntsman abandoned his campaign in January, he immediately endorsed Mr. Romney.
As they prep and role-play for their final debate, both candidates might do well to recruit Mr. Huntsman to get a lay of the land on China. The debate, set for Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, will focus on foreign policy issues, with China one of the selected topics. 
In a fascinating new interview with Isaac Stone Fish of Foreign Policy magazine, Mr. Huntsman was asked about the differences between the two candidates in their approach to China. 
"Well, they differ in some senses in the levers of power that are being pulled," he said. "I think Obama has chosen more the soft levers of power, and Romney is at least articulating some of the hard levers of power, where in reality, we need a combination of both. 
"During campaign season, you never want to talk about anything except the hard levers of power. But we're also trying to get over 10 years of war in the Middle East that have set us back enormously economically and diplomatically, and in terms of loss of life. And that's a reality that we're not having a conversation about."
Mr. Huntsman told Mr. Stone Fish that China had canceled his visa as he was preparing to travel there last month to make a speech. After the interview was published, however, Mr. Huntsman's office on Thursday sent this statement: "The governor's invitation to speak, not his visa, was rescinded for political reasons. The governor misspoke in the interview, citing a canceled visa when he meant to say canceled invitation." 
"Why? Because I talk too much about human rights and American values, and they know that," Mr. Huntsman, who speaks Mandarin, said in the interview. "And at a time of leadership realignment, the biggest deal in 10 years for them, they didn't want the former U.S. ambassador saying stuff that might create a narrative that they would have to fight. I understand that. 
"But when the transition is done, the crazy American ambassador will be let back in, and I can say whatever I want. As they used to tell me when I was over there was 'Women zhongguo ye you zhengzhi' - 'We have politics too in China.' "
Mr. Huntsman said he was subsequently approved for entry to attend a board meeting in China. 
A condensed excerpt from Mr. Stone Fish's interview:
 Q. 
 Put yourself in the shoes of the moderator at the upcoming foreign-policy debate on Oct. 22. What do you think he should ask about China? 
 A. 
 What are the core philosophical drivers that inform the thinking of the candidates? What are our national interests at play? How do we maximize our position in the Asia-Pacific region, understanding that China is the centerpiece geographically. And fourth, given that it is the relationship of the 21st century, how do we intend to sustain the cyclicality that is inherent in a large, complicated relationship? 
 Q. 
Are you surprised that China hasn't become a bigger issue in the campaign? 
 A. 
Beyond it being used as a political tool rhetorically, we've had very little talk of China at a time when we ought to be having a substantive conversation, because it is the relationship that will matter the most in the 21st century. 
 Q. 
What's your understanding of what Chinese officials think about all this rhetoric and what's behind it? Do they see this as one of the downsides of democracy, or of Americans playing into the fears of American decline? 
 A. 
I think it's happened for so long that they've grown to expect it during the election season. I think it affected them more in the earlier years, but now they've grown accustomed to the political cycle, just as we've grown accustomed to the leadership cycles in China, where they do the same thing to us. We just have a bigger megaphone. And they tend to be a little more sensitive, because face still matters a whole lot in terms of human interaction. 
The current U.S. ambassador to China, Gary F. Locke, revealed Wednesday that he had traveled last month to a Tibetan area of western China where "dozens of Tibetans disaffected with Chinese rule have set themselves on fire," as my colleague Edward Wong reported. 
Mr. Locke visited two Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Aba Prefecture of Sichuan Province. He went there, he told The Times, "to see it for myself."
The visit, which came during a wider trip to Chongqing, was noteworthy if only for the fact that Beijing permitted it. The area is tightly controlled by Chinese security forces and the issue of Tibetan autonomy and Buddhist activism is a highly sensitive one for Beijing. 
Mr. Locke only revealed his trip on Wednesday. And for those belonging to the there-are-no-coincidences-in-politics school of thought, it was five years ago on Wednesday - Oct. 17, 2007 - that the Dalai Lama received the Congressional Gold Medal in Washington. 
The award was met with fury and outrage from Beijing, and one senior official called it a "farce." The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who has lived in exile since 1959, is particularly reviled by the leadership in Beijing. 
President George W. Bush attended the elaborate ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda and called the Dalai Lama "a man of faith and sincerity and peace." 
A previous version of this post cited a remark -- in a verbatim interview published by Foreign Policy magazine -- that was made by the former ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr., saying that his visa to China had been canceled due to political reasons. After the interview was published, Mr. Huntsman's office sent this revision of his remarks: "The governor's invitation to speak, not his visa, was rescinded for political reasons. The governor misspoke in the interview, citing a canceled visa when he meant to say canceled invitation." The Rendezvous post and headline have been revised to reflect Mr. Huntsman's statement.

HEADLINE: Springsteen Makes It Official: He's for Obama

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: In a letter on his Web site, Bruce Springsteen made it clear that he was going to support President Obama again and included an explanation as to why Mr. Obama's term had not gone precisely as promised. 

 BODY:
Until now, Bruce Springsteen had chosen to stay silent on national politics, even though his latest album, "Wrecking Ball," can seem like a soundtrack for the Obama campaign, with its lyrics about corporate raiders negatively impacting the working-class people he sings about.
It became clear in the last week that he was going to support President Obama again, after he announced he would perform at Obama rallies in Ohio and Iowa.
But on Thursday night he made it formal in a letter he made public on his Web site. The letter included an explanation as to why Mr. Obama's term had not gone precisely as promised, with a nod to the economy he inherited and Republican opposition.
The letter states: "This presidential election is different than the last one because President Obama has a four year record to run on. Last time around, he carried with him a tremendous amount of hope and expectations. Unfortunately, due to the economic chaos the previous administration left him with, and the extraordinary intensity of the opposition, it turned into a really rough ride. But through grit, determination, and focus, the President has been able to do a great many things that many of us deeply support."

He credits Mr. Obama for "passing guaranteed health care for most of our citizens," and "rescuing the auto industry and so many of the American jobs that go with it," "protecting and enhancing the rights of women, and bringing us closer to full acceptance of our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters."
He cites "the killing of Osama Bin Laden,'' and "following through on the removal of troops from the misguided and deceptive war in Iraq."
He expresses anger at what he called "the opposition's resort to voter suppression," through "anti-voter, anti-citizen efforts."
And, he concludes: "Right now, there is a choice going on in America, and I'm happy that we live in a country where we all participate in that process. For me, President Obama is our best choice because he has a vision of the United States as a place where we are all in this together. We're still living through very hard times but justice, equality and real freedom are not always a tide rushing in. They are more often a slow march, inch by inch, day after long day. I believe President Obama feels these days in his bones and has the strength to live them with us and to lead us to a country ' where no one crowds you and no one goes it alone.' That's why I plan to be in Ohio and Iowa supporting the re-election of President Obama to lead our country for the next four years."

HEADLINE: On Florida's Jewish Question

BYLINE: SHMUEL ROSNER


HIGHLIGHT: Studying the Jewish vote in America is much like studying the Talmud: You immerse yourself in a miniscule detail of little value to most other people and debate ad nauseam the consequences of infinitesimal variations. 

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Florida - I got my first first-hand lesson on the technicalities of Florida voting among a small group of fellow Jews in a classroom here on Tuesday. It was an improvised seminar of sorts: a few friends sitting together to make sure they were on the same page and ready. What's on the ballot, and how does one make sure to vote for the people and the causes one believes in?
You might be thinking: Voting 101 for Floridian Jews? Now? Now, those Jews are learning how to vote properly? Twelve years late? Twelve years after George W. Bush narrowly beat Al Gore in Florida to win the presidency?
No one knows for sure if confused Jewish voters contributed significantly to the 2000 election debacle. All these years later, there's still no agreementabout what happened here back then.
The New York Times concluded that Bush would have won even without the Supreme Court's decision to stop the recount. But the 2,600 extra ballots that went to Patrick Buchanan in Palm Beach -- extra relative to what he won in other districts - may have made a difference in that tight race. You can't reliably tally the number of elderly Jewish voters who mistakenly voted for Buchanan - not a likely deliberate choice for most of them - or Bush or who somehow failed to vote for the candidate they wanted to see win: Gore.
This year Florida's Jews will be better prepared. The mechanics of voting have been simplified since 2000, and with all the hoopla around that debacle, it's hard to imagine there could be another one. So if they fail to vote for the candidate everybody expects them to vote for - Barack Obama - a reason other than technical difficulties will have to be found: his contentious relations with the Israeli government or, more likely, his economic policies.
Any such failure to vote for the predictable candidate would also have to be measured with a very sensitive scale. At most, the result would be that instead of 74 percent of American Jews supporting Obama (as in the 2008 election), this time only 65 percent would be - meaning that a vast majority of American Jews would still be rooting for the man in the White House.
Earlier this week, during an interview with an Israeli radio station dedicated to my new book, "The Jewish Vote: Obama vs. Romney/ A Jewish Voter's Guide," the host introduced me as "an expert on the Jewish vote." It's a big title that masks a simple truth: one hardly needs to be an expert on anything to accurately predict the Jewish vote in the United States. American Jews have not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since forever, and in most races they have given the Democrats not just a majority, but a vast majority of their votes. 
Does a 2 percent or a 3 percent or even a 10 percent change in the Jewish vote warrant that much attention anyway? (Look at all these reports, opinion pieces, analyses, polls and blog posts!) That'd only mean at most a 10 percent change in the votes of just 2 percent of the American population. Jews, it must be said, vote in higher percentages than other Americans, so their actual share of the national vote is about double their share of the population. Still, with most of them residing in states where their votes hardly matter, the implications are generally minor.
In other words, examining the Jewish vote with such passion is often more about the student than about the topic, which is hardly, or only rarely, as consequential as we make it seem. You immerse yourself in a miniscule detail of little value to most other people and debate ad nauseam consequences of infinitesimal variations. That got me thinking that studying the Jewish vote is much like studying the Talmud and a very Jewish thing to do.

HEADLINE: Running Citigroup Without Subsidies

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup's new chief executive should seize the moment to break the huge financial company into discrete, easier-to-manage parts, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
On Tuesday, Vikram S. Pandit announced his resignation as the chief executive of Citigroup. He will also leave its board. Joining him in departing the company immediately is John P. Havens, the chief operating officer, who was already scheduled to retire at the end of the year. 
Michael L. Corbat, the new chief executive, faces the prospect of running Citigroup without the huge government subsidies to which the company has become accustomed. He could make himself into a hero to shareholders by breaking Citigroup into smaller, simpler and more dynamic companies that would be easier to manage.
According to American Banker, a trade publication:
In recent months, Pandit faced mounting questions about Citigroup's capital levels, share price and his compensation as chief executive. On Monday evening, hours after Citigroup reported a third-quarter profit, Pandit clashed with the board over his pay and the company's strategic direction, according to industry sources. By the next morning, he and his longtime aide, chief operating officer John Havens, were gone.
This is an unexpected exit, almost as dramatic as the resignation of the top two executives at Barclays this summer. It is also long overdue; I called for Mr. Pandit to resign in March 2010. 
Others were far ahead of me. For example, Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, concluded in 2008 of Mr. Pandit, "I doubted that he was up to the job"; this appears on Page 2 of her new book, "Bull by the Horns." (Disclosure: I serve, uncompensated, on the private, nonprofit Systemic Risk Council founded by Ms. Bair.)

Citigroup's stock was up 1.6 percent on Tuesday, as shareholders responded positively to the announcement - and perhaps to the sign that the board was finally beginning to act in their interests. Since Mr. Pandit took over as chief executive in December 2007, the stock has lost more than 90 percent of its value. Since March 2010, the stock has been up and down, and it is roughly in the same range now it was then. It is easy to understand shareholders' frustration.
Their frustration is compounded by the amount of compensation that Mr. Pandit received. According to Bloomberg News, Citigroup paid Mr. Pandit $261 million over the last five years, including the $165 million paid to acquire his hedge fund, Old Lane (which was quickly shut down). 
Michael O'Neill, Citi's chairman since April 2012, deserves credit for finally pushing Mr. Pandit out. Unfortunately, Mr. O'Neill has a lot of house-cleaning to do; the governance failures at Citi have been profound and longstanding.
Mr. Corbat will face a great deal of pressure and scrutiny in his new job. His task of restoring profitability will be made even harder by signals that the Federal Reserve plans to chip away at the subsidies for Citigroup and other global megabanks.
In a speech last week, the Fed governor Daniel Tarullo made clear - for the first time - that he thought very large banks received cheaper funding because their creditors believed they receive downside protection in the form of implicit government guarantees.
Mr. Tarullo, the lead Fed governor for many regulatory issues, also made it plain that too-big-to-fail banks should face a size cap. He did not mention Citigroup by name, but Citi's experience leading up to the crisis of 2008 and more recently are likely to have been on his mind. (Mr. Tarullo spoke specifically about capping "nondeposit liabilities" of financial institutions as a percentage of gross domestic product, meaning their debts other than insured deposits. Citigroup is the fourth-largest bank in the country, according to this metric. Its wings would definitely be clipped.)
Citigroup had too little shareholder equity when the financial crisis broke and consequently had to be rescued by government injections of capital and other measures (Ms. Bair's book provides for a meticulous and evenhanded account). Citi has struggled in subsequent stress tests, and last spring the Fed rejected its plan for paying higher dividends.
Mr. Tarullo is stating the plain and awkward truth. The United States taxpayer, directly and indirectly, provided downside protection for Citi's creditors in 2008 and 2009 -- in effect, a great deal of insurance for which taxpayers were not properly compensated. It must not happen again.
Mr. Tarullo also said large banks should have "enhanced capital requirements" that "can also help to offset any funding advantage derived from the perceived status of such institutions as too big to fail." In other words, the funding advantage of global megabanks is going to be reduced, one way or another. The Fed has only just begun to speak forcefully on this issue.
Mr. Corbat, the new chief executive, needs to generate value for Citi shareholders, and, if Mr. Tarullo gets his way, it will not be possible to do so by becoming bigger, getting larger implicit subsidies and posing a greater threat to the American taxpayer.
Mr. Corbat should instead move to break Citi up into smaller, more dynamic and more easily managed pieces. He would create a great deal of shareholder value - American megabanks currently trade at a discount to their book value, while smaller and more manageable banks have a significantly higher valuation. (Ms. Bair made a closely related point in March, although about JPMorgan Chase; she is probably ahead of the curve there, as well.)
Ending the too-big-to-fail distortion of our financial markets is also long overdue. This current implicit subsidy scheme primarily benefits the people who run global megabanks (and not even their shareholders). Let's hope it ends as abruptly and as completely as Mr. Pandit's tenure at Citigroup.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Women

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
The heightened rivalry between President Obama and Mitt Romney on display at Tuesday's debate suggests that the presidential campaign has come down toa tooth-and-nail fight for undecided women. Jim Rutenberg and Jeremy W. Peters explain that Mr. Romney's goal is to chip into the president's lead among women by reframing Mr. Romney's positions on reproductive rights and health care issues, while Democrats are seeking to give the president a greater edge by highlighting his policies and portraying Mr. Romney's views as extremist.

        
The sparring in the three debates so far has done little to clarify for voters what the next four years would look like under an Obama or Romney administration. Peter Baker writes that the retrospective bent of the debates has left voters to extrapolate what each candidate's agenda is.

        
On Wednesday, the candidates returned to the campaign trail ahead of their next and final debate on Monday. Mark Landler and Richard A. Oppel Jr. write that while Mr. Obama tried to woo early voters in Iowa and Mr. Romney talked to voters in Virginia, the pair exchanged jabs mocking each other's performance at Tuesday's debate.

        
The rising cost of college and education financing is blunting President Obama's efforts to make education more affordable and feeding a debate over the government's role in college financing. Richard Prez-Pea writes that while the factors contributing to rising costs are myriad and complex, conservatives say that Mr. Obama's investments hurt where they are intended to help, with Mr. Romney arguing that the president's policies are unsustainable.

        
A poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics suggests that Mr. Romney has missed an opportunity to draw young voters disenchanted with Mr. Obama. Susan Saulny explains that the poll, taken before the first presidential debate, did not reflect Mr. Romney's lift from that performance. It also suggests that Mr. Obama has missed a chance to connect with young Hispanics.
 Happening in Washington 

        
Economic reports expected today include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed by September's leading economic indicators and weekly mortgage rates at 10.

        
At 10:18, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will conduct the Great Shakeout, the agency's annual earthquake drill.

        
At 11, officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will discuss their winter weather outlook.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island: The Most Elastic State

HIGHLIGHT: Rhode Island is among the most Democratic-leaning states, yet it hasn't elected a Democratic governor in more than 20 years. What allows for such results? Elasticity. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is Rhode Island, the Ocean State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Scott MacKay, a political analyst for Rhode Island Public Radio; and Maureen Moakley, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island. 
In the Rhode Island State Legislature, "there are so few Republicans they barely give them parking spaces," Ms. Moakley said.
Indeed, Rhode Island is among the most Democratic-leaning states. It ranks as the fourth bluest state in the nation in the FiveThirtyEight Presidential Voting Index, and Democrats have more than a 3-to-1 edge in voter registration, an overwhelming advantage.
Yet Rhode Island has not elected a Democratic governor since 1992. And one of its two United States senators was a Republican from 1976 to 2007: John Chafee, then his son Lincoln Chafee. The younger Mr. Chafee, now an independent, was elected governor in 2010.
What allows for such disparate results? Elasticity. Rhode Island is the most elastic state, a large swatch of its electorate are persuadable voters unaligned with either political party. Rhode Island has very few Republicans (10 percent of registered voters), a ton of Democrats (41 percent), but even more unaffiliated voters (49 percent).
In presidential races, those unaffiliated voters break largely for the Democrat. The last Republican to carry the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984. But at the state level, unaffiliated voters have often opted to elect socially moderate Republican governors as a check on the Democratic-controlled legislature, Mr. Mackay said.
Rhode Island has a lot of swing voters, partly because the state's main demographic groups do not correlate strongly with either political party. Democrats have a solid base in the state's Hispanic population (13 percent) and black population (7 percent). But outside of those communities voters do not fit perfectly into either major party. Many Democrats are former Rockefeller Republicans, and many Republicans are Reagan Democrats. Party affiliation is a weak bond for many Rhode Island voters. 
In addition, Rhode Island's largest religious populace, Roman Catholics, also tend to be swing voters. Nationally, every winning presidential candidate since the 1972 election has also carried the Catholic vote.
Rhode Island is the only majority Catholic state (52 percent) in the nation, according to Gallup (Massachusetts comes close). And unlike evangelical Christians and Mormons (who lean heavily Republican) or Jews (who lean Democratic), Catholic voters are split roughly down the middle. White Catholics lean slightly Republican, but Hispanic Catholics skew Democratic.
Providence is overwhelmingly Democratic, with mostly white, highly educated and affluent liberals around Brown University, a large Jewish community and more working-class and diverse Democrats in the city's black and Latino populations.
Northern Rhode Island, around Woonsocket, is socially conservative but more supportive of an activist government on issues like Social Security, Mr. Mackay said. This is Reagan Democrat territory.
Conversely, in southern Rhode Island in Washington County, socially moderate, highly educated and wealthy voters live along the water in towns like Westerly and Charlestown. This is a region dominated by Rockefeller Republicans, the old base of the Republican Party in New England, who now vote for Democrats.
Between the two, Kent County, anchored by Warwick, is mostly suburban, relatively affluent and one of Rhode Island's more competitive counties. This was the only county in Rhode Island where Senator John McCain carried more than 40 percent of the vote in 2008.
 The Bellwether: Bristol County 
Look to Bristol County for an early clue as to how Rhode Island will vote. It includes remnants of the state's traditional economic drivers in Bristol and Warren, like fishing and manufacturing. But there's also manifestations of a new knowledge-based economy in wealthy, suburban towns like Barrington, Mr. Mackay said. And over all, Bristol County is becoming more affluent and gentrified, Ms. Moakley said.
Bristol County was a few percentage points more Republican leaning than the state in the 2000 presidential election, but it matched the two-party vote shares in Rhode Island almost perfectly in 2004 and 2008.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 100 percent favorite to carry Rhode Island, according to the current FiveThirtyEight, and all signs point to it remaining reliably Democratic-leaning in presidential elections.
A resurgent Republican Party seems unlikely in Rhode Island. As long as the national Republican brand is strongly defined by cultural conservatism, socially moderate, fiscal conservatives in Rhode Island will most likely continue to vote Democratic.
This dynamic has been apparent by this year's race for Rhode Island First Congressional District. Brenden Doherty, a Republican, was running as a moderate and seemed to be leading the incumbent, Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat. But as the presidential race kicked into full gear, Ms. Moakley said, Mr. Cicilline was able to tie Mr. Doherty with Mr. Romney and the national Republican Party. The latest polls show Mr. Cicilline in front.
Mr. Doherty could still win, of course, but the national Republican brand is a millstone for Rhode Island Republicans, making it harder for them to gain office.
Rhode Island still has socially moderate, fiscally conservative voters. It just doesn't have a partisan home for them.
So while the odds are against state Republicans ascending to power, there could be "an increasing move toward independent candidates," Ms. Moakley said.
"Because," she added, "there's so many people with no place to go."

HEADLINE: Lord & Taylor Parent Moves Toward an I.P.O.

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Hudson's Bay Company, which was founded in 1670, making it Canada's oldest corporation, has filed a preliminary prospectus in preparation for a return to the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- The Hudson's Bay Company, which was founded in 1670, making it Canada's oldest corporation, has filed a preliminary prospectus in preparation for a return to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Hudson's Bay, which also includes the Lord & Taylor chain in the United States, is making the move as it faces increased competition from American retailers in its home market. At the low end of its market, Target is now renovating outlets of a former discount chain it acquired from Hudson's Bay for about $1.8 billion last year. At the other extreme, Nordstrom recently announced plans to open its first stores in Canada.
The prospectus for an initial public offering offered no information about how much of the company will be made available to investors or the share value. The Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, said that the share offering will likely value the company at $2.6 billion.
Although Canada's comparatively robust economy makes it an increasingly attractive market for American retailers, the prospectus show that Lord & Taylor is outperforming its Canadian parent company. Last year, Lord & Taylor had sales of $210 a square foot, compared with 133 Canadian dollars at Hudson's Bay. (Over the past few weeks, the Canadian dollar has been roughly at par, or worth just slightly more than, its American counterpart.)
Excluding discontinued operations, the company said in the prospectus that it produced net earnings of 57.3 million Canadian dollars on sales of 3.8 billion Canadian dollars last year.
Given the symbolic nature of the Hudson's Bay, which once controlled much of what is now Western Canada, there was some controversy in Canada when it was acquired by Jerry Zucker, a technology and textiles investor from North Charleston, S.C., in 2006. Mr. Zucker took the company private.
Following Mr. Zucker's death, Hudson's Bay remained under American control when it was purchased by Richard A. Baker, a real estate investor from New York. Mr. Baker soon combined Hudson's Bay with Lord & Taylor which he had previously acquired and began investing on store improvements at both chains. Bonnie Brooks, a longtime Canadian department store retailer, became president of the combined company, which she operates from Hudson's Bay's flagship store in downtown Toronto.
In the prospectus, the company indicates that it will use some of the proceeds from the stock offering to pay down an undisclosed amount of debt.
The Canadian Press news agency reported that Ms. Brooks, who was in Vancouver, British Columbia for a store event, declined to say if proceeds from the stock offering will allow Hudson's Bay to expand its operations.
But she did dismiss concerns that Nordstrom and Target would grab significant portions of Hudson's Bay's business, arguing that there is little overlap between their businesses. That view is not shared by some analysts.
"We had a lot to do to get the company to a new level of standard so we're now in a position to bring a new level of presentation and new products now to a lot more of our stores," she told the news agency.

HEADLINE: A Financier in Chief

BYLINE: PETER JOSEPH


HIGHLIGHT: What would it really mean to have a man with Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital in the White House? 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney stakes his claim to being a better "job creator" than President Obama largely on his success and experience in the private sector. After the first two presidential debates, voters say that they trust him more than the president on the economy and jobs, but it isn't because Romney has talked much about what Bain Capital actually does.
Romney has chosen not to try to put the private equity business in a particularly sympathetic light nor to explain it in a way that would enable voters to see the connection between his financial activity and his ability to create jobs. I understand his dilemma. As one who spent close to 25 years as a partner in two private equity firms, I can't imagine that I would ever want to try to explain the business during an American political campaign.
So far, the media has focused on Romney's wealth, which he earned from founding one of the leading firms in the business, a firm that maintains an impeccable reputation. This focus has led to interest in Romney's tax returns, which undoubtedly reflect the sound professional advice of experts in tax and estate planning. Other than identifying practices outside the experience of less fortunate Americans, the attention has not identified anything other than compliance with the intricacies of our tax code. One might feel that Romney should have released more of his tax returns or should not have been able to exploit an over-complicated tax code, but those issues are a red herring, in a way. Let's move past them for the moment and instead try to understand exactly how private equity works and how Romney's experience would inform his presidency.
The key point, which has been at once over-discussed and misunderstood, is that the best word for the job Romney did at Bain is financier. He identified attractive investment opportunities and then deployed capital (largely provided by others) to generate positive returns on those investments. For example, imagine that you wish to buy a piece of real estate and that you are able to get a mortgage for 99% of the purchase price (this may stretch your imagination - where can I get a mortgage like this? - but the world of private equity has different rules).
You would have very little money at risk, but an opportunity, with inflation or appreciation in real estate values, to pay off your mortgage lender and keep 100% of the gain for yourself. In addition to the skill of ferreting out an attractive investment opportunity, Romney has demonstrated the ability to recruit and motivate managers who actually create value by improving a business, as well as the ability to attract the necessary capital from banks and institutional investors. In short, Romney was an intermediary or broker between capital and business opportunity.
It is essential to recognize that there is only one significant benchmark of performance for a financier: internal rate of return (I.R.R.), which is basically the rate at which a particular investment grows. An investor who invests in a private equity transaction only wants to know how the investment did. When it comes to the means employed, ignorance is bliss. Unlike in the more public corporate world, where boards, shareholders, customers and sometimes public activists scrutinize the social implications of what a business does, a financier's performance is measured by one question: what was the I.R.R.? 
In pursuit of single-mindedly maximizing the return on an investment, a financier must focus on how to increase a company's cash flow in order to create value, and herein lies Romney's greatest political difficulty. A businessman seeking to optimize profitability will look to lower labor costs by reducing head-count, whether through technology, out-sourcing, or rationalization. This is right out of the basic playbook. It is not the mission of the financier to create jobs. In fact, his mission is often to do just the opposite.
It is also right out of the playbook to maximize cash flow by paying as little in corporate taxes as possible. This is accomplished by managing the level of taxable income, most commonly by using deductions like interest expenses that result from a maximal level of debt. It is the job of the financier to engage in sophisticated tax-planning, and most business people understand and sympathize with this. Most American voters faced with a job recession and a federal budget crisis do not.
Exactly how do financiers like Romney make their money in the institutional private equity business? When large institutions give investment discretion over their funds to a financier, they need to assure themselves that the financier will act as if the money were his own and generally require the financier to make a significant co-investment with his own funds. This basic philosophy of aligning the interests of the financier with those of his investors also gave rise to the compensation structure which has come to be known as carried interest which, in essence, is a sharing of the profits earned on the investors' capital. The carried interest is performance-based because it is earned only if there has been real benefit to the institutional investor. Unless the financier makes money for his investors, he doesn't make money for himself. In this context, Romney can point to his financial success as directly attributable to his performance as an investment manager.
But a third way Romney made his fortune was through his participation in a highly lucrative fee structure that includes any management, monitoring, transaction, financing and other fees generated and taken by Bain for its services. Unlike performance-based compensation, these fees create an adverse interest between the financier and his institutional investors. They solely benefit the financier and, to the extent they diminish the value of private equity investment, they are detrimental to the institutional investors.
Over the course of the last decade, the scale of the private equity business has exploded in response to the search by institutional investors for ever-higher returns. As a result, private equity increasingly became an asset management business, virtually risk-free to the financiers, rather than a shared-risk business as it was originally conceived. The management and other fees that bring in millions of dollars regardless of investment performance have overshadowed the performance-based compensation for many firms and have created unimaginable wealth for private equity firms, little of which has been shared by the people providing the money. As a Bain founder, Romney has undoubtedly benefited from the immense growth in the value of Bain's franchise, even though he has not been actively engaged in the business during this recent period.
Perhaps the most uncomfortable aspect of private equity for Romney to explain is the role of capital from the public sector in driving its growth. In recent years, state and local public employee pension funds have had greater and greater trouble keeping pace with projected obligations to their beneficiaries. The causes of these potential shortfalls vary: unreasonable actuarial assumptions in calculating future benefits, substandard investment performance, inadequate government support, and the unwillingness of politicians to constrain benefit levels. Whatever the reason, the managers who run these pension funds have responded to the anticipated funding gap by seeking investments that offer ever-higher rates of return. In other words, the management of the nest eggs of teachers, police, firefighters, prison guards and other public employees has increasingly been handed over to the captains of private equity.
Although Romney is unlikely to admit it on the campaign trail, his much-vaunted private sector success was based in significant part on the savings of public sector workers. Romney constantly derides big government, but government is made up of individuals, whose pension funds helped make him and Bain unimaginably rich. There is no doubt that these pension funds sought the higher returns offered by private equity investing. But as the private equity business grew, the public pension funds and other capital providers have gotten the short end of the stick, as they have not completely shared with the financiers the value of the franchise created in part by their investment in the industry. It seems odd to hear Romney criticize big government without any acknowledgment that he has made much of his fortune managing the retirement funds of many public employees.
Mitt Romney argues that his time at Bain has real significance in terms of his qualifications for the presidency. Many on Wall Street and in the business community argue that he developed a keen sense, absent in today's White House, of the concerns of the private sector. But voters need to consider whether the time he spent in single-minded pursuit of profit as a financial intermediary has prepared him to tackle the complex problems facing America, which can't be reduced to a financial model.
Romney's financial success is admirable and enviable, but it came by following the mantra of increasing cash flow, cutting jobs and minimizing taxable income. Though the Obama campaign has tried to exploit this with millions of dollars in anti-Bain ads, the real issue is how Romney's experience relates to a president's need to balance budgetary responsibility with the heavy lifting required to address our collective concerns, our common obligations. We have heard a lot about pragmatism and practicality, but I can assure you that compassion and broader social concerns rarely make it into an investment memo. If Romney really wants to push his Bain experience, Americans will have to decide whether the answers to the problems facing them are best provided by a financier president.
 Peter Joseph is a private investor, with more than twenty-five years in the private equity business. He co-founded two private equity firms and invested on behalf of many leading institutional investors.

HEADLINE: Greg Smith's Memoir Offers Few New Details on Goldman

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Greg Smith's reminiscences of the pleasures of the job but does not seem to break much new ground on questionable practices at Goldman Sachs. 

 BODY:
For several months, Goldman Sachs had been worried about what confidential details might come out in a memoir by Greg Smith, a former midlevel executive and trader who worked at the firm for a decade.
While the book does repeat the allegations he first described in a New York Times Op-ed page article, insiders were relieved on Thursday after seeing bootleg copies of the book as it provided few new details of the "toxic" culture that he said prompted him to quit.
Long on Mr. Smith's reminiscences of the pleasures of the job - handmade suits, sashimi at 30,000 feet, strawberries at Wimbledon - the former Goldman salesman's book does not break much new ground on illegal or questionable financial practices at the firm.
There are moments that every veteran Wall Streeter might recognize and will trouble readers - like when bankers increase their bonuses by advising clients to buy the most-profitable products and then grumble when those payouts aren't big enough.
Or telling hedge funds how to profit as countries like Greece teetered on the edge of default, while other Goldman bankers advised their governments on "how to fix the mess."
Despite this "hypocrisy," as he terms it, "Nobody did anything about it. The bonus culture was just too entrenched. The numbers themselves militated against change."
Mr. Smith's Op-ed article, when it first came out in March the day he resigned, sparked a furor and fueled the debate about greed and excess on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs in particular, which had already been derided as a "Vampire Squid" and had faced regulatory inquiries on products linked to troubled subprime mortgages, again found itself under a media microscope.
In recent years, the firm has managed to profit even through some turmoil that felled other banks, including the 2008 financial crisis - a success some critics say is a result of ruthless tactics.
Mr. Smith attributes the shift to the ascension of Lloyd C. Blankfein, a former trader, as chief executive, as well as the changes wrought by the financial crisis on Wall Street. To him, his colleagues in London, where Mr. Smith worked before his abrupt exit, seemed less troubled by a nagging conscience than their counterparts in New York.
It was in London that Mr. Smith heard his colleagues first refer to clients as "muppets," among the most incendiary bits in his March opinion piece.
"Muppets was a word that, for me, had once evoked childhood memories of cute puppets such as Kermit the Frog. But the way it was used in the London office had nothing to do with cuteness. Being a muppet meant being an idiot, a tool, manipulated by someone else," he writes in the book.
And clients considered muppets might get a 15-minute-old price on a product, enabling Goldman traders to profit from the real-time price to the tune of more than $1 million.
When a client asks the trading desk to correct a mistake, not knowing the mistake was actually in the client's favor, he's soon called a muppet by Goldman's traders.
The memoir, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," is scheduled to be released on Monday. A spokesman for Goldman said he was "relieved" upon reading the book, which was provided to The New York Times by the firm.
Grand Central Publishing, a division of the Hachette Book Group, is reported to have offered Mr. Smith an advance of close to $1.5 million.
Goldman Sachs, for its part, has not been afraid to engage in a little hardball in the days leading up to the book's release. Goldman shared documents with Bloomberg News on Thursday detailing how months before he quit, Mr. Smith asked Goldman to double his salary to more than $1 million, and was denied a promotion.
The book does delve into his salary and bonuses over the years, including the times when Mr. Smith said he felt that he was inadequately paid for making millions for the firm.
And the book discusses some of the well-publicized fraud cases. But instead of new details about the case which prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to charge Goldman with fraud in 2010, we learn that one of the traders at the heart of the affair, Fabrice Tourre, was "slightly goofy" and "socially awkward."
Even after the S.E.C. action that Goldman settled for $550 million, Mr. Smith finds himself pressured to sell a financial product he nicknamed Clorox, which he likens to a bologna sandwich sold as "Panino de Bologna." In a chapter called "Monstruosities," he describes how he is dismayed that endowments, philanthropies and foundations "took the bait."
Mr. Smith describes his rise at the firm from an intern all the way up to a midlevel position in London as head of the U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Born in Johannesburg, Mr. Smith makes several references in the book to his family's roots in South Africa, where his grandparents had immigrated as Jewish refugees from Lithuania.
He won a full scholarship to Stanford and after graduating in 2001 landed a spot at Goldman, where he quickly worked his way up in the organization.
He acknowledges having some naivete about the workings of Wall Street, but at other times describes how seductive the money and lavish lifestyle afforded him.
As an intern he visits Scores, a well-known New York strip club, and after "what seemed like about five minutes of dances from a few blond bombshells," Mr. Smith runs up a tab of $750. "Seven hundred and fifty dollars! I certainly didn't have that kind of money to throw around - it would have been a significant portion of my net worth."
By 2009, Mr. Smith earned $500,000 a year but his doubts were growing. In the book, Mr. Smith recalls trying to referee disputes between associates over bonuses, only to watch partners frequently decide based on who they liked more.
"Goldman Sachs teamwork had gone out the window," Mr. Smith writes.
By 2011, Mr. Smith was writing his cri de coeur on airplanes, in hotel rooms, and late at night, distilling in writing "many of the things that were poisoning the institution I loved."
A colleague warns him against publishing it, but Mr. Smith writes, "the moral benefits outweighed the risks. I felt incredibly strongly about this." On the Saturday night before the piece's publication, Mr. Smith ventured into the office to clean out his desk, pausing for a few bites of a McDonald's Filet-O-Fish.
After a few hours, Mr. Smith departed into the London night, with a backpack and a small box that contained a "decade's worth of memories."
"Goldman would later tell me they had surveillance video of me walking out the front lobby with my box and backpack. They thought I had larceny in my heart, when all I had was freedom."

Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collage-like paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur  la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velzquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help but be overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, ber-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Toms Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (through Nov. 4) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met this summer, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and MUSEUM: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (through Nov. 5) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine God-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Fireflies on the Water' (through Oct. 28) The museum's retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has closed but visitors can still view this 2002 installation, which depicts a seemingly endless space. It's a carefully constructed environment of lights, mirrors and water in which viewers can transcend their very sense of self. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art -- A Film Environment' (through Oct. 28) Projected on three adjoining screens, ''Light Space Art'' floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Signs & Symbols' (through Oct. 28) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney's permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess.

&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed.

Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe: 'Stray Light Grey' (through Oct. 27) Your journey through this immersive installation begins in a janitor's closet. From there you pass through a grungy bathroom, an abandoned Off Track Betting parlor, a plastic surgeon's office and a store stocked with nutritional supplements like ''DNA Recalibrator.'' Finally you emerge into a library displaying fake books with titles like ''The Decorated Slave State'' and ''Fun With Your Interneurons.'' You may wish you could see the unmade movie for which all this would make an excellent set. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Johnson)
Robert Adams: 'On Any Given Day in Spring and Light Balances' (through Nov. 3) Two new series of landscape photographs attest to the almost classical lucidity of this esteemed American photographer's work, his passion for nature and his impeccable printing technique. Spare, calligraphic images record the movements of flocks of shorebirds, known as brant, at high tide, while lushly dappled views of Edenic forests demonstrate that few subjects catch the play of light and shadow so basic to photography as richly as leaves and trees. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarksgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire': 'Encounters with the African Archive, Part I: Santu Mofokeng and A.M. Duggan-Cronin' (through Nov. 17) Born in Ireland in 1874, Alfred Martin Duggan-Cronin photographed in South Africa until his death in 1954, creating a multivolume book -- a record of indigenous peoples and of ways of life that he feared were disappearing. In 1997, Santu Mofokeng, born in Johannesburg in 1956, completed a book-length compilation of urban African studio portraits dating to the colonial era. The Duggan-Cronin photographs, seen in mounted pages from his books in this show, perpetuate an old view of Africans as being, by definition, rural, tradition-bound, on the verge of extinction. The studio portraits gathered in Mr. Mofokeng's archive present Africans as they chose to see themselves, as global citizens with modern histories.

Gelitin: 'The Fall Show' (through Nov. 13) In a sardonic jibe at our money-crazed times and the preciousness of the art object, the congenitally disruptive Austrian collective exhibits 17 assemblage sculptures on rigged pedestals that send the works crashing to the floor with the press of a lever. Whether participating viewers are completing or destroying the art is an interesting question, but the resulting mayhem is definitely disconcerting.

&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Timeline: Work in Public Space' (through Nov. 3) Running concurrently with his installation at Gladstone Gallery, Thomas Hirschhorn's ''Timeline: Work in Public Space'' is a dense collage of text and photos that guides you through Mr. Hirschhorn's public artworks. (It's a prelude to his ''Gramsci Monument,'' a Dia project in the Bronx that's slated for summer 2013.) The jumble of texts, photographs and diagrams looks provisional, which suits the unfinished space and, more important, Mr. Hirschhorn's ideas about public art (a term he likes to disparage, saying, ''Art is public''). Dia:Chelsea, 541 West 22nd Street; (212) 989-5566, diaart.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Ralph Humphrey (through Oct. 27) With rich, soft colors, abrasive, stucco-like surfaces and boxy, built-out forms, the painter Ralph Humphrey (1932-90) put his own idiosyncratic spin on longstanding formalist concerns. He pit the retinal against the physical and pushed the modernist monochrome toward representation with results at once comic and subtly elegiac. This survey of works form the 1970s and '80s should encourage a museum show. Gary Snyder Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-1351, garysnyderart.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Jesper Just: 'This Nameless Spectacle' (through Oct. 27) Grand mal, la petit mort or divine revelation? The question lingers in the wake of Mr. Just's astounding, 13-minute video ''This Nameless Spectacle.'' On opposite walls, two extremely wide-screen projections follow the peregrinations of a woman rolling herself along in a wheelchair in Paris followed by a young man who might be a stalker and might be an incarnation of the demigod Eros. The climax resembles a scene from David Lynch's ''Inland Empire.'' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Johnson)
'We the People' (through Nov. 9) Timed to coincide with the final weeks of the presidential election, this enervating exhibition of works by 68 artists extols American democracy. It includes patriotic posters by Norman Rockwell and LeRoy Neiman, but the overall drift is, unsurprisingly, to the left. There are paintings by Alice Neel, Nicole Eisenman and, most prominently, a billboard-size portrait of Mitt Romney by Richard Phillips. Sculptors include Duane Hanson, creator of a startling super-realistic portrait of a scruffy youth titled ''High School Student.''

Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chlo Sevigny.

&#x2605; Tony Conrad: 'Doing the City: Urban Community Interventions' (through Nov. 3) Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity, and it's about time. His multifold career -- as experimental film and video maker, composer, musician and sound artist -- still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began. This show includes haunting 1969 sound pieces, and films and videos made in the past and finished in the present. 80WSE Gallery, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benot Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benot Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was.

Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outr realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; and the Tracey/Barry Gallery at Fales Library in Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 998-2596, nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales.

Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks across the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, West 59th Street and Broadway. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)

&#x2605; Robert Adams: 'The Place We Live, A Retrospective Selection of Photographs' (through Oct. 28) A prophet in the wilderness of modernity, the photographer Robert Adams has devoted almost five decades to decrying what fecklessly industrious humans have done to the landscape of the American West. This splendid retrospective show of more than 250 prints dating from the late 1960s to 2009 surveys an oeuvre that is as compelling for its understated metaphorical resonance as for its moral ferocity. Yale University Art Gallery, 111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best.

'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984.

'Light and Landscape' (through Nov. 11) Temporary exhibitions at this bucolic art park have not been notably cutting edge, but this show of Postmodernist sculptures relating to light organized by the center's new associate curator, Nora Lawrence, may signal a promising change in the program. It includes indoor works by Roni Horn, Alyson Shotz and Diana Thater and elaborate outdoor constructions by Spencer Finch and William Lamson. Most surprising is Peter Coffin's ''Untitled (Sunshine),'' which consists of four loud speakers attached to a tall pole on a grassy hill broadcasting sunny keyboard melodies composed and performed by the jazz musician Bob James. Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormkingartcenter.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; National Museum of African Art: 'African Cosmos: Stellar Arts' (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It's also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection.

Last Chance
Bowdoin College Museum of Art: 'William Wegman: Hello Nature' (closes on Sunday) As its title implies, this beguiling show surveys the erstwhile Conceptual pioneer's lifelong attachment to nature, especially as evidenced in his characteristically witty, offhand works of the past two decades. Included are drawings, collages, photographs and altered photographs, as well as photographs and a 25-minute movie featuring his signature, endlessly cooperative Weimaraners. Also on hand are numerous examples of his efforts in painting, which he took up again in 1985, made with and without postcards. Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 9400 College Station, Brunswick, Me., (207) 725-3275, bowdoin.edu/art-museum. (Smith)
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Concordia Concordia' (closes on Saturday) In his latest show in Chelsea the Swiss installation artist Thomas Hirschhorn serves up a spectacle from recent headlines: the wreck in January of the Costa Concordia cruise ship along the Italian coastline, which killed 32 people. A few small touches connect ''Concordia, Concordia'' to Mr. Hirschhorn's earlier walk-in, agitprop-laced installations: a print of Gricault's ''Raft of the Medusa,'' scattered pages from ''Das Kapital'' and flat-screen televisions playing video of news broadcasts about the disaster. But these critical interventions are fairly subtle; over all, the installation looks less like a work by Mr. Hirschhorn than like a set from the inevitable Concordia movie. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Kindergarten' (closes on Saturday) This edifying show, which complements the early galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's ''Century of the Child'' exhibition, explores the playful exercises in abstraction that used to be de rigeur for children younger than 7. Devised by the 19th-century German educator Friedrich Froebel, these early explorations of color, shape and pattern -- called Froebel Gifts -- influenced many a grown-up modernist. Paul Klee, Le Corbusier and Josef Albers were all kindergartners. Ricco Maresca Gallery, 29 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4819, riccomaresca.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Elad Lassry: 'Untitled (Presence)' (closes on Saturday) In his seductive and thought-provoking solo at the Kitchen, Mr. Lassry nudges photography ever closer to time-based mediums like film and dance. Some of his ideas go back to the Bauhaus and to photographic pioneers like Muybridge, but Mr. Lassry's strong personal aesthetic keeps things in the moment. The show, which was accompanied by performances in September, transforms the gallery into a layered, compressed and unmistakably photographic space with wall cutouts that afford fragmentary glimpses of Mr. Lassry's photographs and photo objects. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Rosenberg)
'Monet's Garden' (closes on Sunday) From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, Claude Monet presided over his estate in Giverny, working at flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did on his paintings. The main attraction here is a living abbreviated approximation of the two major gardens that he designed and planted: one in traditional, orderly French style, the other a Japanese-inspired fantasia of water, blooming water lilies and weeping willows. It is far from the real thing, but there are moments of astounding beauty. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)
Paul Pfeiffer: 'Playroom' (closes on Saturday) In this spare exhibition of new work, his first New York solo since 2007, Paul Pfeiffer picks up right where he left off: with videos digitally edited to ''erase'' key figures and objects, and related sculpture and photographs with similarly eerie bodies in absentia. The four-minute looped video ''100 Point Game'' (presented as a 16-millimeter film) deploys footage from basketball games; it shows empty nets shuddering as the balls -- removed by Mr. Pfeiffer -- pass through. Also related to basketball, the sculpture ''Playroom'' presents a dollhouse-size version of a mirrored, fur-and-velvet-upholstered, pentagonal room in Wilt Chamberlain's Los Angeles mansion. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (closes on Sunday) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. Also on display through Jan. 6: at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; and at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Primary Sources: Artists in Residence 2011-2012' (closes on Sunday) The accent is on Africa in the Studio Museum's latest artist-in-residence showcase. Two of the three participants were born there -- Njideka Akunyili in Nigeria in 1983, Meleko Mokgosi in Botswana in 1981 -- and their experience of it is a wellspring for very different and accomplished kinds of painting. The show's third artist, Xaviera Simmons, born in New York City in 1974, plays audacious photographic games with the African in African-American, and proves herself once again, as she has in the past, a thinker's artist. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Andra Ursuta: 'Magical Terrorism' (closes on Sunday) This Romanian-born New York artist's second solo show is another rambunctious, haunted affair, this one framed in two acts of possible terrorism: the gallery's shattered front windows and its crumpled back wall, seemingly rammed by an ancient cart opulently encrusted in silver foam. In between marble figures and -- especially striking -- several cast metal African-esque torsos are decked out in elaborate coin chokers; this grouping conjures conflicting systems of belief, economics and display, as well as a world whose center is not holding. Ramiken Crucible, 389 Grand Street, at Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (917) 434-4245, ramikencrucible.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guido van der Werve: 'Nummer veertien, home' (closes on Saturday) This Dutch artist's latest -- and 14th -- feat of poetic, often musically accompanied (filmed) endurance art involved running, swimming and bicycling from Warsaw to Paris to deliver Polish soil to Frdric Chopin's grave. The act is accomplished to the strains of a requiem mass composed by Mr. van der Werve and performed by various orchestras and choirs along the route. The music and landscape vistas account for possibly too much of the effect, but the artist's stoic, self-abnegating devotion has its own power. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com. (Smith)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CANDID: THE LENS AND LIFE OF HOMAI VYARAWALLA': (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. (Above, Vyarawalla's image of a fox hunt in Delhi in the early 1940s.) This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas K. Gandhi's funeral
important events in the tenure of the charismatic prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru
and visits from Nikita S. Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Vyarawalla was a pioneer
 in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Holland Cotter) (PHOTOGRAPH BY ALKAZI COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHY)

HEADLINE: The Game Is All-Consuming, at Least Until the Outside World Intrudes

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
The child chess champions in the irresistible documentary ''Brooklyn Castle'' don't take long, as one of these sweetpeas likes to say, to crush you. Year after year, these big brains and little bodies at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg win chess tournaments, and their winning streak continues on screen. They are a remarkable, funny, inspiring, at times devastating group. Through the eyes of the director Katie Dellamaggiore, you come to know these children, their teachers and parents as you witness their pulse-quickening matches and tears splashed on the family dining-room table. There's smiling uplift here, but the road is seldom easy and sometimes brutal. 
Rochelle Ballantyne dreams of being the first female African-American chess master; Alexis Paredes hopes to be a lawyer or doctor so he can ease the burdens of his immigrant parents. The dreadlocked newcomer, Justus Williams, might be a chess genius; Patrick Johnston, who has attention issues, just wants to raise his ranking. Pobo Efekoro helps his mother with her day care business. He doesn't mind pushing around a vacuum cleaner for her; she's trying hard, he says, and, well, his father is dead. By the end of the movie, Pobo is writing a letter to politicians about budget cuts, reminding them of their ''moral responsibility'' and well on his way from easygoing child to bright light and civic-minded citizen.
''Brooklyn Castle'' is partly about the why and how these children became conquerors, but its reach is higher because it looks at pedagogy, politics and their intersection. As Pobo suggests, that means it's also about moral choices. Providentially for her narrative if not the school, Ms. Dellamaggiore -- who produced ''Brooklyn Castle'' with her husband-editor, Nelson Dellamaggiore, and her brother-cinematographer, Brian Schulz -- began shooting after the 2008 economic downturn. (Nothing makes for documentary drama like a budget cut that might wipe out the subject of your project.) Bluntly put, to watch a child worry that his school's marching band and chess program will be cut is to witness the further collapse of a dream far bigger than he is: that of quality public education as a democratic ideal.
The filmmakers open their story gently, though, with mood- and stage-setting scenes mixed in with talking-head interviews. At I.S. 318, ''The geeks, they are the athletes,'' beams the principal, Fred Rubino, a big man with a broad smile. The chess program was started in 1991 by another principal, Alan Fierstein. By 2006-07, Elizabeth Spiegel, a chess coach and one of the movie's heroes, was teaching at I.S. 318 full time. (She is ranked an expert.) Pale, reedy, determined, with rotating long and short hairstyles that speak to the multiyear shoot, Ms. Spiegel (in the movie, she is Ms. Vicary; she has since married), is a paragon of public-school virtue. Another advocate is an assistant principal, John Galvin, who has absorbed the game's lessons into his teaching philosophy.
The faces of these teachers at times mirror those of their students, who can wear their burdens heavily, with worried eyes and anxious jittering. Being gifted and going from opening move to checkmate in between homework and chores isn't easy. The children in ''Brooklyn Castle'' go up against intense pressures: They burn and tremble to win and watching them lose is hard, but they also cope with external burdens like parents and poverty, demanding teachers, uncertain futures and budget woes. They keep going day after week, month after year, urged on by teachers who expect greatness from them and who are rewarded with students whose time before a chessboard brings them trophies, scholarships and cognitive skills. The school is featured in Paul Tough's new book, ''How Children Succeed.''
''Brooklyn Castle'' is itself an argument about how children succeed, but it is also unabashedly and somewhat overexcitedly a feature-length mash note to its young subjects. Yet why not? It's deeply satisfying watching these public school, hard-knock kids win, and Ms. Dellamaggiore knows it. They struggle, these children, and their struggling reaches its climax in tournaments that are at once dramatic and nicely cinematic, as illustrated by the many wide shots of rows upon rows of boys and girls hunched over boards in cavernous hotel rooms. Will they win? You know it. Read it and weep: In April, after the documentary wrapped, I.S. 318 became the first middle school team to win the United States Chess Federation's national high school championship.
''Brooklyn Castle'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The rating is for language, and is absurd.
Brooklyn Castle
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Advanced Micro Devices Posts a Loss and Plans Layoffs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Advanced Micro Devices said on Thursday that it would cut its work force of nearly 12,000 by 15 percent, its second round of layoffs in less than a year, as it struggles with a weak global economy and a consumer shift toward tablets. 
The company's chief executive, Rory Read, said he did not expect the personal computer industry to improve for several quarters.
A.M.D., which is a distant No. 2 to the top chip maker, Intel, said in a statement that it expected its restructuring actions to result in savings of $190 million next year. It expects to record a restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of about $80 million.
''It'll bring earnings up, I guess, but you still have to ask how disruptive this will be and what roles are they cutting,'' said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ''The market is not going their way, and they're not in a strong position.''
Last week, A.M.D. warned that its third-quarter revenue fell more than it had previously expected and that gross margins suffered from a $100 million write-down because of lower future growth of some products.
A.M.D. posted a net loss of $157 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a profit of $97 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $1.27 billion from $1.69 billion.
Mr. Read took over at A.M.D. last year promising to fix long-standing execution problems that have plagued the company. But A.M.D. has continued to lose money as well as market share to Intel and the graphic chip rival Nvidia.
''The trends we knew would reshape the industry are happening at a much faster pace than we anticipated,'' Mr. Read told analysts in a conference call.
Looking for markets with faster growth than personal computers, A.M.D. said it planned to increase its focus on selling chips for communications, industrial and gaming applications. Mr. Read said those areas would grow to account for 20 percent of quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of next year, compared with 5 percent now.
Like Intel, A.M.D., which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple's iPad.
A.M.D. and Intel have been slow to adapt their computer chip designs to mobile. But while Intel has poured its huge resources into efforts to catch up to smartphone chip makers like Qualcomm, A.M.D. has yet to define a clear mobile strategy.
Shares of A.M.D. closed at $2.62., down 5.4 percent, before it announced its results.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Senate Rivals Spar Over Women's Issues and Jobs in Their Final Debate

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
HARTFORD -- Linda E. McMahon and Christopher S. Murphy clashed on women's issues and jobs Thursday in their fourth and final debate in Connecticut's hotly contested Senate race.
Mr. Murphy, a Democratic three-term congressman, tried repeatedly to put Ms. McMahon, the Republican, on the defensive on issues concerning women. He noted his strong support from women's organizations, Ms. McMahon's opposition to requiring that employer-provided health insurance cover contraceptive services, and the national Republican support for overturning Roe v. Wade. And Mr. Murphy, 39, tried to link her election to the possibility that Ms. McMahon, 64, could become the 51st Senate vote for a Republican agenda antithetical to the values of Connecticut voters.
''Today, unfortunately, the Republican Party has really become radicalized,'' he said. ''It has become a shadow of what it once was, and I don't think they have Connecticut's interests at heart.'' 
Ms. McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, insisted that she was an independent thinker who favored allowing women to choose abortion. In her closing statement, she made her own appeal to female voters while emphasizing her background in business, saying it was time to send to Washington people who understood job creation rather than career politicians.
''My opponent's chief ambition is to hold public office,'' she said. ''Mine is to make sure our kids and grandkids have a better opportunity than we did. So I'm asking you to make history in November and not send another career politician to Washington, but to send the first woman from Connecticut to serve in the United States Senate.''
The debate, which broke little new ground as both candidates largely recycled talking points from previous debates, ended a phase of the campaign. Mr. Murphy has been gaining a bit of momentum in a tight race that had earlier been dominated by Ms. McMahon's aggressive campaign and expensive television ads.
A University of Connecticut/Hartford Courant poll released on Thursday showed Mr. Murphy with 44 percent of likely voters and Ms. McMahon with 38 percent, with 17 percent undecided in the race to succeed Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who is retiring. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points. The results indicated that the race was still up for grabs, as Ms. McMahon continues to dominate the airwaves with advertising.
In a race often focused on female voters, Mr. Murphy has been helped by support from women, who favored him in the poll by 50 percent to 32 percent for Ms. McMahon.
''When we polled on this race last month, there wasn't much of a gender gap,'' the university's poll director, Jennifer Necci Dineen, said. ''The campaigns have included more of a focus on issues that are typically important to women voters, though, and that seems to be helping Murphy.''
In perhaps the debate's most distinctive moment, Mr. Murphy tried to jump on a remark by Ms. McMahon after she declined to address specifics on her plans for Social Security. In remarks to a Tea Party group, she had talked about her support for sunset provisions for programs including Social Security, meaning that they would periodically be reviewed and reconsidered.
In the debate, she said senators should put options on the table in a bipartisan way, but added: ''I've not talked about specifics when I've been on the campaign trail because they get demagogued.'' After the debate, she blamed reporters for an environment not conducive for reforming programs like Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Murphy responded: ''She says she's going to get demagogued. Well, maybe that's a different way of saying you're going to lose votes. Well, you might lose votes when you take a position, but that's our responsibility as candidates, to tell folks what we would do.''
Ms. McMahon, as she did in the other debates, returned time and again to her jobs plan, accusing Mr. Murphy of not having one. She argued that jobs and her experience in providing them trumped all the other issues.
''Congressman Murphy has never created any jobs,'' she said. ''He's not been part of the private market. He's a career politician, and we don't need to send the same people to Washington that made this mess and expect them to fix it.''
Linking jobs and the economy to women's issues, she said that as important as social and health issues were, what women really cared about were jobs.
''More of them have lost jobs; more of them are in poverty,'' she said, adding, ''The thing that is going to give them the greatest comfort is to know that our economy is going to be sound again.''
And in a rare effort to inject a bit of amity into what has been a brutal race, the candidates were asked by a panelist to say something nice about each other.
Mr. Murphy, who answered first, said Ms. McMahon was clearly ''a very driven person'' who had shown she could accomplish something when she set her mind to it. He added that she had contributed to Connecticut charities and had done some good things for people in the state. ''I give her credit for both of those,'' he said.
Given her chance, Ms. McMahon said: ''I think one of the nicest things I've seen about Congressman Murphy are his two little boys. They are so cute.''
Mr. Murphy said his wife deserved most of the credit, but he seemed to be waiting for some nice words about him. ''For the record, I think Linda McMahon said nice things about my little boys,'' he said.

&#x2605; American Ballet Theater (Friday and Saturday) The real event of Ballet Theater's tantalizingly brief fall season is the new work by its artist in residence Alexei Ratmansky. Set to ''Symphony No. 9'' by Shostakovich, it will be the first part of a full evening of work that Mr. Ratmansky will choreograph to music by this composer, due to have its premiere during the company's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House. No further clues have been given, but any new piece by Mr. Ratmansky is an occasion, and he has already shown a particular affinity with Shostakovich's music in his delightful ''Bright Stream.'' The rest of the season includes a celebration of the 70th anniversary of ''Rodeo'' (I suppose we must); Mark Morris's ''Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes'' (enjoyable); a revival of Jos Limn's ''Moor's Pavane'' (worthy); Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading'' (depends on the cast); Twyla Tharp's ''In the Upper Room'' (dependably exhilarating). Ballet Theater is all about the dancing and the glorious dancers, which this season includes the heartthrob La Scala principal Roberto Bolle; on that front any program will offer rewards in plenty. 
Friday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $20 to $145. (Roslyn Sulcas)
Aspen Santa Fe Ballet (Friday through Sunday) This small company has made a name for itself as an adventurous repository of contemporary ballet choreography; not an easy position to take up in an economic climate that pressurizes ballet troupes to rely on box office favorites. For its New York season, the company brings no fewer than three newly commissioned works -- from Norbert de la Cruz, Alejandro Cerrudo and Jorma Elo. Mr. Elo is the only well-known name on this program, but that's all to the good; the ballet world waits with bated breath for new talent. Who knows? Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Sulcas)
Ballet Next (Tuesday through Thursday; through Oct. 28) This company, founded by Michele Wiles and Charles Askegard, former principal dancers with American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, has its first weeklong run at the Joyce. The choreography -- by Margo Sappington, Mauro Bigonzetti, Alison Cook Beatty and Mr. Askegard, presented on two programs -- might prove less interesting than the stellar guest artists dancing it: Karina Gonzalez of Houston Ballet, Carla Korbes of Pacific Northwest Ballet and Jason Reilly of Stuttgart Ballet. Ms. Wiles, Mr. Askegard and the City Ballet dancers Georgina Pazcoguin and Ana Sophia Scheller will also perform. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Siobhan Burke)
Monica Bill Barnes & Company (Saturday and Sunday) Ira Glass, host of the popular public radio program ''This American Life,'' has become something of an unofficial spokesman for Ms. Barnes since first seeing her witty, charismatic troupe last year. Having invited them to perform on ''This American Life Live!'' in May, he joins the dancers again, introducing their show at the Skirball Center and leading a post-performance discussion. The concert includes the New York premiere of ''Luster'' and Ms. Barnes's signature piece, ''I feel like,'' a slapstick duet fueled by James Brown. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, skirballcenter.nyu.edu. (Burke )
&#x2605; Big Dance Theater (Thursday through Nov. 10) This company's loyal following, combined with the intimate setup of ''Ich, Krbisgeist'' -- performed in the Chocolate Factory's basement for just 30 people a show -- means that tickets will be hard to come by. But try to get one anyway. The directors, Paul Lazar and Annie-B Parson, never fail to fascinate with their seamless integrations of movement, text, video, song and scenic design. In this new project, co-presented with Performance Space 122, they join forces with the writer Sibyl Kempson, whose ''old tyme agricultural revenge play for Hallowe'en,'' as the news release describes it, is delivered in an entirely invented language. At 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-7069, chocolatefactorytheater.org; sold out. (Burke)
Sunhwa Chung / Ko-Ryo Dance Theater (Friday and Saturday) The Korean choreographer Sunhwa Chung presents an autobiographical piece, ''Arirang -- We Go Beyond the Crossroad,'' reflecting on her departure from her native country and life in another culture. Blending traditional Korean dance with contemporary forms, the piece offers live musical accompaniment by the Korean traditional drummer Vonggu Pak and the violinist Sarang West. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $12 in advance, $17 day of performance; $14 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
Fridays at Noon (Friday) If you want to see Ballet Next but can't make it to the Joyce, here's one solution: the company's co-founders, Charles Askegard and Michele Wiles, present a few works from their coming Joyce season as part of this free, informal series at the 92nd Street Y. As former members of New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater, Mr. Askegard and Ms. Wiles have connections to some excellent dancers; here they'll be joined by Jennie Somogyi, Misty Copeland and Georgina Pazcoguin on a program that includes Margo Sappington's ''Entwined,'' Mauro Bigonzetti's ''Follia'' and Mr. Askegard's ''Stravinsky Divertimento.'' At noon, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; free. (Burke)
&#x2605; David Gordon (Thursday through Oct. 27) In 1972 Mr. Gordon created ''The Matter,'' based on a scrambled series of Eadweard Muybridge photographs, which translated choreographically into an enigmatic sequence of incongruent poses. As part of Danspace Project's Judson Now series, honoring the 50th anniversary of Judson Dance Theater, Mr. Gordon, one of its founding members, revisits the classic work in a new production, ''The Matter/2012: Art and Archive.'' The cast of more than 30 dancers includes students from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, members of Mr. Gordon's Pick Up Performance Company, and his inimitable muse and life partner, Valda Setterfield. At 7 and 9 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
Akram Khan (Tuesday and Wednesday) Lincoln Center's White Light Festival, while focused primarily on the spiritual dimensions of music, offers several dance productions this year, including ''Vertical Road'' by the British choreographer Akram Khan. Through his quicksilver, kathak-infused movement, Mr. Khan asks, ''What it might mean to be connected not just spiritually, but also vertically,'' drawing inspiration from the poetry of Rumi. At 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org; $45 to $90. (Burke)
L.A. Dance Project (Thursday through Oct. 28) Benjamin Millepied, of ''Black Swan'' fame, has turned his focus away from the silver screen and toward this smaller but nevertheless ambitious project. His new six-member company makes its East Coast debut at Peak Performances with ''Moving Parts,'' Mr. Millepied's latest collaboration with the composer Nico Muhly, and pieces by two giants of 20th-century contemporary dance: Merce Cunningham's turbulent ''Winterbranch,'' a rarely seen work from 1964, and William Forsythe's ''Quintett'' (1993), danced to the looping, melancholic refrain of Gavin Bryers's score. At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $15. (Burke)
Movement Research at the Judson Church (Monday) A few months ago it looked as if this forum for experimentation, a longstanding Monday-night tradition in the contemporary dance world, might not continue. Happily for both artists and audiences, it returns for another season (and, let's hope, many more to come), beginning with works by Grace Courvousier, Aaron Mattocks and Gabriel Forestieri. At 8 p.m., Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 477-0351, movementresearch.org; free. (Burke)
People Get Ready / Steven Reker (Friday and Saturday) Steven Reker has performed as both a dancer and a musician, and with his band, People Get Ready, he now creates performances that are a hybrid of music, dance, pop concert and mixtape. His new ''Specific Ocean'' uses songs from a recent album. If you stay late on Friday, there's a dance party, with a D.J. and special guests. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15 to $20, or $16 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; 'Some Sweet Day' (Friday through Nov. 4) The guest curator Ralph Lemon has brought together three pairs of influential contemporary choreographers for this series at the Museum of Modern Art, revealing how their works converse across generational and geographical distances. (It also challenges them to make use of that museum's sprawling atrium.) Those artists are Steve Paxton and Jrme Bel; Dean Moss and Faustin Linyekula; and Sarah Michelson and Deborah Hay. They will all participate in discussions of their work, beginning on Saturday at 4 p.m. with Mr. Paxton and Mr. Bel. A full schedule is at moma.org. Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron Atrium, Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400; $25, $18 for seniors or $14 for students. (Siobhan Burke)
&#x2605; Tanztheater Wuppertal (Friday through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday; through Oct. 27) What is there to say about Pina Bausch's final, beautiful work, ''Como el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si...'' except, go and see it? (The unwieldy title, which means ''like moss on a stone, ah yes, yes, yes,'' is taken from a song by the Chilean singer Violeta Parra.) Full of beautiful, winding solos, it celebrates the exceptional dancing of some of the younger members of the Wuppertal ensemble, as well as the gifts of some of its older dancers, like the 62-year-old Dominique Mercy. But then Bausch's work has never ignored the full spectrum of humanity, even -- or particularly -- its less agreeable aspects. ''Como el musguito,'' which was inspired by a residency in Chile, is, like much of her later work, markedly cheerful, even optimistic. In the light of her sudden death less than three weeks after its premiere, it seems all the more moving for that. Friday and Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; sold out. (Sulcas)
Works & Process at the Guggenheim (Sunday and Monday) Nikolaj Hbbe, the Royal Danish Ballet's artistic director, has given himself the challenge of creating a modern production of ''La Bayadre'' on the occasion of that extravagant ballet's 135th anniversary. Leading up to its premiere next month in Copenhagen, the company performs excerpts from the new work, and Mr. Hbbe discusses his creative process with members of his artistic team. Sunday's show will be streamed live at ustream.tv/worksandprocess. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Monday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, guggenheim.org; $40 and $50. (Burke)

HEADLINE: Missouri Political Donor Thrives With No Limits

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, Mo. -- When the first $150,000 check showed up in his campaign account, Shane Schoeller was locked in a tight Republican primary for the unheralded office of Missouri secretary of state, battling two fellow lawmakers with virtually identical platforms.
An additional $250,000 arrived in August, after Mr. Schoeller had nearly run out of money and faced a tough general election campaign against a well-financed Democratic opponent.
Mr. Schoeller's angel is a retired investor and chess enthusiast named Rex Sinquefield, who in recent years has emerged as the biggest political donor in Missouri and one of the most prolific anywhere in the country.
Since 2008, when Missouri abolished contribution limits, Mr. Sinquefield has donated more than $20 million to local candidates and political action committees, driving the political debate on issues like education, upending the political world here and making him perhaps the most influential private citizen in the state. More than half of that money has gone to advance his signature cause: eliminating state and local income taxes in Missouri, a major source of government revenue, and replacing them with sales taxes. 
But efforts this year by a Sinquefield-backed group to abolish the state income tax by referendum stalled amid a dispute over ballot language issued by the current secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, a Democrat. Now, with Ms. Carnahan stepping down at the end of her term, Mr. Sinquefield, 68, has a chance to revive the issue and has invested heavily to help Mr. Schoeller, who as a state representative voted to eliminate Missouri's income tax, succeed her.
The no-limits giving that has let him do it might soon be coming to a campaign near you. The lawyers and activists who played a critical role in abolishing limits on contributions to independent groups -- culminating in the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision two years ago -- now hope to persuade Congress to repeal the federal caps on direct contributions to candidates, one of the last vestiges of the post-Watergate reforms.
Legal and legislative challenges to contribution limits are already proliferating at the state level and federally. This month, the Republican National Committee asked the Supreme Court to consider its lawsuit challenging limits on the combined amount an individual can give to party committees in each election cycle.
The future of unlimited giving has already come to pass in Missouri, which in 2008 became one of four states that do not limit contributions to candidates. Mr. Sinquefield's millions financed a successful 2010 initiative that banned new local income taxes and required citizens in two of Missouri's largest municipalities, St. Louis and Kansas City, to reauthorize their earnings taxes every five years. His contributions to lawmakers and political action committees have propelled efforts to end teacher tenure in Missouri and to end state oversight of St. Louis's police department.
''He has been able to change the debate,'' said Chuck Hatfield, a lawyer who helped lead a court battle several years ago to preserve Missouri's contribution limits. ''He's gotten the state to consider issues that everyone considered dead.''
Mr. Sinquefield has contributed about 40 percent of the money raised by Mr. Schoeller. Next week, Mr. Sinquefield will hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Schoeller at his home in St. Louis.
The Democratic candidate in the race, Jason Kander, raised more money than Mr. Schoeller through the beginning of September, largely from unions and trial lawyers, but no single donor has given nearly as much.
In an interview at a coffee shop here, Mr. Schoeller said he shared Mr. Sinquefield's views on the income tax. But if elected, he said, he would treat his largest donor no differently from any other constituent.
''I'm grateful for the support that Mr. Sinquefield has given to me, certainly,'' Mr. Schoeller said. ''But I think it's important to say that everybody has a voice in the way that I look at government. Because you're there to serve.''
Mr. Sinquefield declined to be interviewed for this article.
Laura Slay, his spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, ''In general, Mr. Sinquefield's contributions support initiatives that have the greatest potential for improving the lives of all Missouri families and moving our state ahead economically: education and tax reform.''
Raised in a St. Louis orphanage, Mr. Sinquefield graduated from college in the 1960s and earned a business degree at the University of Chicago, where he absorbed the free-market thinking of the university's influential economists. He helped pioneer index funds, founded a California-based money management fund and amassed a fortune whose exact size he has never disclosed.
In 2005, Mr. Sinquefield retired to Missouri to devote himself to political and philanthropic causes. At the time, Missouri still had contribution limits as low as a few hundred dollars for some offices. To get around them, Mr. Sinquefield formed more than 100 political action committees, allowing him to legally evade the limits by directing multiple smaller contributions through many different PACs. He also founded a St. Louis-based, libertarian-leaning research organization, the Show-Me Institute, and deployed a phalanx of lawyers and lobbyists, known in political circles as ''Rex's World.''
Missouri abolished contribution limits in 2008 after a lengthy legislative and legal battle, and Mr. Sinquefield and his wife, Jeanne Sinquefield, along with a few other wealthy families, began giving large checks directly to candidates. Through the beginning of September, Mr. Sinquefield had given a total of $335,000 to the re-election campaign of Chris Koster, the state's Democratic attorney general, for example, and in June he gave $385,000 -- the largest contribution to a candidate in Missouri history -- to a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. This month, he gave $100,000 to the campaign of the speaker of the Missouri House.
Recent years have also seen an explosion in ballot initiatives in the state, as gridlock in the Capitol -- Republicans hold wide majorities in both houses of the Legislature and a popular Democrat is governor -- made it difficult to move major legislation. In 2004, Missourians submitted 17 referendums for approval by the secretary of state. This year, that figure is 143. Mr. Sinquefield's lawyer submitted 22 of them, all variations on proposals to swap income taxes for sales taxes.
Legal challenges have grown at the same pace, as opponents and supporters battle over the 100-word summaries drafted by the secretary of state's office to appear on petitions.
Mr. Schoeller and his opponent, Mr. Kander, a lawyer and former Army intelligence officer, both say they want to ensure integrity in the ballot-writing process. Mr. Schoeller has proposed allowing a bipartisan committee, appointed by legislative leaders that could rewrite ballot initiatives if the secretary of state's language is challenged. Mr. Kander opposes the measure, saying that it was the duty of the secretary of state to handle the task.
Mr. Kander met Mr. Sinquefield for lunch in August, a meeting that Mr. Kander requested ''in order to build a relationship of respect,'' as Travis Brown, Mr. Sinquefield's lobbyist, described it an e-mail.
In an interview in his campaign office, Mr. Kander said Mr. Sinquefield ''seemed like a nice man.'' But Mr. Kander suggested that voters be wary of Mr. Sinquefield's contributions to his opponent.
''Any time that someone who is one of the biggest customers of an office is bankrolling a candidate for that office,'' Mr. Kander said, ''Missourians should take it into consideration when they vote.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Demonstrate Labor Market Is Improving

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits spiked last week, reversing a sharp decline in the previous week but still pointing to a labor market that is slowly healing. 
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity increased in the mid-Atlantic region during October, although not enough to suggest an end to broader weakness in factory output.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose a greater-than-expected 46,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the Labor Department said.
But the department cautioned that data over the last two weeks appeared distorted by a shift in the way one state was reporting its claims figures. A four-week moving average that smooths weekly volatility fell from a month earlier, suggesting the lackluster recovery in the job market was on track.
''Things are getting better in the labor market, but only slowly,'' Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said.
The private Conference Board said on Thursday that its gauge of future economic activity rebounded in September to post its largest gain in seven months.
Separately, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index rose to 5.7 in October from minus 1.9 the month before, ending a streak of five months of negative readings that pointed to contraction.
The reading topped the expectations of analysts polled by Reuters, but details within the report gave some worrisome signals about manufacturing, which has suffered from sagging exports. Europe's debt crisis has cooled global growth, cutting into export demand.
The Philadelphia Fed report pointed to a contraction in employment at the region's factories.
It also suggested the region's factories were cutting plans for capital investments.
Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London, said that could be a sign factories are worried the government could raise taxes and cut spending next year, which would hit economic growth.

HEADLINE: Ex-Trader's Book Offers Few Details On Goldman

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
For several months, Goldman Sachs had been worried about what confidential details might come out in a memoir by Greg Smith, a former midlevel executive and trader who worked at the firm for a decade.
While the book does repeat the allegations he first described in a New York Times Op-ed page article, insiders were relieved on Thursday after seeing bootleg copies of the book as it provided few new details of the "toxic" culture that he said prompted him to quit.
Long on Mr. Smith's reminiscences of the pleasures of the job - handmade suits, sashimi at 30,000 feet, strawberries at Wimbledon - the former Goldman salesman's book does not break much new ground on illegal or questionable financial practices at the firm.
There are moments that every veteran Wall Streeter might recognize and will trouble readers - like when bankers increase their bonuses by advising clients to buy the most-profitable products and then grumble when those payouts aren't big enough. 
Or telling hedge funds how to profit as countries like Greece teetered on the edge of default, while other Goldman bankers advised their governments on "how to fix the mess."
Despite this "hypocrisy," as he terms it, "Nobody did anything about it. The bonus culture was just too entrenched. The numbers themselves militated against change."
Mr. Smith's Op-ed article, when it first came out in March the day he resigned, sparked a furor and fueled the debate about greed and excess on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs in particular, which had already been derided as a "Vampire Squid" and had faced regulatory inquiries on products linked to troubled subprime mortgages, again found itself under a media microscope.
In recent years, the firm has managed to profit even through some turmoil that felled other banks, including the 2008 financial crisis - a success some critics say is a result of ruthless tactics.
Mr. Smith attributes the shift to the ascension of Lloyd C. Blankfein, a former trader, as chief executive, as well as the changes wrought by the financial crisis on Wall Street. To him, his colleagues in London, where Mr. Smith worked before his abrupt exit, seemed less troubled by a nagging conscience than their counterparts in New York.
It was in London that Mr. Smith heard his colleagues first refer to clients as "muppets," among the most incendiary bits in his March opinion piece.
"Muppets was a word that, for me, had once evoked childhood memories of cute puppets such as Kermit the Frog. But the way it was used in the London office had nothing to do with cuteness. Being a muppet meant being an idiot, a tool, manipulated by someone else," he writes in the book.
And clients considered muppets might get a 15-minute-old price on a product, enabling Goldman traders to profit from the real-time price to the tune of more than $1 million.
When a client asks the trading desk to correct a mistake, not knowing the mistake was actually in the client's favor, he's soon called a muppet by Goldman's traders.
The memoir, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," is scheduled to be released on Monday. A spokesman for Goldman said he was "relieved" upon reading the book, which was provided to The New York Times by the firm.
Grand Central Publishing, a division of the Hachette Book Group, is reported to have offered Mr. Smith an advance of close to $1.5 million.
Goldman Sachs, for its part, has not been afraid to engage in a little hardball in the days leading up to the book's release. Goldman shared documents with Bloomberg News on Thursday detailing how months before he quit, Mr. Smith asked Goldman to double his salary to more than $1 million, and was denied a promotion.
The book does delve into his salary and bonuses over the years, including the times when Mr. Smith said he felt that he was inadequately paid for making millions for the firm.
And the book discusses some of the well-publicized fraud cases. But instead of new details about the case which prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to charge Goldman with fraud in 2010, readers learn that one of the traders at the heart of the affair, Fabrice Tourre, was "slightly goofy" and "socially awkward."
Even after the S.E.C. action that Goldman settled for $550 million, Mr. Smith finds himself pressured to sell a financial product he nicknamed Clorox, which he likens to a bologna sandwich sold as "Panino de Bologna." In a chapter called "Monstruosities," he describes how he is dismayed that endowments, philanthropies and foundations "took the bait."
Mr. Smith describes his rise at the firm from an intern all the way up to a midlevel position in London as head of the U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Born in Johannesburg, Mr. Smith makes several references in the book to his family's roots in South Africa, where his grandparents had immigrated as Jewish refugees from Lithuania.
He won a full scholarship to Stanford and after graduating in 2001 landed a spot at Goldman, where he quickly worked his way up in the organization.
He acknowledges having some naivete about the workings of Wall Street, but at other times describes how seductive the money and lavish lifestyle afforded him.
As an intern he visits Scores, a well-known New York strip club, and after "what seemed like about five minutes of dances from a few blond bombshells," Mr. Smith runs up a tab of $750. "Seven hundred and fifty dollars! I certainly didn't have that kind of money to throw around - it would have been a significant portion of my net worth."
By 2009, Mr. Smith earned $500,000 a year but his doubts were growing. In the book, Mr. Smith recalls trying to referee disputes between associates over bonuses, only to watch partners frequently decide based on who they liked more.
"Goldman Sachs teamwork had gone out the window," Mr. Smith writes.
By 2011, Mr. Smith was writing his cri de coeur on airplanes, in hotel rooms, and late at night, distilling in writing "many of the things that were poisoning the institution I loved."
A colleague warns him against publishing it, but Mr. Smith writes, "the moral benefits outweighed the risks. I felt incredibly strongly about this." On the Saturday night before the piece's publication, Mr. Smith ventured into the office to clean out his desk, pausing for a few bites of a McDonald's Filet-O-Fish.
After a few hours, Mr. Smith departed into the London night, with a backpack and a small box that contained a "decade's worth of memories."
"Goldman would later tell me they had surveillance video of me walking out the front lobby with my box and backpack. They thought I had larceny in my heart, when all I had was freedom."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As the Rest of the World Slows, Africa Accelerates

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- If you are looking for some good cheer in a pretty gloomy world, consider the growing consensus among some of the world's smartest money that the next big emerging market may be Africa.
Above all, that is great news for Africans: As we have seen across so much of Asia, economic growth has accomplished what decades of well-meaning development efforts failed to do, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. If that happens in Africa, the world will be transformed.
This case for Africa as the world's new economic tiger is made forcefully in ''The Fastest Billion: The Story Behind Africa's Economic Revolution,'' a data-packed collection of essays to be published at the end of this month and brought together under the aegis of Renaissance Capital, an investment firm with Russian roots and global ambitions. 
The consensus view among many students of the global economy is that investment decisions are about choosing, in the words of Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of the fund manager Pimco, ''the cleanest dirty shirt'': The United States faces a fiscal cliff and political gridlock, Europe is tenuously poised between years of painfully slow growth and outright collapse, and even go-go China is slowing.
By contrast, in the view of Stephen Jennings, the Renaissance chief executive, Africa is on a tear. ''It is the only region in the world where growth is accelerating,'' he said by phone from Moscow. ''If you strip out South Africa, the rest of the region is actually growing very, very quickly.''
Mr. Jennings says he believes Africa is following the path to economic development that has been trod in recent decades by countries like Brazil, China and India -- only in Africa the transformation is happening even faster.
''The chances are this will be like Asia and this will go on for the next 30 years,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''It is helpful to remember where Asia was in the early 1970s. Then, most of the wars were in Asia, the lowest G.D.P. and life expectancy were in Asia. People thought that was Asia's lot.''
We hold those same prejudices, only more deeply, when it comes to Africa, Mr. Jennings argued. But, quietly, Africa has been remaking itself.
''It is not something that we are predicting -- it is something that is happening,'' he said. ''You have this very broad-based, Asia-like process of modernization.''
Mr. Jennings, who pointed out that Kenya had halved infant mortality in five years, an improvement it took India 25 years to achieve, predicts that within a generation, Africa's place in the world will be utterly changed. By 2050, he believes Nigeria will be the most populous country in the world and the African economy will be bigger than that of the United States and Europe combined.
Mr. Jennings is not alone in predicting an African renaissance. Two years ago, McKinsey, the management consulting firm, put a savanna spin on the emerging market clich in a report titled, ''Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies .''
Foreshadowing ''The Fastest Billion,'' this report painted a picture of an Africa whose economic pulse ''has quickened,'' with gross domestic product rising 4.9 percent per year from 2000 to 2008. ''While Africa's increased economic momentum is widely recognized, less known are its sources and likely staying power,'' the McKinsey study argued. ''Our analysis suggests that Africa's long-term economic prospects are quite strong. Global businesses cannot afford to ignore the potential.''
An obvious source of Africa's new might is the surge in commodity prices, and both reports acknowledge the impact of natural resources. But they also have a shared conviction that domestic factors are at play. The predictable one is improved governance.
Less predictable is the joint celebration of Africa's excellent demographics. Not so long ago, Africa's tragedy was its children -- now that is why the global elite think Africa may be a strong bet. This is just the beginning of a revolution in our thinking about babies and the economy: The Industrial Revolution transformed children from a family's labor force to its luxury good. That is still the case; but for the national economy, babies are becoming the most precious resource of all.
Both McKinsey and Renaissance have produced hopeful documents, and for a continent that mostly gets hand-wringingly gloomy news coverage, that is a very welcome perspective. But it is worth challenging one optimistic assumption, particularly because of its wider implications.
That is the view that in Africa, economic growth and democracy will go together. Their synonymity is a comfortable belief. But in Africa, as in other emerging markets like China, Russia and even Turkey, it may not be true.
For example, Mohamed Keita, Africa advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists, argues that in countries that are cracking down on freedom of the press, like Ethiopia, economic growth deflects attention from growing authoritarianism rather than undermining it.
This is the Putin model, or the Beijing model -- forget about ephemeral concepts like free speech and pluralism in exchange for a swiftly increasing G.D.P. It is not just impoverished domestic electorates that are tempted by this siren song. Western investors and many Western governments find it equally convincing. But the emerging market lions -- and the tigers and the Siberian bears -- should ask themselves how long authoritarian growth can be sustained.

HEADLINE: Slowdown in China Appears to Have Ended, for Now

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- After months of slowing growth, the Chinese economy may finally have bottomed out. But concerns remain about whether and when it can resume the rapid expansion of recent years.
Data released Thursday from China offered some fairly positive news on economic performance in September, just as the country prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition.
Industrial output grew 9.2 percent, compared with a year earlier, and retail sales expanded 14.2 percent, the statistics office in Beijing said. Both figures beat expectations and improved on the expansions in August. 
Similarly, investment in fixed assets rose 20.5 percent in the first nine months this year from the comparable period in 2011, slightly better than analysts had expected, showing that stimulus measures announced by Beijing over the past year have gradually put a floor under the economy's deceleration.
During the July-to-September quarter as a whole, gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent, compared with a year earlier, a figure that represented the slowest pace of growth since early 2009, when the global economy was reeling from the financial crisis.
The figure was in line with expectations, and it confirmed what analysts and executives from across a wide range of sectors had been saying for much of this year: that the heady days of double-digit growth rates in China are a thing of the past and that the economy has slowed markedly this year.
Weak overseas demand for Chinese exports and government policies aimed at combating inflation and soaring property prices have combined to slow the once red-hot pace of expansion. The picture for September appeared to show that the economy, at least for now, may have stabilized, albeit at a lower level of growth.
''Clearly, concerns over continued slowdown can now be put to rest,'' Dariusz Kowalczyk, an analyst at Crdit Agricole in Hong Kong, said in a research note. The data, he added, confirm ''that growth is picking up and that China is not at risk of hard landing.''
Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said the data sent ''very positive signals'' and helped ''reinforce our view that growth will rebound visibly'' in the fourth quarter.
The performance also has ''laid a solid foundation for achieving the full-year growth target'' of 7.5 percent this year, said Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the statistics bureau, according to Reuters, in reference to the government's official target for annual growth.
Analysts said a combination of slightly improved global circumstances and local policy measures had helped end the slide in growth.
Trade statistics released last Saturday showed that Chinese exports had risen 9.9 percent in September, compared with a year earlier, much more rapidly than analysts had expected, as shipments to the United States and Southeast Asia had improved.
At the same time, stimulus measures have finally begun to bear fruit. Eager not to set off an investment binge and spike in property prices of the kind that followed a huge stimulus program after the 2008 crisis, the Chinese authorities have taken a much more measured approach to bolstering flagging growth this time.
Stimulus steps have come in the form of smaller steps, like loosened lending constraints for banks, increased approvals for infrastructure projects and two small interest rate cuts, which appear to have stopped the slowdown for now, analysts said.
In a sign that investors continued to be cautious about China's longer-term economic prospects, stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region staged a mixed response to the Chinese data Thursday. In Japan, the Nikkei 225-share index rose 2 percent, while in mainland China, the Shanghai composite index climbed 1.2 percent. The main indexes in Hong Kong and Singapore rose 0.5 percent, the Kospi in South Korea edged up 0.2 percent, and in Australia, the S.&P./ASX 200 gained 0.7 percent.
Despite signs of renewed growth in sectors like transportation, exports and tourism, many economists said that the economy was likely to accelerate only modestly in the coming quarters, and that it remained vulnerable to the fall-out from the euro zone crisis and the looming ''fiscal cliff'' of automatic tax increases and spending cuts in the United States.
Moreover, the Chinese property sector remains weak. Figures released Thursday showed that prices for new homes in 70 major cities slipped 1.3 percent in September, compared with a year earlier. Some analysts worry about the financial health of developers that overinvested amid the tide of liquidity that accompanied the 2008-9 stimulus rush.
The policy outlook also remains murky, with little clarity as to how China's coming leadership will shape the country's efforts to put its economy on a firmer economic footing.
''As it stands, the 'ups' match the 'downs,''' said Alistair Thornton, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing. ''The risks of a hard landing are narrowing by the day, but it is too early to suggest that a recovery is a given.''
Longer term, he said, there was a risk that financial markets could be disappointed by the lingering lack of clarity over China's economic policy direction. The markets will be looking for signs of policy direction and the central reforms that will be needed to rebalance the economy, he said, but ''it may take weeks if not months for things to become clearer.''

HEADLINE: Planter of the Seeds Of Mind-Expanding Conceptualism

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Anyone who wants art to be more radical, anti-market and otherwise against the establishment should hasten to the Brooklyn Museum to see ''Materializing 'Six Years': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art.'' Traditionalists who bemoan the triumph of mind over matter brought to us by Bruce Nauman, Sol LeWitt, Adrian Piper and scores of others in the mid-to-late 1960s will also profit, for they will here become better acquainted with their enemy. Today's booming market for attractive objects notwithstanding, most of the ideas, values and fantasies that animated the conceptual turn half a century ago are still in play in the more intellectually fashionable circles of the art world.
The show is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen, while it was happening, by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard. Ms. Lippard (born in 1937) is known today mainly as a feminist and leftist activist, but in the years addressed by the exhibition -- 1966 to 1973 -- she was an extraordinarily energetic participant in, and promoter of, what was then seemingly a relatively apolitical trend. 
Organized by Catherine Morris, curator of the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, and Vincent Bonin, an independent curator and writer, the exhibition is designed to reflect the chronological structure of the seminal book Ms. Lippard published in 1973 to document her involvement with the Conceptualist movement. Its lengthy, unlovely title is worth citing in full, as it reflects the dauntingly cerebral tenor of much of the art it describes: ''Six Years: The dematerialization of the art object from 1966 to 1972: a cross-reference book of information on some esthetic boundaries; consisting of a bibliography into which are inserted a fragmented text, art works, documents, interviews, and symposia, arranged chronologically and focused on so-called conceptual or information or idea art with mentions of such vaguely designated areas as minimal, anti-form, systems, earth, or process art, occurring now in the Americas, Europe, England, Australia, and Asia (with occasional political overtones), edited and annotated by Lucy R. Lippard.''
Yes, that is like a mouthful of sawdust, and a lot of what is in the show is similarly dry and technocratic. There are charts, maps, magazines, exhibition catalogs and pages of dense verbiage. Among dozens of aesthetically indifferent photographs are examples from Douglas Huebler's impossible mission to take a picture of every person in the world, and images of Vito Acconci performing his ''Following Piece,'' in which he tailed strangers on the street until they went indoors. Notebooks by Lee Lozano are filled with carefully hand-printed texts describing, for example, a performance work called ''No Title (Grass Piece),'' for which she tried to stay continuously stoned on marijuana for 30 days.
Some things are weirdly disconcerting, like Mr. Nauman's video of his hands kneading his own hairy thigh into different shapes. Some are comical. William Wegman's video ''Spit Sandwiches'' offers a close-up view into the artist's mouth as he sings a nonverbal, percussive tune. Bas Jan Ader's ''Fall I, Los Angeles'' is a 34-second film showing him tumbling off the roof of a one-story house. Generally, though, there is not a lot of hilarity to be found. And excepting a Minimalist diptych by Jo Baer, conventional painting is entirely absent. It is not a visually ingratiating show.
Oddly, there is little acknowledgment of world events. An exception is the famous poster picturing victims of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, overlaid by the text reading ''Q. And babies? A. And babies,'' which was distributed by the Art Workers Coalition in 1970. But the overall impression is of a nearly autistic, self-reflexive insularity.
Conceptualism's political import is better understood when considered against the background of the mainstream art world at the time. Abstract painting, championed by the powerfully influential critic Clement Greenberg, was ascendant, and the market for contemporary art was booming, thanks to Pop Art. Young radicals viewed the commercial gallery system as a cog in the capitalist machine that they believed responsible for the war in Vietnam. Refusing to produce goods for sale to comfortable collectors and instead making ''dematerialized'' works that sharpened and elasticized thought were construed as forms of political resistance.
This helps to explain what seems in retrospect to be the messianic nature of Ms. Lippard's involvement. Between 1969 and 1973 she organized a series of four exhibitions in four cities. This she did by traveling to each place with many of the works in a suitcase in the form of artists' instructions for realizing the pieces on site. Each show had for its title a number signifying the population of the host city. One in Seattle in 1969, for example, was called ''557,087''; ''2,972,453'' took place in Buenos Aires in 1970. She was, you could say, the Johnny Appleseed of Conceptual Art, planting germs of mind-expanding thought that would grow and flourish around the world.
In the early '70s Ms. Lippard's commitments changed in response to a pertinent question asked by some: Why were there so few female artists among the cohort she was promoting? In 1973 in Valencia, Calif., she organized her last numbered show, ''c. 7,500,'' which included Conceptual works by 26 women, including Agnes Denes, Martha Rosler and Yoko Ono. In the decade after that she devoted herself to promoting female artists of all kinds. In some ways this was a reversal of field, from a mandarin preoccupation with pure thought to a populist concern for the economic and political conditions of living people in the real world.
But as Ms. Lippard notes in an essay in the Brooklyn exhibition's excellent catalog, it was not a rejection of where she was coming from: ''Conceptual Art in the broadest sense was a kind of laboratory for innovations in the rest of the century. An unconscious international energy emerged from the raw materials of friendship, art history, interdisciplinary readings and a fervor to change the world and the ways artists related to it.'' That energy can still be felt in this richly illuminating show.
''Materializing 'Six Years': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art'' is on view through Feb. 3 at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: On These Soccer Fields, a Brief Respite from the Killing Fields

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- When Ana Aguirre stepped onto the soccer field in the main plaza here, wearing her green Mexican uniform, and scored goals against teams from Brazil and the United States, her life back in Ciudad Jurez seemed to have been vacuumed from the scene.
There were no jobless parents, no addicts, no dead friends and no young men with pistols shoved into their acid-washed jeans. There was only a celebratory noise: fans, commentators, music and the sound of the ball being kicked or teammates yelling. 
''If I was home, I'd be drinking and hanging out,'' said Ms. Aguirre, a petite 23-year-old with braces who looks no older than 16. ''I'd be taking a lot more risks.''
Here, for a little while at least, it was just soccer. That is the goal of the weeklong tournament known as the Homeless World Cup, which brings together teams from dozens of countries to compete on four-player squads, with each athlete selected according to both talent and need.
Many, if not most, of those involved have actually been homeless. And in its 10th year, the event seemed mostly at ease with its spectacle of mass marketing -- sponsors, billboards and giveaways -- draped over impoverished players smoking cigarettes after every match.
Mexico's teams, however, reflected a struggle less tied to living on the streets than to the dangers they produce. They represented the particular pain of this country in this moment: drug violence.
Organizers prioritized the issue over homelessness, so of the 16 players on the men's and women's teams, nearly half were from Ciudad Jurez, the border city where more than 10,000 people have been killed since 2006. Many of the others are like Alvaro Antonio Orellana, 22, a wiry striker from near the Guatemalan border who said that six of his friends had recently been killed.
''These are people who live in a place where there are shootouts all the time, people who have lost their brothers,'' said Heriberto Espejel, 36, the coach of the women's team. ''These are Mexicans in shock.''
Ranging in age from their teens to their mid-20s, they were chosen through a series of tryouts and interviews over the past year. Not surprisingly, in a country that both loves soccer and frequently mourns the dead from the drug war, more than 15,000 people applied.
The handful selected arrived in Mexico City about a month ago. For the first three weeks, the players lived together near Mexico's Olympic Center. In addition to practicing and playing scrimmages, they attended group therapy sessions where they swapped tragic tales and survival strategies.
Ms. Aguirre said she found more comfort than she expected. ''There are a lot of people here who have the same kinds of stories,'' she said.
Her own struggles began at an early age. She said she saw street fights when she was 8, and she saw her first gun at 14 or 15. Killings became common when she was in high school. Even when the local economy boomed, her parents never made enough to feel comfortable and her neighborhood stayed dusty and dangerous.
Then in January 2010, a housing complex in her area -- Villas de Salvarcar -- became a symbol of drug war horror: 20 drug gang gunmen rushed into a party filled with high school and college students, spraying gunfire and killing 18 people. Photographs showed the floors covered with footprints in blood.
Ms. Aguirre had planned to go. By chance, she stayed home to study, but the aftermath lingers. Like many who grow up in Mexico's most violent areas, Ms. Aguirre knew both victims and some of those accused of doing the shooting, she said.
Killer and killed, she said matter-of-factly, looking down, ''they were the people I grew up with.''
Soccer had always been an escape. She played to avoid partying. Now, with her parents out of work, she referees games to make money.
Mr. Espejel, her coach, said he had been impressed with her sense of focus, and her happiness, which he described as a sign of strength.
Indeed, on the field last week as the team's captain, she was a quick, wise, natural and generous leader. In a game against the Netherlands, she spent more time passing than shooting, though she also scored twice -- prompting her personal celebration, in which she pointed both thumbs at the name on her jersey and stuck out her tongue with pride.
She had the opportunity to make the move repeatedly, especially when her team beat the United States, 20-0.
But sports, she and her teammates acknowledged, could do only so much. They were living a life that was not their own, in a nice hotel, with expensive uniforms, restaurant food and attention from the upper tier of Mexican society. At one point, Ms. Aguirre, who had never been to Mexico City before the tournament, even found herself in the stands talking to Carlos Slim Hel, the world's richest person, whose company Telmex was a sponsor of the tournament.
''We've gotten used to this,'' said Melissa Villegas, 17, the team's goalie. She is from Ciudad Jurez, too, but at the time she was sitting in a V.I.P. area with attentive waiters, staring straight ahead at a temporary field where the Mexican men's team was beating Poland.
The next day, as Ms. Aguirre rushed a Chilean goalkeeper, she twisted her knee and collapsed with screams of agony. The instant replay showed that she had caught her foot in the turf. Her tournament was over.
Her teammates applauded her departure from the field, as did the crowd. And the Mexican women went on to win it all, beating Brazil, 6-2, in the final on Sunday.
But Ms. Aguirre, saddened and sweat-free, had to watch from the sidelines. Then she had to go home to a violent city. Participants are allowed only one year in the Homeless World Cup so more people can enjoy the well-financed experience.
Her team's victory soon faded as the soccer tournament was packed up and moved to another country. The moment when the world seemed as simple as putting the ball into the back of the net was over, and neither the final cheers nor the new friendships could hide the sorrow that followed as Ms. Aguirre hobbled back to the hotel for a final few minutes of peace.

&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Argo' (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis) 
'Atlas Shrugged, Part II' (PG-13, 1:52) He isn't the only one. The producers of this and ''Part I'' will have to work harder if they want anyone, other than Ayn Rand loyalists, to stick around for the presumptive third movie so they learn who this John Galt cat is. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Big Picture' (No rating, 1:54, in French, Serbian, Montenegrin and English) The adage, ''It's never too late to be who you might have been,'' ascribed to George Eliot, is given a cruel twist in this terrific French thriller. A loose adaptation of Douglas Kennedy's 1997 novel, it might be described as ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' for the age of Google. (Stephen Holden)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
'Dredd 3D' (R, 1:35) Alex Garland wrote and Pete Travis directed this grim, gory adaptation of the British comic series. The setting is a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else is B-movie familiar. Karl Urban stars. (Dargis)
'End of Watch' (R, 1:49) David Ayer's ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pea. (Dargis)
'Frankenweenie' (PG, 1:27) This cute and creepy animated update of the Frankenstein story, from the imagination of Tim Burton, pays tribute to monster movies of the past while honoring the commercial family-movie imperatives of the present. (A. O. Scott)
'Gayby' (No rating, 1:29) A gay man and his best gal pal decide to have a baby the old-fashioned way in Jonathan Lisecki's baggy comedy. The movie doesn't have much to say about the topics at hand: love and friendship, and how unconventional modern permutations might help rewrite the script of romance. (Rachel Saltz)
'Harvest of Empire' (No rating, 1:30, in English and Spanish) This fact-filled documentary works as a civics lesson and has a punch that comes from political advocacy. Directed by Peter Getzels and Eduardo Lpez, it has two clear missions: to combat anti-immigrant feeling and to show how migration from Latin America has been spurred by the sometimes violent intervention of the United States. (Saltz)
'Here Comes the Boom' (PG, 1:44) This is a pleasant enough comedy if you can buy the premise that Kevin James would make a credible mixed martial arts fighter. Here he's a teacher determined to raise money to save the music program, and he takes up the sport for the purses it offers. Mr. James and Henry Winkler, playing a fellow teacher, pair surprisingly well in the predictable tale. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Holy Motors' (No rating, 1:56, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)
'Hotel Transylvania' (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially ''The Little Mermaid'' with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she's 118) daughter in a hotel that's exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Genzlinger)
'The House I Live In' (No rating, 1:48) In his latest documentary, Eugene Jarecki, inspired by an African-American family employee, digs deep into the drug war and its racial and class implications. The result is a call to national conscience, and persuasively urgent. (Dargis)
'House at the End of the Street' (PG-13, 1:41) This blatant unscary rip-off of ''Psycho'' is an incoherent hybrid of the Hitchcock classic and standard teenage horror films. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (Franois Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'The Iran Job' (No rating, 1:30) Iran in 2008 isn't a place where every American would feel comfortable. But the effusive basketball player Kevin Sheppard takes to it with informal ease in this documentary, observational and authentic if not always artful. Sports fans are fed, but so are the culturally curious: most interesting and revealing are three lively Iranian women he befriends. (David DeWitt)
'Just 45 Minutes From Broadway' (No rating, 1:46) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can't turn off their performing in life, for better or worse -- though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film's crop of clichs is dispiriting, in result if not intent. (DeWitt)
'Looper' (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson's obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Middle of Nowhere' (R, 1:39) Ava DuVernay wrote and directed this plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a young woman (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who, with her husband (Omari Hardwick) serving time, has lost touch with her own self and needs. Her journey is hard, as well as politically freighted, but also more complex than it might initially seem. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'The Oranges' (R, 1:30) The best explanation for this dud that wastes the talents of Hugh Laurie, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Catherine Keener may be that its creators couldn't decide whether it should be a dangerous comic satire or a serious dramatic downer, and settled for a wishy-washy middle ground. (Holden)
'The Paperboy' (R, 1:46) In the hands of Lee Daniels (''Precious''), Pete Dexter's Southern potboiler becomes a hot mess of pulpy passion, utterly incoherent but crazily alive. With Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron in his underpants. (Scott)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'Photographic Memory' (No rating, 1:27, in English and French) How accurate is your memory as you get on in years? How much do old home movies and vintage photographs reveal about the past? Such questions go to the heart of Ross McElwee's Proustian documentary about a period of his youth spent in France. (Holden)
'Pitch Perfect' (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it's aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements -- daddy issues, boyfriend issues -- that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
'Resident Evil: Retribution' (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter -- shamelessly cribbing from ''Aliens'' -- and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Seven Psychopaths' (R, 1:49) A sporadically funny, blood-splattered comedy from the playwright turned movie director Martin McDonagh about a Los Angeles screenwriter (Colin Farrell), his writer's block and his circle of dangerous acquaintances (Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson). (Dargis)
'Sinister'' (R, 1:50) Ethan Hawke tries to class up this movie, directed by Scott Derrickson, about a true-crime writer who moves his family into the house once occupied by the same slaughtered family he's writing about. Bad things happen. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Smashed' (R, 1:20) The degree to which this story of alcoholism and recovery refuses to indulge a voyeuristic taste for the kind of sordid details exploited by reality television amounts to an unspoken declaration of principle. In lieu of self-pity, ''Smashed'' substitutes tough love. (Holden)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg) and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'Trouble With the Curve' (PG-13, 1:51) The latest of Clint Eastwood's grumpy old men is Gus Lobel, a Major League Baseball scout struggling with failing eyesight and a front office full of number-crunching ''Moneyball'' types. On a trip to North Carolina to check out a promising young slugger, Gus and his semi-estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), do some squabbling and some healing. Mickey, a big-city lawyer, also dabbles in romance with a rival (and former protg) of her dad's played by Justin Timberlake. The movie, directed by Mr. Eastwood's protg Robert Lorenz, is hokey and predictable -- the very title is a spoiler -- but it is also full of warmth, humor and wonderful performances. (Scott)
'V/H/S' (R, 1:55) Populated by drunks, louts and Grade-A molesters, this low-budget horror anthology flits from ghastly to moronic in displays of braying masculinity that can be, at least for women, a chore to listen to and a torment to watch. (Catsoulis)
'War of the Buttons' (PG-13, 1:40, in French) Christophe Barratier has set his version of this story -- about boys in a territorial war that grows increasingly fraught -- in occupied France in 1944. That inflates the stakes, but this slick movie too often rings false when it tries to compare the boys' war with the deadly serious adult one. (Saltz)
'Won't Back Down' (PG, 2:00) Two moms, Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal, team up to fight a teachers' union in the name of ''the kids.'' This exercise in educational-reform propaganda, directed by Daniel Barnz, is somewhat amusing in the way it turns the traditional strike drama on its head, but it is so strident and tone-deaf that even those who sympathize with its anti-labor views -- to say nothing of the union members who make up the cast -- may find themselves embarrassed. (Scott)
'Wuthering Heights' (No rating, 2:08) Andrea Arnold strips away the veneer of polish and romanticism to produce a wild and raw version of Emily Bront's novel of ill-starred passion. The film, the first with black actors playing Heathcliff, aims for maximum intensity, but its naturalism feels as mannered in its way as the stately decorum of older adaptations. (Scott)
Film Series
On Romantics and Outsiders: the Cinema of Yousry Nasrallah (Friday through Wednesday) With the death of the incomparable Youssef Chahine in 2008, the position of Egypt's foremost filmmaker passed in due line of succession to Yousry Nasrallah, Chahine's former assistant and screenwriter. Like Chahine, though with less melodramatic fervor, Mr. Nasrallah turns the broad strokes and high emotions of the popular Egyptian cinema to acute social observation, and the conflicts within his films, six of which will be shown in this series, embody the tensions of class, gender and religion (Mr. Nasrallah is of a Coptic Christian background) that animate his ever-evolving country. The films here range from his 1988 debut, ''Summer Thefts'' (Monday at 9 p.m. and Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.), the story of a cross-cultural friendship that ranges from the land reforms of the 1960s to the Iran-Iraq war, to the 2008 film ''The Aquarium'' (Tuesday and Wednesday at 9 p.m.). Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $10. (Dave Kehr)
Salut les jeunes! Young French Cinema (Friday through Thursday) Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, ACID is an association of French filmmakers that supports the distribution of independent films, most conspicuously through an annual program in Cannes. This selection of recent films supported by ACID includes Sophie Letourneur's 2010 debut, ''La Vie au Ranch,'' a semi-autobiographical story of a group of young women who share a Left Bank apartment (Friday at 2 and 6:50 p.m.); Armel Hostiou's ''Day,'' a 2011 film that follows three characters through a single day in Paris (Monday at 6:50 p.m.); and ''Robert Mitchum Is Dead'' (Wednesday at 6:50 p.m.), a road movie by Olivier Babinet and Fred Kihn about an agent (Oliver Gourmet) and an actor (Pablo Nicomedes) trying to make their way to a film festival in the Arctic Circle. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Radio's Star, Never Killed, May Lead the Way to New Frontiers

BYLINE: By AMANDA PETRUSICH

 BODY:
IT'S easy to think about radio as a tragically consolidated, soon-to-be-doomed medium -- to note how, in recent years, the airwaves have become overrun by barky, overcaffeinated D.J.'s playing tiny, preprogrammed playlists. But radio, thankfully, is a broad and expansive thing, and this weekend its future (and past) iterations will be on display and up for debate at the Radiovision Festival, two days of talks, panels and performances about the future of noncommercial radio, online audio and digital online media.
The festival, now in its second year, is sponsored by WFMU, a free-form, listener-supported station in Jersey City, which is beloved for its eclectic stable of shows. Benjamen Walker, the festival's programmer and the host of the WFMU show ''Too Much Information,'' has optimistic, forward-thinking notions about where radio is headed, and Radiovision's unpredictable lineup reflects those big ideas. The keynote speaker, Mark Frauenfelder, is the founding editor in chief of Make magazine and the Web site Boing Boing, and an unexpected choice for a radio-focused event. 
One panel titled ''Piracy Is the New Radio!'' (a phrase nicked from Neil Young) will feature Anna Troberg, the leader of the Swedish Pirate Party, a political group dedicated to the reformation of copyright and patent law, and Alexa Clay, an author of ''The Misfit Economy,'' a forthcoming book about how underground economies demand and support innovation.
Mr. Walker prefers to analyze piracy rather than bemoan its impact on the music industry. ''People get caught up in how it's hurting musicians -- and it's not that those issues aren't important,'' he said, ''but I want to carve out one hour where we're not having that conversation. We're having a different conversation.''
Jim Colgan of Soundcloud, an online platform that allows users to post and distribute audio, is moderating a panel called ''Radio Free Radio,'' featuring the producers Pejk Malinovski of the East Village Poetry Walk, Ellen Horne of RadioLab, and Francesca Panetta, the multimedia special projects editor at The Guardian who developed the smartphone app Hackney Hear, which uses a phone's GPS function to activate interviews, archive recordings and new poetry and music germane to a location (in this case, the Hackney borough of London).
Mr. Colgan, who previously worked as a producer at WNYC for nearly 10 years, is compelled by all the different ways radio is being redefined. He considers the democratization of audio, both online and off, a boon for curious listeners.
''The places where you can listen to audio, have a relationship with audio, are increasing exponentially,'' Mr. Colgan said. He cited the rise of podcasts as a defining pivot. ''That was a moment where we saw this whole other channel, beyond the terrestrial airwaves,'' he recalled.
Mr. Walker emphasized the social component of media consumption: the ways modern listeners will discover new forms and promote them, if they enjoy them. ''There's a shift in how we're presenting content, how we're sharing it, how we're talking about it,'' he said. ''I think it's much more about the connections.''
For now, the Radiovision Festival is dedicated to exploring those connections: between creators and consumers, between old and new formats, between how we listened yesterday and how we'll listen tomorrow.
The Radiovision Festival opens on Friday with a screening of the documentary ''Radio Unnameable'' at 7 p.m., at the Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; $5. The conference begins on Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at the Scholastic Auditorium, 557 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, SoHo, radiovision.wfmu.org; $80; $40 for students and artists.

HEADLINE: Microsoft's Profit Falls as Sales of Personal Computers Shrink

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Microsoft is on the verge of releasing Windows 8, its biggest software product in years -- and the company's lackluster financial results on Thursday underscored how badly the company needs it to succeed.
The software company, based in Redmond, Wash., said net income for its fiscal first quarter which ended Sept. 30, dropped 22 percent to $4.47 billion, or 53 cents a share, compared to $5.74 billion, or 68 cents a share, for the year-earlier period.
Revenue was $16 billion, down 8 percent from $17.37 billion a year before. Microsoft deferred the recognition of $1.36 billion in revenue in the quarter because of software upgrade offers and the sale of copies of Windows 8 before its official release. But even if that had been included in the quarter, Microsoft's revenue would have been flat. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected Microsoft to report earnings of 56 cents a share and revenue of $16.42 billion. Microsoft's shares fell more than 1 percent in after-hours trading.
The results reflected the grim market for personal computers, the technology from which Microsoft still derives much of its sales and profit in one way or another. Smartphones, tablets and other devices have been taking in more and more money that might have once been spent on PCs. The soft economy has not helped PC sales either.
Signs of the personal computer slump are everywhere. The research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments declined 8.6 percent globally in the last quarter, much worse than it had expected. Intel, the primary maker of chips that power PCs, said this week that its sales and profit fell because of weakness in the market.
Microsoft expects Windows 8 to help bolster the overall PC market, though Peter Klein, Microsoft's chief financial officer, declined in an interview Thursday to say how significant it would be. The earliest adopters of new versions of Microsoft's operating systems tend to be consumers rather than businesses, a pattern Mr. Klein said he expected to continue with Windows 8.
Microsoft said revenue from its core Windows operating system declined 33 percent to $3.24 billion,though it declined 9 percent if Microsoft had not deferred revenue related to Windows 8. Even the Microsoft division that includes its Office applications, which also tends to benefit from sales of new PCs, had a decline in revenue -- 2 percent in the quarter to $5.5 billion.
Mr. Klein also said Microsoft had strong sales to corporate customers, many of whom tend to buy software through big multiyear contracts. But Mr. Klein said the company's results suffered because of ''challenges in the PC environment,'' especially the consumer market. During the first two months of the quarter, he said, retailers cleared out PCs running older versions of Windows in anticipation of new Windows 8 machines, which they began ordering late in the quarter.
One reason Microsoft has suffered is that it has had trouble capitalizing on the growth in mobile devices. Its Windows Phone operating system has made little progress in halting the momentum of Apple's iPhone and devices running Google's Android software.
The huge success of the iPad has started to eat into sales of low-end laptops, though no one in the industry is sure by precisely how much. The planned release of Windows 8 on Oct. 26 will be Microsoft's most serious effort yet to take part in the surge in interest among consumers and businesses in tablet computers.
Microsoft has radically changed the operating system to take better advantage of touch-screen devices, though it is also aimed at more conventional PCs operated with a keyboard and mouse. With Windows 8, Microsoft is also preparing to release a tablet of its own design, called Surface, that will go on sale for a starting price of $500 on Oct. 26. (Surface will use a variation of the Windows 8 operating system called Windows RT.)
Some analysts say that they believe fears about Microsoft's deteriorating future are overblown, and that the PC market is still very large. ''People want to make it like the last PC was shipped,'' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. ''Yes, it's in decline, but it's not dead.''
Most of Microsoft's other divisions experienced declines or little growth in the quarter.
The revenue of the company's entertainment and devices division, which includes one of the company's biggest consumer hits, the Xbox 360, fell 1 percent to $1.95 billion, as the console showed further signs of age.

HEADLINE: A State Senate Race With a Lot Riding on It

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
FORT WORTH -- Under bright lights in a Tarrant County College lecture hall last week, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Democratic incumbent, and her Republican challenger, State Representative Mark Shelton, traded sharp jabs and bitter accusations. She is corrupt, Mr. Shelton alleged; he is an ideologue, Ms. Davis asserted -- before a rapt audience.
But interest in the Senate District 10 race extends far beyond the candidates' debate performances. Across the state, all eyes are on the matchup, and not only because the vote is expected to be close.
Democrats have a lot riding on the outcome. Ms. Davis, a spirited, charismatic legislator and Fort Worth lawyer, is a rising star, and party leaders are pinning their hopes on her for a future run at statewide office. That excitement would surely subside if she were unseated. 
''I can't overemphasize the significance,'' said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. ''Particularly if she's re-elected to a four-year seat, she's someone that I think would be ready to jump into a statewide candidate for governor, for U.S. Senate, lieutenant governor.''
For Republicans, electing Dr. Shelton, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and reliably conservative two-term state representative, would get them within one vote of the two-thirds majority they need to render Democrats virtually obsolete in the Senate. A bonus would be knocking Ms. Davis off the pedestal her supporters hoisted her onto at the end of the last legislative term, when her Senate filibuster over multibillion-dollar cuts to public education sent lawmakers into a special session.
Winning back the district is such a priority for Republicans ''because it's a conservative area,'' said Jordan Berry, a Republican political consultant who is not working with the Shelton campaign.
''Rick Perry won that district in 2010, and John McCain won that district in 2008,'' Mr. Berry said. ''I don't think a Democrat will be holding that seat come early January.''
The Tarrant County district provides little certainty for either candidate. Four years ago, Ms. Davis, a well-known veteran of the nonpartisan Fort Worth City Council, unseated Senator Kim Brimer, a Republican, with 49.9 percent of the vote to Mr. Brimer's 47.5 percent. Ms. Davis is running for re-election in that majority-minority district after federal courts threw out redistricting maps Republican lawmakers drew last year that would have made the district very difficult -- if not impossible -- for her to win.
But the district's voters traditionally lean right. In the last decade, no Democratic State Senate candidate has received more than 50 percent of the vote there. In the 2008 presidential election, Mr. McCain got 52 percent of the vote there, to Barack Obama's 47 percent. In the race between Ms. Davis and Mr. Brimer, there was one more factor: a Libertarian candidate who won 2.6 percent of the vote. There is no Libertarian in the race between Ms. Davis and Mr. Shelton. ''It's a presidential year in a Republican state, and she's a Democrat,'' Bill Miller, an Austin-based lobbyist, said of Ms. Davis. ''There's no wind at her back. Everything's a headwind for her.''
Even with a headwind, Ms. Davis has a great deal going for her candidacy.
She has a compelling story. She is a twice-divorced single mother who was a teenager when her first daughter was born, was the first in her family to attend college and worked her way from junior college and a Tarrant County trailer park to Harvard Law School. Her campaign has had a fund-raising head start; there was no doubt Republicans would put up a challenger, and as of early this month she had nearly three times as much cash on hand as Mr. Shelton, whom she calls ''part of the problem, part of following hook, line and sinker a very narrow, special-interest-focused agenda that isn't reflective of what families in our community want.''
Her opponent, whose story may be less striking, has had an unimpeachable career. A married father of four, Mr. Shelton works at a children's hospital treating patients with H.I.V. and other serious ailments. His campaign has painted Ms. Davis as a self-dealing lawyer who has used her political office to benefit her paying clients -- allegations that even Democratic consultants acknowledge have been troubling. (Ms. Davis calls them lies and a diversionary tactic.) Mr. Shelton said that if voters ''want someone flashy to stomp their feet, obstruct things and spend all their time in front of TV cameras, they can vote for Wendy.''
While the candidates are all too happy to spar with each other, in the district they are running campaigns of nonalienation, taking careful steps to make themselves attractive to on-the-fence voters.
Mr. Shelton is taking aim at moderate fiscal conservatives. His talking points include balancing the budget, keeping taxes low and removing obstacles to businesses so the economy will improve. On social issues, he is an entrenched Republican, but he is not making waves about his opposition to abortion or his support for voter ID while campaigning in this diverse blue-collar district. ''The biggest priorities right now are the financial ones,'' he said.
Ms. Davis, meanwhile, is revolting against the liberal brand, calling herself a ''centrist Democrat'' and saying her work with the Fort Worth business community and her openness to seeking nonpartisan solutions to community problems take her out of the traditional party framework. Her efforts on issues like school finance and women's health, which contributed to an independent analysis that portrayed her as one of the Legislature's most liberal members, would look moderate if not for the Legislature's shift to the right, she said.
''People are so weary of partisan bickering and unfair attacks and misleading characterizations,'' Ms. Davis said. ''They want us to say, Here's who I am, what I hope to do for you.''
Whether that strategy will work in November remains unknown. Bryan Eppstein, a Fort Worth-based political consultant who is working for the Shelton campaign, said his internal polling showed Mitt Romney leading President Obama by 14 points in the district. While he would not release specific numbers for the Davis-Shelton matchup, he said, ''We're ahead, and it's going to be a close race.''
Ms. Davis said her campaign would not reveal its polling numbers either but that they looked good for her candidacy. ''They reflect that my record is one that is reflective of the issues that are of concern in this district,'' she said.
And while Ms. Davis said she was squarely focused on her current race, she has also not closed the door on a statewide run, regardless of the outcome in November.
''I haven't made any decisions on that,'' she said. ''I do think there are opportunities for centrists in Texas, whether they're Democrats or Republicans.''

HEADLINE: A Rogue Climate Experiment Has Ocean Experts Outraged

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.

 BODY:
A California businessman chartered a fishing boat in July, loaded it with 100 tons of iron dust and cruised through Pacific waters off western Canada, spewing his cargo into the sea in an ecological experiment that has outraged scientists and government officials.
The entrepreneur, whose foray came to light only this week, even duped the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States into lending him ocean-monitoring buoys for the project.
Canada's environment ministry says it is investigating the experiment, which was carried out with no government or scientific oversight. A spokesman said the ministry had warned the venture in advance that its plan would violate international agreements.
Marine scientists and other experts have assailed the experiment as unscientific, irresponsible and probably in violation of those agreements, which are intended to prevent tampering with ocean ecosystems under the guise of trying to fight the effects of climate change. 
Though the environmental impact of the foray could well prove minimal, scientists said, it raises the specter of what they have long feared: rogue field experiments that might unintentionally put the environment at risk.
The entrepreneur, Russ George, calling it a ''state-of-the-art study,'' said his team scattered iron dust several hundred miles west of the islands of Haida Gwaii, in northern British Columbia, in exchange for $2.5 million from a native Canadian group.
The iron spawned the growth of enormous amounts of plankton, which Mr. George, a former fisheries and forestry worker, said might allow the project to meet one of its goals: aiding the recovery of the local salmon fishery for the native Haida.
Plankton absorbs carbon dioxide, the predominant greenhouse gas, and settles deep in the ocean when it dies, sequestering carbon. The Haida had hoped that by burying carbon, they could also sell so-called carbon offset credits to companies and make money.
Iron fertilization is contentious because it is associated with geoengineering, a set of proposed strategies for counteracting global warming through the deliberate manipulation of the environment. Many experts have argued that scientists should be researching such geoengineering techniques -- like spewing compounds into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight or using sophisticated machines to remove carbon dioxide from the air.
But tampering with the environment is risky, they say, so any experiments must be carried out responsibly and transparently, with the involvement of the scientific community and proper governance.
''Geoengineering is extremely controversial,'' said Andrew Parker, a fellow at the Belfer Center at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''There is a need to protect the environment while making sure safe and legitimate research can go ahead.''
Mark L. Wells, a marine scientist at the University of Maine, said that what Mr. George did ''could be described as ocean dumping.''
Dr. Wells said it would be difficult for Mr. George to demonstrate what impact the iron had on the plankton and called it ''extraordinarily unlikely'' that Mr. George could prove that the experiment met the goal of permanently removing some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
NOAA acknowledged that it had provided the project with 20 instrument-laden buoys that drift in the ocean for a year or more and measure water temperature, salinity and other characteristics. Such buoys are often sent out on what the agency calls ''vessels of opportunity,'' and the data they provide, uploaded to satellites, is publicly available.
But a spokesman said the agency had been ''misled'' by the group, which ''did not disclose that it was going to discharge material into the ocean.''
The nature of Mr. George's project was first reported this week in an article in The Guardian, a British newspaper, after it was revealed by the ETC Group, a watchdog group in Montreal that opposes geoengineering.
Mr. Parker, of Harvard's Kennedy School, said it appeared that the project had contravened two international agreements on geoengineering, the London Convention on the dumping of wastes at sea and a moratorium declared by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity -- as well as a set of principles developed at Oxford University on transparency, regulation and the need for public participation.
Mr. George, said that his experiment was not related to geoengineering, and that 100 tons was a negligible amount of iron compared to what naturally enters the oceans. ''This is a community trying to maintain its livelihood,'' he said of the Haida.
He said his team had collected a ''golden mountain'' of data on the plankton bloom. Mr. George, who described himself as chief scientist on the project and said he has training as a plant ecologist, refused to name any of the other scientists on the team.
Scientists who have been involved with sanctioned iron fertilization experiments strongly disputed Mr. George's assertion about the quality of his experiment, saying that it was roughly 10 times bigger than any other but that the fishing boat used and the science team were clearly insufficient.
Victor Smetacek, an oceanographer with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany who recently published an analysis of sanctioned fertilization research conducted in 2004 in the Southern Ocean, said Mr. George's project would give a black eye to legitimate research.
''This kind of behavior is disastrous,'' he said, describing Mr. George, with whom he had brief contact more than five years ago, as a ''messing around, bumbling guy.''
Mr. George, 62, of Northern California, was previously in the public eye when, as chief executive of a company called Planktos, he proposed a similar iron-fertilization project, in the equatorial Pacific west of the Galpagos Islands, whose purpose was the sale of carbon offsets. Under cap-and-trade programs in various countries, polluters can offset their emissions of greenhouse gases by buying credits from projects that store carbon or otherwise mitigate global warming.
The project was canceled in 2008 after what his company called a ''disinformation campaign'' by environmentalists and others made it impossible to attract investors.
Mr. George said that during that period he was contacted by the Old Massett Village Council, one of two Haida groups on Haida Gwaii, about ''wanting to do something about their fish,'' which had suffered population declines.
But John Disney, the council's economic development director, said he had worked with Mr. George on other projects before, including one to generate carbon credits by replacing alder forests on the islands with conifers. That project never came to fruition.
Mr. Disney defended the iron sprinkling project, saying that it had been approved by Old Massett's villagers and cleared by the council's lawyers.
He said at least seven Canadian government agencies were aware of the project. But a spokesman for Canada's environment minister said Thursday that the salmon group was twice warned in advance that its plan violated international agreements Canada had signed that would prohibit an iron-seeding project with a commercial element, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
Mr. Disney also said that the marine science community, including researchers at the Wegener Institute in Germany, had known about the project.
But Mr. Smetacek disputed that as well. ''I've had no contact with this guy on this,'' he said, referring to Mr. George.

HEADLINE: Stanford R. Ovshinsky Dies at 89, A Self-Taught Maverick in Electronics

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Stanford R. Ovshinsky, an iconoclastic, largely self-taught and commercially successful scientist who invented the nickel-metal hydride battery and contributed to the development of a host of devices, including solar energy panels, flat-panel displays and rewritable compact discs, died on Wednesday at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. He was 89.
The cause was prostate cancer, his son Harvey said.
Placing Mr. Ovshinsky in ''the league of genius inventors,'' The Economist magazine once titled an article about him ''The Edison of Our Age?'' 
If not quite that, he was certainly among the 20th century's most inventive breed of scientists who, like Edison, parlayed their ideas into practical commercial applications.
He gained particular attention for upsetting common wisdom about the nature of semiconductors. Semiconductors, which block or carry electrical current depending on the voltage to which they are exposed, typically consist of crystals in which molecules line up in ordered ranks. But in the late 1950s Mr. Ovshinsky became convinced that less regimented materials could also act as semiconductors.
He argued that products using these so-called amorphous, or disordered, materials could be much cheaper to make than those built from the workhorse compounds of the electronics industry, like silicon crystals.
His ideas drew only scorn and skepticism at first. He was an unknown inventor with unconventional ideas, a man without a college education who made his living designing automation equipment for the automobile industry in Detroit, far from the hotbeds of electronics research like Silicon Valley and Boston.
But Mr. Ovshinsky prevailed. Industry eventually credited him for the principle that small quantities or thin films of amorphous materials exposed to a charge can instantly reorganize their structures into semicrystalline forms capable of carrying significant current.
With a bit of a promotional twist, he christened the field ''ovonics.''
In 1960, he and his second wife, the former Iris L. Miroy, founded Energy Conversion Laboratories in Rochester Hills, Mich., to develop practical products from the discovery. It was renamed Energy Conversion Devices four years later.
Energy Conversion Devices and its subsidiaries, spinoff companies and licensees began translating Mr. Ovshinsky's insights into mechanical, electronic and energy devices, among them solar-powered calculators. His nickel-metal battery is used to power hybrid cars and portable electronics, among other things.
He holds patents relating to rewritable optical discs, flat-panel displays and electronic-memory technology. His thin-film solar cells are produced in sheets ''by the mile,'' as he once put it.
The Ovshinskys were champions of alternative energy and sounded early alarms about the industrial world's insatiable demand for oil, saying it could lead to resource wars and climate change. More than 50 years ago, Mr. Ovshinsky began promoting hydrogen fuel cells as an alternative to the internal-combustion engine.
In his so-called hydrogen loop, water is converted to stored hydrogen through solar-powered electrolysis, and from hydrogen back to water, generating electricity through a fuel cell. Automotive companies have begun producing hydrogen-based demonstration models.
Mr. Ovshinsky's promotional flair helped Energy Conversion Devices attract investors, including giants like Standard Oil, Texaco, Chevron, Canon, 3M, Intel and General Motors. They collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars in his ventures, some of which failed.
Mr. Ovshinsky's business maneuvers came to be considered every bit as creative and extraordinary as his inventions. Energy Conversion Devices lost money decade after decade, surviving by periodically selling control of patents, rights to royalties from them or new stock.
In 1989, when the company was completing the 29th of what would become a string of 35 years of losses, Forbes described it as ''a high-tech Roach Motel'' where ''the money goes in but it never comes out.''
Mr. Ovshinsky recruited Robert Stempel, a former chairman and chief executive of G.M., to help run the company in 1993. Mr. Stempel became chairman in 1995 and retired in 2007. (He died in 2011.)
The practical applications of his ideas never fully diverted Mr. Ovshinsky from his passion for basic materials research. He continued to help write scientific papers and cultivated relationships with luminaries like Nevill F. Mott, who won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics for explaining the underlying behavior of amorphous materials.
''His incredible curiosity and unbelievable ability to learn sets him apart,'' Hellmut T. Fritzsche, a longtime friend and consultant, said in an interview in 2005.
Mr. Fritzsche was a noted semiconductor researcher at the University of Chicago when Mr. Ovshinsky called him in 1963 to ask him to visit Energy Conversion Devices.
Mr. Fritzsche, who became a paid consultant for the company and then its vice president, said he had been impressed that Mr. Ovshinsky's first words when he arrived were: ''Let's not talk. Let me show you what I've discovered.''
Stanford Robert Ovshinsky was born on Nov. 24, 1922, in Akron, Ohio, the son of Benjamin and Bertha Munitz Ovshinsky. His father was an immigrant from Lithuania who became a scrap metal dealer. His contacts got young Stan an apprenticeship as a lathe operator with a motor manufacturer while still in high school.
When Mr. Ovshinsky's asthma excluded him from military service, he married Norma Rifkin, his childhood sweetheart, and moved to Phoenix to work in a Goodyear aircraft factory. He returned to Akron and set up his own machine and lathe manufacturing shop in 1946. His first patent was for a novel lathe design.
That design caught the attention of the New Britain Machine Company in Connecticut, and it bought his company in 1950. Mr. Ovshinsky ran the business for two years until leaving for Detroit in 1952 to become director of research at Hupp, a motor manufacturer.
He and his brother, Herbert, formed General Automation in 1955, which was renamed Ovitron in 1958. Energy Conversion Devices became a publicly traded company in 1967.
Iris Ovshinsky died in 2006. Mr. Ovshinsky later married Dr. Rosa Young. He retired from Energy Conversion in 2007 and formed Ovshinsky Innovation and Ovshinsky Solar to further his work in energy and information technologies.
This year Energy Conversion sold its battery unit, the Ovonic Battery Company, to BASF and filed for bankruptcy protection. A liquidation plan was approved in bankruptcy court in August.
Mr. Ovshinsky's survivors include his wife as well three sons from his first marriage, Benjamin, Harvey and Dale; two stepchildren from his first marriage, Dr. Robin Dibner and Steven Dibner; two stepchildren from his third marriage, Angela Goddard and Vicki Young; his brother, Herbert; and six grandchildren and step-grandchildren.
Stanford and Iris Ovshinsky's five-decade partnership in science, business and marriage brought them almost as much attention as their contributions to alternative energy.
In an interview for PBS in 2004, Mr. Ovshinsky was asked how he and his wife had managed to work so well together.
''By being in love,'' he replied.

HEADLINE: A Sad Green Story

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The period around 2003 was the golden spring of green technology. John McCain and Joe Lieberman introduced a bipartisan bill to curb global warming. I got my first ride in a Prius from a conservative foreign policy hawk who said that these new technologies were going to help us end our dependence on Middle Eastern despots. You'd go to Silicon Valley and all the venture capitalists, it seemed, were rushing into clean tech.
From that date on the story begins to get a little sadder. 
Al Gore released his movie ''An Inconvenient Truth'' in 2006. The global warming issue became associated with the highly partisan former vice president. Gore mobilized liberals, but, once he became the global warming spokesman, no Republican could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and survive. Any slim chance of building a bipartisan national consensus was gone.
Then, in 2008, Barack Obama seized upon green technology and decided to make it the centerpiece of his jobs program. During his presidential campaign he promised to create five million green tech jobs. Renewable energy has many virtues, but it is not a jobs program. Obama's stimulus package set aside $90 billion for renewable energy loans and grants, but the number of actual jobs created has been small. Articles began to appear in the press of green technology grants that were costing $2 million per job created. The program began to look like a wasteful disappointment.
Federal subsidies also created a network of green tech corporations hoping to benefit from taxpayer dollars. One of the players in this network was, again, Al Gore. As Carol Leonnig reported in The Washington Post last week, Gore left public office in 2001 worth less than $2 million. Today his wealth is estimated to be around $100 million.
Leonnig reports that 14 green tech firms that Gore invested in received or directly benefited from more than $2.5 billion in federal loans, grants and tax breaks. Suddenly, green tech looks less like a gleaming beacon of virtue and more like corporate welfare, further enriching already affluent investors.
The federal agencies invested in many winners, but they also invested in some spectacular losers, from Solyndra to the battery maker A123 Systems, which just filed for bankruptcy protection. Private investors can shake off bad investments. But when a political entity like the federal government makes a bad investment, the nasty publicity tarnishes the whole program.
The U.S. government wasn't the only one investing in renewables. Governments around the world were also doing it, and the result has been gigantic oversupply, a green tech bubble. Keith Bradsher of The Times reported earlier this month that China's biggest solar panel makers are suffering losses of up to $1 for every $3 in sales. Panel prices have fallen by three-fourths since 2008. Manufacturers will need huge subsidies far into the future -- as Bradsher writes, ''a looming financial disaster.'' The U.S. share of the global market, meanwhile, has fallen from 7 percent to 3 percent since 2008.
The biggest blow to green tech has come from the marketplace itself. Fossil fuel technology has advanced more quickly than renewables technology. People used to worry that the world would soon run out of oil, but few worry about that now. Shale gas, meanwhile, has become the current hot, revolutionary fuel of the future.
Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, Daniel Yergin projects that in 2030 the worldwide fuel mix will not be too different than what it is today. That is, there will be more solar and wind power generated, but these sources will still account for a small fraction of total supply. Fossil fuels will still be the default fuel for decades ahead.
The Financial Post in Canada recently surveyed the gloom across the clean energy sector. ''Revenues from renewable and alternative energy fell a little more than 12%'' in 2011, the paper reported. Research and development spending on renewables is set to decline next year, according to United Nations figures, while the oil and gas sector is investing a whopping $490 billion a year in exploration.
All in all, the once bright green future is looking grimmer. Green tech is decidedly less glamorous, tarnished by political and technological disappointments.
The shifting mood was certainly evident in the presidential debate this week. Global warming was off the radar. Meanwhile, President Obama and Mitt Romney competed to see who could most ardently support coal and new pipelines. Obama is running radio ads in Ohio touting his record as a coal champion.
This is not where we thought we'd be back in 2003.
Global warming is still real. Green technology is still important. Personally, I'd support a carbon tax to give it a boost. But he who lives by the subsidy dies by the subsidy. Government planners should not be betting on what technologies will develop fastest. They should certainly not be betting on individual companies.
This is a story of overreach, misjudgments and disappointment.

HEADLINE: The E.U. Goes After Gazprom

BYLINE: By JOHN VINOCUR

 BODY:
Hooray for the European Union -- in spite of a Nobel Peace Prize awarded largely on the basis of wishful thinking -- for taking an important, tough-minded step, avoided by NATO and the United States.
The bold moment came last month when the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation against Gazprom, the Russian national gas monopoly which furnishes about 25 percent of Europe's energy imports, for unfair pricing and blocking diversification of supply concerning eight E.U. members from the old Soviet bloc.
Out of character for an organization once described by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former French minister for Europe and France's former chief financial market supervisor, as dominated by a culture of connivance? I'd like to believe it matters little whether the European Union is being consecrated, even counter-instinctively, as a grand peacemaker, if it is really drawing lines that make clear where its tolerance stops and trouble for transgressors begins. 
The European pursuit of Gazprom as an energy bully has particular resonance because it comes at a time when Vladimir Putin's Russia is supplying Syria with arms and support in the U.N. Security Council, renouncing a pact with the United States providing nuclear safeguards, ordering the closure of Unicef's Russian office, and directing the U.S. Agency for International Development to halt its operations in Russia -- all without the United States taking countermeasures.
The E.U. investigation K.O.'s the argument that only born-again cold warriors regard Putin's actions as serious, strategic problems for the West (starting with a significant measure of Russian control over E.U. and European NATO members' energy supply).
The investigation contains an additional message: the European Union's willingness to challenge Putin's attempt to play off wealthy Western Europe against poorer Eastern members by offering price flexibility to France and Germany while treating a Poland, a Bulgaria, or an Estonia as if they still fell under the Brezhnev Doctrine. That was the Soviet Union's notion of its immediate neighbors' limited sovereignty, reiterated by former president Dmitri Medvedev after Russian troops entered Georgia in 2008.
Now Moscow, a new member of the World Trade Organization, has issued a decree barring ''strategic'' enterprises like Gazprom from divulging any information to foreign regulators.
A substantial irony enters here. In 2009, just weeks after Barack Obama's inauguration, American diplomats complained about the European Union bringing antitrust suits against Microsoft while ignoring Gazprom's hold over its energy supply.
Vice President Joe Biden told a European audience that NATO ''must expand the writ of energy security,'' and Hillary Clinton described aggressive Russian tactics in the European energy sector as ''a significant security challenge that we ignore at our peril.''
But NATO was never seriously pressed to pick up the ball. Kurt Volker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO at the time, said the initial American warnings about the energy squeeze involved ''smart people who were operating on auto-pilot. Then Obama's reset kicked in.''
At its extreme, that meant the United States publicly saying it would not pursue linkage in its Russian policy -- telling Putin, in effect, he could do as he pleased, with no price to pay. The E.U. Commission, all the same, has signaled that its limits have been overrun.
Sddeutsche Zeitung, a leading left-of-center voice, called the investigation a brave strike and ''the start of a battle against the power of Russia's raw materials empire.'' And the E.U.'s commissioner for energy, Gnther Oettinger, a German conservative, has branded those energy reserves ''Putin's new Red Army,'' and criticized Angela Merkel's announced retreat from atomic energy as increasing Europe's dependency on Gazprom as a supplier.
But there is an obvious, palpable conflict here between the commission's approach and Germany's cozy, largely uncritical relationship with Putin.
Example: Last week, while the chancellor's own party prepared a draft Bundestag statement on Russia that pointed to the ''great dangers'' of ''its deficit as a law-abiding state,'' the Foreign Ministry in Berlin was reported objecting to that remark and a reference to ''democracy'' as being a goal for Russia.
The weekly Die Zeit has even gone as far as saying that, while not liking Putin, Merkel runs a Russian policy that differs only in detail from that of her predecessor, Gerhard Schrder, now a Gazprom front man. The chancellor will have to determine herself if, alongside the European Union's new stance, she faces a change of mood on Germany's handling of Russia that could affect her re-election next year.
As for Barack Obama, he cannot politically manage a shift in tone on Putin's Russia with only weeks to go in the U.S. presidential campaign. But with Putin acting aggressively and unrelentingly, the president, if re-elected, could well find it necessary to speak out on the significant deterioration of Russia's sense of responsibility, and stand up with protesting Russians the next time they fill Moscow's streets.
Beyond the non sequitur of its award of a Nobel, and to its genuine credit, the European Union will have then served as a real catalyst in refocusing the president and perhaps the chancellor's vision on how far and hard Vladimir Putin can feel free to push.

HEADLINE: Both Parties See Latino Voters As the Deciders in 3 Key States

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and FERNANDA SANTOS; Adam Nagourney reported from Las Vegas, and Fernanda Santos from Denver.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Volunteers for President Obama have flooded into Latino-owned nail salons here, buttonholing potential Obama voters as they sit captive in their chairs. In Colorado, supporters of Mitt Romney are recruiting Latino owners of small businesses to reach out to other business owners whom they view as particularly receptive to the Republican economic message.
Mr. Obama and his supporters have outspent Mr. Romney and his backers nearly 2-to-1 on advertising on Spanish-language television stations in three of the most closely contested states -- Colorado, Florida and Nevada -- including a new advertisement in which Mr. Obama makes a personal appeal for support, speaking entirely in Spanish. Mr. Romney's advisers have relied on a surge of ads across the television spectrum, saying that most Hispanics speak English and consider the economy, not immigration, the top issue.
But if their strategies differ, both campaigns have determined that turning out Latinos in those three states is potentially critical. Mr. Obama is trying to roll up an outsize margin among Hispanics that could edge him to victory in those states, while Mr. Romney is seeking to hold down the president's numbers. 
''Obama understands your struggles,'' Camila Peterson, 65, said in Spanish. She spoke through a door to a family of Mexican immigrants in Longmont, Colo. ''He is one of us.''
Pauline Olvera, 46, a third-generation American working at a Romney campaign office outside Denver, said she was calling back voters who she sensed needed ''just an extra push.''
''Romney,'' Ms. Olvera said. ''I want them to tell me they're voting for Romney.''
The effort is being played out as the campaigns move from registering Hispanic supporters to the historically more difficult task of getting them to vote. A poll conducted Sept. 7 to Oct. 4 by the Pew Hispanic Center found that 77 percent of Latino registered voters said they were certain they would vote, compared with 89 percent over all.
Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, said that while Latino voters were central in a growing number of states -- including Iowa, North Carolina and Virginia -- nowhere were they more critical than in Colorado, Nevada and Florida.
The voting population of Latinos has been on a steady rise in Colorado and Nevada. In Florida, it has shifted from Cuban, a heavily Republican bloc, to include more Puerto Ricans, a group that has proved to be more Democratic in the state. The change has provided Democrats with a new pool of potential supporters.
''If you're looking at a place to get new votes, that's the place,'' Mr. Messina said.
Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, a Republican who is campaigning for Mr. Romney, said here that while Republicans face a battle cutting into Mr. Obama's lead with Latinos, Mr. Romney was catching up. ''The same things are important to Latinos as to the rest of the Americans,'' she said, adding, ''President Obama has made a lot of empty promises. They see through his rhetoric.''
Still, the challenges that Mr. Romney faces were apparent in a Las Vegas parking lot last Saturday where Ms. Martinez had just spoken to a rally of Romney volunteers. The group was almost entirely white.
In Denver, Luis A. Coln, who runs a small international trade company, has been meeting other Latino small-business owners receptive to Mr. Romney's call to cut government regulation and taxes. ''The stimulus money resulted in a lot of waste, and a lot of the jobs it created were construction jobs,'' Mr. Coln said. ''So when the construction was done, the jobs were done. We need improvement that's more than just temporary.''
These last weeks are the culmination of a strategy years in the making for Mr. Obama. It now seeks to take advantage of a backlash among many Latino voters against tough immigration measures embraced by Mr. Romney during his party's presidential primaries.
Mr. Obama's campaign and its supporters have spent $8.9 million on Spanish-language television stations in Colorado, Florida and Nevada, compared with $4.6 million by Mr. Romney, according to Kantar Media, which tracks advertising spending.
''We have been organizing on the ground,'' Mr. Messina said. ''And that is a community that is difficult to organize on the ground unless you have real support in the community.''
Mr. Romney's aides said they had put together what they described as the most extensive effort to reach Latino voters of any Republican presidential candidate.
''We care about their vote,'' said Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director, adding, ''This is the kind of election where we are going to be out there fighting for every kind of vote.''
Recent polling of Latino voters attests to the obstacles Mr. Romney faces. The Pew Hispanic Center survey found that 61 percent of respondents said that Democrats were more concerned than Republicans about Hispanic people; just 10 percent said Republicans were more concerned.
''Fifty-one percent difference,'' said Mark Hugo Lopez, the center's associate director. ''That's the largest number we have seen in our 10 years of polling.''
The poll showed Mr. Obama leading Mr. Romney among Hispanic voters nationwide 69 percent to 21 percent; in 2008, Mr. Obama took 67 percent of the Hispanic vote, to 31 percent for Senator John McCain.
In 2008, Mr. Obama pulled in strong support among Latino voters, according to exit polls: 61 percent in Colorado, 57 percent in Florida and 76 percent in Nevada. The extent of Mr. Obama's lead nationally among Hispanics suggests, analysts said, that he is doing well in those states this year as well, though it is difficult to assess the opinions of small groups of voters in a single state.
Mr. Lopez said that Mr. Obama's strong position is in no small part due to his signing of an executive order giving temporary legal status to many illegal immigrants who entered the country as children. This became clear at an Obama field office telephone bank that hummed with Spanish and English as volunteers worked through lists.
''I got involved as soon as I heard he signed the Dream Act,'' said Adriana Ortiz, 37, whose sister came to the United States illegally from Mexico as a child.
''He did something for my family,'' she added. ''I'm going to do something for him.''
Mr. Obama's biggest challenge is turnout. ''There's no chance that Republicans are going to win a majority of Mexican-Americans'' in Nevada or Colorado, said Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. ''It's just a matter of how many turn out.''
Matt A. Barreto, an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington and a founder of Latino Decisions, which polls Latino voters, said Mr. Romney continued to pay a price for the tough immigration language that marked the primary, even as he now seeks to move to the center.
''Romney has moved himself into an area where his statements on immigration are not satisfactory; before, they were offensive,'' he said. ''His new language may not alienate as many people, but it's not attracting people.''

HEADLINE: Despite a Paper Loss, Morgan Stanley Reports Improvements

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
6:08 p.m. | Updated
Morgan Stanley earnings rebounded strongly in the third quarter as skittish clients returned to doing business with the company.
For much of the year, Morgan Stanley lived under the threat of a big, three-notch rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. Ratings downgrades are bad news for any company, particularly financial institutions that depend on the confidence of their creditors and the companies they trade with.
In June, Moody's downgraded Morgan Stanley two notches to Baa1. That was not as far as some had feared, and resulted in a bump in business in the most recent quarter. 
"On a tactical front, our objective this quarter was to demonstrate a recovery from the challenging second quarter," James P. Gorman, the chairman and chief executive, said in a call with analysts. "Clients did re-engage with us at the end of the second quarter and continued to do through the third quarter."
The bank actually posted a loss of $1.01 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the quarter because it incurred a $2.3 billion charge on the perceived improvement in its debt - an accounting-related cost that indicated greater public confidence in the stability of the bank.
Excluding that accounting charge, Morgan Stanley earned $561 million, or 28 cents, compared with 2 cents in the year-ago quarter and 4 cents better than analysts' expectations, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
Morgan Stanley produced adjusted net revenue of $7.6 billion, or $5.3 billion when excluding the one-time charge.
Investors bid up Morgan Stanley shares this week in anticipation of earnings, and then sold on the news, which failed to impress them. Shares closed on Thursday at $17.79, down 3.8 percent.
The bank showed steady gains in most of its business lines, notably in institutional securities. Excluding the debt charge, it had revenue of $3.6 billion, compared with $3 billion in the year-earlier period. This much-watched division is a big generator of revenue and has shrunk significantly since the financial crisis. It includes the company's investment bank, as well as stock and bond trading.
In the third quarter of 2007, institutional securities, which took greater risks to generate revenue, posted adjusted revenue of $4.6 billion. New regulations adopted since the financial crisis have forced Morgan Stanley to exit or reduce its presence in certain capital-intensive businesses, squeezing revenue.
The Moody's downgrade required the company to put up more capital against certain businesses, reducing its returns.
The quarter, while an improvement over recent periods, also highlights the long road the company still faces as it works to transform itself after the financial crisis.
Its return on equity in the quarter adjusted for the accounting charge was 3.5 percent. This year, it has not posted a quarterly return on equity above 10 percent. Morgan Stanley's return on equity in the third quarter of 2007 was roughly 17 percent.
"We will be very, very, very focused on noncompensation expenses," Mr. Gorman said on his plan to increase return on equity. "We are very attentive to our overall capital plan over the next couple of years. We are determined to make this global wealth management acquisition work."
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the company's global wealth management division, posted net revenue of $3.3 billion, up slightly from the year-earlier period.
Morgan Stanley has been making a big push into wealth management, a low-risk business that tends to produce steady returns. Last month, Morgan Stanley reached a deal to buy out Citigroup's share of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which had been a joint venture.
Asset management reported revenue of $631 million, compared with $205 million in the year-ago period.
The company's compensation expense climbed 6.7 percent, to $1.6 billion, while noncompensation expense rose 21 percent, an increase the bank attributed in large part to increased litigation costs. The company said it had almost reached its staff reduction targets for the year.
Morgan Stanley and other big Wall Street companies do not actually pay out compensation until the fourth quarter, after the company knows its performance for the full year. As a result, analysts and shareholders tend to pay more attention to just that quarter's compensation payout number.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Springsteen and Clinton Lead Rally for President

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
PARMA, Ohio -- First, let's get to the point: He played six songs, starting with ''No Surrender,'' then weaving to ''The Promised Land,'' then a new one called ''Forward'' that he joked he came up with after President Obama telephoned him asking for a song to go with the campaign's ''Forward'' slogan.
Even the man viewed widely as one of America's most renowned lyricists admitted he couldn't really get his head around that one. ''Forward?'' said Bruce Springsteen, the latest surrogate on the presidential campaign trail, looking stumped. ''Yeah.'' 
The only thing going for the slogan, he said, is that it beats ''Backward.''
The crowd, some 3,000 packed in a gymnasium at Cuyahoga Community College, laughed. Mr. Springsteen, for his part, did the best he could.
''I kissed your sister and I kissed your mama,'' he sang.
''Forward!'' yelled the crowd, per instructions.
''Let's vote for the man who got Osama,'' Mr. Springsteen sang, looking sheepish.
But Ohio is working-class country -- the prime Springsteen demographic. So there was no way this crowd wouldn't love anything he did, even ''Forward.''
The president's campaign aides were ecstatic to have the Boss back on the road for their boss. Mr. Springsteen joined former President Bill Clinton on stage for the event, as part of the Obama campaign's full-throated effort to scrounge up every single vote it can in Ohio. If Mr. Obama can win the state, campaign aides figure, the path to victory for the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will look like one of those single-track dusty roads that Mr. Springsteen is always singing about.
Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Springsteen, at some point in their careers, have been compared to preachers, and on Thursday, Mr. Clinton was definitely channeling his inner pulpit-pounder. ''This is the first time in my life I ever got to be the warm-up act for Bruce Springsteen,'' Mr. Clinton said. His voice started rising. ''I am qualified 'cause I was born in the U.S.A., and unlike one of the candidates for president, I keep all my money here!''
Mr. Clinton delivered a fire-and-brimstone condemnation of Mr. Romney in particular and Republicans in Congress in general, accusing them of doing everything they could to stand in the way of Mr. Obama's jobs agenda.
Of the unemployment rate, Mr. Clinton said: ''They were crushed when it dropped to 7.8 percent. They had talked about the unemployment rate for three and a half years as if it were scripture! It was right up there with the tablets that Moses brought down from Sinai!''
His arms flailed, his cheeks reddened. ''Then when it comes down, they say 'no, it was rigged!' ''
By the time Mr. Springsteen showed up on stage, Mr. Clinton had worked the crowd up to the point that the rocker known widely as BRUUUUUUUCE, the star who has sold out Giants Stadium in under seven minutes, was claiming that Mr. Clinton was a tough act to follow.
''It's like going on after Elvis,'' Mr. Springsteen said.
After performing ''Forward'' -- don't look for that one on the Billboard charts -- he wrapped the crowd around his little finger with ''Youngstown,'' from his uber-depressing 1995 album, ''The Ghost of Tom Joad.''
Mr. Obama, whose musical taste runs more toward Miles Davis, Al Green and Javanese flute music (a preference he apparently acquired back in his Indonesia days), has been proclaiming himself a big Bruce fan ever since Mr. Springsteen hit the road for him in 2008. But the truth is, unlike the working-class young white men the president is hoping that Mr. Springsteen will help him make inroads with, Mr. Obama did not cut his musical teeth on Springsteen anthems like ''The River.'' It's doubtful anyone has ever seen the president singing along, like legions of fans, when Mr. Springsteen belts out: ''But lately there ain't been much work, on account of the economy.''
In fact, the longest block of time that the president has spent with Mr. Springsteen seems to have been in December 2009, when the singer sat next to the Obamas during the Kennedy Center Honors, howling with laughter and slapping palms with Mr. Obama during the comedian Jon Stewart's tribute: ''I believe that Bob Dylan and James Brown had a baby. Yes, and they abandoned this child -- as you can imagine at the time, interracial same-sex relationships being what they were -- they abandoned this child on the side of the road between the exit interchanges of 8A and 9 on the Jersey turnpike. That child is Bruce Springsteen.''
But Mr. Obama has a legion of staff members and speechwriters who are massive Springsteen fans, so when the president took the stage at the same event, he could say, truthfully, ''It's no wonder his tours are not so much concerts as communions.'' Alas, just when people started thinking that maybe Mr. Obama had actually jammed at the Stone Pony on the Jersey Shore at some of those communions, the president added, ''I watched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial'' when Mr. Springsteen ''rocked the national mall for my inauguration.''
No matter. Mr. Springsteen is a fierce Democrat, and even though he said he wasn't going to return to the campaign trail this year, these are hard times for many Democrats here in this American land.
And so, the Boss played. He did an acoustic version of the song that the Obama campaign has co-opted, ''We Take Care of Our Own,'' Followed by Woody Guthrie's ''This Land is Your Land.''
Mr. Springsteen exhorted the crowd to ''Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!''
Then he told the crowd, ''I've got one more for you.''
And the screen door slammed.

HEADLINE: Behind China's High Abortion Rate: New Sexual Freedoms

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The one-child policy has long been cited as the reason for China's steep abortion rate, but some experts now point to another factor: Young people, they say, simply don't know how to use contraceptives. 

 BODY:
China, long a world leader in economic growth, has also long led in a category that fewer people talk about: abortion.
More than 13 million abortions are performed annually here, according to a recent survey by the Research Institute of the National Population and Family Planning Commission - about 25 a minute. (That compares to about 6.5 million abortions in India, according to The Times of India, or about 1.2 million in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute.)
For a long time, the high number of abortions in China was largely ascribed to its one-child policy, with women coerced into aborting children by the threat of heavy fines or the loss of a job - or, in some cases, physically forced to abort, often late in the pregnancy. That's still common, said Liu Yi, a rights activist in Chengdu, one of a growing number of ordinary Chinese who are monitoring the situation and speaking out about it. 
"China's now the world's second-biggest economy and many things have advanced, but people's rights are still being damaged a lot," Mr. Liu said by telephone.
But scholars are pointing to a new factor - women under the age of 25 who, if they are unmarried, do not directly fall within the remit of the family planners. About six million abortions per year are occurring among this group, according to a survey by the research institute, cited in a report this month by a state-run radio station that was picked up widely by domestic media, including the newspaper of the Communist Party, the People's Daily.
This new factor highlights how young Chinese are increasingly seizing on fast-growing personal freedoms, including sexual freedoms. 
Parents, and society more broadly, including schools, still remain reluctant to talk about sex. This exposes young people to risk, said Guo Weihe, head of the Social Work and Social Policy Research Unit of the China University of Political Science and Law.
"It reflects great unevenness amid the social change," Mr. Guo said by telephone. "People have changed, but our system and our culture has not."
One result is that young people simply don't know how to use contraceptives, said Wu Shangchun of the family planning commission research institute. 
"University students have become a high-occurrence group," a China National Radio report said in reference to abortions, citing a survey by Ms. Wu's institute. The story was picked up widely by domestic media, including the Communist Party-run people.com.cn (in Chinese).
"Many girls born after 1990 are not mature and are ignorant of the damage that can be caused by abortions," the radio station's report said. Just 12 percent of young people rated their knowledge of contraception as "very good," it said.
"Many young people encounter obstacles when it comes to getting information. For example they are shy about discussing it, or they worry they will be discovered by their parents, teachers or friends," the report said.
Yet gradually people are beginning to talk more openly about what had long often been discussed only in private.
Some novelists are leading the way. In 2009, Mo Yan, who recently received the Nobel in literature, published "Frog," based on the experiences of his aunt, an obstetrician who provided abortions under the state's strict family planning policies that began in 1979.
And Sheng Keyi, who in her novel "Northern Girls" wrote about the lives of Chinese migrant women seeking jobs in cities like Shenzhen in the south, addressed the issue last year at a book fair in Beijing.
"About 70 or 80 percent of migrant worker girls in Shenzhen have probably had abortions," she said. "I remember hearing that working in a gynecological hospital in Shenzhen was one of the best ways to make an income, because there was such a regular supply of abortions to be done. Millions and millions. It is very common."
