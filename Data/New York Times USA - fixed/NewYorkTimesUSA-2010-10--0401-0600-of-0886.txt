HEADLINE: Congressional Race Saves an Unlikely Role for Human Rights

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- The flagging economy came up, of course. So did the high unemployment rate. But it is not every Congressional debate that turns on the question of how to improve human rights in Vietnam.
Yet there were Loretta Sanchez, a Latina Democrat, and Van Tran, a Vietnamese-born Republican, eagerly discussing their credentials in fighting for human rights in Vietnam on behalf of the voters of California's 47th Congressional District.
Ms. Sanchez wore the yellow and red colors of the former South Vietnam flag, a symbol of pride in the large enclave of Vietnamese refugees here in Orange County. During the debate Wednesday, she proudly recounted being kicked out of Vietnam during a recent visit because, as she put it, ''I talked to the dissidents.'' Mr. Tran dismissed this as just talk. 
Soon their focus turned to the question of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, with each candidate walking a fine line to avoid alienating both conservatives and Mexican-American voters. All in all, it was a kind of tri-cultural debate in a place formerly known as the land of Richard Nixon and John Wayne.
In this central part of Orange County, once a Republican bastion, immigrants now make up more than half of the population. For the last 14 years, Ms. Sanchez has been the sole Democrat in the county's Congressional delegation and, as a daughter of Mexican immigrants, a potent symbol of power in the predominantly Mexican community. But she is now facing her toughest battle since she ousted the conservative Robert K. Dornan, as Republican leaders see Mr. Tran as their best chance at snatching back the seat.
The race has attracted big names -- former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York campaigned with Mr. Tran and former President Bill Clinton is scheduled to headline a rally for Ms. Sanchez on Friday.
Mr. Tran, a state assemblyman who is a formidable power in the Vietnamese political community, has managed to amass more than $1 million, he said. The Sanchez campaign declined to release its most recent fund-raising figures, but in June the campaign had nearly $1.3 million on hand.
Although there has been little public polling, a recent survey by a conservative group showed Mr. Tran within striking distance of the incumbent. He is counting on a base of conservative voters -- whom he called ''anti-incumbent, anti-Democrat and anti-Sanchez'' -- and the Vietnamese community to propel him to a win next month. Ms. Sanchez is clearly feeling the pressure, calling him a ''failed Sacramento politician'' in the hopes that voters like their state leaders even less than they like their Washington ones.
''I would never go on some kind of suicide mission,'' Mr. Tran said in a recent interview near his office in a part of town known as Little Saigon. ''This area has one of the lowest Congressional turnouts, so you can put your arms around the coalition relatively easily. A substantial number of people will cross party lines to vote with their background.''
During a September interview with Univision, Ms. Sanchez remarked that ''the Vietnamese'' and Republicans were trying to take the seat from her, a comment that Mr. Tran seized on and that sent an uproar through the conservative blogosphere. Ms. Sanchez has since said that she was referring only to Mr. Tran's supporters.
''Yes, those Vietnamese and Republicans who are supporting him are trying to take the office -- that's what an election is about,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ''But to say that I was on a racist rampage is just ridiculous.''
After news of Ms. Sanchez's comments surfaced, Mr. Tran said she was a ''trying to create a wedge where there isn't one.'' He said there had rarely been tensions between the two communities.
For its part, Ms. Sanchez's campaign bristled at a particularly nasty Tran campaign mailer, a hefty booklet in Vietnamese that showed several unflattering photographs of Ms. Sanchez, including one of her speaking with Ramon Castro, Fidel Castro's oldest brother, in Cuba -- a potentially powerful image for those who fled Communism. (Mr. Tran has also taken to repeatedly using the term ''socialist conspiracy'' when referring to Ms. Sanchez's votes for the economic stimulus and health care bills.)
In a list comparing the candidates, the leaflet described Mr. Tran's beliefs as ''conservative and maintaining traditional Asian values.'' It pointed out that Ms. Sanchez was divorced and described her way of life with a term that roughly translates to ''loose'' or ''carefree.''
While the Vietnamese community makes up roughly 9 percent of the vote here, history has shown that these residents go to the polls in far larger numbers than their Latino counterparts, who are estimated at more than 60 percent of registered voters and make up a substantial part of Ms. Sanchez's base. Her supporters acknowledge that a low turnout could hand Mr. Tran a victory.
The Vietnamese community here is hardly new -- refugees began flocking to Westminster, just six miles west, in the 1970s. But they have come to political power more slowly.
''The real change is the heightened understanding, the heightened interest of that community -- there has been a bump in the numbers of the Vietnamese in the school board and City Council,'' said Adam D. Probolsky, a Republican political strategist. ''These communities have a new sense of empowerment and a new organized effort to elect some of their own.''
Claudia Alvarez, a Santa Ana city councilwoman and supporter of Ms. Sanchez said it was unfortunate that ''two communities are really fighting over the same pieces of the pie,'' rather than electing another immigrant from other parts of the county.
''There is a lot of cynical attitude in the Hispanic community and the sense that nothing in government matters,'' Ms. Alvarez said. ''My fear is we are going to lose because of that divide and apathy.''

HEADLINE: In Nevada Senate Debate, a Clash of Candidates and Political Philosophies, Too

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- The debate Thursday evening between Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, and Sharron Angle, the Republican running with Tea Party support, had been promoted as a climactic duel between two opponents for a Nevada Senate seat, locked in an exceedingly tight contest in what may well be the most closely watched race of the fall.
What viewers saw here was a vivid contrast of philosophy between two competing forces in American politics this election cycle: Mr. Reid, the face of the Democratic establishment and champion of President Obama's policies, and Ms. Angle, the hero of the Tea Party. They offered fundamentally different visions of the role of government in dealing with issues including health care, regulating banks and the insurance industry, and using government programs to create jobs. 
Mr. Reid said that in a time of economic turmoil, he viewed the role of government as creating jobs, pointing, for example, to federal projects like the Boulder Dam, now known as the Hoover Dam, which was built during the Depression.
''My job is to create jobs,'' he said, looking into the camera as he addressed a state burdened with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. ''What she is talking about is extreme: We have to do it.''
Ms. Angle looked over at her opponent and also to the camera. ''Harry Reid,'' she said, ''it's not your job to create jobs. It's your job to create policies that create confidence in the private sector so they can create jobs.''
Ms. Angle said she opposed forcing insurance companies to cover any kind of procedures -- including mammograms and colonoscopies -- arguing that these decisions should be left to the private market. ''America is a country of choices, not forcing people to buy things they don't need,'' she said, adding, ''The free market will weed out those companies who don't offer as many choices.''
Mr. Reid, defending the health care law, argued that that kind of coverage was essential to hold down insurance costs by allowing doctors to catch diseases before they progressed too far and by guarding the public's health. ''Insurance companies don't do anything out of the goodness of their hearts,'' he said. ''They do it out of the profit motive.''
The 60-minute encounter at the PBS station here, the only one the candidates are scheduled to have, included attacks from both sides that were often personal. Mr. Reid repeatedly used the word ''extreme'' to describe Ms. Angle, echoing a central theme of his campaign advertisements.
Ms. Angle started attacking Mr. Reid in her opening remarks.
''The contrast is, I'm not a career politician; I'm a grandmother,'' she said, also noting that Mr. Reid lives at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington. And in the closing moments, she said he had gone from a hardscrabble life as the son of a miner in Searchlight to being, as she put it, one of the wealthiest men in the Senate.
''How did that happen?'' she demanded.
Mr. Reid seemed taken aback by the suggestion that he had somehow profited from his job as senator. ''That really is kind of a low blow,'' he said. ''I think everybody knows I have been a very successful lawyer. I lived off what I made. Her suggestion that I made money being a senator is false.''
Mr. Reid and Ms. Angle -- two candidates who have proved to have an unusual propensity to make the kind of misstatement that haunts them for days -- did not appear to make any kind of egregious mistake on Thursday that could, by itself, turn the course of this campaign.
Ms. Angle smiled and laughed, sometimes a bit nervously, at the start of almost every answer. Mr. Reid looked pale and slightly wan at the start, but loosened up -- at least for him; his strengths, as he acknowledges, do not include public speaking -- as the night went on.

HEADLINE: Merger Will Save Hospital In Brooklyn, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Long Island College Hospital, a financially troubled community hospital in Brooklyn, has been saved from the threat of closing or bankruptcy through a planned merger with SUNY Downstate Medical Center, a major public university and medical center, Gov. David A. Paterson and hospital officials said Thursday.
Long Island College Hospital, known as LICH, has been at risk of closing since at least 2008, when its parent company, Continuum Health Partners, announced that the hospital was straining under the weight of $170 million in capital debt and proposed to shut down its maternity and pediatric operations. The State Health Department denied Continuum's 2008 plan to close maternity and pediatric operations, leading to the search for a partner. 
Governor Paterson said Thursday that the state would provide $40 million to support the merger. In 2009 the state gave LICH $22 million to help stabilize itself and to make it more attractive to a prospective partner.
Hospital officials said the merger made sense because SUNY Downstate was already running a major part of its teaching program out of LICH, which is in the gentrifying Cobble Hill neighborhood. Under the agreement, officials said, LICH and Downstate's teaching hospital, University Hospital of Brooklyn, will operate as a single hospital with two campuses.
Mr. Paterson said the agreement would ''save Long Island College Hospital and protect health education and training in Brooklyn.''
Doctors in the pediatric and obstetric departments, which had fought to stay open, said they welcomed the long-term stability that a partnership with SUNY Downstate would provide.
''I think we'll be able to get the best of both worlds: maintain our community hospital and get support academically and financially from an esteemed, well-known organization like the SUNY system,'' said Dr. Hugh Gilgoff, medical director of the pediatric outpatient unit.
Dr. Gilgoff predicted that the merger would win over families who might now be traveling to Manhattan for specialty care. ''Hopefully in a short time we will look back and see a big change, a very tangible marked difference, in how the community views LICH because of more support,'' he said.
Dr. John C. LaRosa, president of SUNY Downstate, echoed Dr. Gilgoff's sentiment. ''In general the large hospitals in Manhattan use the community hospitals in the boroughs to feed them, and often control them,'' he said. ''It's hard to run a hospital when you essentially send all your high-end stuff into Manhattan.''
LICH, founded in 1858 as a medical school and hospital, is licensed for 506 beds.
The deal is something of a victory for the governor, and it preserves LICH from the fate of two other New York City hospitals, St. Vincent's in Greenwich Village and North General in Harlem, which closed this year, also because of financial problems.
The closing of St. Vincent's and North General, which had been kept alive for many years despite operating losses and other debt, showed the weakness of the hospital industry during the recession, hospital officials said.
North General, which declared bankruptcy in June and closed in early July, was about $200 million in debt when it closed, and had been in debt almost constantly since it was created in 1979 as part of a political deal to serve Harlem. It has been replaced by a large government-subsidized primary care center run by the Institute for Family Health.
St. Vincent's, which was more than $1 billion in debt, closed in April.
The state provided $14 million for an urgent care center and other health care services in the neighborhood to make up for the closing of St. Vincent's.

HEADLINE: Scrutinizing the Elite, Whether They Like It or Not

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE rich are sitting firmly in the public cross hairs, especially as the economy continues to stumble. Reports that Wall Street bonuses will again be high, and the debate in Congress over tax increases for the wealthy, just add to the outrage.
So it was a serendipitous time for Columbia University to convene the first Elites Research Network conference last week. The conference drew in scholars focused on inequality across academic disciplines, like economics, political science, sociology and history.
In the academic world, this was remarkable. As several of the scholars acknowledged, there has traditionally been some unease in talking about the elite, let alone researching them.
''When we study the poor, it's relatively easy,'' said Sudhir Venkatesh, a professor of sociology at Columbia and the author of ''Gang Leader for a Day'' (Penguin Press, 2008). ''The poor don't have the power to say no. Elites don't grant us interviews. They don't let us hang out at their country clubs.'' 
But Dorian Warren, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia, said the increasing concentration of wealth, moving from the top 10 percent of Americans to the top 1 percent, has made this the right time to look more closely at the group. ''We have to understand what's going on at the top,'' Mr. Warren said.
The discussion quickly went beyond examining how those with more had traditionally exercised control over those with less. Many of the younger scholars said their goal was to do more than just look at tax returns and see who sat on boards. Instead, they said, they want to start looking at the relationships between the elite and the non-elite.
''If you look at the poor as a problem, you'll be angry at elites or you'll expect them to come up with a solution,'' said Mr. Venkatesh, who took the most pragmatic line. ''You have to come in accepting that there will always be poor people in society and there will always be wealthy people in society, and neither of the two reached that status by their own efforts.''
That's not the usual description of this issue. But otherwise, you risk viewing the rich as rapacious thieves or seeing the poor as lazy freeloaders.
That said, there were other academics who hewed to an older model of power dynamics. Jeffrey Winters, associate professor of political science at Northwestern University, talked of the wealthy in America in terms of oligarchy. And he advanced an argument against what he called the ''income defense industry.''
The term referred to the accountants, lawyers and financial advisers employed by the wealthy -- and the merely affluent -- to manage their financial affairs. Mr. Winters argued that this group was hurting the non-elite by minimizing tax collection. He estimated that $70 billion was lost yearly just from offshore accounts.
There is no denying that members of the elite have a lot of money and would like to hang on to as much of it as they can. But that's true of most people.
Olivier Godechot, a French academic on the sociology panel, presented research that quantified just how skewed the increase in wealth at the very top has become. Mr. Godechot, a researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research in France, said that two professions -- finance and business services -- accounted for almost all of the increase in income inequality.
D. Michael Lindsay, assistant professor of sociology at Rice University, said his research showed that many of the people now considered elite in America did not start out that way. He is conducting what he described as the largest study ever of top leaders in America, having talked to over 500 so far across business, nonprofits and academia.
He said he had found that a privileged upbringing did not matter as much as generally thought. Nor, he said, did many of the top leaders inherit large sums of money. While many went to top colleges and a large number attended Harvard Business School, the biggest determining factor of whether someone moved into the elite was an early career opportunity.
Being able to look beyond their specialty early -- as opposed to being highly specialized their entire career and then thrust into a leadership role -- distinguished great leaders more than any inherent advantage in their upbringing, he said.
''These people had a chance to be a generalist early on, as opposed to being specialists their whole career,'' Mr. Lindsay said. ''They had that experience in their early 30s or 40s.''
Some of the conference presenters took note that they themselves were almost entirely from Ivy League and other elite universities -- only one was from a state university.
''When we send our kids to the Brookline schools, we're not making a judgment about the Boston schools,'' said Michele Lamont, a sociology professor at Harvard University. ''There are unintended consequences to our actions.''
Mr. Warren put it more bluntly: ''I did not come up as a child of privilege, but I got into Yale for graduate school. I'm going to want to do the same for my kids. It's not a malicious intent to exclude others; it's a rational impulse to maintain the advantage.''
Those at the conference defined the elite as people with power over others, and the debate was framed largely in economic terms. But professors at an Ivy League university are part of an elite, even if their salaries do not reflect it.
Shamus Rahman Khan, a conference organizer and assistant professor of sociology at Columbia, seemed to be most at ease with the conflict. The son of a Pakistani father and Irish mother who both emigrated to the United States, he said he came from a wealthy but not elite family. His father, a successful surgeon, paid his son's way to the St. Paul's School, a top boarding school.
Yet when Mr. Khan arrived there in the mid-1990s, he said he lived in the ''minority students dorm.'' He used that experience and a later teaching stint at St. Paul's to write a book on the nature of advantage, ''Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School,'' which will be published by Princeton University Press in January.
''Is it morally responsible for you to get your kids into very expensive schools if it will advantage them?'' Mr. Khan said. ''It's hard not to do it. But by doing it, you're not explicitly squirting some other kid in the eye with pepper spray. It's more subtle.''
His concern is what the concentration of wealth means for American society in the future. He said he wondered whether the post-World War II era in America -- as defined by prosperity and rising income levels -- was a historical anomaly and was coming to an end.
He cited data showing that the United States now had the second-lowest level of intergenerational income mobility in the world, after England.
''If we lose this truly American thing -- that you can become anything if you just work at it -- then you're really going to lose what makes America America,'' he said. ''It already appears that it will take a tremendous amount of time for people to bring their families out of poverty and for the wealthy to fall from the advantages they have.''

HEADLINE: A Dip in Profit and Soft Industrial Sales at G.E. Send Its Shares Down

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
General Electric has come a long way back since the financial crisis sent it reeling. The company has pared back its troubled finance arm, focused on its mainstay industrial business, cut costs and revived profits. But G.E.'s credibility on Wall Street remains shaky, with any sign of weakness punished by waves of selling.
The company on Friday reported stronger-than-expected profits, led by a big improvement in its finance unit, GE Capital. And orders for its industrial goods and services -- an early sign of future revenue -- grew for the first time in two years. 
But revenue slipped as current sales of industrial equipment were soft, and investors sent G.E.'s shares down 5 percent.
''There is very little room for error for G.E.,'' said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.
The quarterly results also included an unsettling reminder that liabilities in the finance business can linger and grow. G.E.'s third-quarter net profit fell 18 percent, weighed down by a $1.1 billion charge for obligations it may still have to pay on the Japanese consumer finance business it sold in 2008.
Consequently, G.E. reported net income of $2.06 billion, or 18 cents a share, compared with $2.49 billion, or 23 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations rose 29 percent, to $3.16 billion. And earnings per share on that basis increased 32 percent, to 29 cents a share, which was above analysts' forecast of 27 cents, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.
In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chief executive, called the performance ''a good quarter in an improving environment'' and evidence that the company's back-to-basics strategy was progressing as hoped.
Yet analysts expressed concern that most of the profit improvement came from a recovery in the finance business -- not a robust performance from its high-technology industrial lines, including jet engines, medical imaging equipment and wind turbines.
GE Capital, which contributes less than 20 percent of total corporate earnings, reported a sixfold jump in profit, to $871 million, from $141 million a year ago.
The commercial real estate business is a continuing headache, losing $405 million, though the losses are declining. But analysts say the company's consumer division, like retail credit cards, and lending to small businesses are solid performers.
Wall Street analysts have long had concerns about the quality of earnings across the conglomerate's mixed portfolio.
The surest test of G.E.'s financial performance, some analysts say, will be its ability to increase its dividend. Those payments, they say, will be real cash commitments for the long term.
''Dividends will be the key for G.E., raising the yield,'' said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach. ''G.E. is a special situation, a stock that is really more like a bond.''
In July, G.E. announced a 20 percent increase in its quarterly dividend, to 12 cents a share from 10 cents. But that remains well below the 31 cents a share the company was paying until February 2009, when the board cut the payout to conserve cash. That was the first time since the Depression that G.E. had cut its dividend.
One way to free up cash for further dividend increases, analysts say, would be to retire the $3 billion in G.E. preferred stock that the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett bought in October 2008.
That deal, arranged soon after the financial crisis erupted, was done to secure cash and restore confidence in G.E., the nation's largest nonbank financial institution.
That stock pays a 10 percent dividend, or $300 million a year. Under the terms of the deal, G.E. cannot buy the shares back until next October.
But G.E. executives have said that negotiating an earlier sale would be a step they might pursue -- if it completes the spinoff of its media company, NBC Universal, into a joint venture 51 percent owned by Comcast, by the end of this year.
G.E.'s big-ticket industrial products are often the last investments made by corporate customers during uncertain economic times.
But analysts note that G.E. has been slower to return to a growth path than other industrial equipment makers, including Honeywell, Emerson Electric and Tyco.
Revenue fell 5 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, to $35.9 billion. That was below Wall Street's estimate of $37.6 billion, and down from $37.8 billion in the third quarter of 2009.
One particular source of weakness was the once-booming market for wind turbines, which were down 32 percent, or $600 million, from a year ago.
Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, attributed the steep fall in the American market for wind turbines mainly to the falloff in overall electricity demand and low prices for natural-gas power generation.
Yet in a sign of improving fortunes, G.E. is investing again.
Earlier this month, the company announced that it had agreed to purchase Dresser, a maker of equipment for natural gas distribution, for $3 billion.
In the conference call, Mr. Immelt declared that G.E. was looking for similar purchases, typically of $1 billion to $3 billion.
''All the deals,'' he said, ''will be bolt-ons to the core of what we're doing.''

HEADLINE: World Trade, Once Rising, Is Starting to Sag Again

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE rapid recovery in world trade after the financial crisis appears to have slowed this spring and summer, raising new concerns about the global economy. Exports of many countries have stabilized at levels well under the peaks reached before the crisis sent world trade into a tailspin. 
The United States reported this week that its export volume of goods in August was virtually unchanged from July and little different from the previous four months. American imports rose, increasing the trade deficit and raising new political pressure for protectionist policies.
Even with that stall, the United States has recovered more of its lost exports than many other countries, particularly in Europe.
The accompanying charts show the dollar volume of monthly exports reported by 16 major countries since world trade peaked in July 2008.
The latest American figure is 10 percent below the peak. That compares with figures showing falls of 20 percent or more in most of Europe.
Even China, the world's strongest exporter, has seen a dip in exports this year. This week, it reported that its September exports were about equal to those of July 2008, but below its exports in several months earlier this year.
To some extent, the varying figures reflect changes in currency values relative to the dollar. The summer of 2008, when world trade was at its highest level ever, was also a period of a weak dollar. Since then, most currencies have lost value relative to the dollar, which benefited from fearful investors' flight to safety.
The charts show the change in the value of each currency against the dollar, comparing the average currency value in July 2008 to the average value in August of this year, which is the last month for which export data is available for most of the countries.
China is the anomaly there. By the summer of 2008, it had stopped allowing its currency to appreciate against the dollar. As a result, the Chinese currency was essentially unchanged against the dollar over the period, while it appreciated against most other currencies.
It is a measure of the strength of the Chinese export machine, and perhaps of the long-term undervaluation of its currency, that Chinese exports have rebounded more than those of its Asian competitors. South Korea and India benefited from weakening currencies that made their exports cheaper, but have not done as well.
The euro zone is a special case. In countries that have become less competitive within Europe since joining the zone -- like Italy and Greece -- export levels have generally bounced back less than in the more competitive countries, like France and Germany.
Over all, the fact that the export surge has slowed is a sign that the manufacturing-led world economic recovery has begun to sputter.
Another indicator of possible slowing is that surveys of manufacturing companies around the world are indicating that new orders are growing less rapidly than they were a few months ago.
''With many economies, especially in the developed world, saddled with persistent high unemployment and export demand weakening,'' said Chris Williamson, the chief economist of Markit, a firm that conducts such surveys, ''the risks of a further slowdown in coming months have increased.''

HEADLINE: Mixed End to a Bad Day For the Financial Sector

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed Friday as investors weighed encouraging retail news and signs of new Fed measures to bolster the economy against the impact of the tangled foreclosure process on the nation's banks.
On Friday, a spate of economic statistics and corporate results kept analysts sifting through potential outcomes for the stock market and economic recovery. Financial stocks closed down more than 1 percent, while technology shares rose.
The market opened higher shortly after the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested in a speech in Boston that the Fed was prepared to manage the risks associated with new purchases of government debt to lower long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.79 points, or 0.3 percent, at 11,062.78. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.38 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,176.19, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 33.39 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,468.77.
The Dow and S.& P. each were up less than 1 percent in the week, while the Nasdaq ended the week 2.7 percent higher, helped by a rise in Google.
But financial stocks were hit hard, down more than 1.7 percent, the most of any sector. On Wednesday, 50 state attorneys general announced that they were investigating the practices of the mortgage servicing industry. Concerns over the extent to which the foreclosure problems would hit banks' bottom lines were evident in the stock market on Thursday, and the declines continued on Friday. First Horizon National was down nearly 8 percent at $10.03. SunTrust Banks was down 4.7 percent at $24.38, and Bank of America declined nearly 5 percent, to $11.98.
Citigroup, the most actively traded of the banks, was more than 2.7 percent lower at $3.95. JPMorgan Chase was down more than 4 percent at $37.15, and Capital One declined 7.6 percent at $36.86.
''The financial sector is still being impacted by this issue of the foreclosure conundrum,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an IHS Global Insight economist. ''It is very hard to say how that is going t0 play out.''
And while the market has long been anticipating the Fed measures, economists downgraded the potential impact of new quantitative easing by the Fed. Some analysts said the market had already accounted for the effect of any easing measures, which the presidents of the regional banks had been discussing for weeks.
''They are all moving in that direction,'' said Mr. Bethune. ''All the chairman is doing is summarizing and pulling it together. It is pretty clear where they are going. The question is, Will it impact the economy? And the answer is yes, but it is not going to be overnight.''
Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said such quantitative easing measures might lower long-term interest rates and stimulate the stock market ''a bit more.''
But he added, ''At this stage, $500 billion or even $1 trillion is probably just not going to do it.''
''With mortgage rates and corporate bond yields already close to record lows, however, we doubt that would have any meaningful impact on the wider economy,'' Mr. Ashworth wrote in a research note.
There were also new economic statistics to mull over on Friday. Retail sales for September were a rare bright spot, climbing by 0.6 percent over all and beating forecasts.
The rise came after upward revisions to August and July, both of which projected a stronger picture of consumer spending in the third quarter than previously thought.
''Consumers are starting to pick up spending after a relatively weak showing in the first half of the summer despite a steady stream of poor news on the employment and financial fronts,'' said Chris Christopher, the IHS Global Insight United States economist.
Inflation was 0.1 percent, with the core index flat for another month, the Commerce Department reported.
Quarterly results continued to trickle out, with results from bellwether stocks affecting the direction of some of the main indexes.
General Electric reported that its third-quarter profit fell 18 percent, with revenue soft from sales of industrial equipment, although orders for industrial goods and services grew.
Its shares were down more than 5 percent at $16.30.
Google shares buoyed the Nasdaq. Google reported on Thursday that revenue climbed 23 percent and net income rose 32 percent. On Friday the share closed up more than 11 percent at $601.45.

HEADLINE: Inflation Looks Tame, and Shoppers Take Heart

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The economy continued to show little sign of inflation as consumer prices eased marginally in September, while consumers provided a glimmer of hope for the retail sector, government reports said on Friday.
The Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index, a benchmark measure of inflation, increased 0.1 percent in September, compared with a 0.3 percent rise in August and the same increase in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, the core index was flat in September, the same as in August. It had risen 0.1 percent in July and 0.2 percent in June.
Year-over-year core inflation was up 0.8 percent. It had been running at 0.9 percent for five consecutive months, its lowest level in more than 50 years. 
The consumer price results for September were slightly below analysts' forecasts, which had called for a 0.2 percent rise in September and a 0.1 percent increase in the core index.
The figures were the latest in a series of economic indicators this week suggesting that growth would remain sluggish for the rest of the year, given the slowdown in jobs and output.
In addition, the Producer Price Index on Thursday registered a slight rise, suggesting that the environment was not deflationary, said Anthony Chan, the chief economist at J. P. Morgan Private Wealth Management.
The latest statistics ''are telling us that the economy is in less danger of a double dip,'' he added.
But the bottom line for the recovery still remains pinned on job growth. ''We are going to continue to grow positively, but maybe not strong enough to make the progress the central bank wants to lower unemployment,'' Mr. Chan said.
This week the government also said that weekly claims for unemployment insurance reached 462,000 as of the week of Oct. 9. And the trade deficit widened to $46.3 billion in August, with the deficit with China reaching a record. Some economists say they believe the trade deficit will be a drag on growth.
Separately, Reuters reported that consumer sentiment in the United States declined in early October to its weakest level since July.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment was 67.9, down from 68.2 in September and below the 69.0 median forecast among economists polled by Reuters.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions was at the lowest level since November 2009. The index was at 73 in early October, compared with 79.6 in September and 79.8 forecast by analysts, Reuters reported.
On Friday, new statistics for retail sales provided a bright spot for consumer spending, which is a cornerstone component of economic growth, by climbing more than forecast last month.
The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales picked up in September by 0.6 percent over all, up from a revised 0.7 percent rise in August and above forecasts of 0.4 percent. When the volatile auto sales and gas components are stripped from the equation, retail sales were up 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.9 percent revision for the previous month.
The upward revision to the retail sales number ''does kind of offer a glimmer of hope that consumer spending is not falling off a cliff,'' Mr. Chan said.
A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also suggested some resilience in the economy. The Empire State manufacturing index for this month registered 15.73, up from 4.14 in September, with growth propelled by the new orders and employment sections of the index.
The data was released weeks ahead of a meeting on Nov. 2-3 of Federal Reserve policy makers, who many economists and analysts expect will announce a new round of quantitative easing.
At their meeting on Aug. 10, policy makers decided to use proceeds from the Fed's mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities.
''QE2 in my view is a 'done deal' and the Fed will re-engage this process at the November F.O.M.C. meeting,'' Tom di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners, said in a research note. ''We expect $1 trillion in size for QE2,'' he said.
''The most substantial reason for this decision by the Fed is to simply keep the economy afloat during times of uncertainty as it relates to the high unemployment picture, subpar growth and the backdrop of a disinflationary environment,'' Mr. di Galoma said.

HEADLINE: Buyers Beware

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Are you out of your mind to even consider buying a foreclosed property right now?
Todd Phelps and Paul Whitehead didn't think they were last month when they were the winning bidders in a foreclosure auction on the steps of the main Riverside, Calif., county courthouse. They thought they had won the lottery.
For years, they had been living in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica and waiting out the housing bubble in hopes of buying a weekend getaway in the Palm Springs area. And on Sept. 10, they thought they had finally done it, getting a house for $137,000.
Several days later, however, they realized that what they had really bought was a second mortgage from Wachovia on a house that still had an enormous, unpaid primary loan. In other words, they did not own the home free and clear, and the auction company wouldn't give back their $137,000 check. 
The tale is certainly enough to give anyone pause, especially as several banks slow or halt their foreclosure proceedings amid questions about how they cut corners to speed up the process. Still, roughly half the recent home sales in hard-hit states like California, Arizona and Nevada have been foreclosures or short sales, according to RealtyTrac. Anyone wanting to buy homes in those and other states hit hard by the housing crisis will probably encounter these sorts of properties.
And the houses will be tempting for scores of first-time homebuyers, second-home seekers and people looking to get an early jump on buying a retirement home while prices and interest rates are low.
So given the pitfalls, are they crazy? The answer is no, not always. But it's important to keep something in mind.
''The whole foreclosure process is adversarial, even though it's nonjudicial in many areas,'' said Tom Cahraman, the presiding judge in Riverside County. ''One person is losing their home, and another person is trying to get a new home at a discount price.''
He's absolutely right. Strap on the body armor, and think hard about the following five factors if you find foreclosed homes even remotely enticing.
THE LOAN First of all, many banks that own foreclosed properties would prefer that you stay far away from their listings. In fact, they may sell a property for less money to an investor who can pay all cash.
You, on the other hand, will probably need a mortgage, and your need for bank approval can delay the sales process because your lender may hesitate when you say you're interested in a foreclosed property.
''Lenders will usually only give you a loan on homes that are pretty ready to be lived in,'' said Andy Tolbert of Oneir HD Realty in Longwood, Fla., who represents buyers shopping for foreclosed and other homes and invests in distressed property herself. ''If the carpet is ripped out and the toilets are missing, they are not going to give the loan.''
This is especially important to consider if you're using a Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration loan, where there may be particularly stringent requirements. ''I have seen V.A. lenders require torn carpet to be repaired or replaced because they see it as a hazard to the new occupants,'' said Mike Goblet, a mortgage broker with United Mortgage Financial Group in Mesa, Ariz.
There are some exceptions. The F.H.A. offers a mortgage called a 203(k) that may allow you to borrow money to buy and substantially rehabilitate a foreclosed property. But it could take a while to find a bank that offers the loan and to get your project approved. Some sellers, meanwhile, won't let you buy with F.H.A. loans.
THE AUCTION PROCESS Foreclosure auctions can be a dangerous place for people who don't know what they're doing or are relying on help from people who are sloppy or negligent.
Mr. Phelps and Mr. Whitehead had a real estate broker who was supposed to be checking the records of the home they wanted to buy at auction. But the broker did not discover, or did not report to them, the fact that the property had several claims against it.
They considered suing the broker, but first turned to the auction company, Executive Trustee Services, a unit of GMAC Mortgage (one of the companies that suspended many foreclosures in recent weeks). At the company's Burbank, Calif., office, a representative told Mr. Phelps that all sales were final and that Executive Trustee was merely a middleman. Mr. Phelps asked for further documentation and was told that he could have it when he returned with a subpoena. Classy, no? Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the company, did not respond to requests for comment.
The couple also wrote plaintive letters to executives at Wachovia, now part of Wells Fargo, because both defaulted loans attached to the home they were trying to buy came from that bank. (The auction company was working on the bank's behalf.)
After a couple of rounds of e-mail and phone inquiries on my part, the bank decided to give Mr. Phelps and Mr. Whitehead their money back. ''Given the circumstances, we have decided to rescind the sale on the property and return the funds to the buyers,'' Vickee J. Adams, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail on Friday.
Meanwhile, the couple, having nearly lost most of their life savings, now realize that they were in way over their heads bidding for homes at auction and were lucky to get their money back. ''Trust no one,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''We didn't get involved when the market was going crazy and everyone was getting subprime mortgages, and we felt like we were smart and that this was our reward for sitting on the sidelines. But there are enough bargains to be had on a straight sale.''
THE INSPECTION Let's say you do manage to get a loan, resist the auctions and take the straight sale approach, shopping through a real estate agent. You'll want to make any bid for a home contingent on a thorough inspection from someone familiar with foreclosed properties.
Mold may be your first concern, especially in more humid climates, given that many foreclosed homes have been uninhabited for months.
Then there's sabotage. You should arrange (or have the real estate agent arrange) to have the power and water turned back on before the inspection if possible. Why? The previous owner (or vandals who have been in the home since) may have cut wires behind walls or poked holes in pipes in various places. Having running water and power can make these things easier to detect.
The pour-concrete-down-the-toilet trick is one that most good inspectors know to look for. But Jon Bolton of The Inspectagator in Oviedo, Fla., recently ran into a bit of destructive ingenuity he'd never encountered.
''Someone went on the roof with a bag of cement and dropped it down the chimney,'' he recalled. ''It rained, and now you have a solid block of concrete somewhere where it's extremely difficult to get in to break it up. That's just wrong.''
Also, don't forget to inspect the minutes of the condominium board or homeowners' association, if there is one. It may be in deep financial trouble if other foreclosures have occurred. Ms. Tolbert says that a good title insurer may be able to help with contacts if you have no luck finding the manager or treasurer on your own.
THE TITLE INSURANCE Speaking of which, title insurance is a must, particularly now. In the unlikely event that a former owner somehow wins back rights to the foreclosed home you end up buying and then tries to kick you out, you will need to make a title insurance claim.
And if you plan to put a lot of money into fixing up the home, you'll want to ask about a rider on the insurance policy that can cover you for more than what you paid to buy the property.
THE WAITING GAME Still worried about the prospect of former owners showing up someday and asking for their home back? Cyd Weeks, a real estate agent with Palmcoasting.com in Palm Coast, Fla., suggests waiting a few months before trying to buy a foreclosed home. Now that all eyes are on the foreclosure process, he said, homes coming on the market early next year will probably have been foreclosed upon with much more care and precision.
Indeed, Ms. Weeks's tip suggests a larger point. Given the foreclosure moratorium that some banks have put in place and the lengthy investigations and lawsuits that are sure to follow, there is no rush to buy as long as you don't have to move or if renting is an option.
Take your time. Assemble a panel of experts and apprentice yourself to them. And watch the listings carefully. For better or for worse, foreclosed properties are going to be available for a very, very long time.

HEADLINE: Stuck in Neutral at Rutgers

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
PISCATAWAY, N.J. -- No one can blame Greg Schiano for believing he can build Rutgers into a national football power. When he arrived 10 years ago, the Scarlet Knights had appeared in a single postseason bowl game in 135 years of competition. This year, Rutgers is seeking its sixth consecutive bowl invitation.
Schiano gets talented players to come to the state university of New Jersey -- 32 of them have gone on to the N.F.L. He makes sure they study -- Rutgers achieved the top ranking in the most recent Academic Progress Rate, according to the N.C.A.A. In fact, the team's score was the best ever in the Football Bowl Subdivision. 
So why are fans of Rutgers, and of the Big East, looking to Saturday's game against Army (4-2) with so much anxiety?
The Scarlet Knights (3-2) are once again off to a slow start and have hardly looked like world beaters in losing to scandal-weakened North Carolina (3-2) and to Tulane (2-3), a team Army walloped last weekend, 41-23. Rutgers was supposed to be one of the bright spots for Big East football, especially after going 11-2 in 2006 and finishing the season ranked No. 12.
Instead, the Scarlet Knights have yet to capture a league title under Schiano and have made bigger headlines for what they may do: abandon the Big East for the Big Ten if they are invited.
Finally, there is the miserable economy. At a time when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is slashing statewide budgets, including freezing the salaries of university professors, Schiano's $2 million annual salary and the university's $102 million stadium expansion rub some people wrong.
Alfred P. Doblin, editorial editor of The Record in Bergen County, pointed out in a May column that Schiano's annual compensation package ''would restore nearly a fifth of the total funding cut by the state toward libraries.''
''New Jersey doesn't need Schiano to get into a bowl,'' Doblin wrote, echoing the fury on both political and sports message boards. ''New Jersey is already in a bowl. It's called a toilet bowl.''
Schiano insists that this is where the ''thick skin'' of a New Jersey native comes in handy. He was the highly regarded defensive coordinator at the University of Miami who wanted to return home and transform an was essentially a lower-tier program into a big-time power.
''We were losing kids to New Hampshire,'' he said this week.
Soon, by focusing on recruits from New Jersey, New York and Florida, Schiano and his staff brought better football players to campus.
''Not top flight, but true Division I players,'' he said. ''We had some really great overachievers and chemistry. In 2006, we had a magical ride.''
When Miami and Michigan came calling, Schiano made it clear he wanted to finish what he started, and the former Rutgers athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy III made him the highest-paid football coach in the Big East. He also gave Schiano an interest-free loan on his house.
Now Schiano says that he needs to remain focused on his team's 62 freshmen and sophomores -- the most talented group he has had -- and that at 1-0 in the Big East, his team is atop the conference standings.
''I'm glad there are expectations,'' Schiano said. ''It means we're building something worthwhile.''
Rutgers's current athletic director, Tim Pernetti, says he understands the frustration of some of the state's residents and of the football team's critics. He was hired in February 2009 after Mulcahy was fired; a special review committee of the university found that the athletic department overspent, made secret deals and operated without oversight as it pushed to become a player in big-time football.
''The university is feeling a lot of pressure in this economic climate,'' said Pernetti, who played tight end at Rutgers and was an executive at CBS College Sports. ''The one pressure we feel every day is running our budget in a responsible and transparent way.''
Rutgers's annual athletic budget is $60 million, Pernetti said, and the department does not make money. As part of the fight over university budget cuts and salary freezes, faculty members derided in a letter ''a subsidy of $11.5 million from the general fund to cover lavish overruns for Intercollegiate Athletics.''
Still, Pernetti said, when the football team generates excitement, his department's bottom line improves. ''We have $18 million in pledges and gifts at a difficult time in our economy,'' he said. ''There is always stress, and more wins than losses helps our fund-raising.''
The Rutgers athletic department is also aggressively seeking new revenue streams. It agreed to meet Army on Saturday at New Meadowlands Stadium rather than at Rutgers Stadium because it meant a guaranteed $2.7 million payout, almost twice what Rutgers would make at home.
''It was purely financial,'' Schiano said. ''I know as the head coach of the football program at Rutgers, we're part of the university, we're part of an athletic department, and I don't think it would be responsible not to take advantage of the opportunity that's presented to us.''
Even as the grousing about his team's performance and the scrutiny of his personal finances persist, Schiano continues to believe in his mission of bringing a national title to New Jersey.
''We're building something here that is incredibly important to the state of New Jersey,'' he said. ''The state needs something to have pride in, something to get behind together.''

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Another year without an increase in Social Security retirement and disability benefits has President Obama and Democrats pushing to give a $250 bonus to each of the program's 58 million recipients. 
The Social Security Administration said on Friday that inflation had been too low since the last increase in 2009 to warrant a raise for 2011. It will be only the second year without an increase since automatic adjustments for inflation were adopted in 1975. This year was the first.
The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, promised to schedule a vote after the Nov. 2 election on a bill to provide the one-time payments to Social Security recipients. Mr. Obama endorsed the payment, which would be similar to one included in his economic recovery package last year.
Annual cost-of-living adjustments are automatically set each year by an inflation measure that was adopted by Congress in the 1970s. Friday's announcemen followed the Labor Department's release of inflation numbers for September. The report showed that consumer prices remained lower than they were two years ago, when the last adjustment was made.
The increase for 2009 was 5.8 percent, the largest in 27 years. It was caused by a sharp but short-lived spike in gasoline, to above $4 a gallon, in the summer of 2008. When the price of gasoline later fell, so did the overall inflation rate. Seniors, however, kept their increase in benefits.
The next increase in benefits will not come until consumer prices rise above what they were in the summer of 2008. The trustees who oversee Social Security project that will happen next year.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Investigate China's Clean Energy Aid

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The economic tension between the United States and China escalated on Friday, as the Obama administration pledged to investigate Beijing's subsidies to its growing clean energy industries while delaying a politically volatile report on the Chinese currency.
The approach -- part carrot, part stick -- reflected the delicate balance the administration is trying to strike in a campaign year by taking a newly assertive posture over China's trade and commercial policies, while pursuing delicate negotiations as an alternative to confrontation.
Hours after the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced an investigation into China's support for makers of wind and solar energy products, advanced batteries and energy-efficient vehicles, the Treasury Department said it would delay its semiannual report on foreign-exchange rates, which was due Friday, and could be critical of Beijing's efforts to keep its currency artificially low. 
The Treasury delayed the last such report, due April 15, until July 8.
The United States last branded China a currency manipulator, a designation that could lead to retaliatory tariffs, in 1994. Successive administrations have since declined to do so, arguing that it would be counterproductive. But as China has been blamed for a loss of American jobs, members of Congress, and now administration officials, have become increasingly critical of Beijing's reluctance to permit greater exchange-rate flexibility. In June, Beijing agreed to do so, but then balked.
Still, since early September, the renminbi has risen by about 2.5 percent relative to the dollar, and a Treasury statement on Friday ''recognized China's actions since early September to accelerate the pace of currency appreciation, while noting it is important to sustain this course.''
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has become more pointed in his criticisms of China, warning recently that China had set off a ''damaging cycle'' of ''competitive nonappreciation'' in which countries aimed to block their currencies from rising in value to support their exporters.
In its statement Friday, the Treasury said that by stimulating Chinese consumer spending and allowing the renminbi to rise in value, ''China will make a significant positive contribution to the global rebalancing effort, help reduce pressure on those emerging market economies that have more flexible exchange rates, and provide a more level playing field for trading partners around the world.''
On the trade subsidy challenge, the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said his office would investigate a complaint filed by the United Steelworkers, one of the nation's largest unions, on Sept. 9. The complaint asserted that China had violated its obligations under the World Trade Organization.
''This is a vitally important sector for the United States,'' Mr. Kirk said. ''Green technology will be an engine for the jobs of the future, and this administration is committed to ensuring a level playing field for American workers, businesses and green technology entrepreneurs.''
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Wang Baodong, called the steelworkers' allegations ''unwarranted and of a protectionist nature, and it's not a right step by the U.S. side to decide to probe it.'' He said China's green technology industries conformed to W.T.O. rules and were a big contribution to sustained global development.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O, the United Steelworkers and the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group, all issued statements in support of the action.
The steelworkers union said that ''President Obama showed again today that fighting for U.S. workers and their jobs is his top priority.''
But the announcement drew a skeptical welcome from one prominent Democrat: Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, an advocate of legislation that would threaten China with retaliation if it does not allow its currency to appreciate more quickly.
''The Obama administration is treating the symptom, but not the disease,'' said Mr. Schumer. ''An investigation into China's illegal subsidies for its clean energy industry is overdue, but it's no substitute for dealing with China's currency manipulation.''
The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last month to threaten China with tariffs on a broad range of Chinese exports to the United States.
The administration's decision represents a shift toward a more confrontational policy toward China, but may not produce quick changes in Chinese policies.
The administration said that it would investigate the steelworkers union's petition for 90 days, after which it might seek bilateral consultations with China that could lead to the filing of a W.T.O. case against China. If the United States files a case, a W.T.O. panel would typically not issue a preliminary decision for more than a year. If the decision goes against China, the Chinese government could then delay any implementation of sanctions for another couple of years through appeals.
W.T.O. dispute resolution panels do not have the authority to issue injunctions while they consider a case. So the current policies could stay in place through the entire W.T.O. dispute process, which can take several years.
Charlene Barshefsky, who was the trade representative under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview last month at a conference in Chengdu, China, that the Chinese government might have misunderstood the politics of clean energy exports.
''China is under the illusion that because they are the leaders in alternative energy, whether it's batteries or wind, they will necessarily be welcome in the U.S. market because of climate change concerns,'' she said.
Ms. Barshefsky said by e-mail on Friday that she was not surprised that Mr. Kirk had opened an investigation, but she cautioned that the possible filing of a W.T.O. case would depend on the strength of the union's complaint.
Chinese officials have maintained that their country follows W.T.O. rules. A common tactic in W.T.O. disputes is for a country being accused of trade violations to file counterclaims.
The difficulty for China in making a counterclaim is that the United States exports relatively little in clean energy products, particularly to China. So American programs to help clean energy industries are likely to count as domestic subsidies, in contrast to the export subsidies that China is alleged to have given.
Domestic subsidies are subject to less stringent W.T.O. rules than export subsidies, according to Carolyn B. Gleason, a lawyer in Washington who has specializes in W.T.O. cases.
The lead example of unfair Chinese trade practices in the United Steelworkers' petition involved China's restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals and two other obscure minerals, tungsten and antimony. China dominates the worldwide mining of all three.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Weighs Risks of New Action

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, went further on Friday in outlining the risks the central bank was prepared to take by pumping more money into the flagging recovery.
In formal remarks here, Mr. Bernanke explained a viewpoint that had taken shape gradually over several months. The Fed hoped to calm debate over its next move and prepare markets for the likelihood that it would pour money into the economy by resuming purchases of government, and possibly private, debt.
The new action would be aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and spurring growth, but it would also have effects far beyond American shores. It could contribute to the weakening of the dollar and complicate a festering currency dispute that threatens to disrupt global trade relations.
For Americans, additional Fed activity is likely to mean that already low 30-year mortgage rates would fall even further. The moves would not help many savers, however, as yields on certificates of deposit and savings bonds would probably fall as well. But the Fed hopes that making credit even cheaper will encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and that could eventually bring relief to jobless workers. 
Mr. Bernanke's remarks, at a conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, confirmed Wall Street analysts' expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee would approve new steps at its next meeting on Nov. 2-3.
The question now is not whether the Fed will resume the debt-buying strategy known as quantitative easing, but how much it will buy, and how quickly, analysts said. Mr. Bernanke did not offer such details.
The stock markets, which have risen since the Fed took an incremental step in August toward additional monetary easing, largely shrugged off Mr. Bernanke's remarks, though new stimulus efforts would probably raise equity prices, at least in the short run. Stocks ended mixed, with the Dow Jones industrial average slightly lower and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up slightly.
In the past, the Fed sometimes changed rates when the market didn't expect it. But in this difficult economy, it felt it had to telegraph its moves well in advance so as not to disturb markets or other major economies.
The economic outlook offered by Mr. Bernanke was sobering. He said that the rate of growth was ''less vigorous than we would like,'' and that the unemployment rate was likely to ''decline only slowly'' next year, even as the recovery gains steam.
Mr. Bernanke centered his analysis on the Fed's ''dual mandate'' to foster maximum employment and price stability. He said that inflation was ''too low'' relative to the desired rate of ''about 2 percent or a bit below,'' and that unemployment was ''clearly too high'' relative to Fed officials' long-run forecast of 5 to 5.25 percent.
''Given the committee's objectives, there would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke noted that one key measure of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy prices -- had fallen to about 1.1 percent over the first eight months of this year, from about 2.5 percent in the early stages of the recession.
Weighing in on a debate that has preoccupied Fed officials, Mr. Bernanke planted himself on the side of those who view the high unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent -- as an outcome of the sharp contraction in economic demand that followed the financial crisis, rather than of structural factors like a mismatch between workers' qualifications and the skills required by employers.
But Mr. Bernanke acknowledged, with greater candor than Fed officials usually have, the tension between the two parts of the Fed's mandate.
''Whereas monetary policy makers clearly have the ability to determine the inflation rate in the long run, they have little or no control over the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate, which is primarily determined by demographic and structural factors, not by monetary policy,'' he said.
In interviews, economists at the conference here offered mixed reactions.
''The Fed is trying to achieve too much,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''They want to stimulate demand, but there are a lot of nonmonetary factors that are inhibiting the economy, including distressed mortgages and foreclosures, the need for households to save, and a whole array of factors deterring businesses from hiring.''
John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist, disagreed with Mr. Bernanke's conclusions. ''From my perspective, the cost-benefit analysis would suggest that it wouldn't be a good idea to do a big, massive quantitative easing because the gains are quite small in terms of the impact on interest rates,'' he said.
But Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, defended Mr. Bernanke's stance.
''If the economy has a negative shock, or continues to grow as slowly as it has, it's going to be sliding toward deflation,'' he said. ''The Fed can't sit on its hands,'' he added, and should pursue additional action ''as long as it has an effect -- even if it's small.''
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, said more Fed action ''should be positive for economic growth, though the amount is uncertain.''
The Fed lowered short-term rates to nearly zero in December 2008 and then pursued its first round of quantitative easing beginning in 2009. By April this year, it had bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related debt and Treasury securities to put downward pressure on long-term rates.
As recently as the spring, the Fed was considering when and how it would begin to raise interest rates. But as the recovery stumbled, the Fed reversed course, and by late summer it was debating how best to prop up the recovery.
Mr. Bernanke cautioned that ''unconventional policies have costs and limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether and how aggressively they should be used.''
He admitted that the debt-buying strategy was largely untested. ''We have much less experience in judging the economic effects of this policy instrument, which makes it challenging to determine the appropriate quantity and pace of purchases and to communicate this policy response to the public,'' he said.
And he acknowledged a fear that new asset purchases might ''reduce public confidence'' in the Fed's ability to eventually make a smooth return to normal monetary policy and lead to ''an undesired increase in inflation expectations.'' But he said he was confident that the Fed could tighten policy when the time came.
Along with more quantitative easing, the Fed could communicate that it intended to keep short-term interest rates low for even longer than markets expected. That could help lower longer-term rates, as they partly reflect expectations of future short-term rates. But Mr. Bernanke appeared to play down that option, saying it would be difficult to convey that intention ''with sufficient precision and conditionality.''

HEADLINE: In Mumbai, Adviser to Obama Extols India's Economic Model

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI -- First, there was the pro-free-market development model known as the Washington consensus. Then came the Beijing consensus, which is used to describe China's state-led, export-powered growth. 
Could it now be time to start talking about the Mumbai consensus? Lawrence H. Summers seems to think so.
In a speech to Mumbai's business and cultural elite on Friday, Mr. Summers, a senior White House economic official, made a pitch for a third, Indian approach to economic development that he described as ''people-centric'' and driven by growth in consumption rather than exports, a reference to China.
''In 2040, the discussion will be less about the Washington consensus and the Beijing consensus than about the Mumbai consensus,'' he said.
According to him, the term described ''a developing state driven not by mercantilist capitalism or exports but a people-centric focus on growing levels of consumption based globally.''
Mr. Summers's comments on the Indian economic model echoed other recent praise for the country. This month, The Economist magazine, for instance, had a cover that read, ''How India's growth will outpace China's.'' The comments appear to mark a turning point in Western impressions about India.
In the past, many foreign economists and policy makers lamented that the fractious democracy in India could not build infrastructure and lift people out of poverty at a respectable pace, but there now seems to be more optimism about the country.
Mr. Summers, of course, was also being a diplomat. His speech, in which he painted a flattering picture of relations between the United States and India, appears to be the beginning of a charm offensive before President Obama's visit to the country early next month, his first as president.
Mr. Summers is visiting business and political leaders in Mumbai and New Delhi for five days.
Many analysts in Washington and New Delhi have worried that since Mr. Obama took office, economic and political relations between India and the United States have lost some of the gloss and pre-eminence that they seemed to have possessed during the administrations of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. That impression has gained currency in recent months because of a string of perceived slights on both sides.
For instance, Indian officials and companies are angry that Congress raised by $2,000 the fees on visas that are often used by Indian outsourcing companies. And American officials and companies like General Electric are upset that the Indian Parliament passed a law that made suppliers of nuclear power equipment subject to liability, a position that is at odds with international convention.

HEADLINE: A Novelist's Voice, Both Exotic and Midwestern

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
Early in Dinaw Mengestu's new novel, ''How to Read the Air,'' the main character, a troubled young Ethiopian-American named Jonas Woldemariam, goes to a job interview, only to be asked, ''Where's that accent of yours from?'' by a prospective boss baffled by his seemingly alien provenance. ''Peoria,'' Jonas replies, puzzling his interviewer even further.
Life has sometimes been like that for Mr. Mengestu, too. His name, ''so clearly foreign and other,'' he admits, and pedigree can make it difficult for some of the people he encounters to see past an ostensibly exotic exterior to the very American core underneath.
But as a novelist, Mr. Mengestu, 32, has made such doubts and confusion about identity and belonging his stock in trade. His work is populated by exiles, refugees, emigres and children of the African diaspora, all struggling both to find a place in the American landscape and to make sense of their attenuated relationship to the world they left behind. 
''It's less about trying to figure out how you occupy these two cultural or racial boundaries and more about what it's like when you are not particularly attached to either of these two communities,'' he said recently in an interview in Manhattan at the offices of his publisher, Riverhead Books.
In nearly two hours, Mr. Mengestu never raised his voice, never demonstrated much emotion, never lost his composure, no matter how painful the subject. His characters tend to be like that as well. ''As a writer, it's a great narrative tool to have that character who is slightly detached but at the same time observant of his reality,'' he explained, ''because I think that's pretty much what being a writer is -- being there, watching and internalizing.''
Mr. Mengestu's first novel, ''The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears,'' focuses on an Ethiopian shopkeeper, living in isolation in a gentrifying neighborhood in Washington, who develops a tentative bond with a professor of American history, a white woman, and her precocious biracial daughter. The New York Times Book Review named the novel, whose title derives from Dante's ''Inferno,'' as one of the notable books of 2007, and Mr. Mengestu quickly became a literary name to watch.
''How to Read the Air,'' published this week, addresses similar issues of self-image and estrangement from a different angle. With his marriage and job prospects crumbling, Jonas Woldemariam abandons New York and returns to his native Midwest, where, almost like a Kerouac character, he goes on the road to retrace a trip that his exile parents made before his birth and that poisoned their own marriage.
''Dinaw writes with a very lyrical grace, with a quality of freshness and observation in his sentences,'' said Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at The New Yorker, which in June included Mr. Mengestu in its prestigious ''20 under 40'' list of outstanding young fiction writers.
''He obviously has a deep interest in studying the details of immigrant life and aspirations,'' Ms. Treisman said, ''but I would say he is 98 percent an American writer, who is getting more comfortable with his own voice.''
Born in Addis Ababa in 1978, Mr. Mengestu came to the United States two years later and grew up in Illinois, first in Peoria and then in Forest Park, a Chicago suburb. During the interview he summoned nostalgic memories of those early years: a white Baptist church's warm embrace of his immigrant family, his father's job at the headquarters of the Caterpillar tractor company and the hope of rising to middle-class comfort that that newcomer's luck inspired.
Lurking in the background, though, was the trauma that had driven his parents from Ethiopia, namely the revolution that followed the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie and, he said, ''split the family cleanly down the middle.''
Some relatives became high-ranking officials in the new Marxist military government, while others, because of their class background as landowners or their political activities, were arrested or jailed or who even perished, including an especially beloved older brother of his father's.
''We had no memories in our house,'' Mr. Mengestu said. ''We were never allowed to, we never spent time talking about it, and yet you're very aware that it haunts everything. It's that absence that creates the concern for it. Nothing can be passed on.''
He added, speaking of his own reaction, ''You know there is this history that precedes you, but you have no access to it whatsoever.''
At the elite Roman Catholic high school he attended in the Chicago area, his situation grew even more complicated. He was the target of racial epithets from white students, he recalls, but also had to confront ''the question of my authenticity'' in his dealings with other black students, since ''it was always really clear that 'you are the black kid who sounds white, the black kid who doesn't seem like he's black,' and no one can figure out exactly why.''
Voracious reading provided some relief for the ''anger and angst'' that Mr. Mengestu said he felt then, and at Georgetown University, he gravitated to literature. Afterward he earned an M.F.A. in fiction at Columbia and held a variety of jobs while writing his first novel, which began when he spotted a solitary Ethiopian storeowner while on a walk one day through the Adams-Morgan neighborhood in Washington.
''Even then, he seemed very much above the fray,'' said Norma Tilden, an English professor at Georgetown whom Mr. Mengestu named as a friend and mentor. ''I was always very clear that Dinaw was holding back a lot, not in a reticent way, but just that there was a lot there, and he would get to it when he wanted.''
Much of ''How to Read the Air'' was written in Paris, providing yet another layer of distancing. Mr. Mengestu's wife, Anne-Emanuelle, is French, and like American writers from Hemingway to James Baldwin, Mr. Mengestu felt, he said, a need to ''get away and find a private space to work in,'' one that would allow him to ''see New York and Illinois more clearly.''
Mr. Mengestu also produces nonfiction, writing for magazines like Rolling Stone, Harper's and Granta. He spent part of the summer in eastern Congo, reporting on the conflict there for Granta, and has also written from Uganda and Darfur, in Sudan.
In fact, when Mr. Mengestu went to Georgetown, it was originally with the idea of ''possibly some day working with the State Department,'' an ambition that was derailed when he took his first economics course and realized ''this cannot possibly work.''
But even in Africa, issues of identity continued to pester him. In eastern Congo he ran into problems trying to interview Hutu rebels from Rwanda, who, like his high school classmates, didn't know what to make of him.
''I could speak English as well as I wanted to them, but they could only see that my features are what they consider Tutsi, and that was definitely threatening to my life,'' he said rather matter-of-factly. ''They would look at me, and my translator would say, 'No, he's American.' He was always very specific, telling me, 'Don't confuse them, don't try to say you're Ethiopian, just tell them you're American, don't complicate things with this extra layer, because nobody's going to believe it.' ''
Mr. Mengestu has begun work on a third novel, which, he said ''seems to be the last component of this cycle'' on the African diaspora and is likely to be followed by something that doesn't have ''that same sense of dislocation and displacement.'' To those who know him well, that strategy makes perfect sense.
''The topics he writes about are very heartbreaking, really, but he is not somebody who is walking around the world with sad puppy-dog eyes,'' said the critic Marcela Valdes, who has been a good friend since both were graduate students. ''He's a much more vibrant and charming personality than that. He has the ability to go deep and look at stuff that is hard, but he also has a joie de vivre.''

HEADLINE: A Rum Battle, a Tax Hangover

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Rum and politics have made a fiery mix since America's earliest days, when a young politician named George Washington won election to the House of Burgesses in colonial Virginia with the help of spiked punch at the polls.
There have been rum wars involving pirates and slave traders, and rumrunners who made a mockery of Prohibition.
Now the spirit once called Kill-Devil has set off a bitter dispute between two United States islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, over a tax that the federal treasury collects on rum.
The fight began when the Virgin Islands persuaded the world's largest distiller, which said it was leaving Puerto Rico, to move to St. Croix by offering a staggering $2.7 billion in tax incentives. The new distillery, for Captain Morgan spiced rum, will provide no more than 70 permanent jobs on the south shore of St. Croix -- but it will entitle the Virgin Islands to collect billions in rum tax revenue from Washington. 
That bounty comes at the expense of Puerto Rico, where 90 percent of the revenue from the rum tax had been used for public projects and social services rather than corporate incentives. The Virgin Islands has promised to give nearly half its tax revenue back to the distiller, the British company Diageo, prompting a series of charges and countercharges between neighbors roughly 50 miles apart in the Caribbean.
The aftershocks could even change what people drink in the United States. The tax incentives are so generous that Virgin Island producers might ultimately try to use highly subsidized sugar cane to make blended whiskeys, vodka and gin, distillers on the mainland say. That could threaten the jobs of grain farmers and distilleries in the American heartland.
The deal could also cost American taxpayers. With Puerto Rico's economy reeling and its government budget already strained, some island officials say they cannot rule out needing to ask Washington for aid to cover basic expenses once covered by the rum tax.
''We'd have to make it up one way or another,'' said Puerto Rico's resident commissioner, Pedro R. Pierluisi, the island's nonvoting delegate to Congress. ''It's not going to be pretty.''
The billions of dollars at stake are the result of a quirk in the tax code that was intended to aid the islands while preventing their offshore distilleries from gaining an unfair advantage over competitors in the states.
Because rum producers in the islands are exempt from federal excise taxes, the government imposed an ''equalization tax'' on Puerto Rican rum producers in 1917 and gave the money to the commonwealth. In 1954, the United States extended the arrangement to the Virgin Islands.
For half a century, the program allowed the islands to replenish their depleted treasuries and pay for infrastructure, schools and social services. Puerto Rico used less than 10 percent of the $450 million it received last year to provide marketing support and production subsidies to rum companies, according to government officials, leaving the rest for the island.
In 2007, Diageo explored a possible move of its Captain Morgan production to Honduras or Guatemala, where labor costs and supplies were cheaper.
At the same time, Diageo approached the governor of the Virgin Islands, John P. de Jongh Jr., about moving to St. Croix. The two signed a deal the following year. It requires Diageo to stay in the Virgin Islands for 30 years in return for incentives so rich they are double the cost of actually producing the rum.
Diageo, based in Britain, will get a new plant built at taxpayer expense, exemption from all property and gross receipt taxes for the length of the deal, a 90 percent reduction in corporate taxes, plus marketing support and production incentives totaling tens of millions a year.
The generous subsidies have led to charges by some Puerto Rican officials and Virgin Islands residents that the governor was misled into using public money for corporate welfare.
''We're not against big businesses,'' said Michael J. Springer Jr., a candidate for the Virgin Islands Senate, ''but for the government of the Virgin Islands to give that much money to a foreign corporation when it was intended to help the residents and their communities, is outrageous. In the meantime, the government is borrowing to pay its operating expenses.''
But officials for Diageo said it had no intention of staying in Puerto Rico, and Mr. de Jongh asserts that the concessions were needed to keep the company from moving out of the United States entirely.
Even after the incentives, the Virgin Islands will gain a stable source of revenue for 30 years, he said, with rum tax proceeds projected to climb to more than $230 million by 2038, from $90 million in 2008.
The infusion of cash has already helped the government retain 2,000 employees, Mr. de Jongh said. ''We will strengthen the government pension fund, build schools, fix and construct roads, and continue to move the U.S. Virgin Islands toward fiscal self-reliance,'' he said.
Jennifer Nugent-Hill, a trustee at the University of the Virgin Islands and vice president at a shipping company, said the infusion of rum tax revenue would be one of the most significant economic developments in the island's history, empowering its residents ''to control our own destiny.''
On Puerto Rico, government officials have little hope of replacing the $120 million in annual revenue that will leave with Diageo in 2012. It will cost the island 340 jobs, as well. Mr. Pierluisi has pushed a bill in Congress that would forbid either entity from offering more than 10 percent of its rum tax revenue as subsidies.
But the measure has languished, in part because of opposition by Donna M. Christensen, the delegate for the Virgin Islands. Others accuse Puerto Rico of opposing the deal to favor its biggest distillery, Bacardi, which has government ties.
Roberto Serralles, whose family distillery stands to lose millions in business, called the moves by the Virgin Islands an underhanded raid.
''If Tennessee got G.M. to relocate by offering a subsidy that was more than the cost of making a car, wouldn't the people in Michigan be upset?'' asked Mr. Serralles, whose family has produced rum on Puerto Rico for six generations. ''And you have to wonder -- why is the government in the business of using federal funds to guarantee profits of a huge multinational corporation?''
The dispute extends beyond Caribbean sands. Distillers on the mainland are concerned about a $1 billion subsidy the Virgin Islands recently awarded Fortune Brands, the American company that makes Cruzan Rum, Jim Beam Bourbon and other spirits.
Fortune will receive an assortment of tax-financed incentives, including $100 million for improvements to its distillery on the island and a wastewater treatment program. The agreement also ensures that the company will pay no more than 16 cents a gallon for molasses, the main ingredient of rum, now selling for more than $2 on the open market.
According to Treasury records, the company won approval to bottle three blended whiskeys using molasses-based cane spirits rather than grain spirits.
A Fortune spokesman said the company merely wanted to preserve its ''flexibility'' and had no plans to use cane spirits in other products. Some distillers worry, though, that cane spirits -- filtered into a nearly flavorless alcohol -- may be used to make vodka, gin and other liquors.
''If our own federal government is also letting its taxes subsidize foreign corporations and offshore producers, it makes it harder to survive,'' said Philip E. Prichard, whose independent distillery in Tennessee makes rum and bourbon. ''It flies in the face of entrepreneurship.''

HEADLINE: For Midterm Voters, War Is Off the Radar

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It has been going on there for nine years and counting. Nearly 100,000 American troops are currently deployed there. More than 1,300 American service members have lost their lives there. The United States has spent over $300 billion on the effort so far. Yet polling suggests that the war in Afghanistan is barely a blip on voters' radars as the midterm elections approach.
Given the condition of the economy and the high unemployment rate, the fact that most Americans largely cite those problems as the nation's top issues is not surprising. What is surprising is that hardly any Americans cite the war in Afghanistan at all. 
In a nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month, 60 percent of Americans said that the economy or jobs were the most important problems facing the country. A mere 3 percent mentioned Afghanistan or the war.
A Pew poll earlier this month found that 23 percent of Americans said they were following the situation in Afghanistan very closely, far fewer than the 43 percent who were following the condition of the economy very closely.
When an ABC News/Washington Post poll released in early September directly asked how important a number of issues would be in deciding how to vote for Congress in November, the economy, health care and the budget deficit were all rated as very important or the single most important issue more often than the war was.
In contrast, in the period leading up to the 2006 midterm elections, the war in Iraq and concerns about terrorism trumped all other issues in Times/CBS News national polls. Amid broad dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq that year, American voters ushered in a new Democratic majority in Congress.
But Americans' priorities shifted dramatically in 2008, as the economy took a severe turn for the worse. In the Edison/Mitofsky exit polls on Election Day 2008, with the country in the midst of an unfolding financial crisis, the economy was chosen by more than 6 in 10 voters as the most important issue facing the country, while 1 in 10 chose the war in Iraq (these voters were more apt to be Democrats) and another 1 in 10 cited terrorism (voters who were mostly Republicans and conservatives).
John Mueller, a professor of political science at Ohio State University, said the ''rubber band theory'' explains the lack of interest in the war. ''People mainly think about domestic issues, particularly economic ones, and from time to time their attention is pulled away by international events, but their natural tendency is for it to snap back to what they're really interested in.''
Lack of focus should not be confused with support for the war. On the contrary: Americans' assessments of the war are grim. A majority in the September Times/CBS News poll said the United States should not be involved in Afghanistan now, up 15 percentage points since December. And most said the war was going badly, down from its peak but well above the reading in the early years of the war, when broad majorities said it was going well.
Mark Janssen, 54, an independent voter from Traer, Iowa, was one of the few Times/CBS News poll respondents citing the war in Afghanistan as the most important problem facing the country. In a follow-up interview, Mr. Janssen said, ''The economy is terrible, but if nukes get into the wrong hands, it's going to make all this other stuff seem insignificant.''
Speaking about the candidates, Dr. Mueller explained: ''They would talk about it if they thought it would win them votes. It just doesn't have much political traction. The big thing is the overwhelming impact of the economy, which is certainly straightforward and obvious.''
The Democratic party is split over the war, with many elected Democrats uneasy with or opposed to President Obama's decision to send more troops. That makes it all the more likely that Democratic candidates will avoid bringing up the issue with voters. With the poor economy contributing to a favorable electoral climate for them, Republicans have no particular political need to bring up the war -- which, in any case, most Republican political leaders support. Republican voters are the most apt to support the war, and to say the United States is doing the right thing by fighting.
Until the unemployment rate begins to fall dramatically, most Americans seem to feel that they cannot afford to focus on the war. ''Jobs are the prevailing issue for everyone right now -- we need to focus on jobs,'' said one poll respondent, Michael Santalucia, a 47-year-old Democrat from Beavercreek, Ohio. ''I don't know how much we can do about Afghanistan right now, but we can do something about jobs here.''

HEADLINE: Signs of Recovery in Brooklyn Housing

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
Coming on the heels of reports showing that the Manhattan residential real estate market has stabilized somewhat, a third-quarter market report to be released Friday shows that the Brooklyn housing market has rebounded fairly quickly from the 2008 housing crash. 
According to the report, to be released Friday by Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, Brooklyn is seeing stable sales, faster marketing times, a surge in high-end sales and rising inventory. While mortgage rates are now at record lows and prices are still well below peak levels, Mr. Miller said recovery was still being hindered by unemployment, a so-called shadow inventory of property for sale but not listed, and tight credit.
The report, prepared for the brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman, found that average sales prices increased 7.2 percent, to $583,790, from 544,676 in the third quarter of 2009 and increased 7.1 percent from $545,110 in the second quarter of this year. (The average sales price in Manhattan in the third quarter was around $1.43 million, according to market reports on that borough). According to the Brooklyn report, the average number of days an apartment was on the market was 109, down from 165 days from the same time last year.

HEADLINE: The Future of the Global Fund

 BODY:
Even in the midst of an economic downturn, the United States and other donors have increased their pledges to a global fund that is fighting three of the world's most devastating infectious diseases. Unfortunately, the money will not be nearly enough to meet the rising health needs in developing countries. 
Millions of lives that could be saved will be lost unless additional financing can be found.
Public and private donors have recently pledged to contribute $11.7 billion over the next three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The money supports programs that provide drug treatments for AIDS patients; therapy to prevent transmission of H.I.V., the AIDS virus, from mothers to children; long-lasting insecticidal nets to prevent malaria; closely observed treatment for tuberculosis; and care for the sick or orphaned. The new pledges are a substantial improvement over contributions of $9.7 billion for the preceding three years. The United States led the way -- as usual -- by pledging $4 billion over three years, a 38 percent increase over the preceding three years. No other donor nation came close to that percentage increase.
The money pledged will be enough to ensure that anyone now being treated will continue to get help. There will also be $2.9 billion to add new programs or renew existing programs that are working well. The disappointing fact is that the rate at which the fund has been expanding its work will be greatly slowed.
As the global fight against these diseases widens and recipients scale up successful programs or submit additional high-quality proposals, the need for money is rapidly rising. Just to maintain existing programs and the current rate of expansion would require $17 billion. Adding money for an even more rapid scale-up of programs that are working would require $20 billion.
The Global Fund and advocacy groups need to press countries that have not yet pledged or pledged too little to ante up. Congress is on track to approve $1.1 billion or slightly more for fiscal-year 2011, which is more than what President Obama requested. It should consider whether it can give more. This effort is essential for global health and the stability of fragile nations.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Arts Center Sets Real Estate Venture

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Performing arts centers typically present performances, not develop real estate.
But the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark is stepping up its involvement in real estate by putting its founding president and chief executive, Lawrence P. Goldman, at the helm of its newly created NJPAC Development Corporation, the center announced on Friday.
''The arts centers that are going to be successful in the next decade or two are the ones that diversify their revenues,'' Mr. Goldman said in an interview. ''The basic economic model of presentations, tickets sales and fund-raising is beginning to break down.'' 
Mr. Goldman, 64, will step down as chief executive in June, the end of the fiscal year, after almost 22 years of leading the performing arts center, which is among the largest in the nation. The center's board has established a search committee to find a successor for Mr. Goldman, who started in 1989 after serving as vice president of Carnegie Hall and who oversaw the design and construction of the center, which opened its doors in 1997.
''For an arts center to truly live up to its full potential, it must focus on being more than just a venue; it must be a force in the creation of economic opportunity,'' Cory A. Booker, the mayor of Newark, said in an interview. ''Newark is the arts capital of New Jersey. We are still not fulfilling our potential in terms of the economic impact the arts could be having.''
The move does not reflect a state of emergency at the center, a need for a quick infusion of money or any shift in priorities, Mr. Goldman said. Rather, it represents a recognition that, given the economic climate, it makes sense to develop alternative sources of income and to play a more active role in animating the center's neighborhood.
''We want to make it the Piazza Navona of Newark,'' Mr. Goldman said, speaking of the popular square in Rome, ''with cafes and restaurants and galleries, to revitalize the area and make it a 24/7 environment. What Newark needs is people downtown.''
In a sense the performing arts center has been preparing for this shift from the beginning, having originally acquired more land than it needed for a cultural building: a total of 12 acres. (Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, by comparison, has about 16.) That leaves eight acres available for private development.
Thomas H. Kean, who as governor ushered in the arts center, said he had Lincoln Center in mind when determining that urban development should be integral to the center's activities.
''I saw Lincoln Center go in and what happened to the neighborhood surrounding it,'' he said in an interview. As the area became commercially successful with Lincoln Center's development, he said, the center itself did not have a corresponding benefit because it had not invested more directly in neighborhood property.
William J. Marino, the New Jersey center's chairman, said the timing was right. ''The real estate opportunities are better than they have been in quite some time,'' he said. ''Real estate is one of Larry's strengths.''
Mr. Goldman will become president of the corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the arts center. Among its first orders of business will be the completion of One Theater Square, a 1.2-acre, 44-story, mixed-use residential building that is next to the arts center and is slated to be the tallest building in Newark.
Gov. Christopher J. Christie has approved $38 million in tax credits over 10 years for the project, which is being developed with Dranoff Properties. The 325-unit tower still requires $160 million in financing. In addition to amenities like a pool and a health club, the building is to include 20,000 square feet of retail space, and 20 percent of its apartments will rent at below market rates to qualifying artists.
At the corporation Mr. Goldman will also focus on the planning and development of two other sites that are contiguous with, and controlled by, the center. The corporation is working ''in a preliminary way'' with Liberty Property Trust of Philadelphia, Mr. Goldman said, on a commercial building on at least one of the other properties.
Mr. Goldman came to the arts center with the idea of undertaking real estate ventures, having helped shepherd the expansion and renovation of Carnegie Hall. In the 1980s a small parking lot of Carnegie's between the hall and the Russian Tea Room restaurant, he said, was returning about $250,000 to the hall. That space now has Carnegie Hall Tower, developed by the Rockrose Development Corporation and designed by Cesar Pelli. The property now generates more than $2 million a year for Carnegie.
''The arts center has to be the town square of New Jersey,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Corporate events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, poetry festivals, other nonprofits doing their fund-raisers here, graduations, job fairs. It has to be more than what's on your stages.''
To a large extent, Mr. Goldman said, the development corporation is an attempt to build on the arts center's success. The center, which has an annual operating budget of $30 million, has been in the black for five years running. It has built an endowment of more than $55 million and raises about $11 million a year. And the center is notably diverse, with minorities making up 27 percent of the audience and 50 percent of the staff.
''What this is saying is, the arts center is now stabilized -- we are doing pretty well in a difficult environment,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''And it is time to focus on the planning and development of the property we control.''

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Official Seeks to Block West Virginia Mine

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A top federal regulator has recommended revoking the permit for one of the nation's largest planned mountaintop removal mining projects, saying it would be devastating to miles of West Virginia streams and the plant and animal life they support. 
In a report submitted last month and made public on Friday, Shawn M. Garvin, the Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator for the Mid-Atlantic, said that Arch Coal's proposed Spruce No. 1 Mine in Logan County should be stopped because it ''would likely have unacceptable adverse effects on wildlife.''
In 2007, the Bush administration approved the project, which would involve dynamiting the tops off mountains over 2,278 acres to get at the coal beneath while dumping the resulting rubble, known as spoil, into nearby valleys and streams. The Obama administration announced last year that it would review the decision, prompting the mine owner, Arch Coal, based in St. Louis, to sue.
In its review, the E.P.A. found that the project would bury more than seven miles of the Pigeonroost Branch and Oldhouse Branch streams under 110 million cubic yards of spoil, killing everything in them and sending downstream a flood of contaminants, toxic substances and life-choking algae.
Kim Link, a spokeswoman for Arch Coal, said in a statement that the company intended to ''vigorously'' challenge the recommendation.
''If the E.P.A. proceeds with its unlawful veto of the Spruce permit -- as it appears determined to do -- West Virginia's economy and future tax base will suffer a serious blow,'' Ms. Link said. She said the company planned to spend $250 million on the project, creating 250 jobs and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenues in a struggling region
''Beyond that, every business in the nation would be put on notice that any lawfully issued permit -- Clean Water Act 404 or otherwise -- can be revoked at any time according to the whims of the federal government,'' she said, referring to the federal law under which the original permit was granted. ''Clearly, such a development would have a chilling impact on future investment and job creation.''
The E.P.A. said the construction of waste ponds as well as other discharges from the Spruce No. 1 mining operation would spread pollutants beyond the boundaries of the mine itself, causing further damage to wildlife and the environment.
Arch Coal had proposed to construct new streams to replace the buried rivers, but the E.P.A. said they could not reproduce the numbers and variety of fish and plant life supported by the indigenous streams.
An E.P.A. spokesman said that Mr. Garvin's recommendation was a step in a long process and that the agency's Office of Water and the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, would review his report and thousands of public comments before making the final decision, likely before the end of the year.
The Sierra Club applauded the E.P.A. for ''staring down Big Coal and industry lobbyists.''
''This mother of all mountaintop removal coal mines would destroy thousands of acres of land, bury seven miles of streams and end a way of life for too many Appalachian families,'' the Sierra Club's executive director, Michael Brune, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: In Truman Homes, Reflections of a City

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
INDEPENDENCE, Mo. -- Harry S. Truman once proclaimed that returning to this small city where he began his unlikely political ascent allowed him to forget he was president of the United States. That would be impossible today -- his name and bespectacled image have become so omnipresent here that were he to make his ritual morning stroll through downtown he might conclude that his status is less favorite son than only son.
All of which makes the sight of the old house on South Crysler Avenue all the more unexpected. The large gray building appears all but abandoned, decaying the way houses do when people have simply lost interest. Most of the subdivided apartments inside have sat empty for years, the residents evicted in the hope of ridding the place of its reputation as a drug house.
''I wish I had never bought it,'' said Charles Evans, a heating and cooling system repairman from nearby Raytown, who bought the seven-unit house in 2004 for $79,500. ''Independence is the drug capital of the world, and it's just real hard to get decent renters.'' 
There is no plaque out front to mark this as Truman's boyhood residence, though it was the first of four houses in this city that he called home. Brenda Yancey, 54, who has lived here for a decade at $550 a month and was the only resident the new owner allowed to stay, has trouble even convincing visitors that these walls sheltered the 33rd president for six years. ''They look at me like, 'Really?' '' she said this week, watching late afternoon television as empty beer cans accumulated on her floor.
This hardscrabble suburb of Kansas City has struggled in recent decades to confront the many faces of urban blight -- at one time receiving the unfortunate designation of methamphetamine capital of the United States -- but its ties to Truman continue to serve as both an economic and spiritual salve, drawing tourist dollars and reminding locals of a happier past when residents boasted that this was the kind of town capable of both producing a president and luring him back after his time in office ended.
Today, the differing fates of the four houses here where Truman once lived reflect the more difficult present of this city: the decaying building on South Crysler with its shuttered windows (Truman acquired his love of reading here while recovering from diphtheria); the meticulously renovated house on West Waldo Avenue that has lingered on the market, unable to sell (Truman bragged that he made the house a gathering spot for neighborhood children); the foreboding home on North Liberty Street where the owner warns of ghosts (Truman's sister would later describe this home, where the family lived for just six months before moving to Kansas City, as ''old when we lived there''); and, of course, the still immaculate Victorian mansion on North Delaware Street, now a popular tourist attraction owned and operated by the National Park Service, where Truman, after marrying into money, spent most of his adult life.
In the coming months the city expects to receive approval for a decade-long effort to expand the Truman Historic District to 560 properties from 216 properties around town -- some of which can claim only to have served as a backdrop for his walks. But the historic landmark designation will leave out the two houses where he used to lay his head that are in more troubled areas. The city and the Park Service said they lacked historic integrity after years of structural changes and neglect.
''How many buildings associated with Harry Truman can you turn into historic sites?'' asked Michael J. Devine, director of the Truman Presidential Library, noting that three additional properties, the house in Lamar, Mo., where Truman was born, the family farm in Grandview, Mo., and the vacation house in Key West, Fla., dubbed ''the Little White House'' are preserved for public use. ''The buildings that the Trumans lived in were built to be private residences, and they're still used as residences,'' Mr. Devine said.
That is still the case of the yellow house at 909 West Waldo Avenue, which could not provide a starker contrast to the house less than a mile away at 619 South Crysler. Perched above a well-manicured lawn, the Victorian structure still sparkles from the years of renovations aimed at restoring the appearance it would have had when Truman was a resident. Outside, a bronze plaque flatly calls it ''Truman Boyhood Home,'' though this was home for just six years until 1902 when Truman's father -- in an unfortunate turn of events that may sound familiar in today's housing market -- lost the house because of speculative investments in grain futures.
Paul and Rita Nolan bought the home in 2007 for $250,000, almost immediately after it was put on the market, and have delighted in the attention ever since. ''It was totally the novelty of it,'' said Ms. Nolan, who estimated that they put in about $100,000 worth of renovations. ''Living in a presidential historic home seemed like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We could not believe it was for sale.''
Three years later, though, the novelty has worn off and the Nolans, eager to move out of the city, have found that their asking price of $349,900 is too rich for a place where the average home price has five digits. In the six months since it went on the market, the Nolans said, they have yet to receive a serious offer, though there has been ''a lot of lookie-loo traffic.'' They tried unsuccessfully to sell the building to the Park Service.
''I thought that it might be kind of neat to buy that,'' said Mike Ryan, a tour guide at the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site. ''But, no, that's out of my price range.''
On the other side of the small courthouse square, Tracey E. Haley spoke about her imposing old house at 902 North Liberty Street, which she bought for $69,000 in 2003. It took her just days, she said, to discover the spirits haunting the building. But it was not until several years later that she learned, when she noticed a picture of the house in a book, that Truman had briefly lived there. The house has no markers of any kind, so she paid to have one made that says ''Truman Boyhood Home,'' which she plans to install on a patch of concrete already poured in the front yard.
''I'm glad I don't live in, say, George Bush Jr.'s house,'' she said. ''Even though I wasn't searching for a presidential house, I was lucky to find one where I liked the person.''

HEADLINE: Threat Response

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The president and fellow Democrats have taken a page from the Republican playbook. They're unabashedly using racial-solidarity politics to animate voters. In this case, the Democrats' appeal is to black voters, the most unwavering portion of President Obama's base, and the message is simple: The president is under attack, and black voters must mobilize to protect him. 
The Democratic National Committee is spending an unprecedented $3 million on advertising aimed at African-Americans for the midterms this year. As part of that effort, the committee has cut a new radio ad featuring the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the civil rights leader, that outlines the threat and the call to action: ''When young people took to the streets, we elected our first African-American president. Right now, there are those doing everything in their power to block the president's agenda. And that's why we're counting on you to vote. In 2008, we changed the guard. This year, we must guard the change.''
Other ads, on black radio and in black newspapers, simply extol their audiences to ''stand with President Obama.''
These ads aren't about policy. They're personal appeals on behalf of the president. You don't have to be engaged to get it. This November you're voting for Obama, again.
As Politico noted this week, ''the White House has hesitated to cast the midterm elections as a referendum on President Barack Obama, except when it comes to one key constituency: African-American voters.''
This strategy could prove extremely effective.
A report issued Thursday by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies outlines the fact that black voters are ''strategically situated in 2010 to have a major impact'' because (1) there is ''a significant number of black voters in the states and districts where many of the most competitive elections will be held'' and (2) ''there is a president who is very popular with African-Americans and who is under attack from Congressional Republicans.''
And Friday, The Washington Post reported that a poll by that newspaper, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University found that ''80 percent of black Democrats are as interested or more interested in the midterms than they were in the 2008 presidential election.''
A large black turnout next month could prove decisive and upset the predictions of most pundits. If blacks do turn out in record numbers, it would almost certainly be because they are drawn out by their devotion to Obama, a devotion he's counting on.
As the president told an audience last week at Bowie State University, a historically black college, in Maryland: ''I think the pundits are wrong. But it's up to you to prove them wrong. Don't make me look bad, now.''

HEADLINE: Obama, Hitting the Trail, Still Looks for Ways to Make His Message Stick

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is preparing to wage the final weeks of the midterm campaign with a theme he has been hammering for months -- a plea that voters not embrace the Republican policies of the past. But the specifics of his closing argument remain in flux as the White House searches for a way to frame the message that connects with voters.
In the face of a surge in Republican enthusiasm, the sagging economy and high unemployment, Mr. Obama and his advisers are betting he can give disillusioned Democrats a reason to vote in November. On Friday, the president began a two-week tour of nine Democratic strongholds around the country, putting the strength of his presidential victories in those states to the test on behalf of his Democratic allies.
But a White House that once envisioned a fall campaign proudly proclaiming the benefits of health care and financial reform is now using the presidential megaphone mostly as a warning device, offering a full-throated critique of a Republican return to power. 
''It's a complicated task in a sense; they have been trying to refine their message,'' said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, who is in a close race for a second term. ''What they are trying to do is get the voters to ask, 'What's the choice?' They created this mess, we're cleaning it up. You have got to stay with us. I think that's the bottom-line message.''
The challenge for the president has been to find a way to tailor that argument so it resonates with a public that is deeply skeptical of both parties and frustrated by the lack of economic progress in the first half of Mr. Obama's term. To do that, he has made adjustments to his political talking points since Labor Day, when he became fully engaged in the all-out effort to save the Democratic majorities in Congress.
For two months, Mr. Obama has sought a foil to serve as the face of the Republican opposition. He briefly cited former President George W. Bush before shifting to a focus on Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader who would most likely become House speaker if his party won control. More recently, the president has taken aim at Karl Rove, the former Bush strategist, hoping that his work raising money for candidates this year makes him an effective bridge between the present and the past.
Mr. Obama has at times focused his attention on the Republican ''Pledge to America'' and the fight over extending tax cuts for the middle class and the wealthy. And most recently, he has warned about the dangers of undisclosed money from foreign countries flowing into conservative political organizations.
Mr. Obama raised the stakes on that argument at a rally in Maryland last week, warning that ''groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections, and they won't tell you where the money for their ads comes from.'' He called the flow of undisclosed money from corporations and big business a ''threat to our democracy.''
Senior White House officials say the shifts in how the message is cast are a conscious effort to find new ways to make the president's argument stay fresh and in the news. And they say public polling in the last several weeks has confirmed that the strategy is working. The overall Republican advantage has narrowed in some polls, and some Democratic candidates seem less endangered than they did six weeks ago, though that trend to some degree reflects a natural tightening of races in the final weeks as more voters become engaged.
''The president has been making a clear and consistent argument throughout this campaign season,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''This election is a choice between continuing to move our economy forward and going back to the policies that created the economic crisis, damaged the middle class and gave free rein to the special interests.''
But to some, including some Democrats, the president appears to be casting about for a workable answer to the anger and frustration that could fuel Republican victories across the country.
James Carville, the former adviser to President Bill Clinton who is known for his stick-to-one-message advice about ''the economy, stupid,'' said in an interview that Mr. Obama still seemed to be searching for the right way to make the argument. Mr. Carville said he needed to find a way to connect the issue of jobs to the conservative groups raising money from undisclosed sources.
''My sense is they are flirting with the right girl here. They are just a little clumsy,'' Mr. Carville said. ''Why would the organizations whose agenda is outsourcing put in $75 million into the campaign? Ask yourself that.''
Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama's message was the result of an inability to campaign on a positive economic message. ''Clearly, the administration is trying to divert attention, but all it's doing is bringing attention to the fact that they really don't have a clear or effective message to close out the campaign,'' Mr. McKinnon said.
At a public forum on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama struggled to answer a friendly question from an activist about what the ''overarching message'' for Democrats should be. He took five and a half minutes to say they should tell voters that the election is a choice, and that Democrats stand for tax cuts for the middle class, for companies investing in America instead of overseas, for good educations without excessive debt and for ''innovation, research and development, skilled workers, lifelong learning.''
Mr. Obama concluded with a return to his basic message. ''And what the other side stands for are the same failed policies that got us into this mess in the first place,'' he said.
Mr. Carville and Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, criticized that message in a recent polling memorandum. They said it was ''painfully weaker'' than the other ones they tested in surveys. ''Compared to the other messages, it falls very short,'' they concluded, saying it does little with ''winnable voters'' across the country and ''cannot extend the Democratic vote.''
Instead, Mr. Carville and Mr. Greenberg said Mr. Obama could help win over undecided voters with a promise to change Washington on behalf of the middle class and to oppose tax breaks for companies that export jobs.
Mr. Connolly, the Virginia lawmaker, said of Mr. Obama's political efforts, ''He's got different roles to play in this very volatile political environment.'' He added: ''It's not easy to navigate your way in troubled waters. I think they are trying to do the best they can.''

HEADLINE: Russia Says It Will Build Nuclear Plant For Venezuela

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- President Dmitri A. Medvedev said Friday that Russia planned to build the first nuclear power plant in Venezuela, and that the United States should not object because Russia's intentions were ''absolutely pure and open.'' 
The deal was announced during a state visit to Moscow by Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, and is in keeping with a push by Russian businesses to expand sales of reactors and nuclear fuel around the world. Just in August, Russia completed work on Iran's first nuclear power plant.
''I don't know who will shudder at this,'' Mr. Medvedev said at a meeting with Mr. Chavez, coyly noting the possibility of American concerns about transferring nuclear technology to Mr. Chavez's government, which has long been at odds with the United States. Venezuela, like Iran, is brimming with energy from oil and natural gas, possibly raising concerns about its motives.
''The president said there will be countries in which this will provoke different emotions, but I want to say specially that our intentions are absolutely pure and open,'' Mr. Medvedev said.
Mr. Chavez was here to negotiate a variety of oil and other economic deals, in addition to the nuclear agreement. Energy officials from both countries also signed an inter-governmental agreement approving BP's plan to sell assets in Venezuela to a Russian joint venture, a sale intended to help pay gulf spill lawsuits.
Russia first offered Venezuela nuclear power in 2008, during an intense spell of anti-Western sentiment in Moscow after the war with Georgia. The agreement on Friday fleshed out that offer.
It specified that the Russian state nuclear power company, Rosatom, would build one nuclear plant with two large pressurized water reactors to generate power, and one small research reactor to make medical isotopes and what was described as nuclear materials that could be useful as pesticides for agriculture.
Mr. Medvedev said Friday that Russia would help Venezuela build ''an entire range of energy opportunities.'' He added that ''even such an oil- and gas-rich country as Venezuela needs new sources of energy.''
The timing on the deal was vague, and it remains unclear whether the cost and scientific expertise for a nuclear program are outside of Venezuela's reach, even with Russian help.
In comments Friday, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the chief executive of Rosatom, left open a wide range of possibilities for when Russia might begin work on a new nuclear power plant. ''It could be in ten years; it could be sooner,'' Mr. Kiriyenko said, adding that the smaller research reactor would be the priority for now.
The deepening of Russia's nuclear cooperation with Venezuela marks only one of dozens of nuclear deals for Russia in recent years. Russia's commercial interests lie in building nuclear power reactors and selling fuel around the world. As a legacy of the cold war, Russia has 40 percent of the world's uranium enrichment capacity, far more than it needs for its domestic industry.
After the meetings on Friday, Mr. Chavez promoted some trade opportunities of his own.
At a news conference with the Russian president, he pulled out a chocolate bar and a bottle of jam made of bananas, and suggested that Russians might like to try those Venezuelan products.

HEADLINE: Lending Magnate Settles Charges For $67 Million

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, once the nation's largest mortgage lender, agreed to pay $67.5 million on Friday to settle a civil fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year.
Countrywide itself is paying $20 million of Mr. Mozilo's $67.5 million payment as part of an indemnification agreement he has with the company.
As part of the settlement, Mr. Mozilo, 71, also agreed to be permanently banned from serving as an officer or a director at any public company.
Federal authorities have been criticized for ineffectively policing Wall Street in the years leading up to the financial crisis and the settlement with Mr. Mozilo represents a significant milestone for the government. 
Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs paid a $550 million fine to settle securities fraud charges. Securities regulators are also investigating former senior executives at Merrill Lynch for possible securities fraud.
While securities fraud cases are complex and often difficult to win, analysts have taken the government to task at times for not moving even more aggressively against Wall Street in the wake of the credit debacle.
Still, the settlement by Mr. Mozilo is the first time that a prominent executive has been penalized personally for financial excesses linked to a mortgage boom that, when it went bust, threatened to topple the economy and led to an unprecedented wave of foreclosures.
The deal came just four days before a jury trial was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles. David Sambol, the former president of Countrywide, and Eric Sieracki, the former chief financial officer, were also sued by the S.E.C. Both men settled their cases Friday as well; Mr. Sambol agreed to pay $5.52 million and Mr. Sieracki consented to $130,000. Mr. Sambol also is barred for three years from serving at a public company.
Mr. Mozilo's agreement with the government is a humbling moment for one of the country's most audacious and flamboyant financiers.
For years, Mr. Mozilo was among the highest-paid executives in America and his S.E.C. fine is a fraction of the vast wealth he amassed running Countrywide. In one eight-year period, from 2000 until he left the company in 2008, Mr. Mozilo received total compensation of $521.5 million, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.
The son of a Bronx butcher, Mr. Mozilo started Countrywide in 1969 with David Loeb, who died in 2003; together the men built the company into a mortgage lending behemoth with $11.4 billion in revenue at its peak in 2006.
But Countrywide's foray into subprime lending and other risky loans led to its downfall, and in early 2008, hobbled by mounting losses on loans, the company was purchased by Bank of America in a fire sale.
When the S.E.C. sued Mr. Mozilo, Mr. Sambol and Mr. Sieracki in June 2009, it accused the men of hiding growing risks in Countrywide's operations from investors.
The complaint also contended that Mr. Mozilo and Mr. Sambol improperly generated profits on insider stock sales even though they were aware of Countrywide's deepening financial woes. Mr. Mozilo generated $140 million in gains on stock that he sold from November 2006 through October 2007, the S.E.C. said.
Mr. Mozilo's lawyers declined to comment on the settlement.
In its complaint, the S.E.C. cited a series of e-mails written by Mr. Mozilo starting in 2006 that decried some of Countrywide's lending practices even as the company's executives publicly boasted about its high-quality loans.
''In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product,'' Mr. Mozilo wrote in an April 17, 2006, e-mail to Mr. Sambol, referring to loans that allowed borrowers with poor credit histories to buy homes without putting any money down.
Mr. Mozilo also warned his colleagues about the dangers of a popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage that let borrowers pay a fraction of the typical monthly charge. In an April 2006 e-mail, Mr. Mozilo wrote that he had ''personally observed a serious lack of compliance within our origination system as it relates to documentation and generally a deterioration in the quality of loans originated.''
In another April 2006 e-mail, Mr. Mozilo noted that his colleague Mr. Sambol considered the company's subprime second mortgages ''the 'milk' of the business. Frankly, I consider that product line to be the poison of ours,'' he said.
Mr. Mozilo and his colleagues neither admitted nor denied the government's charges. The payment by Mr. Mozilo will consist of $22.5 million in civil penalties and $45 million in disgorged stock profits. Mr. Sambol agreed to pay $520,000 in penalties and $5 million in disgorgement. Countrywide is paying for all of Mr. Sambol's disgorged funds; Bank of America has been paying Mr. Mozilo's legal fees, and the $20 million Countrywide is paying on his behalf applies to stock profits he was forced to give up.
James D. Cox, professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the settlement was on the high end for an individual corporate officer. ''We're used to seeing $100 million settlements when it's against Goldman Sachs or after-hours trading of mutual funds,'' he said, ''but we don't usually see eight-figure settlements with individuals.''
The settlement was also good for the government, Mr. Cox said. ''This is not a slam dunk; it's a risky case and it's got a lot of complexities to it.''
Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in a statement: ''Mozilo's record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite -- a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasing risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies and a deteriorating business model.''
Mr. Mozilo's trial had been widely anticipated because it represented one of the few public prosecutions of a major participant in the mortgage crisis. Both the defense and the prosecution faced big risks if they lost at trial, legal experts said, and this may have led them to reach a settlement.
The terms of the settlements were approved by John F. Walter, the federal judge overseeing the case in California's central district court. After reading the details of the settlement, Mr. Walter said, ''I would have been interested to see what a jury would have decided. Because of the settlement, as is often the case, we'll never know.''
None of the defendants attended the hearing in the Los Angeles courtroom Friday. Both Mr. Sambol and Mr. Sieracki had two lawyers there to represent them; Mr. Mozilo was represented by five lawyers.
The outcome of the trial would have had enormous consequences for both sides. Had the S.E.C. won, it would have helped the agency re-establish its reputation as an investor advocate.
A win would also have been crucial for Mr. Mozilo, legal experts say, because a criminal prosecution might have followed a loss in the civil case.
Walter F. Brown Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Sambol, said, ''Mr. Sambol has agreed to settle the S.E.C. lawsuit and put the matter behind him for the benefit of his family and loved ones.''
Shirli Fabbri Weiss, Mr. Sieracki's lawyer, noted that the S.E.C. did not pursue any fraud claims against her client and that he, unlike Mr. Mozilo and Mr. Sambol, was not being barred from serving at a public company.

HEADLINE: Giving Foreclosures Closer Scrutiny

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''From This House, a National Foreclosure Freeze'' (front page, Oct. 15):
It isn't surprising that in GMAC Mortgage's rush to foreclose, it failed to do its due diligence. If the scrutiny of the banking industry after the start of the current financial crisis told us anything, it is that any trust we may have in the responsible behavior of the banking industry is folly.
It surprises me that banks remove people from homes that often subsequently remain empty or are sold for a pittance. They do this rather than make humane arrangements with homeowners to pay what they can until their finances recover. 
And perhaps the even bigger surprise is the Democrats' and the Obama administration's consistent support of the banks above the interests and needs of the American people.
If we can't get support for people in trouble from a Democratic president and Congress in such perilous financial times, it's not hard to see why voters aren't motivated to go to the polls to keep the Democrats in power.
Martin M. Beitler New York, Oct. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''The Mortgage Morass,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Oct. 15):
I have represented two people in a ''deed of trust'' state who were wrongfully foreclosed. In deed-of-trust states, the courts don't get involved unless the homeowner sues, and such a suit is difficult and expensive to pursue because the homeowner must obtain an injunction against the foreclosing entity.
Very few of these suits are successful, as the financially stressed homeowners bear the burden of proof. In deed-of-trust states, therefore, foreclosures move faster and without much judicial scrutiny.
Most of the publicity about voluntary suspensions of foreclosures has been about states where judicial foreclosures put the burden on the lender (where it belongs) to prove it has the right to foreclose. I suspect that the foreclosure problem is as bad, or worse, in deed-of-trust states because of the ease with which foreclosures can be processed.

To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Will Veto Notary Bill That Could Speed Foreclosures'' (Business Day, Oct. 8):
We urge President Obama to reconsider the claims that the Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act (H.R. 3808) will make it easier for banks to foreclose on homeowners and focus on what its author, Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama, has announced as its purpose.
The bill was introduced to enable documents like depositions, affidavits and powers of attorney that are validly notarized in one state to be recognized in the courts of another state and not be rejected for failure to conform precisely with the sometimes very particular rules in the state of destination.
It would not force one state to accept the less rigorously performed notarizations of another state, because any notarized document presented in any court is subject to rebuttal upon submission of discrediting evidence.
H.R. 3808 merely says that a court shall recognize any ''lawful'' notarization performed by a notary public. Thus the courts would not be compelled to recognize the improper and illegal notarial acts currently at the center of the foreclosure dispute.
The bill corrects the practice of some courts of arbitrarily rejecting otherwise valid and legal notarial acts performed by honest and impartial notaries who have done their job correctly.
There is a need for more uniformity among the 50 disparate notary codes of this nation, because they do at times pose a significant obstacle to commerce and law. The Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act is just the latest attempt at achieving such a needed unification.

HEADLINE: Where G.O.P. Leaves Blanks, Obama Fills Them In

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In speech after speech lately, President Obama has vowed to oppose a Republican proposal ''to cut education by 20 percent,'' a reduction that would ''eliminate 200,000 children from Head Start programs'' and ''reduce financial aid for eight million college students.''
Except that strictly speaking, the Republicans have made no such proposal. The expansive but vague Pledge to America produced by House Republicans does promise deep cuts in domestic spending, but it gives no further detail about which programs would be slashed. So Mr. Obama has filled in his own details as if they were in the Republican plan.
With the midterm Congressional campaign heading into the home stretch, Mr. Obama and the Republicans are engaged in a profound debate about the proper size and scope of government. To Democrats, the Republican platform is misleading in a fundamental sense, masking the depth of spending cuts while ignoring deficits when it comes to tax breaks for the wealthy. But in making his case, the president at times has presented selective characterizations of Republican positions, according to a review of his campaign speeches. 
On issues like taxes, Social Security, health care, economic stimulus and foreign campaign financing, Republicans say Mr. Obama has distorted their ideas or the facts to scare voters. White House officials deny that, saying that the Republicans have been inconsistent about their own proposals and that the president is merely pointing out the adverse consequences that Republicans want to avoid discussing.
''I think we're 100 percent in the right here,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''They made a whole bunch of pledges about saving money and cutting the deficit and all of that, when they didn't have the details and didn't want to talk about the details.''
Politicians and their surrogates commonly stretch or omit facts to make points during campaigns, and Mr. Obama has seen his opponents make many unfounded assertions about him and his policies, whether by questioning his Christianity or by claiming that his health care plan included ''death panels.''
But as he tries to rally his party for the midterm election against the odds, Mr. Obama is employing the biggest megaphone in politics, and his words are parsed like no other politician's. While Mr. Obama's general points about the scale of Republican spending cuts and fiscal effects of high-end tax cuts have a solid factual basis, some independent organizations that examine political statements, like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, have questioned the veracity of some specific claims on economic policy and other topics.
Most of the disputed statements concern the Pledge to America, the House Republican campaign manifesto. ''The centerpiece of the pledge is a $700 billion tax cut that would only go to the top 2 percent, the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans,'' Mr. Obama said in Philadelphia. ''Ninety-eight percent of you would not get this tax cut.''
Mr. Obama was referring to a dispute over how to extend the reduced federal income tax rates enacted under the Bush administration, which expire Dec. 31. Republicans support extending the lower rates for all taxpayers; Mr. Obama and the Republicans agree on preserving the reduced rates for the lower 98 percent, and differ only on whether to do so for the top 2 percent as well, covering income over $250,000 for a married couple.
''We want to stop a tax hike that would hit every American taxpayer,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner. ''So, that 98 percent figure is bogus.''
Bill Burton, a White House spokesman, defended the president's characterization. ''Every fact in that statement is true,'' he said. ''We have a significant disagreement about the central premise of their economic policy, which is their plan to extend an average tax cut of $100,000 to every millionaire and billionaire in the country.''
Mr. Obama also chides Republicans for wanting to ''borrow $700 billion from the Chinese or from the Saudis or somebody'' to pay for that part of the tax reduction over the next 10 years. He does not mention the cost of the tax reduction for the other 98 percent of taxpayers -- more than $3 trillion -- which would also require borrowing as long as the budget remains in deficit.
In attacking the Republican calls for spending cuts, the president is defining them where Republicans fail to do so. The Republican pledge promises to return overall spending on domestic programs to 2008 levels, which would mean cutting roughly $100 billion a year. But the pledge does not say which programs would be cut to achieve that; all it does is specify that no cuts would be made to national security programs, entitlement payments like Medicare, or interest on the national debt.
That means, the White House said, that the $100 billion cut would amount to a 20 percent reduction in domestic programs, so it is fair to extrapolate the effects on education, Head Start, college aid and other programs. Republicans said they could choose to cut more deeply in some programs while sparing others, so education would not necessarily be cut 20 percent. At the same time, they do not rule it out.
Aides to Mr. Obama said Republicans have been inconsistent on the issue, pointing to comments by some party leaders characterizing the cuts as ''across the board,'' implying that the party would not discriminate among programs. ''We should know exactly what the Republicans want to cut, if not education,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said.
Another area where Mr. Obama and Republicans have skirmished over what their plans mean is their proposal to cancel remaining stimulus spending. In a recent Internet address, Mr. Obama said that the Republicans would ''scrap all the incentives for clean energy projects, including those currently under way.''
Republicans said that was untrue. According to Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Republican campaign effort, the part of the pledge that promises to ''cancel unspent 'stimulus' funds'' refers only to money that is ''unobligated.'' That means, he said, that money that has already been committed would still be paid out, even if it has not yet been spent. Only $18 billion of the $787 billion stimulus program remains unobligated.
But Republicans have previously suggested that they would cancel far more stimulus spending than that. As recently as August, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, a Republican chief deputy whip, said the party would cancel $260 billion in stimulus spending. Mr. Buck said that was now an outdated figure, and the official party platform would not halt any projects that were already in motion. ''Bottom line, his assertion is false,'' Mr. Buck said of the president's claim.

HEADLINE: Obama and Biden Stump for Delaware Candidate

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WILMINGTON, Del. -- Chris Coons, the Democratic Senate candidate in Delaware, is far ahead in state polls, yet both President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were here on Friday to give him a hand and to keep attention on his rival, Christine O'Donnell, as a symbol of Tea Party Republican candidates across the country.
''I don't want anybody here taking this for granted,'' Mr. Obama told about 1,000 supporters at the Grand Opera House. ''This is a tough political environment right now.'' 
Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Biden mentioned Ms. O'Donnell by name. But she has become well known nationally for her controversial views since she upset the Republican establishment candidate, Michael N. Castle, last month. Mr. Castle, a congressman and former governor, had been heavily favored to win the party primary and the general election, given his broad support and moderate views.
Now Mr. Coons, the executive of populous New Castle County, is up 15 points in two recent state polls. In several other states, Tea Party victories over establishment Republicans are seen as having increased Democrats' chances of winning Senate seats, reducing Republicans' chances of seizing control.
Gov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, said the president and vice president had come because ''it's a great opportunity to highlight the difference between solid Democratic candidates like Chris Coons, who have a track record of creating jobs in the private sector, and these Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right.''
Mr. Obama also came here out of deference to Mr. Biden, who held the Senate seat for 36 years. He paid tribute to his vice president in familiar terms, but the praise assumed larger meaning after recent speculation -- denied by the White House -- that Mr. Obama might replace Mr. Biden as his running mate for 2012.
''The single best decision that I have made was selecting Joe Biden as my running mate,'' Mr. Obama said, provoking a standing ovation as he turned to shake hands and embrace Mr. Biden. ''Joe has been an extraordinary vice president, a great friend, a fighter, somebody who knows what our core mission is, which is making sure that we are growing this economy on behalf of the middle class so they start to live out the American dream.''
Mr. Biden, in introducing Mr. Obama, said, ''We've become genuinely good friends, close friends.''
Mr. Obama, who is beginning a period of intensive travel to encourage the party faithful in the less than three weeks before Election Day, twice brought the audience to its feet. Citing gains on health care, college aid and small business assistance, Mr. Obama said, ''Don't let them tell you change isn't possible. Don't let them convince you we have not made progress.''
He assailed what he said was undisclosed money ''pouring in'' to Republicans from wealthy interests, saying, ''The only way to match their millions of dollars is with millions of voices.''
Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Biden had thought when they took office amid the worst recession in decades, with millions unemployed, that both parties would put politics aside for the good of the country. But, he said, ''the Republican leaders in Washington made a different decision.''
''They had made such a big mess that they figured it was going to take some time to repair the economy, longer than any of us would like. They knew the people would be frustrated, they knew people would be angry,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And they figured if they just sat on the sidelines and opposed us every step of the way, if they said no even to policies that they could agree with, that historically they had supported, that people might forget that they were the ones who had caused the mess, and that people's anger and frustration would lead them to success in the next election.''
But Mr. Obama was quick to distinguish between those Republicans and ''a whole lot of Republicans all across the country'' who, he said, would have preferred bipartisanship in the emergency. That distinction perhaps reflected that the audience included some local Republicans who have endorsed Mr. Coons rather than support Ms. O'Donnell.
''You put flakes in a cereal box, not in the Senate,'' said Nathan Hayward III, a Republican who previously was a budget director to former Gov. Pete DuPont, a Republican.

HEADLINE: Forget the Downturn; Punish the Lazybones

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
IN the new ABC series ''No Ordinary Family'' an affluent couple, Jim and Stephanie Powell (Michael Chiklis and Julie Benz), living with their teenage children in Modernist splendor in Los Angeles, struggle with the pressures of careerism. Stephanie is a research scientist who works 80-hour weeks and answers to barracudas. She's the kind of person who, with the best of intentions, will plan to meet you for dinner at 8, call at 8:10 to say that she's running late and then realize at 10:15 that she won't be able to make it until possibly the next leap year. She rarely has time to talk to her husband and doesn't realize that her son has learning difficulties. All of this is presented as a problem in need of a solution. 
In an effort to reconnect, the Powells decide to take a trip to Brazil, where Stephanie is headed for business. The plane crash that follows ought to be a signal to scale back, but instead it spurs them on to more fantastical feats of accomplishment, investing each of them, they soon discover, with superhuman strengths. Stephanie doesn't actually have to slow down and move the family to the Redwoods now, because she has sped up, literally: she can run miles in seconds. Her troubled son becomes a genius. Under the guise of offering lessons in the dangers of overscheduling, ''No Ordinary Family'' salutes an addiction to work.
The series is one of a number now on television to break with a long strain of tradition by casting ambition as something healthy, positive, redemptive and even honorable, and its absence an agent of ostentatious humiliation. During the past decade the dramas that helped define television -- ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Wire,'' ''Damages'' -- equated professional striving with dark moral deficiency, while comedies like ''Sex and the City'' and ''Friends'' imagined the urban playground as the great priority of adult life.
The recession, though, appears to have prompted a re-evaluation. In recent years the eager embrace of the capitalist impulse has largely been found in competitive reality television, where aggressive contest is thrilling and good, and the will to achieve is the lifeblood of the American way. Shows like ''The Apprentice'' and ''Top Chef'' pump this notion into us as if it were an intravenous narcotic. But during the downturn, fictional television has become an enabler of a similar spirit, administering the drug even when it doesn't necessarily intend to.
During the bleak days of the 1970s economy, characters were mostly committed to just getting by. But today a show like ''Undercovers,'' a caper from J. J. Abrams on NBC, is a tribute to advanced multitasking. Here an attractive young couple who have retired from the C.I.A. to spend more time together embark on the fantasy Plan B career of so many overburdened yuppies: gourmet food. Steven and Samantha Bloom (Boris Kodjoe and Gugu Mbatha-Raw) run a catering business but, quickly bored by hours of menu planning, return to jetting around the world fighting terrorism even as they continue to do inventive things with shrimp for parties of 200.
In the last century both high and low culture, in novels like ''The House of Mirth'' and ''Absalom, Absalom!'' and movies like ''Stella Dallas'' and ''Election,'' leveled harsh judgment on those who aspire to too much. Raw ambition isn't merely regarded with distaste, as it is in many cubicles; it warrants existential punishment.
In the most simplistic sense ''Mad Men,'' which concludes its fourth season on Sunday, has embraced that sensibility, warning against extreme sacrifice in the name of success. Don Draper has risen at great cost, leveraging the stuff of genuine happiness: selfhood, connection, intimacy, truth. This past season, though, the series has exacted a cruel toll on the limply driven (and rewarded determined characters like the secretary turned copywriter Peggy). In a moment of black comedy a lifer secretary who slept her way to the middle, never even mastering message taking, drops dead at her desk.
More profoundly felt has been the fate of Roger Sterling (John Slattery), whose patrician ease devolved into a contempt for work so egregious that his laziness threatened to dissolve the agency. The price he pays is not simply the prospect of never again getting a table at Jimmy's La Grange but also the loss of Joan Harris, (Christina Hendricks), the wise lover he deeply prefers to his vapid wife.
And yet the indignities that befall him seem fairly trivial compared with what goes on in the present-day world of Dillon, Tex., rendered so poignantly on ''Friday Night Lights.'' (The series begins its fifth season, on DirecTV, next week, before being repeated on NBC later in the year.) Here success is defined by what happens on the high school football field and, beyond that, by one's willingness to leave for places more prosperous. Life becomes baroquely grim for those who don't.
Arguably no character on television has suffered more ritual abjection than Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch), a former high school football star, who imagined, naively, that his quiet dreams and generous, sloppy spirit would set him on the course to a decent life. A good guy with no desire to get out of town, Riggins hoped merely for the keg never to run dry, for his girl to stick around (she eventually left) and for a plot of West Texas land to call his own. Though he has spent much of the series doing nice things for people, he has been compensated only with mounting penalties; the most severe was delivered last season when he was sentenced to prison for his reluctant participation in his brother's chop shop, an enterprise meant to help pay his sister-in-law's medical expenses.
''Friday Night Lights,'' explicitly in its gridiron metaphors and implicitly in its characters' destinies, is an instruction in the dangers of refusing to barrel through one's limitations. Tim gives up on college the minute he gets there and has to read ''The Odyssey.'' In the current era of near-double-digit unemployment, the show forecloses any real pathway to a viable middle class life. In its own subversively elitist way it offers the promise of bright futures only to those who educate themselves at fine universities beyond Dillon's borders.
''Friday Night Lights'' is one of many series that venerate ambition in part by default, degrading characters who lack it. Riggins is like a teenage version of Ray Drecker (Thomas Jane) on the HBO series ''Hung,'' in which a financially ailing coach not only loses his wife because of his inability to set real goals but is also reduced to selling sexual companionship to bossy Detroit women to round out his paycheck.
''Hung'' can trace its lineage to ''Weeds,'' the Showtime comedy about a drug-dealing widowed suburban mother, Nancy Botwin (Mary Louise Parker), which made its debut in 2005 during the days of the easy no-money-down economy. Initially Nancy, as if a stand-in for brokers in phantom-dollar mortgage-backed securities, did well effortlessly, selling pot to her stoner neighbors in Southern California. But the years have been unkind to her. In the current season she is on the lam, living in motels; one of her three children is a murderer and possible psychopath; and other family members are turning to state-fair butter-eating contests in the hope of winning an R.V.
A chronic underachiever who couldn't fathom the concept of legitimate employment, Nancy has completely lost the respect of her children. She is chastised early in the current season by her oldest son, who rails on her for never having the sort of regular job that would have spared them their crisis. Jabbing harder, her middle son tells her that the problem isn't that she became a drug dealer, but that she never even tried to be a good one. Forced into wage labor, Nancy becomes a hotel maid cleaning up after messy acts of sadomasochistic sex.
On some level this all feels like character abuse. Shows like ''Weeds'' are gothic morality tales about the high price of messing up, at a time when messing up amounts to little more than the failure to build a decent resume. It's a three-second miler's world, and you're just slacking in it.

HEADLINE: How to Erase the Lost Decade?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S been a rough decade for the stock market -- even when considering its recent rally. But frustrated investors can at least fall back on a comforting thought: that the market will eventually ''revert to the mean,'' or snap back to its historical average returns.
Or can they? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be ''not necessarily'' -- or at least ''not immediately.'' For starters, while it's true that the past decade has been unusually difficult for stocks, theoretically setting the stage for a rebound, the same can't be said for the last 20 years. 
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, points out that over 20-year periods since 1919, the average annual price gain for stocks has been 6.8 percent. And even with the market's losses from 2000 to this year, the S.& P. 500-stock index has still appreciated 7.8 percent a year, on average, in the most recent 20-year stretch. When you factor in dividends, the market has performed even better: up around 10 percent a year, on average.
''On a 20-year basis, we're only now getting back to the mean,'' Mr. Stovall said. This would imply that the market, despite the so-called lost decade of the 2000s, isn't necessarily coiled like a spring, ready to explode higher.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, also finds little immediate comfort in the prospect of reverting to the mean. He argues that the go-nowhere market of the last dozen years is itself such a reversion, but in a negative fashion -- in response to the booming bull markets of the 1980s and '90s.
To be sure, it's extremely rare for stocks to lose ground over the course of an entire decade, especially when you factor in dividends. So the laws of probability would suggest that stocks are likely to perform better in the coming 10 years than they did in the past 10.
But even if stocks start to rebound, John S. Osterweis, president of Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco, wonders, ''Which mean will stocks revert to?''
In theory, stocks could revisit their long-term historical total return of around 10 percent a year, going back to 1926. But several market strategists and historians say domestic stocks will have a hard time producing such returns in the coming years.
For example, stock performance over the past century includes the time when the United States market was evolving from an emerging player in the global economy to the world's economic superpower. Elroy Dimson, a finance professor at the London Business School, argues that because this early period of growth can't be replicated, investors ought to brace for more modest returns.
At the same time, some market strategists worry that using more recent averages -- for instance, the nearly 11 percent annualized total returns for stocks since 1980 or the 9 percent since 1990 -- is also misleading.
That's because those returns reflect a historic drop in interest rates and inflation, both of which served as major tail winds for stocks. Those trends were also coupled with an huge climb in market valuation that isn't likely to be repeated, says Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif.
He says that instead of waiting for stock performance to return to the mean, investors would do better to pay attention to whether price-to-earnings ratios are reverting to long-term averages.
That could take a while. Mr. Arnott uses 10-year averaged earnings to calculate the market's P/E, a conservative method that smoothes out extreme swings in corporate profits. The method is favored by Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist.
Despite the market's recent troubles, its P/E ratio, based on this method, currently stands at 21. That's significantly higher than the long-term average of 16 for domestic stocks.
Until that changes, stocks are likely to be in store for below-average returns, Mr. Arnott argues. In fact, since 1900, whenever P/E ratios have ranged from 16 to 24, stocks have gained about 7 percent, annualized, on a nominal basis -- or 4 percent after inflation -- in the following 10-year stretch.
For his part, Mr. Arnott says he thinks that stocks are likely to produce total returns of about 6 percent a year. He comes to that figure by taking the current 2 percent dividend yield for the S.& P. 500 and adding it to the long-term earnings growth rate of around 4 percent.
Whatever figure turns out to be right, the bottom line is that ''people should ratchet down their expectations for stocks,'' he said.
''There's no harm in hoping that things turn out better,'' Mr. Arnott added. ''But the danger is assuming and planning for the best while saving as if the market can do your work for you.''

HEADLINE: Income Inequality: Too Big To Ignore

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
PEOPLE often remember the past with exaggerated fondness. Sometimes, however, important aspects of life really were better in the old days.
During the three decades after World War II, for example, incomes in the United States rose rapidly and at about the same rate -- almost 3 percent a year -- for people at all income levels. America had an economically vibrant middle class. Roads and bridges were well maintained, and impressive new infrastructure was being built. People were optimistic.
By contrast, during the last three decades the economy has grown much more slowly, and our infrastructure has fallen into grave disrepair. Most troubling, all significant income growth has been concentrated at the top of the scale. The share of total income going to the top 1 percent of earners, which stood at 8.9 percent in 1976, rose to 23.5 percent by 2007, but during the same period, the average inflation-adjusted hourly wage declined by more than 7 percent. 
Yet many economists are reluctant to confront rising income inequality directly, saying that whether this trend is good or bad requires a value judgment that is best left to philosophers. But that disclaimer rings hollow. Economics, after all, was founded by moral philosophers, and links between the disciplines remain strong. So economists are well positioned to address this question, and the answer is very clear.
Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow. His first book, ''A Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' was published more than 25 years before his celebrated ''Wealth of Nations,'' which was itself peppered with trenchant moral analysis.
Some moral philosophers address inequality by invoking principles of justice and fairness. But because they have been unable to forge broad agreement about what these abstract principles mean in practice, they've made little progress. The more pragmatic cost-benefit approach favored by Smith has proved more fruitful, for it turns out that rising inequality has created enormous losses and few gains, even for its ostensible beneficiaries.
Recent research on psychological well-being has taught us that beyond a certain point, across-the-board spending increases often do little more than raise the bar for what is considered enough. A C.E.O. may think he needs a 30,000-square-foot mansion, for example, just because each of his peers has one. Although they might all be just as happy in more modest dwellings, few would be willing to downsize on their own.
People do not exist in a social vacuum. Community norms define clear expectations about what people should spend on interview suits and birthday parties. Rising inequality has thus spawned a multitude of ''expenditure cascades,'' whose first step is increased spending by top earners.
The rich have been spending more simply because they have so much extra money. Their spending shifts the frame of reference that shapes the demands of those just below them, who travel in overlapping social circles. So this second group, too, spends more, which shifts the frame of reference for the group just below it, and so on, all the way down the income ladder. These cascades have made it substantially more expensive for middle-class families to achieve basic financial goals.
In a recent working paper based on census data for the 100 most populous counties in the United States, Adam Seth Levine (a postdoctoral researcher in political science at Vanderbilt University), Oege Dijk (an economics Ph.D. student at the European University Institute) and I found that the counties where income inequality grew fastest also showed the biggest increases in symptoms of financial distress.
For example, even after controlling for other factors, these counties had the largest increases in bankruptcy filings.
Divorce rates are another reliable indicator of financial distress, as marriage counselors report that a high proportion of couples they see are experiencing significant financial problems. The counties with the biggest increases in inequality also reported the largest increases in divorce rates.
Another footprint of financial distress is long commute times, because families who are short on cash often try to make ends meet by moving to where housing is cheaper -- in many cases, farther from work. The counties where long commute times had grown the most were again those with the largest increases in inequality.
The middle-class squeeze has also reduced voters' willingness to support even basic public services. Rich and poor alike endure crumbling roads, weak bridges, an unreliable rail system, and cargo containers that enter our ports without scrutiny. And many Americans live in the shadow of poorly maintained dams that could collapse at any moment.
ECONOMISTS who say we should relegate questions about inequality to philosophers often advocate policies, like tax cuts for the wealthy, that increase inequality substantially. That greater inequality causes real harm is beyond doubt.
But are there offsetting benefits?
There is no persuasive evidence that greater inequality bolsters economic growth or enhances anyone's well-being. Yes, the rich can now buy bigger mansions and host more expensive parties. But this appears to have made them no happier. And in our winner-take-all economy, one effect of the growing inequality has been to lure our most talented graduates to the largely unproductive chase for financial bonanzas on Wall Street.
In short, the economist's cost-benefit approach -- itself long an important arrow in the moral philosopher's quiver -- has much to say about the effects of rising inequality. We need not reach agreement on all philosophical principles of fairness to recognize that it has imposed considerable harm across the income scale without generating significant offsetting benefits.
No one dares to argue that rising inequality is required in the name of fairness. So maybe we should just agree that it's a bad thing -- and try to do something about it.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Cash (or Borders)?

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and ANDREW MARTIN. 
Vikas Bajaj reported from New Delhi and Mumbai, India, and Andrew Martin reported from Purchase, N.Y.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India
A DAY after the Indian government started a campaign to give identification numbers to all its 1.2 billion citizens, Ajay Banga, the newly minted chief executive of MasterCard, arrived in town, eager to lend a hand.
The program will identify people based on fingerprints and retina scans, and could make it easier for the government to route food stamps and other payments to people below the poverty line.
Mr. Banga says he believes he has a simple way to process the payments: via the MasterCard network.
''I wasn't educated in the U.S.; I was educated in India. I understand what you are trying to do,'' he said during a news conference at the Trident Hotel, in the financial center here. ''I think it's a huge opportunity for our government and people and companies like ours.'' 
Though Mr. Banga has risen to the top ranks of American business, the roots of his success are firmly planted in India, where he was born, raised and got his start in business. His success at MasterCard may well depend on India, too.
Observing that 85 percent of the world's transactions are still in currency, he has declared a ''war on cash'' to nudge as many consumers as possible toward electronic payments, preferably processed by MasterCard. Although competition to handle payments is intense in the United States, the wider battlegrounds are in countries like India and Brazil, which have vast numbers of people without bank accounts, and a growing middle class.
Capturing only a small fraction of those customers -- with prepaid debit cards, mobile payment systems or credit cards -- could exponentially expand MasterCard's business and profits. ''Whether it's 200 million or 400 million, it's a lot of millions,'' says Mr. Banga, referring to estimates of the size of the emerging global middle class over the next five years or so.
Nevertheless, Mr. Banga, 50, is taking over MasterCard as it faces huge challenges, from new rules governing credit and debit cards in the United States to nimble new rivals offering online and wireless transactions. And, of course, there's Visa, its much larger rival.
''Visa and MasterCard are going to have to generate new business, and that's overseas,'' says David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. ''What you want to do is find new virgin territory where the margins aren't compromised by competition.''
In Mr. Banga, MasterCard believes it has found an ideal, if unconventional, candidate for tackling such tasks. A Sikh with a jet-black mustache and beard, Mr. Banga says he loves fine wine, the New York Mets, Lady Gaga, Elvis Presley and Sikh spirituals, in no particular order.
During a recent dinner of Southeast Asian food at the luxurious Imperial Hotel in New Delhi, he teased Vicky S. Bindra, a regional MasterCard president, for ordering khichdi, a simple Indian dish of rice and lentils. Mr. Banga ordered the $90 tasting menu and a $300 bottle of Tuscan wine. ''It's a $70 bottle in New York,'' he noted.
His globe-trotting identity and animated personality are in jarring contrast to previous MasterCard chief executives, who were typically buttoned up, American and, often, Ivy League-educated.
''He brings a different vibe, a different sense of urgency to the company,'' says Adam Frisch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''I expect MasterCard's velocity to change.''
For example, Mr. Banga shook up the company by declaring that any request to headquarters not acted upon in two weeks would be automatically approved -- a directive meant to speed decision-making.
For its first four decades of existence, MasterCard -- originally known as MasterCharge -- was owned by the nation's banks and was a reliable cash cow for them. Visa was also owned by the same banks, so there wasn't much head-to-head competition between the two.
Nonetheless, MasterCard developed a reputation for being more conservative and flat-footed than Visa. Not only was Visa more aggressive in pursuing the debit card market in the United States, which it has come to dominate, but it pushed ahead of MasterCard in the nascent prepaid-card market and in pursuing new business in developing countries in Latin America and Asia.
The differences became apparent when both companies went public -- MasterCard in 2006 and Visa in 2008. Mr. Frisch says investors believed that MasterCard had a ''phenomenal'' business model and a well-known brand. Indeed, MasterCard's stock price has risen more than fivefold since the company went public.
But when Visa went public in 2008, investors found that Visa's execution in important growth areas was even better. Visa's market capitalization is now nearly twice that of MasterCard.
Last year, MasterCard reported profit of $1.5 billion on $5.1 billion in revenue, compared with Visa's $2.4 billion in profit on revenue of $6.9 billion in the fiscal year ended in September 2009.
''Visa was perceived as a faster, more entrepreneurial company,'' Mr. Frisch says. ''It appeared that MasterCard was more satisfied with maintaining the status quo.''
Mr. Banga's hiring was a bold, though perhaps belated, effort by MasterCard's board to change all that.
MR. BANGA has made a long, circuitous journey to the leafy confines of Purchase, N.Y., where MasterCard's campus-like headquarters sits across the road from regal estates.
His mother was the first member of her family to earn a college degree; his father was an officer in the Indian army, and the family moved often. Mr. Bindra, the MasterCard executive who has known him for nearly a decade, says the family's military imprint is visible in Mr. Banga's continuing desire to please his parents.
Mr. Banga is also close to his older brother, Manvinder, who rose to the top ranks at Unilever and is now at the private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice in London. His sister, Deepa Dhodhi, lives in Houston and is a business manager for a trading house.
Once out of college, Mr. Banga began his career in management-level jobs in India for Nestle and PepsiCo, where he scrubbed toilets and breaded chicken at Kentucky Fried Chicken (then part of PepsiCo) to get a sense of what running a restaurant was like. He also got his first taste for American-style fast food and marketing.
Ivan Menezes, chief executive for North America at Diageo, the liquor conglomerate, first met Mr. Banga when they were 17 and studying at Delhi University. They had much in common: their fathers worked for the government, and both had older brothers who were ''legendary'' students, Mr. Menezes says.
Even then, he says, Mr. Banga stood out for his smarts and his ability ''to connect with people.''
Later, they attended graduate school together, and both joined Nestle in 1981, when it had a relatively small footprint in India. ''They sent you out for the first 18 months in the most remote parts of India,'' says Mr. Menezes, who is also Diageo's chairman for the Asia-Pacific region. ''We exchanged horror stories.''
Nevertheless, it was a heady time. Every product they introduced seemed to catch fire, and nearly every night they would socialize with a close group of friends. ''We kind of sat next to each other and worked hard and partied hard,'' he says. ''What you see today is the same Ajay.''
Mr. Banga joined Citigroup in 1996 and quickly rose through the ranks, hopscotching the globe along the way. He moved his family -- his wife, Ritu, and two daughters -- to London, Brussels, Hong Kong and New York.
Dinyar S. Devitre, who was in charge of Europe and the Middle East for Citigroup, hired Mr. Banga as his right-hand man in the late 1990s. He praises Mr. Banga's smarts and his ability to take on difficult tasks. For example, after Mr. Devitre assigned him to take over Citi's relatively small operations in Central Europe and the Middle East, Mr. Banga built them into major businesses.
''He made things happen; he made whole cloth out of the businesses in those markets,'' Mr. Devitre says. ''He knows how to navigate a path through obstacles by getting the cooperation of the people he is working with.''
From 2000 to 2002, he ran CitiFinancial in New York, which offers mortgages and other consumer loans. When Mr. Banga arrived, the division was being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for possible predatory lending practices. His task was to clean up the unit, which became part of Citigroup in an acquisition. The inquiry eventually resulted in Citigroup agreeing to a $215 million settlement in 2002.
From 2002 to 2005, he oversaw North American retail banking, a vast network of branches and consumer products that included mortgages, student loans and car loans. He took over the international consumer business in 2005.
During his Citigroup tenure, the bank came under considerable fire for some of the mortgages and credit cards it offered, and for investments in exotic financial instruments. The latter nearly caused Citigroup to go under in 2008 and 2009, but the bank was propped up by a government bailout.
A Citigroup spokeswoman said Mr. Banga was not involved in mortgage-backed securities or other financial instruments that caused Citi's problems. When asked what he gleaned from its woes, Mr. Banga said he had nothing to do with them and declined further comment.
His last job was supervising Citi's highly lucrative Asia Pacific region from Hong Kong, where he oversaw China, Vietnam and other developing markets -- now fertile territory for MasterCard.
Mr. Devitre says he believes the fact that Mr. Banga is a Sikh has ultimately worked to his advantage, despite an occasional uncomfortable glance or comment. He says it takes a lot of conviction to wear a turban, a central tenet of Sikhism, at an American-based corporation. ''People look at him and say: 'He wears a turban and he made it to the top. He must be extraordinarily gifted.' ''
For all his international experience at Citi, Mr. Banga also traveled extensively in America, going to cities and towns from Shreveport, La., to Billings, Mont. He has decorated his relatively modest office in Purchase with souvenirs including a miniature cowboy boot from Dodge City, Kan., with a ''made in China'' sticker on the bottom.
AT Citigroup, Mr. Banga was on a short list of potential chief executives. But when MasterCard called in 2009, he was hired as chief operating officer with the understanding that he would soon run the company.
He took over on July 1, in one of the most difficult periods in MasterCard's history. The global recession had curbed credit card use, and the new government regulations have cut into the profitability of credit and debit cards -- and weighed down MasterCard's and Visa's stock prices.
At the same time, new technologies threaten to upend the traditional dominance of Visa, MasterCard and American Express, particularly as payments move to mobile devices. In India, banks and the government, for instance, are experimenting with mobile money transfer systems that could keep MasterCard and Visa -- and the fees that come with them -- out of the loop.
While acknowledging the obstacles, Mr. Banga says the challenges are far outweighed by the vast opportunities for electronic forms of payment.
Besides the opportunities in developing countries, many governments and companies are viewing plastic as a more efficient way to pay people, particularly those without bank accounts. Some Social Security payments are now available on MasterCard prepaid cards, as are some paychecks, school refunds and tax refunds.
''Cash is expensive; cash is inefficient,'' he says. ''You have to print it, transport it, secure it, store it and change it.''
During his recent visit to India, he announced an investment in an Indian payment processing company. But he was also looking for broader opportunities, like the identification program.
Of course, the Indian government could find other networks for payments. But MasterCard hopes that Mr. Banga's ability to glide among cultures, languages and borders gives it an edge.
Those skills were on display during his recent India trip. In Mumbai, speaking in Hindi, he joked with waiters who were trying to have him eat rasmalai, a rich, milk-based dessert flavored with cardamom and pistachios. ''If I do, will you come to the gym with me?'' he asked.
At a dinner in Delhi with colleagues from New York and Singapore, he spoke animatedly in English about how much he liked ''Freud's Last Session,'' an off-Broadway production about a hypothetical meeting between Sigmund Freud and C. S. Lewis.
Asked if his coming of age and his education in India might explain his success, Mr. Banga says, ''I really don't think that defines me.''
He also brushes off questions about his appearance. ''People say 'How does it feel to be looking like you, working in the West?' '' he notes.
Without skipping a beat, he replies in fluent Hindi: ''What difference does it make?''
Correction: October 24, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about MasterCard misstated the title of one of its executives, Vicky S. Bindra. He is president for the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region; he is not a regional manager.

HEADLINE: A Fine Italian Hand

BYLINE: By ALEXI WORTH

 BODY:
'Wait,'' Maurizio Cattelan says in his low, conspiratorial, Italian-accented voice. ''I have something for you.'' It's a warm July evening, and I am walking along the Hudson with the art world's most famous prankster, so I feel a double twinge of apprehension and curiosity when he reaches into the cotton bag at his side. Out comes a strange object: a life-size orange hand from which all the fingers except the erect middle one have been broken off. Obscene, goofy and eye-catching, the one-fingered hand looks like a cross between a gag-store novelty and a sex toy. To anyone else, it might well be a joke. To Cattelan, it's something entirely serious: a prototype for his next sculpture, which is to say, his next test of the public's equanimity. Cattelan passes the hand to me, and we continue strolling, talking about his plans. This being New York, pedestrians and joggers studiously avoid glancing at us, two men contemplating a rude, inexplicable object. 
A couple of months later in Milan, if everything went as planned, there would be no ignoring Cattelan's hand -- or rather a giant marble version of it, standing on a travertine pedestal 20 feet tall, right in front of the Stock Exchange. Cattelan's colossal highway salute has a wry title, ''L.O.V.E.,'' but by midsummer the Milanese, reading about the proposal in the local media, had already begun referring to it simply as ''Dito Medio,'' the middle finger. Inevitably, it would be a gift to the artist's critics, who are apt to dismiss his works as one-liners. The hand's broken fingers, though, hint that things are more complicated. Imagine them back in place, and the gesture becomes a different kind of provocation: a vandalized Fascist salute. Whether spectators see a sly political allusion or simply an icon of good-natured irreverence, the one-fingered hand would be a grand, brazen, unforgettable gesture.
But in the months before it was installed, during a brief stay in New York, Cattelan spoke about the project cautiously. He downplayed the finger's vulgarity (''In Naples this would be like . . . water'') and emphasized that it would face away from the Stock Exchange. ''I have nothing against the Stock Exchange,'' he said. ''I'm not giving the bird to anybody.'' Only occasionally did he allow himself a flash of mischievous anticipation. When I asked about the opening ceremony, for instance, Cattelan smiled: ''I have some pictures in my mind. I can see the mayor unveiling the sculpture. It could be quite a. . . .'' Cattelan paused, then settled for a sardonic euphemism: ''a family moment.''
Only a few days earlier, the mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti, had pushed a skeptical city council to approve the monument. Despite her links to the Berlusconi regime, Cattelan spoke appreciatively of Moratti's determination. But he clearly -- and characteristically -- relished the idea of putting her in an awkward position. This is, after all, the artist who persuaded one of his dealers to wear a pink, rabbit-eared penis suit for several weeks; crucified another with duct tape to the walls of his own gallery; and installed a cheerful replica of an English collector's grandmother inside a refrigerator. Gestures like these earned Cattelan his reputation as a jokester, a clown, a comedian, and while supporters sometimes bristle at these labels, it would be silly to disavow them entirely. Cattelan is funny. Not simply funny, not predictably funny, not (though the connection is often made) sweetly, sentimentally, Roberto Benigni funny. Instead he's abrasively funny, Richard Pryor funny, Bruce Nauman funny. Funny in a way that depends on discomfort, on testing, on seeing what happens if you flip off your hometown.
At 50, Cattelan is a tall, lean, broad-shouldered man. His long face, dominated by a major nose, projects gravity and wariness. When he laughs, though, he sticks out his tongue like a class clown and lets his shoulders rise up toward his ears. His laughter is undignified, a little embarrassed, exuding goofball modesty. And indeed, Cattelan lives a strangely modest life, especially for an artist at the very top of the international pecking order. He travels everywhere by bicycle (''my girlfriend,'' he calls his bike), dresses in black jeans and T-shirts, drinks only on weekends and keeps mum about his private life. His sole vice appears to be a daily 80-minute swim. Talking about his own work, Cattelan often uses the word ''failure''; on the other hand, he's quick to credit his friends and collaborators, a brain trust of mostly Italian critics and curators who act as a sounding board for his projects. With two of these friends, Massimiliano Gioni and Ali Subotnick, Cattelan has operated a tiny rogue exhibition space, the Wrong Gallery (a door in Chelsea that you can see into but not enter). With others, he produces idiosyncratic magazines, the best known of which, Permanent Food, is a kind of gallery itself: a collection of mostly unattributed pages torn from other magazines. Cattelan claims to have virtually no possessions, but his other sideline includes art collecting. (''There must be a warehouse somewhere,'' one dealer says.)
His whole life appears to be consumed by art: thinking about it, talking about it, buying it -- everything except physically making it, a job he delegates to others. This itself, he pointed out not long ago, is a kind of failure, ''an admission that I am not the best person to make it.''
The roots of Cattelan's asceticism and modesty, his vivid sense of the precariousness of his own success, are not hard to find. He grew up in Padua, a small provincial town where his father was a truck driver. Some of his friends went to university; others, according to the curator Francesco Bonami (another member of the Cattelan brain trust), became ''terrorists.'' Cattelan himself drifted through a series of jobs, working as an accountant, a ''cleaning lady,'' a mailman and, finally, a nurse at the local morgue.
At 25, with an ominous sense that ''there was some serious possibility of becoming deranged,'' he biked past an art gallery and happened to glance inside. He had never visited a gallery or museum before. But the Michelangelo Pistoletto paintings he saw intrigued and irritated him, and he began a process of self-education, primarily through art magazines. Cattelan doesn't romanticize his past: ''There was no call from the art gods,'' he said. But in a remarkably short time, he had moved to Milan, where after a brief stint designing furniture, he began showing artworks that dramatized his own sense of being an untrained outsider, a misfit.
To hear Cattelan tell it, many of his early exhibitions were motivated simply by a lack of ideas. For one show, he locked the gallery door and hung a sign that read torno subito (Back Soon). For others, he exhibited a police affidavit declaring that his artwork had been stolen, or, in one now-famous escapade, simply stole another artist's show from a neighboring gallery and exhibited it as his own. Smartass stunts like these jibed with prevailing avant-garde notions. (You could file them under appropriation, subversion of the gallery system or institutional critique.) But Cattelan's antics were never obscure, never pretentious: they had a rare lightness of tone, a perfect balance of mockery and self-mockery. And quite often a tart political edge: in 1991, at a time when Italy was experiencing rising tensions over illegal immigration, he outfitted a soccer team of African immigrants to play foosball against an all-white team, on opposite sides of a laughably long table. In photos of the match, everyone looks perfectly amiable. But the logo printed on the black players' jerseys reads rauss (a play on the German word for ''get out'').
Almost as soon as he had made a name for himself in Milan, Cattelan moved to New York, where he still keeps an apartment. His debut here, featuring a live donkey (a self-portrait as a jackass), attracted little notice but turned out to be important for him. The donkey initiated a long sequence of animal installations in venues all over the world: macabre horses hung from ceilings, a suicidal squirrel, a bright-eyed baby elephant in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. Animals suited Cattelan's developing knack for creating simple, memorable images. But they also gave his work a cartoony, folk-tale cast that sometimes narrowed its scope. Compared with Damien Hirst, who was exhibiting taxidermied animals at the same time, Cattelan could seem a little coy, a little tame.
That changed in 1999, with his most notorious installation, ''La Nona Ora'' (''The Ninth Hour,'' named for the moment of Jesus's death). Here Cattelan subjected a human icon -- a wax effigy of Pope John Paul II -- to an absurd injury: the pontiff lay sideways on the ground, his legs crushed by a meteorite. Typically for Cattelan, there was no blood, no real violence. Instead the tableau had a theatrical strangeness and a new kind of perplexing social resonance. It was an object lesson in ambiguity, one that not all spectators were equipped to handle. When it was shown in Warsaw, two members of the Polish Parliament angrily removed the meteorite and then, in an act of almost touching folly, tried to stand the pontiff up on his slippered feet.
''La Nona Ora'' was a media magnet, widely admired, endlessly reproduced. In its wake, Cattelan's reputation soared into a high, sparsely populated, recession-proof region of the art market where famous collectors plead for the privilege of writing million-dollar checks. Predictably, there has been a certain amount of backlash, and Cattelan has occasionally offered fuel to his detractors. A recent sculpture of body bags, carved (like ''L.O.V.E.'') in Carrara marble, seems uncharacteristically flat-footed, a well-intentioned but obvious transposition of news photographs from any of the world's conflict zones. On the other hand, ''Him,'' a trompe l'oeil portrait of Hitler as a penitent child, has been widely hailed as an unnerving spectacle -- an untouchable subject treated with singular tact. The fact that ''Him'' is now owned by a Holocaust survivor is one of the strange ironies that Cattelan's best works seem to attract.
For a truly complete sense of Cattelan's trajectory, we will have to wait for next year's Guggenheim retrospective. In the meantime, this fall Milan is recognizing him with a major show at the Palazzo Reale, which includes ''La Nona Ora,'' not to mention his newest work, the finger sculpture. Sadly, due to a compromise with the Stock Exchange, the finger was scheduled to be displayed only temporarily, as a kind of accompaniment (one hesitates to say salute) to Fashion Week. In the month leading up to the exhibit, he seemed unfazed by its brief duration. ''One week,'' he said to me blithely. ''But we need only one day. They underestimate the power of images.'' Many artists use the word ''image'' disparagingly, to imply tabloid shallowness. For Cattelan, however, ''image'' is the goal: a successful artwork lives through photography and the media, quietly shaping collective consciousness. Talking about this process, his tacit political leanings emerge. ''History is made of images,'' he said. ''When we think about the Vietnam War, we think about a couple of images. An image can do a lot. I'm not saying this [the finger sculpture] is going to be an image. But we have a chance.''
In late July, Cattelan was back in Italy, and I flew to Milan to meet with him there. On a weekday afternoon we walked together to the square where his monument would soon be installed. As we stood looking up at the facade of the Stock Exchange, it seemed a strangely perfect setting. Cattelan's single finger would occupy the exact center of the square's open space, a wry mini-column echoing the many columns on every side. Was this just a lucky coincidence? Not for the first time, I began to reassess Cattelan's motives. How much does visual subtlety matter to Cattelan, as opposed to social impact? How much secret formalism is there, buried under his comic reflexes? Later, the two of us went to visit Santa Maria delle Grazie, the church where Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' is displayed. The Minister of Culture, a gracious, impossibly handsome Milanese bureaucrat, had offered us special access to the exhibit after hours. As it turned out, though, the chapel was still full of tourists. We joined them and stood for a while, contemplating the ancient abraded image. Cattelan was restive, scanning the crowd with bemused glances, manifestly more interested in live spectators than in ancient frescoes. After a few minutes, a young docent walked toward us, eager to see if she could do anything to accommodate Italy's most famous living artist. As she approached, Cattelan leaned forward, in a climate-controlled room that housed one of the most physically fragile works in all of Western art, held out two fingers and said, ''Cigarette?''

HEADLINE: How the West Was Won

BYLINE: By BRUCE BARCOTT. 
Bruce Barcott, author of ''The Last Flight of the Scarlet Macaw,'' is writing a book about the battle over salmon and Indian treaties in the Pacific Northwest.

 BODY:
DUST DEVIL
By Anne Isaacs
Illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky
Unpaged. Schwartz & Wade Books. $17.99. (Ages 5 to 9)
Tarnation! Seems like a mule's age since we've had a hero of American folklore worth wasting song and spit over, someone big enough to wear the boots of Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill and John Henry, a giant who cuts canyons with his plow and seeds lakes with his tears.
Our long spell of waiting is over. Six years ago Anne Isaacs teamed up with Paul O. Zelinsky on ''Swamp Angel,'' the story of Angelica Longrider, a red-haired girl from the hills of Tennessee who grew and grew and grew and grew to become the greatest woodswoman in the land. Born in 1815, when Tennessee was still unsettled, Angelica rescued a wagon train from the mists of Dejection Swamp when she was only 12. ''Ever since that time,'' Isaacs wrote, ''Angelica Longrider has been known as Swamp Angel. To this day, stories about Swamp Angel spring up like sunflowers along the wagon trails. And every one of them is true.'' 
True or not, the book won well-deserved praise, including a Caldecott Honor, for Isaacs' storytelling and Zelinsky's witty illustrations, done in an American primitive style on wood veneers.
Much of ''Swamp Angel'' chronicled Angelica's battle with a giant bear. Day and night they fought like Frazier and Ali, until the Angel finally got the best of the bear by snoring down a tree on top of him. She kept its pelt as a rug, but it was too big for Tennessee ''so she moved to Montana and spread that bear rug out on the ground in front of her cabin,'' Isaacs wrote. ''Nowadays, folks call it the Shortgrass Prairie.''
In the motion picture business, folks, that's what they call a sequel tease.
Now the Isaacs-Zelinsky team is back with ''Dust Devil,'' in which our heroine, who is all of 16 years old, finds herself setting up house on the Montana prairie. The flat land offers no shade, so Angel plucks a nearby mountain and plants it east of her ranch. Voila: cool relief. ''Pretty soon all her neighbors wanted a mountain,'' Isaacs writes. ''So Angel grabbed an armful and planted mountains one by one on the prairie. 'That's a beaut,' she'd say proudly every time she set one down. And to this day, every stand-alone peak in Montana is called a butte.''
In ''Dust Devil,'' 19th-century Montana is a land where hyperbole is common fact. The soil is ''rich enough to open its own bank.'' One summer the corn shot up so fast the stalks lifted cows into the sky, and ''it rained milk by the bucket.'' When a dust storm engulfs the land, Angel takes to rasslin' with it and discovers its cause: a giant white horse, ''bucking and wheeling and neighing like fury!'' Soon enough the horse, named Dust Devil, becomes her trusty sidekick, Babe the Blue Ox to her Paul Bunyan.
Every heroine needs a villain to foil, and Isaacs comes up with some dandies: Backward Bart and his gang of Flying Desperadoes, who ride through Montana ''as fast as bad news,'' robbing and terrorizing everywhere they go. Bart grew up backward, so every time he speaks it sounds like, well, like something funny. ''Cash your gimme!'' he'd say at a stickup. ''Up hurry!''
Bart and his gang give Zelinsky a chance to shine. There's Missouri Jerk, who resembles a mustache with a man attached; Lovely Poe, whose face looks like the bad end of a bar fight; Lawless Sam Diego, who looks like a loving homage to Quentin Blake's hirsute husband in ''The Twits,'' by Roald Dahl; and the Stanford twins, By-Guess and By-Golly, who are peg-legged, eye-patched and just plain creepy.
Did I mention that Bart and the Desperadoes ride giant mosquitoes instead of horses? They do grow 'em big in Montana, you know.
Generations ago this kind of big-sky storytelling was an oral folk art. Tale-spinners like Hathaway Jones, the Munchausen of Oregon's Rogue River country, helped people pass long evenings and laugh away hardship with tales of ridiculous deprivation: Cold? This is nothing. Heck, one winter it was so cold the water froze under the jumping salmon, left 'em stranded on hard ice. It was entertainment, succor and backhanded bragging, and Anne Isaacs has the style, the tone, the motifs and the humor absolutely nailed. It's as if the author discovered Angelica the Angel hidden away in some old folkways archive in the Smithsonian.
In the end, of course, the heroine saves the day through bravery, pluck and a clever ploy. In all the scuffling, Angel creates the Sawtooth Range and the geysers of Yellowstone, a couple of Montana-size instances of what an economist might call unintended consequences. Will there be a third installment? The portents are positive. When Angel knocked the teeth out of Bart and the Desperadoes, you see, their gold fillings ''washed downstream, all the way to California,'' Isaacs writes. ''Eventually settlers discovered those nuggets and started a stampede. But that's another story.'' Saddle up, boys! The lady's headed west.

HEADLINE: The Financial Time Bomb of Longer Lives

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
FIRST the good news: We're living longer, healthier lives than ever before.
We're already so used to the idea of greater longevity, in fact, that it may seem ho-hum to learn that boys and girls born in 2008 in the United States have life expectancies of 75 and 81, respectively.
Those life spans, however, represent a bonus of about three decades, compared with Americans born in 1900, according to a report last year from the Census Bureau. And, by the way, Spain, Greece and Austria fared even better, proportionally: Life expectancies in those countries doubled over the course of the 20th century.
Now for the bad news: At this rate, we can't afford to live so long. 
And by ''we,'' I don't just mean you, me and our often insufficient long-term-care insurance policies. I mean ''we the people.'' I mean the bureaucratic ''we.''
For the first time in human history, people aged 65 and over are about to outnumber children under 5. In many countries, older people entitled to government-funded pensions, health services and long-term care will soon outnumber the work force whose taxes help finance those benefits. This demographic shift also means that the number of people living with dementia, whose treatment is estimated to cost $604 billion worldwide this year, is expected to more than triple, to 115 million, by 2050, according to a report this year by Alzheimer's Disease International, a group representing 73 Alzheimer's associations around the world.
No other force is as likely to shape the future of national economic health, public finances and national policies, according to a new analysis on global aging from Standard & Poor's, as the ''irreversible rate at which the population is growing older.''
How are the most developed countries handling preparations for the boom in the elderly population -- and for the budget-busting expenditures that are sure to follow?
For a majority, not very well.
Unless governments enact sweeping changes to age-related public spending, sovereign debt could become unsustainable, rivaling levels seen during cataclysms like the Great Depression and World War II, according to the S.& P. report.
If the status quo continues, the report projects, the median government debt in the most advanced economies could soar to 329 percent of gross domestic product by 2050. By contrast, Britain's debt represented only 252 percent of G.D.P. in 1946, in the aftermath of World War II, the report said.
So what is to be done?
For starters, governments should extend the retirement age, says Marko Mrsnik, the associate director of sovereign ratings in Europe for S.& P. and the lead author of the report. Another no-brainer, he says, is that governments should balance their budgets.
Alas, private citizens often don't see the logic in curbing public benefits in order to maintain national solvency. Witness France last week, where more than one million people took to the streets to protest pension reform that would raise the minimum legal retirement age to 62 from 60.
Moreover, global aging experts say, measures like pension reform are inadequate, piecemeal responses to the giant demographic shift that is upon us.
If the cost of maintaining aging populations could lead to World War II-era levels of government debt, a solution to the crisis will require a mass-scale collaborative response akin to the Manhattan Project or the space race, says Michael W. Hodin, who is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and researches aging issues.
Governments, industry and international agencies, he says, will have to work together to transform the very structure of society, by creating jobs and education programs for people in their 60s and 70s -- the hypothetical new middle age -- and by tackling diseases like Alzheimer's whose likelihood increases as people age.
''What we need is a very fundamental and profound transformation that is proportionate to the social shifts that are upon us and that is truly innovative in the public arena, innovation that is driven by industry,'' says Mr. Hodin.
Here's one simple suggestion: Influential international organizations, government agencies, companies and academic institutions should take up aging as a cause, the way they have already done for the environment. Although the United Nations, for example, set eight ''millennium development goals'' -- ensuring environmental sustainability, promoting gender equality, and so on -- for 2015, the list did not include ensuring the sustainability and equality of aging populations.
''This is quite unacceptable that aging hasn't been included in these goals,'' says Baroness Greengross, a member of the House of Lords in Britain and chief executive of the International Longevity Centre U.K in London.
Here's another suggestion: Governments with national health programs or other state coverage could start curbing the growth in medical spending ahead of the looming elderquake.
If countries wait to act, says Peter S. Heller, a senior adjunct professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, they will have to scramble reactively to cut their budgets in response to burgeoning older populations, the way Greece, Ireland and Spain have done recently. At the same time, he says, politicians must also start educating citizens to understand that greater longevity may entail personal sacrifices, like increased savings and a willingness to pay higher shares of their medical and long-term care costs.
But the carrot may be a better approach than the stick, says Laura L. Carstensen, a professor of psychology at Stanford and the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. She describes her outfit as a multidisciplinary research center whose ''modest aim is to change the course of human aging.''
Rather than uniformly extending the retirement age, she says, governments and the private sector could develop incentives that motivate older people to remain in the work force. Those incentives might include bonuses for people who work until they are 70, exempting employers from paying Social Security taxes for employees over retirement age, more flexible work schedules, telecommuting options, and sabbaticals for education and training.
''Maybe culture needs to change first,'' says Professor Carstensen, ''and policy will follow.''
FINALLY, some governments and companies may need attitude adjustments so they can view aging populations not as debt loads but as valuable wells of expertise.
''I rather dispute your calling it a problem,'' said Lady Greengross when I called to ask her how governments could better handle global aging. ''It's a celebration.''
As one example of how to embrace aging populations, she cites an equality act, recently passed by British legislators, that prohibits discrimination against older people (among others) seeking goods and services like car rentals or mortgages. Separately, she says, Britain next year will eliminate its default retirement age of 65, allowing people to remain in the work force longer.
''In the long run, I'd like to see age irrelevance,'' Lady Greengross says, ''where people aren't just labeled by their birthdays.''

HEADLINE: Making the Dream Trip a Reality

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
IT'S a dream anyone with a passport fantasizes about once in a while: ditching everything to travel the world for a year, or at least long enough to forget about office life.
Acting out that fantasy tends to be reserved for retirees and recent college graduates, but some midcareer globe-trotters hope to show that anyone can hop off the treadmill and go travel.
''Once you get outside the confines of your day-to-day life, you discover things about yourself,'' said Sherry Ott, a New Yorker who quit her middle-management job in 2006 to travel and who now wants to inspire others to take the leap.
She and two partners started the company Briefcase to Backpack, which offers seminars (and a coming online class) on the practicalities of planning an extended journey, or what they call a career break. 
''What makes it a career break is you have to have a career you're leaving, but you plan to come back, maybe even in the same field,'' she said. ''It's not just early retirement.''
Ms. Ott and other career-break veterans recently hosted events in 13 cities, where they answered questions about their experiences from 1,500 aspiring travelers (in some locations, hundreds more were on a waiting list). I dropped by the one in New York a little skeptical about what I'd learn, but found that I could relate to many of the issues the panelists identified as barriers to taking time off.
Here is some of their advice about clearing those obstacles.
Plan for Your Budget
For many people, a big issue is determining how to pay for an ambitious journey, which definitely requires some saving -- and planning -- a year or more ahead. The career-break veterans on the panel estimated that they spent between $1,500 and $2,700 a month (a person), or about $20,000 for a year away. But they also suggested ways to keep costs down.
''It's more expensive if you keep moving around from place to place,'' said Michaela Potter, another Briefcase to Backpack founder, mentioning Central and South America and Southeast Asia as more budget-friendly destinations. She cited hostels with communal kitchens as a cheaper lodging option because they allow travelers to keep meal expenses in check.
Other people save by becoming volunteers. Ms. Potter, who managed to save for several long trips while working for a nonprofit organization, spent about $2,000 for a six-week volunteer experience in Cuzco through the group Peru's Challenge. The trip included housing, Spanish lessons and a trek along the Inca Trail. She recommended idealist.org as a helpful resource for volunteer opportunities.
Working along the way is another option. Ms. Ott taught English during an extended stay in Vietnam. With high-speed Internet access, other globe-trotters said they were able to do freelance editing, copywriting or computer programming. Selling or subletting your home can also help finance a trip -- especially if you can do so at a profit.
Expect Resistance
It may not come as a surprise that pressure from family members can dampen a dream to travel the world.
Marie Elena Martinez said that when she decided to quit her job in book publishing and travel to South America, her parents worried that she'd get off track in her career, not to mention put herself in dicey situations by traveling alone. ''Their fears became my fears,'' she said. ''Once I kind of shut off that white noise, I took the leap.''
Other career-break veterans echoed that advice, and found that with technology offering more ways to stay in touch, the naysayers often became armchair travelers through Facebook updates and blog posts.
Marc and Danielle Hoffmeister took on an even bigger challenge when they sold their house in Dallas and took their daughters (ages 7 and 10) on a yearlong trip -- one of many families who have chronicled their journeys online, proving it can be done.
Although Mr. Hoffmeister thought it would be complicated to take the girls out of school, all he had to do was fill out a form; the family liked home schooling so much that they stuck with it after returning to Dallas. They're now planning their next trip.
''Just having a second bathroom feels luxurious,'' he said. ''We're able to live a lot more frugally now.''
Know Your Limits
Not everyone can -- or should -- take a year off.
''People get overwhelmed by thinking they have to do it all at once and give up everything, and that's not the case,'' said Ms. Potter, whose trips have ranged from nine weeks to six months.
Easing into your trip in a more familiar country is a way to reduce anxiety about leaving home. When she and Michael Bontempi (the third Briefcase to Backpack founder) first traveled together on a nine-week trip, they started in Australia so that he could decompress without too much culture shock before visiting Thailand and Laos.
But most people who spent a year or more traveling said that they planned only the first three months, letting the rest of their trip unfold as they learned more about the world and themselves.
''I learned fairly quickly that I had a real interest in traveling to remote and undeveloped countries,'' Ms. Ott said. ''I never would've believed that about myself when I was planning my trip in New York.''
She also joined a group trip to go places she was uncomfortable in traveling alone, like visiting Morocco with Gap Adventures, which specializes in small group travel. ''At first I was scared of traveling alone as a female,'' she said. ''Now it doesn't faze me anymore.''
Plan Your Return
Returning to the working world can take just as much effort as mapping out a travel itinerary, but it isn't as daunting as some people imagine.
For instance, Mr. Bontempi quit his job as a management consultant because he was ready to move on, and traveling for several months helped him decide that he wanted a different type of work when he returned. He now works for a global outsourcing company, and he said that during his job search, he found recruiters more wary of his time off than employers, who viewed it as an asset in a global economy.
He and other panelists advised keeping in touch with work contacts while away, letting people know when you'll be back, keeping your resume updated and marketing your travels as an experience that will make you a more valuable employee.
''At networking events you differentiate yourself almost immediately,'' Mr. Bontempi said. ''I found a lot more people wanted to talk to me.''
But if you hope to return to the same organization, approach your employer with a firm plan, said Elizabeth Pagano, a founder of YourSabbatical.com, which lists nearly 100 companies that offer sabbaticals and sells an e-book (for $37) with advice on negotiating with your employer. One tip: offer suggestions on how the work will get done while you're away.
''You need to show them that you've thought through what you're going to do, how it will make you a better employee and how it will benefit the business,'' Ms. Pagano said, adding that in a shaky economy, an unpaid leave can save your employer money.
''If this is something you really want to do, you can do it,'' she said. ''People of all economic situations find a way.''

HEADLINE: Gary L. Malin

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Malin, 42, is the president of Citi Habitats, a division of the Corcoran Group and one of the largest residential rental brokers in New York City. The company opened for business in 1994 and was acquired by NRT, Corcoran's parent, 10 years later.
Citi Habitats has represented numerous developments, including Dwell 95 on Wall Street and Tower 31 in Midtown. 
Q Business must be good given the strength of the rental market these days.
A We've had a phenomenal year. Last year, despite the economic turmoil, we had the best year in the history of Citi Habitats in the rental game -- not only in the number of transactions, which we set a record on, but revenue as well. And this year we've done more business than last year.
Q Can you provide numbers?
A Last year we rented just shy of 13,000 apartments, and this year we're on track to do more than that. Just a few days ago, I looked at what our business was through the end of August. We had rented about 10 percent more apartments than we rented during that same time last year.
Q Have rental rates gone up?
A Rents are slightly above what they were a year ago: the one-bedrooms and studios are one percentage point up, and two- and three-bedrooms a couple of percentage points. So the average rent for studios is in the high teens; one-bedrooms in the mid-$2,000s; two-bedrooms in the mid-$3,000s. More for a new-development product.
But the huge difference is that owners are not offering the incentives that they did a year ago.
Q Have incentives largely disappeared?
A We did an analysis and found that last year, at the height of concessions, we did about 60 percent of our deals with a concession. In August it was down to 20 percent.
Concessions now are mainly happening in buildings that are new construction. The whole point is velocity -- you want to bring in as many people as humanly possible.
Q Which new developments are you representing now?
A We're still working on Silver Towers for Larry Silverstein, on 42nd Street; we're about 90 percent rented there. We finished up 80 DeKalb for Forest City Ratner, which we opened up in November of last year. We're basically done, other than a couple of select units.
We just opened up the Beatrice for JD Carlisle a couple of months ago, on 29th and Sixth. We represent Kevin Lalezarian in the Townsend on 37th and Ninth. We're also doing the Ashley for Extell Development.
Q Your company has been focusing a lot more on sales, even renaming your sales division Citi Sales.
A We're working as a team to really grow and build our sales business, because we have so many clients that we transact with -- we have renters who become buyers who become sellers.
Q Is there a big overlap in business between Citi Habitats and Corcoran?
A There's overlap to the extent that we're both involved in residential real estate. We have built a company that was founded on this rental concept, and that's where we use it as a springboard. What we really talk about with our agents is being a hybrid agent. What we mean by that is that you're not a rental agent, you're not a sales agent -- you're a real estate agent. Our goal is to become one of the largest sales companies in the city.
Q Where do most of your clients want to live?
A Most people when they come to us say they would like to live downtown -- that's what excites them. But they don't necessarily know why it's exciting; maybe they've spoken to friends who live down there and they say that's where the nightlife is. What I found is that clients come in with different expectations, but then you have to match their expectations with the reality of the marketplace, so people end up going to places they didn't necessarily think they were going to go, and then they end up finding those are phenomenal areas.
Q What's Andrew Heiberger, the company founder and your former roommate at the University of Michigan, up to these days?
A Andrew left in April '05. He did his developments and now he's going to open up a new brokerage company.
Q He'll then be a competitor.
A Anybody in the industry is a competitor. But there's tons of business out there for everyone.
Q Have you ever rented in the city?
A I rented from 1993 to 2002, all on the Upper East Side. The last place was 79th and York. I now live in Roslyn Harbor. I'm a suburban guy.

HEADLINE: Help for an Autistic Son Means Trouble for a Marriage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOMMERS

 BODY:
A young couple, struggling to secure the most beneficial education for their autistic 4-year-old son, disagrees on what's best for him. The separate paths the spouses explore eventually threaten their marriage in ''Love and Communication,'' a new drama by James J. Christy.
Presented by the Passage Theater Company in Trenton, ''Love and Communication'' is an earnest look at the many frustrations and uncertainties challenging the parents of children with autism. The play also considers how love and good intentions are not enough when people fail to understand each other. 
Rob (Chris Stack), who favors traditional therapy, is bent on enrolling his son at an exclusive private school and pursues Julia (Lena Kaminsky), its not unattractive director, to gain admittance. His wife, Megan (Julianna Zinkel), is intrigued by an alternative program offered through a costly DVD series promoted by Silverman (John Jezior), an Internet guru who begins to take a personal interest in her situation.
Meanwhile, the couple tangles with the public school system bureaucracy, represented by Regina (Ashley B. Spearman), a caseworker. Late in the play, she questions whether any kind of therapy makes much of a difference other than to reassure parents that they did their best for their child. ''At the end of the day he'll still have autism,'' Regina observes grimly. ''You know what'll change? You'll feel better, that's all.''
A disconsolate story, the play is marred by a startling revelation during the second act that nearly derails Mr. Christy's otherwise carefully wrought study in parental desperation. After that major, unexpected and somewhat risible bump -- not to be revealed here -- the drama manages to get back on track as Rob and Megan try to reconcile their issues.
The closed-down nature of autism might be seen as an analogy for the difficulties the adults experience in communicating. Mr. Christy, who is the father of a child with autism, writes thoughtfully about the emotional and economic pressures that people in such families face. Through Regina, the playwright also notes that minority households probably suffer even more.
Adam Immerwahr, Passage Theater's resident director, provides a subdued production at the Mill Hill Playhouse. The boy in the story never appears onstage but is spoken to and played with by the others as if he were there. To underline the couple's increasing estrangement, Rob and Megan usually confront each other from opposite sides of the room. An extended sequence of rapid instant-messaging between Megan and Silverman doesn't quite come off.
The acting is spotty. Perhaps Mr. Stack intends Rob to be a vocally and physically inexpressive stick, but his awkward ways scarcely fit with the guy's reputation for being smooth. Contending with such a wooden husband, Ms. Zinkel's fraying Megan focuses on her child and her ripening relationship with Silverman. More than any of the actors, Ms. Spearman appears natural as the exasperated caseworker who finally blurts out bitter commentary.
An austere setting designed by Jeff Van Velsor to accommodate a living room and several other interiors is sufficient, although its black panels and furnishings seem to lend unnecessary gloom to a situation that is bleak enough.
''Love and Communication'' is at the Mill Hill Playhouse, 205 East Front Street, Trenton, through Oct. 24. (609) 392-0766; passagetheatre.org.

HEADLINE: The Great Deflation: Japan Goes From Dynamic to Disheartened

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
OSAKA, Japan -- Like many members of Japan's middle class, Masato Y. enjoyed a level of affluence two decades ago that was the envy of the world. Masato, a small-business owner, bought a $500,000 condominium, vacationed in Hawaii and drove a late-model Mercedes.
But his living standards slowly crumbled along with Japan's overall economy. First, he was forced to reduce trips abroad and then eliminate them. Then he traded the Mercedes for a cheaper domestic model. Last year, he sold his condo -- for a third of what he paid for it, and for less than what he still owed on the mortgage he took out 17 years ago.
''Japan used to be so flashy and upbeat, but now everyone must live in a dark and subdued way,'' said Masato, 49, who asked that his full name not be used because he still cannot repay the $110,000 that he owes on the mortgage. 
Few nations in recent history have seen such a striking reversal of economic fortune as Japan. The original Asian success story, Japan rode one of the great speculative stock and property bubbles of all time in the 1980s to become the first Asian country to challenge the long dominance of the West.
But the bubbles popped in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Japan fell into a slow but relentless decline that neither enormous budget deficits nor a flood of easy money has reversed. For nearly a generation now, the nation has been trapped in low growth and a corrosive downward spiral of prices, known as deflation, in the process shriveling from an economic Godzilla to little more than an afterthought in the global economy.
Now, as the United States and other Western nations struggle to recover from a debt and property bubble of their own, a growing number of economists are pointing to Japan as a dark vision of the future. Even as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, prepares a fresh round of unconventional measures to stimulate the economy, there are growing fears that the United States and many European economies could face a prolonged period of slow growth or even, in the worst case, deflation, something not seen on a sustained basis outside Japan since the Great Depression.
Many economists remain confident that the United States will avoid the stagnation of Japan, largely because of the greater responsiveness of the American political system and Americans' greater tolerance for capitalism's creative destruction. Japanese leaders at first denied the severity of their nation's problems and then spent heavily on job-creating public works projects that only postponed painful but necessary structural changes, economists say.
''We're not Japan,'' said Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford. ''In America, the bet is still that we will somehow find ways to get people spending and investing again.''
Still, as political pressure builds to reduce federal spending and budget deficits, other economists are now warning of ''Japanification'' -- of falling into the same deflationary trap of collapsed demand that occurs when consumers refuse to consume, corporations hold back on investments and banks sit on cash. It becomes a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle: as prices fall further and jobs disappear, consumers tighten their purse strings even more and companies cut back on spending and delay expansion plans.
''The U.S., the U.K., Spain, Ireland, they all are going through what Japan went through a decade or so ago,'' said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Securities who recently wrote a book about Japan's lessons for the world. ''Millions of individuals and companies see their balance sheets going underwater, so they are using their cash to pay down debt instead of borrowing and spending.''
Just as inflation scarred a generation of Americans, deflation has left a deep imprint on the Japanese, breeding generational tensions and a culture of pessimism, fatalism and reduced expectations. While Japan remains in many ways a prosperous society, it faces an increasingly grim situation, particularly outside the relative economic vibrancy of Tokyo, and its situation provides a possible glimpse into the future for the United States and Europe, should the most dire forecasts come to pass.
Scaled-Back Ambitions
The downsizing of Japan's ambitions can be seen on the streets of Tokyo, where concrete ''microhouses'' have become popular among younger Japanese who cannot afford even the famously cramped housing of their parents, or lack the job security to take out a traditional multidecade loan.
These matchbox-size homes stand on plots of land barely large enough to park a sport utility vehicle, yet have three stories of closet-size bedrooms, suitcase-size closets and a tiny kitchen that properly belongs on a submarine.
''This is how to own a house even when you are uneasy about the future,'' said Kimiyo Kondo, general manager at Zaus, a Tokyo-based company that builds microhouses.
For many people under 40, it is hard to grasp just how far this is from the 1980s, when a mighty -- and threatening -- ''Japan Inc.'' seemed ready to obliterate whole American industries, from automakers to supercomputers. With the Japanese stock market quadrupling and the yen rising to unimagined heights, Japan's companies dominated global business, gobbling up trophy properties like Hollywood movie studios (Universal Studios and Columbia Pictures), famous golf courses (Pebble Beach) and iconic real estate (Rockefeller Center).
In 1991, economists were predicting that Japan would overtake the United States as the world's largest economy by 2010. In fact, Japan's economy remains the same size it was then: a gross domestic product of $5.7 trillion at current exchange rates. During the same period, the United States economy doubled in size to $14.7 trillion, and this year China overtook Japan to become the world's No. 2 economy.
China has so thoroughly eclipsed Japan that few American intellectuals seem to bother with Japan now, and once crowded Japanese-language classes at American universities have emptied. Even Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former Reagan administration trade negotiator whose writings in the 1980s about Japan's threat to the United States once stirred alarm in Washington, said he was now studying Chinese. ''I hardly go to Japan anymore,'' Mr. Prestowitz said.
The decline has been painful for the Japanese, with companies and individuals like Masato having lost the equivalent of trillions of dollars in the stock market, which is now just a quarter of its value in 1989, and in real estate, where the average price of a home is the same as it was in 1983. And the future looks even bleaker, as Japan faces the world's largest government debt -- around 200 percent of gross domestic product -- a shrinking population and rising rates of poverty and suicide.
But perhaps the most noticeable impact here has been Japan's crisis of confidence. Just two decades ago, this was a vibrant nation filled with energy and ambition, proud to the point of arrogance and eager to create a new economic order in Asia based on the yen. Today, those high-flying ambitions have been shelved, replaced by weariness and fear of the future, and an almost stifling air of resignation. Japan seems to have pulled into a shell, content to accept its slow fade from the global stage.
Its once voracious manufacturers now seem prepared to surrender industry after industry to hungry South Korean and Chinese rivals. Japanese consumers, who once flew by the planeload on flashy shopping trips to Manhattan and Paris, stay home more often now, saving their money for an uncertain future or setting new trends in frugality with discount brands like Uniqlo.
As living standards in this still wealthy nation slowly erode, a new frugality is apparent among a generation of young Japanese, who have known nothing but economic stagnation and deflation. They refuse to buy big-ticket items like cars or televisions, and fewer choose to study abroad in America.
Japan's loss of gumption is most visible among its young men, who are widely derided as ''herbivores'' for lacking their elders' willingness to toil for endless hours at the office, or even to succeed in romance, which many here blame, only half jokingly, for their country's shrinking birthrate. ''The Japanese used to be called economic animals,'' said Mitsuo Ohashi, former chief executive officer of the chemicals giant Showa Denko. ''But somewhere along the way, Japan lost its animal spirits.''
When asked in dozens of interviews about their nation's decline, Japanese, from policy makers and corporate chieftains to shoppers on the street, repeatedly mention this startling loss of vitality. While Japan suffers from many problems, most prominently the rapid graying of its society, it is this decline of a once wealthy and dynamic nation into a deep social and cultural rut that is perhaps Japan's most ominous lesson for the world today.
The classic explanation of the evils of deflation is that it makes individuals and businesses less willing to use money, because the rational way to act when prices are falling is to hold onto cash, which gains in value. But in Japan, nearly a generation of deflation has had a much deeper effect, subconsciously coloring how the Japanese view the world. It has bred a deep pessimism about the future and a fear of taking risks that make people instinctively reluctant to spend or invest, driving down demand -- and prices -- even further.
''A new common sense appears, in which consumers see it as irrational or even foolish to buy or borrow,'' said Kazuhisa Takemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied the psychology of deflation.
A Deflated City
While the effects are felt across Japan's economy, they are more apparent in regions like Osaka, the third-largest city, than in relatively prosperous Tokyo. In this proudly commercial city, merchants have gone to extremes to coax shell-shocked shoppers into spending again. But this often takes the shape of price wars that end up only feeding Japan's deflationary spiral.
There are vending machines that sell canned drinks for 10 yen, or 12 cents; restaurants with 50-yen beer; apartments with the first month's rent of just 100 yen, about $1.22. Even marriage ceremonies are on sale, with discount wedding halls offering weddings for $600 -- less than a tenth of what ceremonies typically cost here just a decade ago.
On Senbayashi, an Osaka shopping street, merchants recently held a 100-yen day, offering much of their merchandise for that price. Even then, they said, the results were disappointing.
''It's like Japanese have even lost the desire to look good,'' said Akiko Oka, 63, who works part time in a small apparel shop, a job she has held since her own clothing store went bankrupt in 2002.
This loss of vigor is sometimes felt in unusual places. Kitashinchi is Osaka's premier entertainment district, a three-centuries-old playground where the night is filled with neon signs and hostesses in tight dresses, where just taking a seat at a top club can cost $500.
But in the past 15 years, the number of fashionable clubs and lounges has shrunk to 480 from 1,200, replaced by discount bars and chain restaurants. Bartenders say the clientele these days is too cost-conscious to show the studied disregard for money that was long considered the height of refinement.
''A special culture might be vanishing,'' said Takao Oda, who mixes perfectly crafted cocktails behind the glittering gold countertop at his Bar Oda.
After years of complacency, Japan appears to be waking up to its problems, as seen last year when disgruntled voters ended the virtual postwar monopoly on power of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, for many Japanese, it may be too late. Japan has already created an entire generation of young people who say they have given up on believing that they can ever enjoy the job stability or rising living standards that were once considered a birthright here.
Yukari Higaki, 24, said the only economic conditions she had ever known were ones in which prices and salaries seemed to be in permanent decline. She saves as much money as she can by buying her clothes at discount stores, making her own lunches and forgoing travel abroad. She said that while her generation still lived comfortably, she and her peers were always in a defensive crouch, ready for the worst.
''We are the survival generation,'' said Ms. Higaki, who works part time at a furniture store.
Hisakazu Matsuda, president of Japan Consumer Marketing Research Institute, who has written several books on Japanese consumers, has a different name for Japanese in their 20s; he calls them the consumption-haters. He estimates that by the time this generation hits their 60s, their habits of frugality will have cost the Japanese economy $420 billion in lost consumption.
''There is no other generation like this in the world,'' Mr. Matsuda said. ''These guys think it's stupid to spend.''
Deflation has also affected businesspeople by forcing them to invent new ways to survive in an economy where prices and profits only go down, not up.
Yoshinori Kaiami was a real estate agent in Osaka, where, like the rest of Japan, land prices have been falling for most of the past 19 years. Mr. Kaiami said business was tough. There were few buyers in a market that was virtually guaranteed to produce losses, and few sellers, because most homeowners were saddled with loans that were worth more than their homes.
Some years ago, he came up with an idea to break the gridlock. He created a company that guides homeowners through an elaborate legal subterfuge in which they erase the original loan by declaring personal bankruptcy, but continue to live in their home by ''selling'' it to a relative, who takes out a smaller loan to pay its greatly reduced price.
''If we only had inflation again, this sort of business would not be necessary,'' said Mr. Kaiami, referring to the rising prices that are the opposite of deflation. ''I feel like I've been waiting for 20 years for inflation to come back.''
One of his customers was Masato, the small-business owner, who sold his four-bedroom condo to a relative for about $185,000, 15 years after buying it for a bit more than $500,000. He said he was still deliberating about whether to expunge the $110,000 he still owed his bank by declaring personal bankruptcy.
Economists said one reason deflation became self-perpetuating was that it pushed companies and people like Masato to survive by cutting costs and selling what they already owned, instead of buying new goods or investing.
''Deflation destroys the risk-taking that capitalist economies need in order to grow,'' said Shumpei Takemori, an economist at Keio University in Tokyo. ''Creative destruction is replaced with what is just destructive destruction.''
The Great Deflation: This is the first in a series of articles that will examine the effects on Japanese society of two decades of economic stagnation and declining prices.

HEADLINE: Another Family Sedan That Is Firing on Fewer Cylinders

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI

 BODY:
TESTED 2010 Buick LaCrosse CX
WHAT IS IT? Midsize family sedan.
HOW MUCH? Base price $27,245; as tested $27,670.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 2.4-liter Ecotec 4-cylinder (182 horsepower, 172 pound-feet of torque); 6-speed automatic transmission. A 3.6-liter V-6 (280 horsepower, 259 lb. ft.) is optional.
IS IT THIRSTY? Not really, and that's the point: E.P.A. rating is 19 miles per gallon in town, 30 on the highway. 
ALTERNATIVESHyundai Sonata and 4-cylinder versions of the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.
I HAD the great fortune a few years ago to ogle the Buick Y-Job, the sleek 1938 concept car created by the godfather of General Motors design, Harley J. Earl. The car is a wonder of speed lines, bulbous fenders and supreme class. You want to rest your cheek against a fender and whisper sweet nothings to it.
The Y-Job was powered by a 320-cubic-inch straight-8 engine, and while the car is a reminder of the industry's glorious past, the fuel economy rules that start taking effect in 2012 could regulate the V-8 into a similar warm memory.
Engine sizes are already coming down, and cylinders are being taken away. In any meeting with an auto executive these days, after he's discussed growth opportunities in China, he talks about how his company will meet the new standards with smaller, more efficient gasoline engines.
Hyundai, for example, has eliminated the Sonata's V-6 in favor of an in-line 4, and Audi has done the same thing with its A4. The Ford Explorer, for the first time, will have a 4-cylinder option. Even BMW, which has not offered a 4 in a car in the United States since 1999, has said it will soon have them in its lineup.
Buick is doing its part. The new Regal is offered only with a 4-cylinder engine, and the same engine is now available in the LaCrosse CX and CXL.
The second-generation LaCrosse, which is almost 7 inches longer than the Regal, made its debut last year to considerable praise, joining the Enclave crossover in broadening Buick's appeal beyond the older customers who had been its loyalists. The average buyer's age is now 65, Buick says, down from 67 three years ago.
Through its recent corporate grief, G.M. has been making some appealing cars, and the LaCrosse is among them.
But the story on this version, the CX, is the addition of the Ecotec engine, the first 4-cylinder in a Buick since the 1998 Skylark. I spent a week with the front-drive CX, which I took on a family vacation to Virginia. In the 400-mile trip from Connecticut, I averaged 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving with four people and a dog aboard.
In most driving conditions, the engine response was adequate. There was enough power for highway merges, but not enough to misbehave. I found myself waiting for the coast to be completely clear before changing lanes, forcing me to be a good citizen. Fully loaded, the CX also struggled up hills, teaching me patience. This car is so Zen.
The 4-cylinder is standard in the base CX, as is the suedelike material on the seats. My test car also didn't have a satellite navigation system, leading to my only major annoyance.
The closest power outlet to the dash was in the center console near my elbow. The power cord of my portable GPS unit had to be stretched taut like a clothesline, handy for drying damp clothes perhaps, but deadly when the cord's tension sent the unit flying off the windshield.
Given its solid effort with the LaCrosse, it's hard not to feel that Buick, which once produced cars people still sigh over, might actually be able to compete with foreign brands. But while this 4 is nice, Buick will need small engines that can do much better than 30 m.p.g. Hyundai, for example, now offers a turbocharged 4 in its Sonata that is rated at 33 m.p.g. on the highway while producing an impressive 274 horsepower.
Buick has a new turbo 4 for the 2011 Regal, but it makes about 50 less horsepower than the Sonata's engine while getting only 29 m.p.g. on the highway. And that engine isn't destined for the LaCrosse anyhow.

HEADLINE: Pushing the Spotlight Away From Herself

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
UNLIKE most playwrights, who get to hide in the back of the theater on opening night -- if not in a bar around the corner -- Lisa Kron has spent most of her career performing in her own plays, which have frequently been autobiographical, including ''2.5 Minute Ride,'' about her father, and ''Well,'' about her perpetually unwell but nonetheless redoubtable mother, which had a Broadway run in 2006.
If you saw ''Well,'' it would be fair to assume that you know Lisa Kron: hyper-articulate, rational, analytical, sardonic, and, um, maybe a bit tightly wound.
But the Lisa Kron who sat down on a recent afternoon to discuss her new play, ''In the Wake,'' which begins previews at the Public Theater on Tuesday, was both like and unlike her onstage persona. She too was talkative and serious, especially about politics, a major theme of ''In the Wake,'' which is set against the backdrop of the Bush years. But whereas the Lisa Kron of ''Well'' wanted to impose order on her story by reducing her mother's life to a set of carefully organized index cards, the real Lisa Kron is preoccupied with life's uncertainties and the questions we can't answer. 
She explained that one of the things that inspired ''In the Wake'' -- the first major play she has written in which she does not also act -- was the frequency with which she heard Americans, after the Sept. 11 attacks, asking how such a horrible event could happen to them.
''There were many people, like me, who found that an appalling question,'' said Ms. Kron, 49, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor whose parents died in Auschwitz. ''Why not us? What does that mean? You really think there's logic to that kind of pain or tragedy?''
The question she wanted to ask in the play, she added, was, '' 'How far can we fall?' Certainly that was in my head all through the Bush administration: 'How bad can it get?' ''
Despite a fiercely funny writing style, Ms. Kron gives the sense of carrying the weight of the world on her blazered shoulders. (She did bring her toy poodle, Django, to the interview, although the restaurant's no-dogs-indoors policy ultimately meant relinquishing him to a publicist.) Somewhat surprisingly for an artist who has used her biography as raw material, she prefers not to discuss her personal life, calling herself a private person and drawing a sharp distinction between what audiences project onto her and her real self.
Perhaps it's a natural progression, then, that she would begin to separate herself from her work, and put her ideas in the mouths of fictional characters.
In ''In the Wake'' that character largely is Ellen, a zealously liberal New Yorker in her 30s who worries that deregulation and tax cuts are tipping the United States into oligarchy. While keenly aware, and critical, of the country's tendency to veer off course, Ellen is blind to her own self-destructiveness. At the beginning of the play she seems to have the ideal New York life: She lives with her devoted boyfriend, Danny, in the same building as Danny's sister and Ellen's best friend, Kayla, and Kayla's partner, Laurie.
Into this cozy family life Ellen throws a grenade: She falls in love with a woman named Amy and decides to explore that relationship while trying to maintain her bond with Danny as well.
Ms. Kron said that she sees Ellen as ''an allegory for the country -- this idea that we can expand infinitely'' without ever making sacrifices. ''Ultimately what the play wants to say is: To get to more, there's always going to be loss,'' she said.
Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, described ''In the Wake'' as ''a portrait of the way we live now'' and compared it to the work of Tony Kushner. ''Lisa has for some time been moving away from her definition as a performer-writer,'' he said. ''This is her embracing that what she is is a great American playwright.''
After growing up in Lansing, Mich., and spending a post-college year touring with a repertory theater company, Ms. Kron came to New York and found her voice as a solo performer in East Village theaters like Performance Space 122 and the WOW Cafe, a lesbian theater collective.
''I often say I was sort of trained like a vaudevillian,'' she recalled. ''I learned onstage, and I learned by doing.''
In the late '80s and '90s, she was part of a troupe called the Five Lesbian Brothers, which performed at the Public, New York Theater Workshop and elsewhere, and she wrote and appeared in two solo shows, ''101 Humiliating Stories'' and ''2.5 Minute Ride,'' in which she talked about her father's experience of being rescued from Germany in 1937, at the age of 15.
While the quirky six-character ''Well'' was Ms. Kron's first play to make it to Broadway, it closed after only six weeks. Still, the critical praise it earned -- Ben Brantley called her ''the best stand-up memoirist of the American theater'' in The New York Times -- opened up enormous opportunities.
Ms. Kron considered returning to the solo-show format for her next project, but chose instead to look at the Bush years through a traditional narrative and a group of fictional characters. Still, Ellen, a freelance writer in the play, clearly expresses Ms. Kron's views on the economy and the importance of government regulation, which were informed, she said, by commentators like Bill Moyers and Paul Krugman, the economist and columnist for The New York Times.
''In the Wake'' had its premiere last spring in a co-production by Center Theater Group and Berkeley Repertory Theater. At the Public three of the seven cast members and the director, Leigh Silverman, are the same; the other four, including Marin Ireland as Ellen, are new.
Between writing the play and seeing it staged in New York, Ms. Kron watched the Bush era end and the Obama administration begin. Still, ''I don't feel afraid that the play is less relevant,'' she said. ''To sort of put my Ellen on, I feel like we're still not even talking about the right things. I mean, state governments are starting to seize up. They're ceasing to function. There's about to be no money.''
Ellen may share Ms. Kron's political views, but she is not an alter ego. While Ms. Kron has explored lesbian themes in her work and lives with her partner of three years, the playwright Madeleine George, Ellen is straight. Even her relationship with Amy, while sexually passionate, is about being challenged by a new person, not about discovering that she is gay.
Ms. Kron said she made a conscious decision to put two of her main characters -- Ellen and an international aid worker named Judy -- in relationships with men. Otherwise she worried that part of the audience would write them off and tune out their political arguments as a result.
She doesn't seem to have agonized about the decision, presenting it simply as a pragmatic response to the challenge -- because it still is one -- of creating a female protagonist who will stand in for universal human experiences. ''I think there will come a point when you can have women with no men around, and that will carry the same presumed cultural weight as if there is only one man onstage,'' Ms. Kron predicted.
Asked which political playwrights she admires, Ms. Kron named Mr. Kushner and Tom Stoppard, two men who, despite their specifics -- Mr. Kushner, Jewish and gay; Mr. Stoppard, Jewish and a refugee -- have been hailed as universal artists. In a follow-up e-mail she added two playwright-performers, Wallace Shawn and Danny Hoch, both of whose work bears some similarity to her earlier plays.
But the references to Mr. Kushner and Mr. Stoppard better suggest her ambitions for ''In the Wake.'' And, to achieve them, she has decided to try, like those men do, hiding in the back of the theater. There she will be, listening to her words spoken by invented characters and seeing how they land.

 BODY:
ILLUMINATED by a single candle, the shaman's weathered face appeared kindly, like that of a sympathetic doctor, with painted red marks also suggesting a calm, fierce authority -- both qualities that I would rely on during the dark and uncertain hours ahead. He sat on a wooden stool carved into a tortoise, and wore turquoise beads around his neck and a crown of crimson feathers. A table beside him displayed the modest tools of the ceremony: a fan of leaves, jungle tobacco, a gourd bowl and a clear plastic soda bottle containing an opaque, brown liquid.
''You will start to feel a reaction in about half an hour,'' the shaman, Tsumpa, said, as my guide translated. ''When the effects come, you must concentrate on what the medicine is trying to communicate.''
The open air of the hut, animated with night sounds, grew still with expectation. Tsumpa grimaced as he drank the brew. After pouring a bowl for me, he cupped the gourd in his hands and for several minutes whistled a sweet melody into it -- the high key of a tin whistle or courting bird, seducing the plant spirits to aid me. 
The potion tasted acrid and bitter. I rinsed my mouth with water before rolling tobacco into a plantain leaf cigarette.
And then I waited.
It was the final night of my weeklong trip to explore the Ecuadorean rain forest and an indigenous people, the Achuar, who, for more than a decade, have been using limited tourism as a means to preserve and protect their land and way of life. I had traveled by car, plane, boat and foot -- more than 100 miles from conventional civilization -- to reach a place where the old ways have not been forgotten, where local people interpret the world through their dreams and the forest spirit known as arutam is said to inhabit the mighty kapok tree, and where healing and insight is sought from a hallucinogenic plant brew the Achuar call natem, known elsewhere as ayahuasca, or ''vine of the soul.''
The trip was to be a departure from the typical Amazon tourism, which tends to package wildlife viewing with a certain cultural voyeurism. I wanted something more immersive and participatory: an experience with Ecuador's indigenous people that would expose me to a different orientation altogether. Casting myself into a world that was utterly foreign, I hoped to return with new insight into the familiar.
Earlier in the week -- an evening in late spring -- I had landed in Quito, Ecuador's capital, which sprawls at 9,350 feet along the base of an active volcano in a distinctive atmosphere of thin air and diesel fumes that aroused dormant memories of the semester I had spent there during college. With me was David Tucker of the Pachamama Alliance, a San Francisco-based nongovernmental organization that supports the cultural and territorial rights of Ecuador's indigenous people and operates specialized tours into their homeland.
David had arranged for us to drive early the next morning to the Amazon basin, fly to a remote community that had recently built a small tourist camp in the forest, and then travel by foot and river to a more established lodge. Only despite a long layover, our bags were delayed from Miami -- an inauspicious start that would waylay us a day. David thought I might want to experience a ''cleansing'' from an indigenous Quichua shaman he knew living in the highlands two hours north of Quito, and the next morning hired a car to take us there.
The shaman's two-floor yellow cement home was modest but the stateliest around. A square altar to Jesus, crammed with crosses and tiny portraits, stood in the waiting room. The shaman, named Don Esteban, emerged wearing a knit V-neck sweater and slacks, beaded necklaces and a yellow-feathered headdress. He beckoned us into the adjacent treatment room, which was sparse and dim and smelled of burnt sugar cane alcohol. I was directed to sit in the corner beside a desk cluttered with melted wax, glass balls, brown eggs and various other mystical paraphernalia.
Don Esteban sat opposite me, next to his wife, a smiling woman with an array of gold teeth. ''Here, rub this over your body,'' he said, handing me an unlighted candle.
After I did so, he sparked the flame and gazed into it intently. ''Andres espiritu, Andres espiritu,'' the shaman incanted. ''Your spirit is not tranquil. It is sad, and longs for a new energy and path. It is struggling to balance your health, work and body.''
I told him that my father had died two months earlier. ''That is why there is sadness and disequilibrium,'' he said. ''This ceremony, and spending time in the mountains with Pachamama'' -- Mother Earth -- ''will help make your spirit whole.''
Don Esteban had me stand naked in the center of the room. Beating a drum and chanting around me, he summoned the ancestral spirits before instructing me to face the four directions of nearby volcanoes in turn, with arms raised, as he blew tobacco smoke on my skin and slapped me with nettle leaves. Then, with his cheeks engorged with alcohol, he held a candle flame to his lips and unleashed spectacular balls of fire that dissipated across my chest.
I looked on these ministrations with skepticism but was left feeling serene, and believing that my visit there had been serendipitous. Whether by intuition or sheer speculation Don Esteban had recognized my grief, and made it a central theme for the journey forward.
Riding back to Quito, I reflected on what the shaman had gone on to say. Three times, he had placed rose petals sprinkled with floral water into my palms, and told me to rub them all over from head to toe.
''Andres,'' he said all the while, ''open your heart.'' When we arrived at the hotel that night, our bags from Miami were awaiting.
The five-hour drive east from Quito into the Amazon basin passes through a highland corridor known as the Avenue of the Volcanoes. Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Antisana, Illiniza -- their snow-white peaks rise above Ecuador's fertile central valley like giants, and Andean indigenous people humanize them as such, relating to them as elder family members who hold great influence. This can sometimes be very handy: I was told of a pregnant young girl who dealt with her father's disapproval by blaming the cause on the Imbabura volcano. Who was he to argue?
Our flight into the jungle was to leave from Shell, a one-street frontier town on the edge of the Amazon basin that was established by the Shell oil company in the 1930s as a base for prospecting. After 20 years, Shell left and evangelical Christians moved in -- embarking on their own kind of prospecting from the town's small airport. (They're still there.) But when we arrived, flights were grounded because of rain. We were told to return the next day; David suggested we drive to nearby Puyo, the provincial capital, and meet some Achuar leaders.
Numbering around 6,000 on an ancestral territory of nearly two million acres in southeastern Ecuador, the Achuar people were among the last of the country's rain forest tribes to be contacted by outsiders, when some Salesian Catholic missionaries arrived in the 1960s. Elders say that in the early '90s they began having dreams about an imminent threat coming from the external world. Soon after, they learned that the western edge of their homeland had been given over to Arco as an oil concession.
Most of Ecuador's estimated 4.7 billion barrels in crude oil reserves -- the third largest in South America -- lie under the northeast Amazon region, where foreign corporations have left a legacy of pollution and displacement that has been widely decried.
But the Achuar had watched watching northern tribes struggle against oil companies, and beginning in 1991 were able to organize their scattered -- and historically warring -- communities into a political entity that has so far saved them from a similar fate.
Recognizing a need for outside allies, they met with a group of Americans to form the Pachamama Alliance, which for the last 15 years has helped the Achuar and other Amazonian indigenous groups from its Quito office with land titling, skills training, economic development and policy advocacy.
With proponents of oil development -- including Ecuador's president -- continuing to press for exploration on their land, the Achuar now find themselves embroiled in a classic struggle for power and resources that native people have almost always lost.
We found Chumpi Tsamarin (also known as Luis Vargas) who had been the Achuar's first president, seated inside the restaurant he opened on a side street in Puyo. Mr. Tsamarin, who has also led the political organization representing all nine of Ecuador's Amazonian indigenous groups, described the current territorial struggle in terms of psychological warfare (he saw ''Avatar'' as an affirmation of their cause, but thought the violent tactics depicted in the film were not inevitable); the Achuar, he said, feel staunchly resolute about their right to defend what is theirs. As they see it, our collective survival is imperiled by the modern ''dream,'' as he put it, that sees nature as an endless fount of resources.
So far, Mr. Tsamarin said, tourism has presented the most viable, nonpolluting source of economic security. In 1996, the Achuar opened Kapawi Lodge & Reserve, which receives an average of 1,000 visitors a year. Last month the United Nations named it one of the top five outstanding environmental conservation and community development projects in the world. Though the lodge was initially set up in joint partnership with an Ecuadorean tour company, the Achuar have assumed full ownership. Most of its 30 staff members are natives, and some received hotel management training in Quito.
But the benefits of tourism have a corollary, and Mr. Tsamarin lamented them: the loss of communal values and a new market mentality, alcohol abuse, litter, men cutting off their traditional ponytails. The Achuar now want to expand a controlled form of tourism farther into their territory, and have built a camp in the forest near the remote community of Tiinkias to offer visitors a more rustic experience than Kapawi. I would be the first tourist there.
After spending a night at the luxuriant El Jardin Hotel in Puyo, we were cleared for takeoff the next afternoon in a small Cessna operated by Aerotsentsak, the Achuar's aviation service. From on high the metaphor of the Amazon as earth's lung came to life: below us, wispy clouds lingered over the virgin forest as vaporous exhalations while mocha-colored rivers coursed through it like capillaries.
After an hour, we landed at a dirt airstrip beside Chichirat, a forested settlement of 10 families north of Tiinkias.
I immediately felt transported by the absence of mechanical ambience, as though the soothing sounds of nature were reaching me through noise-canceling headphones. David and I stepped off the plane as dozens of villagers stared at us quizzically, and a man with a round face and thin mustache walked forward, introducing himself warmly as Shakai. He would be our guide. As children carried off our bags, Shakai led us into the elliptical communal house built over the dirt with a high palm-thatched roof and open walls, and divided along gender lines. Males sat on benches around the perimeter; women clustered in the back.
In short order, I was handed a red clay bowl painted with black-and-white shapes, filled with the staple brew of sweet fermented manioc called nijiamanch. A performance began: a woman walked up to me and sang shyly in Achuar about a sunny day alone in the forest, when she missed her husband, but was comforted knowing that he was somewhere witnessing the same sun. In a fragile falsetto, a young man with a long ponytail voiced words meant to ward off a bad omen he received. I was handed a drum and told to meander around beating it, to the amusement of all, while a girl hopped erratically beside me in a kind of courtship dance.
Their unpolished performance was touching, and being the first ever for a tourist gave it the feeling of historical significance. But this also troubled me, as I considered how my arrival marked the ushering of changes that Mr. Tsamarin had described. And yet there's this unexpected upside. Such quaint cultural displays meant to satisfy tourists expecting something ''authentic'' and exotic can also resuscitate and revive aspects of traditional culture. ''It makes us see how we're admired and validates the importance of our traditions,'' Mr. Tsamarin had told me, adding that the Achuar now consider the value of their cultural heritage as a useful leverage against oil development.
It became too late to travel on to Tiinkias, so we ate dinner -- a crispy heliconia leaf stuffed with steaming wild turkey, palm hearts and green onion -- in the thatched house of the local shaman, and pitched tents on the wooden floor of the schoolhouse.
That night I dreamed of my mother and father defending the rain forest, and later, of Ben Stiller announcing a televised ski race in an Afro wig. When I awoke at 4 a.m., roosters were already declaring it daytime through the pitch darkness. The Achuar typically rise at this transitional hour to drink guayusa, a caffeinated tea grown in the forest. It is a time when fathers pass on values to their children, mothers teach skills to their daughters and dreams are interpreted.
The local shaman, Jippeikit, told me that my first dream was about my father wanting to reunite with my mother -- ''Even when we die, our souls still exist,'' he said. The skiing dream, he sensed, was a story of competition, which boded well. ''When you visit another area,'' he said, ''you will not have any problems.''
We reached Tiinkias after a short trek through the muggy forest and a motorized canoe ride downriver. Its two dozen inhabitants were awaiting us in the communal house, beside a dirt clearing with a volleyball net woven from plant fibers. Laundry hung to dry between thatched-roof dwellings. An uneven footbridge spanned part of a small lagoon where a caiman rested on a log.
Over two idyllic days I found myself content simply in the Achuar's mellow presence. We spent hours in the communal house drinking nijiamanch, tended by women constantly squeezing the pulp by hand. Often, some story I couldn't understand provoked fits of laughter. I sang a bluegrass gospel number for the Achuar; David played guitar. Each morning, I had my dreams read by an elder.
We slept in the new tourist camp, built on a forested knoll just outside the settlement, with a simple layout of elevated wooden platforms covered by thatched roofs that extend into eating and sleeping areas meant to accommodate the groups of up to 16 visitors they anticipate.
Shakai became not just my guide to the forest but also its interpreter. In a nondescript leafy plant he saw a remedy for gastritis; in an electric blue morpho butterfly that fluttered erratically past, he saw the ears of a deceased ancestor. ''What does a stick bug represent?'' I wondered aloud. Shakai said it was just a stick bug.
One afternoon we passed a kapok tree, 150 feet tall with splayed buttresses and thick, weeping vines, which Shakai explained as a home of arutam: the spirit of the forest, and ancestors.
When Shakai was 13, he said, like all Achuar boys, he ventured into the forest alone to find arutam. For three days prior he fasted. He then laid a seat of palm leaves beneath a kapok tree and prepared the sacred forest medicines: datura and natem, hallucinogens that produce potent visions.
Arutam first arrived, the Achuar believe, in a form of strength: a jaguar, or sometimes an anaconda, or lightning. If one becomes afraid, it is said, arutam disappears. But move toward it courageously, and the vision is supposed to transform into an elder ancestor, who reveals one's life calling.
During this rite of passage, Shakai saw himself working with outsiders he'd never seen before. When Kapawi Lodge was built many years later, Shakai would become one of its first guides.
We reached Kapawi by motoring down the Bobonaza River, up the wide Pastaza, to the Capahuari -- a four-hour journey that dipped us briefly into Peruvian territory. The lodge is set on a sheltered lagoon; 18 palm-thatched bungalows, built on stilts above the shallow water in traditional Achuar style -- without nails, but with modern comforts like solar-heated showers and eco-friendly flush toilets -- are connected with airy dining and lounging areas by an elevated boardwalk. The lagoon behaves as a town plaza for bird life, and screened back walls and shaded balconies ensure that guests are always well positioned, from bed or hammock, to observe its lively happenings.
It was the low season, and we and a German couple were Kapawi's only guests. Visitors typically fly in from Shell on four-, five- or eight-day packages of standard jungle lodge fare: dugout canoe rides, guided forest walks, and spotting animals (Kapawi's remote location within a protected reserve offers a particularly excellent chance of that). Riding back the next morning from a clay lick enjoyed by chestnut-fronted macaws, we came across pink river dolphins. Later we paddled a canoe looking for anaconda but returned satisfied by yellow-rumped caciques nesting beside hoatzins, a prehistoric-looking, pheasant-sized bird with a spiky mohawk. Alone on Kapawi's self-guided trail one afternoon, I startled (I should say the reaction was mutual) 30 ring-tailed coatis, which leaped onto tree limbs and then fixed me with beady stares.
But Kapawi places an emphasis on cultural activities, and guests can learn how women make nijiamanch or spend a night in a local Achuar community. Lodge staff members can also arrange participation in a dream-sharing ceremony with guayusa tea. But through a local shaman who knew and trusted David and Shakai, I received a special invitation to drink natem, which is how I landed, on that final evening, in Tsumpa's house.
Tsumpa and his wife, along with a dozen children and grandchildren, live by themselves high above the Pastaza River on a tidy clearing ringed by coconut palms, manioc plants, fruit trees and a garden of various plant medicines. It was dusk when we arrived; in the distance, isolated cumulonimbus thunderclouds were set aflame by the pink-orange sun. Tsumpa was seated within a bucolic tableau: his sturdy wife prepared bowls of nijiamanch and tended to chores, while one daughter sat on a bamboo platform breast-feeding and another wove a headband. Dogs napped on cold ashes; an orphaned, saddle-backed tamarind monkey hopped onto a bunch of plantains; a toucan perched on a nearby log.
Tsumpa served me the natem in an adjacent hut. All appeared normal, until after what seemed like 20 minutes it no longer did. A montage of images emerged from the darkness -- neon crystals, a lion. Soon my body dissolved into the surroundings, swallowed by a sea of energy. Unmoored and disoriented, I was adrift in a more expansive reality.
This brought a greater awareness, and I began to perceive things that had been imperceptible, like a low-frequency vibration permeating the environment. The hum of the universe? My thoughts drifted between visions. I imagined myself basking in the sun on the flanks of the volcano Chimborazo. I saw images from childhood and of random friends back home, all presented like scenes from the narrative of my life. Then my father appeared, seated in a chair before me, like a ghost. For several minutes we exchanged the sentiments that I had regretted not expressing before he died: What a life we shared, we both seemed to say. I looked down and noticed I was sobbing, and when I looked back up, he was gone.
Tsumpa was whistling and shaking leaves around a sick baby that had been brought to him for a cleansing, and Shakai asked if I'd like the same. I sat before Tsumpa and felt his hands on the crown of my head. His whistling seemed to conjure a protective field; in the leaves fanning my shoulders, I sensed a dusting of energy.
''Look at the stars,'' Shakai said. The night was alive and glorious. Stepping outside felt like entering a larger room, the constellations stretching overhead as a low-hanging ceiling. David noticed my lingering sniffles and offered a bowl of tobacco-infused water, a traditional remedy, to clear my nose. Snorting it triggered a surge of intense sensation and then violent waves of vomiting unlike any I had ever experienced. More bizarre were the accompanying sounds: primeval bellows so loud and resonant they seemed to echo for miles. After, I could hear Tsumpa's daughters giggling, and soon we were all laughing.
I laid myself down on a palm leaf, spent and contented. David and I chatted into the night. The Achuar conversed in their huts. Babies cried and were hushed. A gunshot went off in the forest, the sound of a lone man hunting. Within this dynamic nightscape, the boundaries between waking and sleeping, between inside and outside -- indeed between humans and nature -- blurred to nothing.
I awoke refreshed after a few hours of sleep, no longer feeling the queasiness that had been bothering me for two days. Sipping a coconut from Tsumpa's tree, I asked the shaman what he had noticed in me.
''Andres,'' he said simply, ''You came here to learn about the culture, the rain forest and reality of the Achuar people. Now you've seen that.''
David and I returned to Quito later that morning and parted ways. I had given myself a few more days in Ecuador without a plan, but now I knew where to go. I traveled south through the highlands to Riobamba, and then ascended to Estrellas de Chimborazo, a cozy mountain lodge set beneath Ecuador's highest peak, ''Father'' Chimborazo -- some say that elevated by the equatorial bulge, it reaches closer to the stars than any spot on Earth.
I took walks alone through the surrounding paramo, the bushy, blond grassland carpeting the volcano's flanks, past grazing alpacas, and lay for hours on my back.
It was precisely the time with Pachamama that Don Esteban had prescribed for me. And as I had envisioned myself.

HEADLINE: Shakira Conquers New Arenas

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
IT was just another day in New York City for Shakira, toggling between pop star and do-gooder. She spent the early morning of Sept. 23 at Rockefeller Center for a five-minute interview on ''Today'' to promote her new album, ''Sale el Sol'' (''The Sun Comes Out''). Asked how she gets her hips to move the way they do, she replied, with a giggle, ''A magician doesn't reveal the tricks.''
That's about as much guile as Shakira would ever show. Her greatest trick -- if it is one -- has little to do with her famous hips, which can move every which way without special effects. But it's far more difficult to maintain Shakira's air of transparency, the ease with which she leaps from culture to culture, role to role and language to language, all with bubbly girlishness and, behind it, a perfectionist's attention to detail. 
''Sale el Sol'' (Epic) is Shakira's latest shift of direction. Her 2009 album, ''She Wolf,'' aimed for the international common denominator of electronic dance music; Shakira produced most of it with the Neptunes, a team of prolific, and familiar, hip-hop and R&B hit makers. ''Sale el Sol,'' with songs primarily in Spanish, drops that mainstreaming strategy in favor of instinct, whim and glimmers of what Shakira, 33, calls nostalgia. It's full of idiosyncratic crossovers and hybrids, often tied to very specific places.
''It's like I found myself again,'' Shakira said. ''You get influenced by everything you hear on the radio, or maybe by what you feel that other people's expectations are. But then you suddenly realize that everything you need to write about is what's inside of you -- to not look outside but inside.''
Pitbull, a Cuban-American rapper who appears on the album, said: ''On the last album they tried to Americanize Shakira by giving her the big producers. Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, but it's just not her.''
Moments after her ''Today'' appearance, Shakira ducked into a downstairs dressing room to finish writing a speech for her next stop: a conference room at the United Nations Development Program building. She emerged wearing a sleek black pantsuit with silvery trim, and climbed into a black S.U.V. for a long crawl crosstown, which gave her ample time for an interview. After being whisked through United Nations security, she touched up her lipstick and joined the president of her native Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, to announce the formation of Colombians From Birth, a $25 million public-private initiative to improve early-childhood education.
''The only way to overcome poverty and inequality is changing the equation in which a child that is born poor will die poor,'' she said in her speech, in Spanish, with President Santos at her side. ''And that equation can best be solved during the first years of life.'' President Santos embraced her warmly, and praised the Shakira concert he'd attended at Madison Square Garden two nights earlier as ''emocionante'' -- thrilling.
After the officials left the conference room, Shakira said earnestly, ''My work as an artist helps me get close to people that have an enormous influence on the lives and destinies of so many, like the president of my country, so I can discuss things that are far more important than myself.''
Her day had only begun. Back in pop-star mode, Shakira would preview ''Sale el Sol'' for the Latin press, summing it up for sound bites as part rock, part romantic, part Latin. Then she was off to ''The Late Show With David Letterman,'' where she and her dancers shimmied through her new single, the distinctly Latin ''Loca,'' a merengue with rapping. Afterward Shakira flew to Florida to continue her arena tour: another night of glitter, hip swiveling and bilingual singalongs.
Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll has been working like that for most of her life: first in Colombia, where she emerged from the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla as a teenage ''rockera'' -- she translates it as ''rock chick'' -- and eventually as the globe-hopping star who may well be Latin America's most famous performer. She's a brand name; she just introduced her own fragrance, the vanilla-and-sandalwood S by Shakira. Yet she hasn't forgotten her origins. With sweet determination she has continually mixed the local and the global. ''Hips Don't Lie,'' her ubiquitous 2006 hit, included a line in Spanish -- ''Look, in Barranquilla we dance like this'' -- as the video showed dance moves from Barranquilla's Carnaval.
But last year's ''She Wolf'' came close to homogenizing Shakira. It aimed for the kind of electronic club beats that were also powering Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga, and at times the production ran Shakira's distinctively tremulous voice through the dehumanizing Auto-Tune. Although the album reached the Top 10 in the United States and elsewhere, and ''She Wolf'' was a gold single in the United States, the album has only sold 352,000 copies here after a string of million sellers.
''Sale el Sol'' follows it quickly, compared with the four-year gap between ''She Wolf'' and Shakira's previous albums, ''Fijacion Oral Vol. 1'' and ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2,'' both in 2005. ''I realized that the world was faster than I am, and I've got to catch up somehow,'' she said.
While the album's title song, the folk-rock ''Sale el Sol,'' calls for optimism through difficult times, songs like ''Devocion,'' ''Antes de las Seis'' (''Before 6 O'Clock'') and ''Lo que Mas'' (''The Most'') churn with longing, regrets and loneliness. ''We all go through hard moments,'' Shakira said. ''Whatever happened, it's right there in the the songs.'' She smiled. ''I've decided that I'm not going to explain every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain me better than I can explain them.''
The music hopscotches across hemispheres, at times looking back to the music Shakira loved while growing up in Barranquilla. ''Barranquilla is the cradle of Carnaval in our country,'' she said. ''All the stuff from the islands and from those neighbor countries, all that music got to Barranquilla.''
Shakira grew nostalgic for merengue, from the Dominican Republic, and three songs on the album, including ''Loca,'' are electrified merengue fusions. Referred by Pitbull -- ''I always try to listen to what's hitting in the streets in different parts of the world,'' he said -- Shakira recorded with a Dominican producer and rapper, El Cata, in his tiny studio in a rough neighborhood of Santo Domingo.
''If I was thinking that this little studio was going to be in the world's vision at this time, I wouldn't believe it,'' El Cata said by telephone from Santo Domingo. ''She told me, 'You have something that makes me move.' I told her it was the percussion, and I said, 'Those sounds that you want, I have them in my studio.' ''
Another Latin-rap hybrid, ''Gordita'' (''Little Fatty,'' a term of affection), pairs Shakira with Rene Perez Joglar, who is the rapper Residente in the Puerto Rican alternative hip-hop group Calle 13. The beat is a Colombian cumbia with the drums pumped up, and Residente raps, in Spanish, that he liked Shakira better when -- early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick. ''I told her it was a good idea to make fun of yourself,'' he said by telephone from Puerto Rico, ''That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it.''
The album includes English and Spanish versions of this summer's worldwide hit ''Waka Waka (Esto es Africa),'' the official anthem of the World Cup. The song is built directly on a 1986 song by the Golden Sounds, from Cameroon. It was a hit on Colombia's Caribbean coast, introduced there by African disc jockeys. ''It was sort of tattooed to my brain, and I always wanted to do something with it,'' Shakira said. ''When they asked me to do something for the South African World Cup, I thought that song would be fantastic.''
Shakira wrote the lyrics to ''Waka Waka'' in English, but brought in a fellow songwriter to adapt them into Spanish: Jorge Drexler, the literary-minded Uruguayan who won an Oscar for Best Original Song, from ''The Motorcycle Diaries.'' He had also worked with her on Spanish adaptations for ''She Wolf.'' At times they worked day and night on honing her songs. ''If what I proposed was understandable and at the same time a little wild and poetic, that was the choice,'' Mr. Drexler said by telephone from Madrid. ''She would go for the impact. She is like a fighter. She chooses her punch lines very, very well, and she works on that very, very hard.''
In ''Waka Waka'' Shakira's English lyrics compare soccer players to soldiers on the front lines. Mr. Drexler's Spanish version demilitarized the song; it talks about walls coming down and the game being the only justifiable battle. ''Let's use this song to talk about peace, not the war metaphor,'' he recalled thinking. Shakira selected those lyrics.
''I have this gift, and I try to use it as wisely as I can, you know?'' she said. ''I realized the weight that I carry with a song like that one, that so many people are going to make it part of their lives. So it had better send a message that is positive, that is optimistic, that brings a healthy state of mind to people's lives.
''There are songs that are just to dance to in a club, that don't have a big transcendence. But there are songs that will remain in people's hearts and people's consciousness, sometimes forever. There are songs that have the power to feed people's relationships and states of mind and states of spirit. I remember moments in my life that are completely linked to a certain song, so every song has a purpose. But when I'm creating a song, I do it in such a personal and intimate way that at that moment. I'm not really thinking much. I'm just letting it all out.''
The United Nations conference room was being cleared; Shakira had a busy afternoon ahead, and an assistant was signaling her to wrap things up. ''I'm trying to remain genuine,'' she said. ''I don't want to end up posing.''

HEADLINE: King of Beers, And a Slippery Throne

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
MANY Americans barely noticed two years ago when InBev of Belgium took over Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser, for $52 billion. But the deal transformed an industry and represented the failure of a proud but parochial American family dynasty to stave off a foreign threat, says Julie MacIntosh, author of ''Dethroning the King: The Hostile Takeover of Anheuser-Busch, an American Icon'' (Wiley, $27.95).
''At certain points in American history, protectionist rhetoric alone might have rustled up enough popular anger to ruin InBev's takeover attempt,'' Ms. MacIntosh says. ''But this was not a time for political or economic frivolity. People were too distracted by the credit crunch-related turmoil in their own lives to care about whether Budweiser was brewed by an American or Belgian company.'' 
Ms. MacIntosh, who covered the Anheuser story as a New York-based mergers-and-acquisitions correspondent for The Financial Times, earns extra credit for staying on the Anheuser-InBev case despite considerable macrocosmic distractions. During most of the takeover negotiations, her colleagues were understandably focused on the 2008 economic crisis. The author's persistence pays off in her account of the Busch family's searing internecine strife.
The principal characters in this drama are August Busch Jr., known as Gussie; his son August Busch III; and grandson August Busch IV.
In 1975, at the age of 37, August III deposed Gussie as chairman and chief executive of Anheuser-Busch in a boardroom coup. That act was particularly shocking, according to Ms. MacIntosh, because Gussie was ''ahead of his time in understanding mass marketing and promotion'' -- for example, his development of the Busch Gardens theme parks.
Gussie and his son did not speak to each other for the next 10 years, Ms. MacIntosh writes. In the interim, the son hired many M.B.A.'s, took the company public and built Anheuser's share of the American market to 52 percent in 2002 from 28 percent in 1980. Its celebrated marketing slogan was ''This Bud's for You.''
Alas, these domestic successes may have sown the seeds of Anheuser's demise. August III remained so focused on the American market that he seemed blinded to growth opportunities on the international front, Ms. MacIntosh says.
Although August III acquired a 50.2 percent stake in Grupo Modelo of Mexico, the agreement did not include exclusive United States distribution rights to brands like Corona.
August III also spent lavishly. An avid airplane pilot, he maintained an expensive fleet of jets dubbed ''Air Bud'' and flew to work each day in a helicopter.
InBev would enter the Anheuser picture with gradually increasing pressure. Led by a foursome of Brazilians -- the chief executive Carlos Brito and three investment bankers -- InBev formed a joint venture with Anheuser in 2006 to distribute brands like Beck's and Stella Artois in the United States. Early on, InBev floated the idea of a merger, but Anheuser brushed it off. In the summer of 2008, InBev announced an unsolicited offer to buy the company.
By then, August IV had been named chief executive -- despite investor concerns over ''whether he was well-rounded enough, intellectually or managerially, to handle the top job,'' Ms. MacIntosh writes. (The job had been outside the family for four years starting in 2002, when August III left it under rules that required the C.E.O. to relinquish the job at age 65.)
August III still lorded over his C.E.O. son. August IV seemed ''unwilling to challenge his father's dominance,'' rarely made presentations, and ''became increasingly out of touch and distant,'' the author writes.
Unbeknownst to many people, the Busch family was almost powerless to fend off InBev. As Ms. MacIntosh notes, the Busches owned only 4 percent of the Anheuser company stock in the wake of August III's public offering in 1980; most of the outstanding shares were controlled by pension funds and hedge funds.
Anheuser flirted with acquiring the 49.8 percent of Modelo it did not already own, and even suggested putting the Modelo chief Carlos Fernandez in charge of the combined companies rather than August IV. But the deal did not win approval from the Anheuser board, in no small part because August III opposed it.
The Anheuser board did get InBev to increase its offer to $70 a share, from $65. InBev also agreed to call the new entity Anheuser-Busch InBev and to have its North American headquarters in St. Louis. And then it was all over for the Busch family's 132-year rule. In a replay of generational hostilities, August III and August IV seldom spoke after that.
MS. MacINTOSH does an admirable job of gathering colorful Busch family anecdotes. There is the story that, in keeping with tradition, both August III and August IV were fed five drops of Budweiser within hours of their births. But the book's narrative structure is flawed. Rather than telling the saga in a straightforward, linear fashion, it jumps back and forth between developments in the InBev takeover and accounts of family history, making both story lines hard to follow.
Even so, ''Dethroning the King'' makes for a fine yarn with a cautionary message about American business in the age of globalization. InBev began laying off workers less than a month after the deal formally closed, Ms. MacIntosh reports. Maybe the next time a foreign entity tries to acquire a major American family company, the public will take notice before it becomes a fait accompli.

HEADLINE: Forsaken by Her Party, Senator Talks to Anyone Who'll Listen

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. -- Senator Blanche Lincoln, the incumbent Democrat -- a double-whammy of a handicap this year -- was hanging around the Pope County Courthouse here, looking for someone, anyone, to talk to.
''Hi, I'm Blanche Lincoln,'' the two-term senator said, popping her head into an office populated by two people, one of whom barely looked up while the other politely declared herself a supporter of Mrs. Lincoln's Republican opponent, Representative John Boozman.
''I'd love to come around here for one of y'all's office Christmas parties,'' Mrs. Lincoln told the county judge, Jim Ed Gibson, before heading up a flight of stairs and down a dark hallway.
It has come to this for the chairwoman of a powerful Senate committee, a former up-and-comer in her party and onetime favorite daughter in a state whose political royalty includes President Bill Clinton and former Senators J. William Fulbright and Dale Bumpers. 
Late on Thursday afternoon, the 80-year-old courthouse was largely abandoned, which could aptly describe the predicament of Mrs. Lincoln, the 50-year-old Arkansan who became the youngest woman ever elected to the Senate 12 years ago and the first to lead the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.
She appears abandoned by voters, who have favored Mr. Boozman by double digits in nearly every poll in recent months. She has been forsaken by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has essentially written off her race and apportioned almost no money to it, and she has been dismissed by pundits, handicappers and operatives who are focused instead on a cluster of tossup Senate races in states -- like Colorado, Illinois, Nevada and West Virginia -- that absolutely do not include this one.
''It might not be a total wipeout for Lincoln,'' said Jennifer Duffy, the senior editor of the Cook Political Report, charitably. ''But it's going to be bad for her.''
Mrs. Lincoln, whose come-from-behind defeat of Lt. Gov. Bill Halter in a Democratic primary runoff brought her fleeting hope in June, now finds herself very much on the wrong side of the triage that takes place in the final weeks of a Congressional campaign. This is particularly true in a midterm election in which both parties are engaged in a national chess game, deciding which races are winnable or within reach and deserving of their vast but finite means.
This beyond-hope fate befalls dozens of candidates in every national election cycle. But what is striking -- and oddly poignant -- about Mrs. Lincoln is the degree to which such a formidable incumbent who is, in large part, well respected by her colleagues and well liked by many of her constituents, finds herself as seemingly left for dead.
''To be honest with you, I'd rather do it on my own,'' Mrs. Lincoln said in an interview after an impromptu meet-and-greet session on Thursday night at the Russellville Whirlwinds junior high school football game.
She is largely getting her wish, doing it on her own, with a few exceptions. Mr. Clinton, for one, comes back here periodically and has campaigned twice with Mrs. Lincoln in the last six weeks, most recently on Wednesday night at a rally in Jonesboro.
Mr. Clinton is the rare national Democrat who is popular here these days -- President Obama, who lost this state to Senator John McCain in 2008, is box-office poison at this point. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. held a fund-raiser for Mrs. Lincoln last month, but it was in Boston -- the city in Massachusetts, not the township in northwest Arkansas.
As with many incumbent Democrats, Mrs. Lincoln has been stung by association with the president's agenda. She takes strenuous pains to distance herself from the White House, trumpet her centrist credentials and assert her independence from her Democratic colleagues.
''Look, as far as the Democratic caucus in the Senate goes, I've spent my share of time in the time-out chair over there,'' Mrs. Lincoln said, noting her opposition to cap-and-trade energy measures and her support for lowering estate taxes, both of which put her at odds with most of her Democratic colleagues.
But by and large, Mrs. Lincoln's support for such divisive White House-driven legislation as last year's economic stimulus bill and especially this year's health care overhaul -- which she voted for only after equivocating, upsetting both liberals and conservatives -- has put her in a seemingly inescapable box.
''She can be tough, but she is wishy-washy by nature,'' said Max Brantley, a longtime political columnist here who is the editor of the left-leaning Arkansas Times. ''This is no year for that on things like health care. She made the worst of a bad situation by temporizing and creating a drama in which she became the star last vote.''
In a dogged procession that routinely totals six or seven campaign stops a day, Mrs. Lincoln speaks often about her family, especially her young twin boys. She also mentions her chairmanship of the agriculture committee, a position that affords obvious advantage to a rural state and would be a political asset in a normal year.
But Mrs. Lincoln is one of several examples of a powerful veteran lawmaker whose growing influence in Washington belies declining home-state electoral prospects.
''I've worked hard to get to places that are useful to you,'' Mrs. Lincoln said, almost pleadingly, at a Democratic women's luncheon at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock on Friday. ''And I'm not doing it for me. I'm doing it for you.''
Like pretty much every underdog politician in America, Mrs. Lincoln insists that she is going to win, that momentum is shifting toward her and that she hates polls (except, presumably, the internal ones her campaign officials let slip that have her within single digits of Mr. Boozman, not the 19.7 percent average deficit of recent polls compiled by RealClearPolitics).
She wears brightly colored scarves to match a determinedly sunny disposition on the stump. Everything was either ''wonderful'' or ''great'' Thursday on a tour of a community services agency in Russellville. For the most part, she is greeted warmly, even by people who do not support her. There is no visible sign of the dreaded ''voter rage'' that supposedly defines today's political mood.
As she meandered through the state fairgrounds in Little Rock late Friday, Mrs. Lincoln conveyed serenity and a hint of nostalgia. The seventh-generation Arkansan had changed into jeans and a white sweater with the collar turned up, ate fistfuls of popcorn and contemplated making a bid on a goat in a livestock auction.
''My husband would hit the ceiling,'' concluded Mrs. Lincoln, whose family owned a rice and soybean farm in Helena, Ark., with a couple of pigs (''not show pigs'') out in the pecan orchard.
She resisted the deep-fried Twinkie stand and headed into the Hall of Industry, where she stopped by a booth to get her handwriting analyzed.
A few feet away, Bruce Todd of Franklin, Wis., tried to entice Mrs. Lincoln into filling out a raffle ticket that could yield her a ''fantastic vacation cruise'' in the Bahamas.
''No, thank you,'' she said at first, before succumbing to Mr. Todd's last-chance sales pitch. ''I guarantee you might win,'' he promised.

HEADLINE: How Countrywide Covered the Cracks

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ON June 27, 2006, Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, was about to close its books on a record-breaking six-month run. The housing market was on fire and Countrywide's earnings were soaring. Despite all the euphoria inside the company, some executives noticed that Angelo R. Mozilo, the company's brash and imperious chief executive, seemed subdued.
At a town hall meeting that day with 110 of the company's highest-ranking executives in Calabasas, Calif., Mr. Mozilo sat alone on a stage, fielding questions and offering rosy predictions about his company's prospects. But then he struck a sober note in response to a question from one of his colleagues.
The questioner wanted to know what, if anything, worried Mr. Mozilo, according to a participant. 
''I wake up every day frightened that something is going to happen to Countrywide,'' Mr. Mozilo said.
A year and a half later, that day arrived. In January 2008, Countrywide, the company he had built from a two-man mortgage operation into a lending behemoth, had to sell itself to Bank of America at a bargain price because it was being smothered by losses tied to a mountain of sketchy loans.
Yet almost until the moment Countrywide was taken over, Mr. Mozilo was publicly buoyant about its ability to ride out the mortgage crisis. Privately, however, he occasionally offered a gloomier assessment of Countrywide's prospects and practices, according to e-mail and interviews.
What Mr. Mozilo, now 71, knew about Countrywide's problems, and precisely when he knew it, was what eventually led the Securities and Exchange Commission to file civil securities fraud charges against him last year. And on Friday, in the Los Angeles courtroom of John F. Walter, a federal District Court judge, representatives for Mr. Mozilo and for two of his top lieutenants -- David Sambol, Countrywide's former president, and Eric Sieracki, the company's former chief financial officer -- settled those charges.
As part of the settlement, Mr. Mozilo and his co-defendants didn't admit to any wrongdoing. But Mr. Mozilo agreed to pay $67.5 million in a penalty and reparations to investors and is permanently banned from serving as an officer or a director of a public company. Mr. Sambol is paying $5.52 million in a penalty and reparations and agreed to a three-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Mr. Sieracki agreed to pay a $130,000 penalty.
The settlement is a signal event in the credit crisis and its aftermath, including the foreclosure debacle that is now rattling the mortgage market and upending the lives of average homeowners. Although Goldman Sachs settled securities fraud charges earlier this year, Mr. Mozilo is the first prominent chief executive to be held personally accountable for questionable business practices that contributed to the housing bubble, the dizzying financial machinations that surrounded it, and a ruinous lending spree that ultimately threatened to undermine the nation's economy.
Mr. Mozilo and his two former colleagues were accused of misrepresenting the company's declining lending standards during 2006 and 2007 and portraying themselves publicly as underwriters of high-quality mortgages even as they learned that the company's loans were becoming increasingly risky.
The government also contended that Mr. Mozilo and Mr. Sambol improperly profited on inside information about the company's problematic loans when they sold Countrywide shares. From May 2005 to the end of 2007, Mr. Mozilo generated $260 million from his stock sales, while Mr. Sambol's sales produced $40 million, the government says.
Lawyers for Mr. Mozilo declined to comment. Mr. Sambol's lawyer said his client had ''put the matter behind him for the benefit of his family and loved ones.'' Mr. Sieracki's lawyer noted that the S.E.C. had decided not to pursue fraud charges against his client and that his client had not been barred from serving at a public company. Bank of America is paying Mr. Mozilo's legal bills. Countrywide is paying $5 million toward Mr. Sambol's repayment to investors and $20 million of Mr. Mozilo's reparations.
The S.E.C.'s legal team, led by John M. McCoy III, associate regional director of the enforcement division, said the settlement amounted to a hard-won victory.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. McCoy said: ''This settlement will provide affected shareholders significant financial relief, and reinforces the message that corporate officers have a personal responsibility to provide investors with an accurate and complete picture of known risks and uncertainties facing a company.''
Battered by widespread criticism that it failed to corral scam artists like Bernard L. Madoff and to effectively police Wall Street as a whole during the years leading up to the credit crisis, the S.E.C. may now regain some stature as a successful litigator and investor advocate from its settlement with Mr. Mozilo.
''As is the case with most settlements, this is a compromise where nobody comes out a complete winner,'' said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an authority on securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels. ''The S.E.C. gets a substantial monetary settlement and a bar with respect to Mozilo serving as an officer or director. On Mozilo's side, he is probably satisfied to have this behind him. He suffers a considerable stain on his reputation, has to pay a substantial amount of money but retains significant wealth and at the age of 71 may find the possibility of being an officer or director of another public company less enticing.''
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL began operations in 1969, when Mr. Mozilo and his mentor, David Loeb, refugees from an established mortgage lender, decided to start their own loan originator. The company grew slowly at first, but by 2004, Countrywide was the nation's largest home lender, generating annual revenue of $8.6 billion. Mr. Mozilo ran the company alone after Mr. Loeb retired in 2000. (Mr. Loeb died in 2003.)
An up-by-the-bootstraps entrepreneur -- his father was a butcher in the Bronx -- Mr. Mozilo was obsessed with wresting market share away from his buttoned-down rivals in the staid world of banking.
''I run into these guys on Wall Street all the time who think they're something special because they went to Ivy League schools,'' he told The New York Times in 2005. ''We're always underestimated. And we still are. I am. I must say, it bothered me when I was younger -- their snobbery and their looking down on us.''
In an industry that favored low-key behavior and conservative dress, Mr. Mozilo stood apart. He offered blunt opinions about banking and was open about his corporate aspirations. To complement his ever-present tan, he wore flashy clothes and drove expensive cars like Rolls-Royces that were often painted in a shade of gold.
Still, he managed his business for most of its history with a tight focus on the bottom line and on vigilant lending practices.
For years, Countrywide specialized in plain-vanilla, fixed-rate loans. As recently as 2003, such mortgages accounted for 95 percent of the company's loans, according to regulatory filings. Countrywide was the biggest supplier of mortgage loans to Fannie Mae, the federally backed mortgage finance giant that was also hobbled in the credit crisis.
In 2004, Countrywide's sober-minded lending style changed significantly. It began aggressively offering loans to first-time home buyers and to borrowers with modest incomes. These mortgages were known in the industry as ''affordability products,'' but that ho-hum designation belied the potential financial dangers embedded in the loans if borrowers -- particularly low-income borrowers -- wound up unable to pay their debts.
Even so, Countrywide embraced such loans with gusto. For example, adjustable-rate mortgages -- those with a low introductory rate that could ratchet up in later years -- accounted for about 18 percent of Countrywide's business in 2003. But a year later, they made up 49 percent of its loans.
Subprime loans also grew in 2004, to 11 percent of its originations, up from 4.6 percent in 2003. These loans often required no down payments and very little documentation of borrowers' incomes, assets or employment; they generated immense profits to Countrywide but, again, presented a bevy of risks. And even when the going got rough for some homeowners, Countrywide didn't hesitate to take a hard line with borrowers who fell behind.
A born salesman, Mr. Mozilo promoted his company's prospects wherever he went. In front of a crowd of investors or analysts, he would predict what Countrywide would generate in profits five years down the road and how many of its competitors the company would vanquish. No matter what, Countrywide would survive, he vowed.
''Over the entire history of this country, housing prices have never gone down nationally. They have gone down in some local areas, but never nationally,'' he told an interviewer for CNBC in early 2005. ''Secondly, any homeownership over the 10 years has proved to be the best investment that you could ever make. Over any 10-year period, housing prices go up.''
Later that year, he was equally optimistic when he again visited CNBC's studios.
''From our perspective -- and we've been doing this for 38 years -- we're still in a terrific mortgage market,'' he said. ''So the road ahead to us appears to be extremely vibrant, very sound.''
Even as the wheels were coming off of the Countrywide cart in 2007, Mr. Mozilo's upbeat public pronouncements continued.
''I think you have to keep things in perspective. You know, there's an old saying that you don't know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out, and obviously the tide's gone out,'' he told CNBC in March 2007, when a number of once-successful subprime lenders were plunging toward bankruptcy. ''I think it's a mistake to apply what's happening to them to the more diversified financial services companies such as Countrywide.''
When Bank of America invested $2 billion in Countrywide in August 2007 -- a move that caused many analysts to question Countrywide's financial wherewithal and its ability to remain independent -- Mr. Mozilo again struck an optimistic note.
''Countrywide's future's going to be great. You know, it's always been great,'' he told CNBC at the time. ''So I think, down the line, this is going to be a better company, a more profitable company and a company that's going to be a great investment for shareholders as we continue down the line. Because the market ultimately will come to us. This is America. People want to own homes.''
PRIVATELY, however, Mr. Mozilo had long been worried about some of the loans his company favored, as indicated by e-mails he sent to his deputies. And this gulf between Mr. Mozilo's private views and his public proclamations went to the heart of the S.E.C.'s case against him.
Beginning in 2005, for example, he fretted about lending practices at Countrywide, e-mail messages show. One target of his ire was the ''pay-option adjustable-rate mortgage,'' a loan that let borrowers pay a fraction of the interest owed and none of the principal during an introductory period. These loans put homes within many borrowers' financial grasp -- at least initially.
When a borrower made only modest payments, the shortfall was added to the principal balance on the loan, meaning that the mortgage would grow in size. Given this arithmetic, borrowers could wind up owing more than their homes were worth.
In 2004, pay-option A.R.M.'s accounted for 6 percent of Countrywide's originations. Two years later, they accounted for 21 percent of its loans. The loans were moneymakers for Countrywide; internal company documents show that the company made gross profit margins of more than 4 percent on such loans, double the 2 percent generated on standard loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration.
Countrywide pushed the lucrative loans hard. A sales document called ''Pay Option A.R.M.'s Made Simple'' asked rhetorically what kinds of customers would be interested in these loans. ''Anyone who wants the lowest possible payment!'' was one of the answers.
But these loans unnerved Mr. Mozilo, as his e-mails indicate. In April 2006, for example, he learned that almost three-quarters of the company's pay-option customers had chosen to make the minimum payment the prior February, up from 60 percent the previous August, according to the S.E.C.'s complaint. In an e-mail to Mr. Sambol, Mr. Mozilo wrote: ''Since over 70 percent have opted to make the lower payment it appears that it is just a matter of time that we will be faced with much higher resets and therefore much higher delinquencies.''
Two months later, and just one day after he talked up his company's pay-option A.R.M.'s to investors at a Wall Street conference, Mr. Mozilo wrote an e-mail to Mr. Sambol predicting trouble ahead for many borrowers in these mortgages. They ''are going to experience a payment shock which is going to be difficult if not impossible for them to manage,'' he said.
And in September 2006, Mr. Mozilo wrote an e-mail saying the company had no way to assess the risks of holding pay-option A.R.M.'s on its balance sheet. ''The bottom line is that we are flying blind on how these loans will perform in a stressed environment of higher unemployment, reduced values and slowing home sales,'' he wrote.
Another Countrywide product that concerned Mr. Mozilo was its so-called 80/20 loan, named for the fact that the combination allowed a borrower to receive money covering 100 percent of a home's purchase price.
Mr. Mozilo had become worried about these loans in the first quarter of 2006, when HSBC Bank, a buyer of Countrywide's 80-20 loans, began forcing the lender to repurchase some that HSBC contended were defective.
''In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product,'' he wrote to Mr. Sambol in an April 17, 2006, e-mail cited by the S.E.C. ''With real estate values coming down ... the product will become increasingly worse.''
Such e-mails suggest that by mid-2006, Mr. Mozilo had recognized how reckless some of his company's lending had become. And just three months later, according to the S.E.C. complaint, he met with his financial adviser to increase the amount of Countrywide shares he could cash in under a planned executive stock-sale program.
Mr. Mozilo had always been a big seller, and rarely a buyer, of the Countrywide shares he was granted as a part of his compensation. The timing of some of his sales, however, has drawn the scrutiny of the S.E.C.
For example, on Sept. 25, a day before writing the e-mail about how Countrywide was ''flying blind'' on pay-option A.R.M.'s, he set up a new planned stock-selling program for himself, known as a 10b-5 plan, the S.E.C. said.
Such plans allow executives to sell stock regularly, without running afoul of regulations governing the sale of stock around significant corporate announcements. Mr. Mozilo also set up plans enabling a family foundation and a trust he oversaw to sell shares.
Altogether, the S.E.C. said, from November 2006 to October 2007, he sold more than five million Countrywide shares under his personal plan. His gains were $140 million, the S.E.C. said.
Mr. Mozilo has long maintained that his stock sales were not unusual, and in the past Countrywide has said that it and Mr. Mozilo were battered by economic forces beyond their control.
''No one, including Mr. Mozilo, could have foreseen the unprecedented combination of events that led to the problems borrowers, lenders and investors face with many of these loans today,'' a Countrywide spokesman told The Times in 2007. ''Countrywide is proud of its role in making homeownership affordable to lower-income households.''
But lawyers and analysts say Friday's settlement means that Mr. Mozilo's legacy is likely to be something quite different from that of a banker who brought homeownership to the masses.
''Mozilo is agreeing to a permanent ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company,'' said James A. Fanto, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a specialist in corporate and securities law. ''That is a significant punishment and does not look good for his legacy.''

HEADLINE: Sorting Myth From Fact As Volt Makes Its Debut

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
LAST week, General Motors began its press introduction for the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, which is scheduled to be in dealerships next month. The program included detailed engineering and marketing presentations, and journalists drove the cars about 200 miles on Michigan roads.
Predictably, reports on the much-anticipated car -- along with a bit of uproar about its operational details -- began to ricochet around the Internet. Amid praise for the Volt's innovations and barbs at its $41,000 price tag, writers and readers expressed confusion over just what the car is or isn't.
When the Volt made its debut at the 2007 Detroit auto show as a design study and a technology showcase, it was hailed for its unconventional approach to green motoring. Later, as the economy slid into recession and G.M. went into bankruptcy, the Volt became a symbol of hope for the automaker's reinvention, a blueprint for a new approach to vehicle design. 
G.M. engineered the car to drive up to 50 miles purely on electricity from a large lithium-ion battery, producing no tailpipe pollutants. Yet unlike other electric cars, the Volt concept car had a small gasoline engine that would start when the battery ran down, powering an onboard generator to produce the electricity needed to keep the car moving. In one stroke, it seemed, G.M. had dismantled the argument that electric cars were impractical because of their modest driving range.
Though the show car's styling was toned down for production, the drive system remains largely true to the original idea. Nearly four years later, that powertrain still defies a simple label.
On short commutes, the Volt burns no gas. On a full battery charge and a full tank of gas, the car can travel up to 350 miles, G.M. says, so it can be a family's primary car, not just a local runabout.
A full evaluation will appear in this space in a few weeks. Meanwhile, here are answers to basic questions about the car:
Q.Is the Volt an electric car or a hybrid?
A. G.M. has consistently called the Volt an electric car -- ''purely electrically driven'' was the wording in materials distributed to the press -- basing its terminology on the fact that there is electricity driving the front wheels whenever the car is moving. The company insists it is not a hybrid.
But doesn't the gasoline engine under the hood make the Volt a hybrid by the industry's widely accepted definitions? That may seem a reasonable conclusion, but G.M. argues that the engine's main job is to turn a generator. And because the Volt will not drive without electricity to its motor, G.M. says, it should be considered an electric car.
Certainly the Volt takes a different approach to automotive drive systems, perhaps best described as a new variation of the layout known as a series hybrid. Similar to the operation of diesel-electric railroad locomotives, the series hybrid's combustion engine is used solely to produce electricity for an electric drive motor.
Q.So what's all the fuss about?
A. Information obtained ahead of the press introduction, in contrast to what G.M. had previously maintained, made it clear that under certain conditions (at highway speed with the battery depleted) the 4-cylinder gas engine does provide some assist to the drive wheels. Hybrid systems in which a gas engine works in tandem with electric drive in this way -- the Toyota Prius's, for example -- are known as parallel hybrids.
G.M. says it concealed the Volt's operational details while the car was under development for competitive reasons, protecting its intellectual property until the patents were approved.
Also, until this week G.M. was adamant that the gas-driven generator could never charge the battery, only maintain its charge as the car was driven. The company now says that the generator can send some power to the battery to replenish what it calls a buffer. G.M. points out that it's best to recharge by plugging in because the grid is a less expensive source of electricity.
Not surprisingly, when bloggers noted the discrepancies, charges of deception flew, even from publications that found the car to be thoroughly competent and smartly conceived.
Q.How is the Volt different from the Prius? Is it more like the Prius plug-in hybrid that Toyota is developing?
A. The Volt is engineered to drive primarily on power from its battery; a conventional hybrid like the Prius, which has a much smaller battery, is powered mostly by its gasoline engine, relying on its electric motor mainly to assist the gas engine at lower speeds as well as for small amounts of electric-only driving.
Toyota has said that it will offer a plug-in version of the Prius in 2012, with a lithium-ion battery large enough to drive about 13 miles on electric power.
Q.How does the Volt compare with the Nissan Leaf, then?
A. The Leaf is a pure electric car, running only on the energy stored in its battery. Nissan says it has a range of 100 miles, after which it will need eight hours to replenish the battery using a high-voltage charger.
Q.Which of these types of cars -- Prius, Leaf or Volt -- is right for me?
A. If you own another car for extended trips, don't have a long commute and want a car with no tailpipe emissions, the Leaf is a good solution. Drivers who want their around-town errands and daily commutes to be petroleum-free can choose the Volt without losing the ability to make long trips. The Prius makes the most sense for drivers who cover many miles, though it will cost somewhat more to drive on short trips than a Leaf or Volt would.
Q.Why was the Volt designed this way?
A. The engineers set out to build a car that would offer the benefits of an E.V. -- zero emissions and cheap ''refueling'' at home among them -- for the local driving and short trips that most people do every day. To achieve maximum efficiency, the basic layout of an electric car was chosen as the starting point.
But in a concession to practicality -- to eliminate owner concerns about being stranded with a depleted battery -- G.M. added the onboard generating system as a way to extend the car's range. This compromise added cost, weight and complexity, but was thought to make the car appealing to more buyers, at least until a public charging infrastructure is in place.
Q.What are the early reviews?
A. The reaction from journalists who drove the car in Michigan was quite positive, with high praise for the car's performance and how well its electric and gas drive systems are integrated.
Lindsay Brooke, who wrote for The Times the first reports of how the Volt performed with its gas engine running, offered this appraisal in an e-mail after spending a long day driving the car at the press program: ''The Volt works extremely well. We hammered our car yesterday, including a bunch of wide-open-throttle runs to 100 m.p.h. The car returned a 52 miles per gallon average for the day and we got 44.5 miles in E.V. mode. For what G.M. set out to achieve with this program, they nailed it.''
Q.How does the Volt's fuel economy compare with conventional hybrids?
A. There's no simple answer, but this much is certain: it will not get the 230 m.p.g. that G.M. once said it expected in city driving. The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy certification is not finished. In addition, new fuel economy labels are still in the works as regulators try to develop a meaningful rating for mixed-drive vehicles. The numbers are expected soon, G.M. says, as the cars cannot be shipped from the factory without fuel economy stickers.
We know this much: G.M. says the car will go 25 to 50 miles on a fully charged battery -- about $1.60 worth of electricity, according to Car and Driver's Volt test -- and perhaps 310 miles farther with the gas engine drawing fuel from the 9.3-gallon tank. A simple calculation says the car is getting 33 m.p.g while in ''extended range'' mode.
But to be fair, the fuel economy should at least be averaged over the total range, adding in an energy equivalent for the electricity used while driving on battery power. This part of the mileage calculation has not been completed by the government; for comparison's sake, a 2011 Toyota Prius is rated at 51 m.p.g. in town, 48 on the highway.
Q.Why does it require premium gas? Can it use E85 like a flex-fuel vehicle?
A. To extract the necessary power from a small high-efficiency 4-cylinder, engineers designed the engine with a high compression ratio. Premium fuel is required to prevent engine damage with such high internal pressures. The Volt engine will not be compatible with an E85 ethanol blend until 2013, though the original concept car was said to be.
Q.Is the Volt made in America?
A. Chevrolet will assemble the Volt at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan. Like all modern vehicles, its components come from many sources. As production begins, the battery cells will come from South Korea. The electric motors (there are two) are made in Mexico. The gas engine is from Austria.
Q. How much does it cost?
A. The price starts at $41,000, including shipping and a charging cord for 120-volt hookups. The Volt is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit and some state incentives. Chevrolet is offering a lease at $350 for 36 months with $2,500 due at signing. A 240-volt charging link, which will replenish the battery in about four hours (it takes 10 hours using 120-volt household current) costs $490. G.M. estimates an installation cost of $1,475 for 240-volt charging.
For comparison, the Nissan Leaf, which goes on sale in December, costs $33,600. A 36-month lease is offered at $349 per month with $1,999 due at signing, and that car is also eligible for federal and state tax credits.
Q.Why is the Volt's price so high?
A. The car has many specialized components, and at first it will be made in relatively low volume -- some 10,000 cars for North America through the end of 2011, a G.M. sales executive said last week. The company has invested $700 million to revamp the factories that will make the car and its parts. If you add in research and development costs, it is plausible that G.M. has made a $1 billion commitment to the Volt.
Another factor is the 16 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, a complex assembly with a temperature control system. The battery may account for as much as $10,000 of the car's total cost.
Q.How long will the battery last? How much will it cost to replace?
A. G.M. provides a battery warranty for eight years or 100,000 miles. The company has not published a replacement cost, which makes sense: the price is likely to drop before any are replaced under warranty.
Q.What other G.M. vehicles is the Volt related to? How big is it?
A. The Volt shares its basic structure (and 105.7-inch wheelbase) with the Chevrolet Cruze, a new compact sedan. Because the T-shaped battery is under the floor between the seats, there is room for only four occupants. The trunk capacity is middling, at 10.6 cubic feet.
Q.How clean is the Volt?
A. The car has been certified as a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle, the same level as gas-only cars like the Chevy Malibu and some BMW 3 Series models. G.M. says it intends to seek certification as a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle, a more stringent level that carries a longer warranty and allows no evaporative emissions, which will be needed in some states for access to special high-occupancy-vehicle lanes on freeways.
Q.What are the areas where G.M. might make improvements in the future?
A. The Volt is quite heavy for a 4-passenger compact sedan -- nearly 3,800 pounds -- because it carries a 435-pound battery in addition to a gas engine. Changing the iron engine block to aluminum would be a start. And while G.M. says the aerodynamic drag coefficient, first reported at 0.28, is Chevy's best ever, it is not as smooth in the wind tunnel as a Prius, which has a Cd of 0.25.
Q.Why did G.M. go to all the trouble of developing something new instead of improving its previous electric car, the EV1?
A. G.M. has plenty of reasons for choosing to let memories of the EV1 fade. That car, of course, was entirely experimental, and even if it had the range and seating capacity needed to make it appealing to consumers, it did not have a logical path to production. The Volt, on the other hand, shares underpinnings with a mass-market model, reducing costs and simplifying production while taking advantage of advances in battery chemistry and electric motor design over the last decade.

HEADLINE: Blackface and Bigotry, Finely Tuned

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
NO star actors. (Check.) A complex cast of characters. (Check.) A plot based on a low moment in American history. (Check.) Songs that satirize racism, anti-Semitism, and execution by electric chair. (Check.) And all told by resurrecting one of theater's most controversial storytelling devices, the minstrel show. (Check.)
Has there ever been a new Broadway musical facing a more daunting checklist of challenges than ''The Scottsboro Boys,'' which dares to set an infamous 1930s Alabama rape trial to music?
And yet, reader, and yet: A new leading man with major charisma. (Check.) Carefully inserted dialogue and laugh lines to help humanize each of those many characters. (Check.) A legendary songwriting team that over the years has turned cynicism and corruption -- hey, even the Third Reich -- into hummable stage gold. (Check.) And all told by a Tony Award-winning director who has staged some of the wittiest musical numbers in recent Broadway history. (Check.) 
''The Scottsboro Boys'' began previews early this month with a head of steam from an out-of-town revamping at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where the show drew sold-out crowds and admiring reviews. After an Off Broadway run at the Vineyard Theater, the creative team members, led by the director, Susan Stroman, went to the Guthrie with their own to-do list. While standing behind their provocative concept, they wanted to tweak the show to stress its entertainment value, hoping to entice theatergoers who have been willing to spend top-ticket prices to see the same composers explore merry murderesses (''Chicago''), German decadence (''Cabaret'') and South American repression (''Kiss of the Spider Woman'').
The goal: Push as hard as possible to underscore that the show, which opens Oct. 31, is not a downer, the kiss of death on today's Broadway.
''The trick here has been: How do you write a musical where the audience will respond to the story even though it's about some very ugly things?'' said John Kander, the show's Tony-winning composer. ''I never write a piece thinking that I have to do X because the audience will like X. That's paralyzing. But we are entertainers, all of us, and finding great entertainment in a story like this one has been a test, a thrilling one.''
The best-selling musicals now in New York are escapist spectacles (''Wicked,'' ''The Lion King''), comedies (''Promises, Promises,'' ''The Addams Family'') and jukebox shows (''Jersey Boys,'' ''Mamma Mia!''). Darker, emotionally demanding musicals like ''Next to Normal'' and ''Memphis'' have succeeded at the box office because they are fundamentally family stories, or love stories, to which many theatergoers can relate.
There is no romance in this $4 million ''Scottsboro'' musical, no mothers and fathers, and certainly no happy ending via a rewrite of American history. Unlike the Wicked Witch's comeback in the revisionist ''Wicked,'' most of Broadway's Scottsboro boys languish in prison for years, and, while none of the actual prisoners were put to death, a few meet grim fates. Framing the story as a minstrel show that, while subversively comic, means derogatory language and blackface are part of the action.
What ''The Scottsboro Boys'' does have, beyond a livelyscore from Mr. Kander and his lyricist partner, Fred Ebb, is original storytelling, a promising cast of Broadway newcomers, and a certain resonance with modern-day injustices.
''There's a kind of racism in America today that is so insidious, the way enemies of our black president use code language to depict him as the 'other,' and that part of our world has a direct through-line back to the Scottsboro boys,'' said the 83-year-old Mr. Kander, who also contributed lyrics after Mr. Ebb died in 2004.
Off Broadway ''The Scottsboro Boys'' last spring drew mixed but encouraging reviews; even without raves, the lead producers, Barry and Fran Weissler and Jacki Barlia Florin, decided to transfer the show fairly quickly to Broadway but with an extended layover at the Guthrie. Mr. Weissler said ''the knockout score alone justified the show for Broadway,'' even though the show lacks stars or the upbeat trappings of popular entertainments.
The Scottsboro case, which transfixed and divided Americans in the early 1930s, began when nine black youths were arrested in 1931 on a freight train passing through Alabama and charged with rape by two white women also on board. White Alabamans were up in arms, lynch mobs were formed, and the young men -- who were mostly teenagers -- were convicted in speedy trials with their race serving as the chief evidence against them. Most were quickly sentenced to death. Appeals led to retrials, convictions and more appeals for several years before the defendants were eventually paroled or escaped.
To bring the nine to life on Broadway, Ms. Stroman said, their personal stories needed to be developed and deepened from the Off Broadway version, largely through surgical touches, given that a 100-minute show like this one cannot support nine fully rounded characters.
She had each of the actors write his own, largely imagined biography for his character -- both back stories and how they endured the long jail time and trials -- which helped influence some of the characterizations.
''We developed the youngest boy a bit more, Eugene, to underscore the fact that he doesn't even know what rape is and that he is struggling to be tough like the older boys but doesn't really have the emotional ability to cope,'' said Ms. Stroman, best known for her Tony Award-winning work on ''The Producers.''
''Another boy, Roy, was given a little more language about how he had never been with a girl and might never be, because we wanted to hit home the idea of lost youth,'' she said.
What the creators learned, said David Thompson, the book writer, was ''that each character needed a story to tell, or else the audience wouldn't be able to tell them apart, and just see the group as symbols and history and not a story they would care about.''
In a scene near the start and one near the end, most of the Scottsboro nine were given new dialogue that was tried out at the Guthrie and retained for Broadway with an eye toward stirring audience members to invest emotionally in them.
The revisions also make clear, early on in the show, that the Scottsboro nine were traveling in search of jobs when they were met with injustice, a tweak that Mr. Thompson said might have greater resonance with audiences in today's economy. There are also more exuberant, hopeful moments among the men in the early number ''Commencing in Chattanooga,'' as they look toward the future.
And whereas Off Broadway the first trial scene focused mostly on the main character, Haywood Patterson, now each defendant is asked why he was traveling through Alabama. At the end, meanwhile, a few lines of dialogue have been introduced to reveal what became of the young men; most of it is heartbreaking.
Joshua Henry , the actor portraying Haywood, is a new addition to the cast, joining after a showy turn as the military recruiter in ''American Idiot.'' He said he spent time at the Guthrie frequently rethinking his choices about how Haywood should come across. The anger and frustration of the Scottsboro story was fairly easy to play, he said; instead, he focused on developing his character as an 18-year-old who becomes a leader of the nine in a jail cell, who tries to stand up and defend the boys while feeling scared and vulnerable.
''In my biography of Haywood I tried to dig into how he feels about the truth, how his parents taught him to be upright and honest, and how he can't live with a lie even if saying he was guilty would probably get him early parole,'' Mr. Henry said.
For all the reworking, the show's narrative structure remains intact: the tale of the Scottsboro Boys unfolds as a minstrel show. Black actors assume the roles of the nine, while two other black actors play classic minstrel ''end men'' (providing commentary and playing some of the white roles). A white actor, the Tony winner John Cullum, is the ringmaster-interlocutor. The use of blackface remains, as do the jibes aimed at a Jewish lawyer and the presence of a mostly silent African-American woman whose import is revealed only at the end.
''The minstrel show elements are, I like to think, part of the entertainment, but in a way that makes you think about how we tell stories, tell our history as Americans,'' Mr. Kander said. ''Good storytelling, even about tough subjects, should always be entertaining. And I don't think there's anything wrong with giving people something to think about while you're entertaining them.''

HEADLINE: The Traditionalist

BYLINE: By ARTHUR LUBOW. 
Arthur Lubow is a contributing writer to the magazine.

 BODY:
IN A BLUSTERY ECONOMIC climate, with waves of populist resentment thundering outside the thickest paneled doors, what do rich people want in a home? Is it their wish to be exposed in glass-and-steel boxes? Will they opt for precarious-seeming triumphs of cantilevered engineering? Or are they, perhaps, looking for something else? Last winter, I went on a fact-finding mission to 15 Central Park West. The project is the most successful high-end Manhattan residential development in recent memory, having gone to contract on all of its 202 units for approximately $2 billion, before its doors opened in late 2007. My guides were Robert A. M. Stern, whose New York-based architecture firm designed the building, and William Lie Zeckendorf, who developed it with his brother, Arthur. Both Zeckendorfs live there. So do Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs (alongside many of his generals; Goldman Sachs helped finance the venture); Sanford Weill, the former Citigroup chairman; and a smattering of bold-faced names (Denzel Washington, Sting). 
Of all the highfliers who were in the building on that squally afternoon, the most intriguing to me was Stern, who doesn't live at 15 Central Park West himself. (He resides in the relatively modest Chatham, a Manhattan tower he also designed.) In an economic downturn that has been unkind to architecture, Stern maintains a large practice with 230 employees -- below the firm's peak of 300 and not as large as behemoths like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, but still about twice the size of McKim, Mead & White, which a century ago was the largest American architecture office. Such comparisons come to mind in thinking about Stern, because historical references are always buzzing about in his own mind. Robert A. M. Stern Architects traffics in all of the popular architectural styles of the last hundred years, including glass-and-steel modernist skyscrapers; but the work for which it is best known evokes the grand, shingled summer homes and stately apartment houses of the early 20th century. ''A good way to go forward is to go back,'' says Stern, a short and trim 71-year-old with a taste for Gucci loafers and natty suits. ''You can bypass the trendiness of the moment and find a new path to move forward.''
I could readily understand why many of Stern's clients might want to return to a time when the economy was accelerating and the bankers at the helm were admired and self-confident. Only it's not so easy. The artisans who constructed New York's great apartment buildings a century ago have been replaced with labor-saving modern construction techniques, and it is impossible to make the new buildings look the same as the old. Furthermore, tastes have changed as much as technology has. Discussing opulent private residences that are built today in traditional styles, Thomas A. Kligerman, an architect who began his career in Stern's office, says: ''If you had someone from 1930 look at one of these houses, they would think it was very modern. They would be shocked to see all the bathrooms and the kitchens that people work in. They would think the windows were gigantic.'' But they would also find them unrecognizably modern in more distressing ways. ''People back then didn't have Sheetrock and metal beads in the corner,'' he added. ''These houses feel quality to us, but I think they would feel cheap to them.''
Stern is profoundly attentive to surfaces. Arriving early in the lobby of 15 Central Park West, where apartments have sold for as much as $45.8 million, and continued to increase in value even during the recession, I had time to inspect the enormous fluted marble columns, with scalloped tops, that grandly punctuate the space. ''It's a kind of modern classicism,'' said Stern, who joined me moments before Zeckendorf came down from his apartment. ''It kind of picks up where the 1930s left off and takes it forward.''
Even before entering the building, I noticed a less flashy, more substantial nod to the past. The facade of 15 Central Park West is limestone, the cladding that was typically preferred by the architects of exclusive prewar New York apartment buildings. ''We did a psychographic study of the high-end marketplace and tried to envision what would a high-end buyer want in a new Central Park West building,'' Zeckendorf told me. Limestone rated high in desirability. After all, what is more reassuringly solid than stone? When Stern advocated limestone instead of the usual brick, the Zeckendorfs agreed. ''There are 87,000 pieces of limestone, and Bob didn't make it easy -- most of them are different shapes,'' Zeckendorf said. The limestone was shipped from a quarry in Indiana to Canada, where it was cut by computer-assisted saws and set into concrete panels that hang from the building's frame. I had heard that the use of the limestone panels ultimately increased the floor area of the building, thereby creating a windfall for the developers. Stern said that couldn't be true. Was he disingenuous or, more likely, simply oblivious? Stern is the antithesis of a progressive architect who pushes the limits of engineering to create something new. ''I am not interested in the most innovative technical things,'' he told me. ''There are architects who begin the process by discovering a new way of glazing or framing. That is not where I start.'' Arthur Zeckendorf confirmed that the limestone panels were thinner than the alternative of brick veneer -- adding two inches to each floor plate, for a total of 10,000 square feet, which brought in $30 million and more than offset any additional construction costs.
Walking me through the building, Stern pointed out the features that he had conjured from the past: a restaurant that serves only residents and their guests, like one that existed in the Dakota when it opened in 1884; a reflecting pool that admits daylight into an underground health club, which updates the courtyard skylights of the Dakota; and a cobblestoned area that Stern refers to as the ''motor court'' (he is partial to archaic locutions) and which allows you to drive up to a side entrance and re-enter your cocooned domicile beneath a protective canopy.
As we took an elevator (''High ceiling, wood paneling, stone floor, carefully detailed doors -- if I do say so myself,'' Stern observed) to a high-floor apartment in the tower, the architect's mood also seemed to ascend. After we walked through ''the defined prewar foyer,'' the view from the living room induced further giddiness: a sweeping vista that included Central Park and Lincoln Center through windows much larger than could be found in a typical prewar building.
Gazing out now at this vision of Manhattan, he was experiencing vicariously the satisfaction that the occupants of these apartments would derive from surroundings that resemble a stage set in a movie musical. ''My obsession is these romantic views of New York,'' he said. ''The scene in, I think it's 'Shall We Dance,' with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, where it ends in a room like the Rainbow Room, and snow is falling all over the city. We'll have Fred and Ginger spin in here any moment now.''
Fred and Ginger did not appear, but almost as good, the air at this elevation was cold enough for the rain to be transformed into big white flakes that allowed you to imagine you had entered a souvenir snow globe of New York. On exiting 15 Central Park West, I was a little disheartened to discover that down at street level, for the pedestrians, it was still raining.
Housing the plutocrats is merely the most visible facet of Stern's career. Over the last 45 years, his portfolio has grown to include (in a very abridged list) the Comcast headquarters in Philadelphia, towers in Toronto and Rio de Janeiro, a large resort community in southern China, the George W. Bush Presidential Center to be built near Dallas and a collection of university buildings across the United States. With all that, the practice of architecture takes up only part of his time. He is the dean of the architecture school at Yale University, which puts him at the forefront of architectural education in this country. He is also a writer -- most impressively, the co-author of a series of tomes on the built environment of New York from 1880 to the present.
John Hagmann, who met Stern on their first day as Yale graduate students in 1960 and started a joint practice with him in 1969 that lasted for seven years, suggests that there is one talent that unifies Stern's disparate activities. ''He's an editor,'' Hagmann says. ''That's his great gift. That's how he approaches architecture -- a collating of ideas and editing them and assembling them.'' His mind is crammed with architectural details, particularly of American buildings of the late 19th and early 20th centuries but ranging far beyond. Sententious and acerbic, Stern has devised for himself a personality that itself is an edited construction, with a generous borrowing from his friend and mentor, Philip Johnson, the curator and architect who died in 2005 at 98. (In 2008, Stern published a highly entertaining record of some of their conversations.) Like Johnson did, Stern enjoys playing the role of provocateur; but unlike Johnson, who was patrician as well as waspish, Stern did not grow up surrounded by the luxury he purveys. In that way, he more closely resembles a man he does not know personally, Ralph Lauren, the Bronx-born Jew who molded himself into the leading popularizer of the WASP aesthetic. ''It tells one much about the culture that sort-of outsiders can reflect those worn-out aesthetics back in a way that revivifies them,'' says Charles Warren, an architect who once worked for Stern.
Upper-class New York life glimmered tantalizingly from the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Robert Arthur Morton Stern was raised with his younger brother, Elliot, in a one-bedroom apartment. Their father held various jobs, including driving a taxi for many years. Their more assertive mother -- whose own mother had run a poultry store on the Lower East Side -- sold china at the B. Altman department store on Fifth Avenue. ''Manhattan was Oz,'' Stern says. ''I always hated Brooklyn. I shouldn't say it that way. I hated being in Brooklyn.'' The Broadway show tunes he played on the hi-fi offered an escape. So did the screenings of old movies at the Museum of Modern Art, which is where he first saw the films that were perfumed with the allure of Manhattan. His fondness for Broadway shows and old movies has lasted a lifetime, as has his love of New York. ''New York is the center of Bob's universe,'' Elliot says.
After studying history at Columbia University, Stern enrolled in architecture school at Yale, immediately joining the staff of its magazine, Perspecta. When he became its editor, he expanded it greatly. Among the articles he published was a large excerpt from a planned monograph, ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture,'' by an ascendant architecture thinker and practitioner, Robert Venturi. Although Venturi was an early inspiration to Stern, only faint vestiges of his witty postmodernism can still be detected in Stern's work. It is probably no coincidence that Stern became increasingly successful as he discovered the usefulness of being earnest.
Richard Meier gave Stern his first job at an architecture firm, but Meier was never much of an influence on Stern's style. Like other modernist architects I questioned, Meier preferred not to dwell on Stern's building designs but instead discussed how Stern as dean has welcomed instructors of all styles to Yale. ''What's interesting about Bob is that his practice and what he does is one thing, but if you look at the school and the people he brings in, it's much more diverse than you could imagine,'' Meier told me. Stern lasted less than a year with Meier. Already he was multitasking, working with the New York Housing and Development Administration under Mayor John Lindsay. ''He was always out of the office,'' Meier recalls. ''What was clear was that he was interested in doing many things, not just being a practitioner.''
The Lindsay alliance led to a more important tie than the housing administration: while campaigning for Lindsay's election, Stern met Lynn Solinger, whom he married the same year he went to work for Meier. (They have a son, Nicholas.) Solinger's father was a lawyer and art collector who served as president of the Whitney Museum of American Art, and her mother was a Gimbel of the department-store family. His in-laws' connections provided Stern with clients when he set up an architecture firm with Hagmann in 1969. ''Bob married into a client source,'' Hagmann says. ''There was a flow of interested people coming out of that connection.'' Many of the jobs were apartment renovations; even better, when the young couple acquired a weekend house in East Hampton, Stern was well placed to find clients seeking second homes. He was also teaching architecture at Columbia, and ambitious, talented students could come work for him.
Although most of Stern's house designs from those early years were on Long Island, his most notable one went up in Litchfield County, Conn. The Lang House, designed for the parents of Jeremy Lang, one of his Columbia-educated young architects, has a flat mustard-colored facade with symmetrical windows and bold white trim, like a simplified cartoon sketch of a Regency villa. The back of the house is curved volumes and glass, more like what Meier was doing at the time. ''I think it's the most important house he ever did, the most conceptually interesting,'' says Peter Eisenman, the modernist architect. ''It has more modern in it than Bob would probably like it to have today. I always like to point to moments in people's careers that are cusps. There's enough in the Lang House to suggest, 'Which way is this career going?' '' In more than one way, the Lang House signaled a break in Stern's life. In 1977, three years after the house was completed, he and Lynn separated, and she subsequently married Jeremy Lang, whom she had met in the office. The year before, Hagmann announced that he wanted to dissolve the firm, leading Stern to found one on his own. And architecturally, the Lang House represented a high point of Stern's infatuation with Venturi's ideas.
''It evolved very quickly, so that by the time I got there, he was doing the buildings that Venturi might comment on,'' Kligerman says.
DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF from more devout Classical Revival architects like Allan Greenberg, Stern says his buildings are ''interpretations'' of traditional styles. His Superior Ink tower in the far West Village went on sale in 2007 and fared almost as well as its uptown cousin. Stern's tower design evoked the arched windows of the Romanesque Revival warehouses (most of them converted to housing) that punctuate the trendy district. Unlike the warehouse windows that were trimmed with contrasting brick or terra cotta a century ago, however, those at Superior Ink are largely unadorned. From the inside, of course, you don't notice, and the buyers of these condos (at as much as $4,000 per square foot, they can easily exceed $10 million) can enjoy spectacular river views through windows that are larger than the handsome old prototypes. But in the streetscape, the building adds only a weak, if respectful, echo to the architectural dialogue. Unlike a Venturi building, the Superior Ink tower mimics what came before it without offering its own critique.
From the viewpoint of many, that is just fine. Robby Browne, a high-end real estate agent who has sold apartments in both Superior Ink and 15 Central Park West, says that these traditional apartments increase in value much more reliably than those in modernist buildings like the towers designed by Meier a few blocks south or the Gwathmey Siegel monolith a mile to the east. ''There's a line-up of people who want Superior Ink,'' Browne said. ''Richard Meier and Gwathmey Siegel are tough resales.''
Aside from the actress Hilary Swank, the most notable purchaser at Superior Ink is the fashion designer Marc Jacobs, who bought one of seven town houses also in the development for $10.4 million. Unlike the tower, the houses flaunt heavily detailed facades, but not in the manner of Greenwich Village houses. They are actually not contextual. They look much more like the Georgian revival houses that Delano & Aldrich built a century ago on the Upper East Side. When I mentioned this to Stern, he cheerfully agreed. He knows what the new rich want. ''The problem with Village town houses is that they are almost without architectural detail,'' he said. ''They're very low-key. When the developer is trying to sell them at $14 million, they have to play a little higher key.''

HEADLINE: The Fed's Next Move: Lower Rates, a Weaker Dollar

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve has yet to act, but officials in Europe and Russia are already complaining about the prospect of a much weaker dollar. More Fed intervention could ultimately do the global economy good -- especially if it gets China to stop cheapening its currency and squeezing out the rest of the world's exports. 
A lot of countries are hurting. Very few, except the United States, are speaking out. Some governments are instead choosing to manipulate their own currencies.
South Korea has been frantically buying dollars to cheapen the won. Japan, which intervened in its market but failed to stop the yen's rise, is now insisting that Beijing and Seoul ''act responsibly.'' Thailand imposed measures to stop incoming money from pushing up the already artificially low value of the baht.
Everybody can't devalue at once. And competitive devaluations won't change China's behavior.
If Beijing is determined to keep its currency down after the Fed acts, it will have to buy billions of dollars of Treasury bonds and other assets -- even as the dollar falls. Printing renminbi to buy the dollars would fuel inflation and bubbles in stocks and housing. Trying to avoid that by issuing bonds would also be expensive.
China has a better option: it can let the renminbi rise. Beijing's leaders know the country needs to become more reliant on domestic income and spending. They are also fearful of any change that might have unintended political consequences. Washington's lectures have only provoked more bluster.
The euro area of the European Union and Japan -- their economies are weaker than ours and are also taking a battering from Chinese exports -- should emulate the Fed, pump more money into their economies and lower the values of their currencies. That would increase the pressure on Beijing to let the renminbi rise. If they coordinated with the Fed, they could avoid sharp fluctuations among the dollar, the euro and the yen.
Other developing countries with stronger economies and higher inflation, like Brazil, would be faced with the same choice as China: inflation or letting their currencies rise. That would be painful. But if the United States slips back into recession, it will be devastating for world growth, including their own.

Higher Taxes, Less Work
To the Editor:
N. Gregory Mankiw claims some pretty severe consequences if high-income taxpayers decide to work less because they are taxed more. (''I Can Afford Higher Taxes. But They'll Make Me Work Less.'' Economic View, Oct. 10).
The column chills us with the specters of our favorite actors and novelists not wanting to make that extra movie or write that extra book, a popular singer declining to perform a concert, or that surgeon who may not want to perform more operations. 
Even if that were the case, we'd survive. We'd probably have plenty of new actors, artists and doctors whose success is made possible by a well-funded health care and educational system. And plenty of people may be willing to pay extra taxes for the basic opportunities that the rich enjoy. Cathy McNally
Northampton, Mass., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
I disagree with Professor Mankiw when he argues that taxing the rich hurts other taxpayers down the line. In comparison with lower-income people, the wealthy have always saved a disproportionate amount of what they earn. It's a basic reason for the greatest disparity between rich and poor in generations.
The 1990s are proof that people don't need the motivation of tax relief in order to spend their money. If the tax cut for wealthy Americans is allowed to expire, they will be paying no higher income tax rates than were in effect before George W. Bush took office. Jerry Soble
Orchard Lake, Mich., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
Reading the column, I recalled a story a relative told me some 40 years ago. It went like this: ''I was doing well in my lab in Sweden, and they increased my pay to reward my hard work. But then taxes took all of it and more. Why should I work harder and receive even less? So I left Sweden for good and came to America.''
As our tax structure becomes even more destructive and limiting upon those with personal initiative and the intelligence to match, fewer and fewer will share their gifts. And then where will there be left to go?
Debra Darvick
Birmingham, Mich., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
Choosing to do less work is a completely rational choice for Professor Mankiw, or for anyone faced with higher tax rates.
But from society's perspective, the choice we should consider is not between higher taxes on the wealthy and their potential work hours, but between higher taxes on the wealthy and being able to pay for employment programs, national defense, public education, infrastructure, health care, etc.
When it comes to the latter choice, and without any disrespect to Mr. Mankiw, society could do without his extra article. Albert Sumell
Youngstown, Ohio, Oct. 10
The writer is an assistant professor of economics at Youngstown State University.
To the Editor:
Perhaps Professor Mankiw would decide to work less if his taxes increased a bit. But instead of complaining about tax rates, most businesspeople roll up their sleeves and get to work expanding their businesses. Income tax rates were higher at the time when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were starting to build Microsoft and Apple. But no one can say that those higher rates made them work any less.
Brian Schmidt
Bellevue, Wash., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
There are plenty of high-income people (myself included) who evaluate work opportunities solely on the basis of how fulfilling or stimulating they seem likely to be -- and not on whether they will increase our net worth.
That you might get to take home only $523 out of every additional $1,000 you earn is neither here nor there. Sure, it would be nice to be able to keep more, but if you're lucky enough to be able to do work you love, marginal tax rates really don't figure into it at all. Allan Mayer
Malibu, Calif., Oct. 10

HEADLINE: In Fervor For Voting, Retirees Hold a Key

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- In an election year of hype and hyperbole, one fact resonates across all contests and candidates: in midterm elections, many people tune out and stay home, but older voters vote. It is a deeply rutted pattern in American history that could swing race after race.
''We're calling them, we're mailing them -- they're getting a tremendous amount of attention,'' said Walt Klein, a longtime political consultant in Colorado who is working for Ken Buck, the Tea Party-backed Republican candidate for the Senate.
But politicians like Mr. Buck, in focusing on significant issues for retirees like Social Security and Medicare, are also finding that the picture is more complicated than a simple calculation that gray hair equates to a certain position on issue X or Y. 
Like voters of all age groups everywhere, older voters here in Larimer County, an increasingly crucial area for both parties in this tossup state, are pulled by crosscurrents just two weeks before the election. Their feelings range from despair and frustration over the country's dysfunctional politics and economic malaise to a relative optimism for some about their adopted Colorado home.
Some retirees, like Karen and Tom Guter, have backed away from politics entirely, retreating from what they feel is an overheated era of extremes.
The Guters moved here from Maine in 2007 and got passionately involved in the 2008 election, as Democrats but also as wide-eyed transplants eager to take part in their new community. They volunteered for Barack Obama and for Betsy Markey, who became the first Democrat since 1973 to be elected to Congress from Colorado's Fourth District, north of Denver.
This year's election, by many measures, is even harder fought. The races for the Fourth District seat and for the Senate will help decide control of Congress.
Where are the Guters? They are still here, fit, healthy and active (they recently hiked through the Grand Canyon). But they have no appetite for the hurly-burly of the campaigns, or for the volunteering they did last time. They will vote, they say, but are not enamored with any of the candidates.
''We're feeling some of the same frustration that a lot of voters are; the system can't seem to find the middle ground,'' said Mr. Guter, 59, a former human resources manager.
Tales like that of political burnout and withdrawal among older voters emerged over and over in dozens of recent interviews here. For candidates, that only makes the hunt for votes more intense as they seek to engage the thousands of retirees who have flocked to northern Colorado in recent years seeking sunny days and the beckoning Rockies at their doorstep.
The migration made Fort Collins, Larimer County's largest city, one of the fastest-growing places in the nation in 2009. About 14,000 people came from another state, the Census Bureau reported -- an injection totaling almost 5 percent of the county's entire population.
Many retirees brought new political perspectives with them, shaped by contours far from the plains and mountains of the West, and have changed the complexion of this once solidly Republican county into something much less predictable.
Some say that a voter base that is neither quite Democrat nor Republican may be emerging, forged by give and take over Scrabble at the Fort Collins Senior Center or in the Newcomers Club.
In 2008, Mr. Obama became only the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Colorado since 1964. But even in the midst of that Democratic surge, some local Republican candidates here in Larimer County, especially for the state legislature, continued to do well.
''Once I got out here my politics started evolving,'' said John Spurgin, 63, a retired corporate lawyer who voted Republican for years while living in Houston but found himself drawn to the Democrats after arriving here three years ago. He plans to vote mostly for Democrats, including for Congress and governor.
''I think maybe it's true,'' he added. ''Where you stand depends on where you sit.''
There are also new fracture lines here.
In the Republican Senate primary, Larimer went strongly for the Tea Party insurgent, Mr. Buck -- a local figure, as district attorney in neighboring Weld County -- over the establishment candidate. But on the Democratic side, that pattern was reversed, with Senator Michael Bennet, appointed to an open seat last year, soundly beating his upstart challenger.
Mr. Bennet and his allies, in television broadsides throughout September, said Mr. Buck would favor privatizing Social Security and cutting back Medicare. Mr. Buck has fired back, saying the health care overhaul passed by Congress is the real threat to the elderly.
The jousting and Mr. Bennet's apparent popularity in a place where Ms. Markey must do well (Larimer County has about half the population of her district) has created an alignment to court older voters, with Ms. Markey playing up her alliances with Mr. Bennet. Republicans have an edge in party registration in the county with close to 36 percent of the total, compared with 28 percent for Democrats and 34 percent unaffiliated.
''Michael and Betsy are trying to save Social Security,'' said Ben Marter, Ms. Markey's spokesman.
Some voters say their heads are spinning.
Bill Benton, 79, a lifelong Colorado resident who described himself as an Eisenhower Republican, supports Mr. Buck and believes that his comments suggesting that the private sector could perhaps do a better job with Social Security were ''just talk.'' Mr. Buck has said that despite his comments, he would not support privatizing the retirement program.
''I like him, but he says some dumb things,'' Mr. Benton said.
By contrast, Geri Raichel, 67, a retired teacher and school administrator from northern New Jersey, is deeply fearful. ''I don't even want to hear that name,'' she said when asked about Mr. Buck. She is volunteering for Ms. Markey, who is in a tight race against Cory Gardner, a Republican state legislator.
Other retirees are sounding retreat.
Joe Cassidy, 85, a retired Army colonel who came here three years ago from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with his wife, Rachel, 73, said he felt a kind of despair about the country's divisions. The Cassidys volunteered for Democrats in 2008 but are mostly on the sidelines this year, though they say they do intend to vote.
Other retirees say they are staying the course, full speed ahead. Viola and Norman Kuehl, former teachers who met as farm kids in South Dakota more than 60 years ago, brought their Republican votes and passions with them when they came here in 2008.
''Republican roots, from the farm,'' said Mr. Kuehl, 85. ''We plan to keep on going.''
Crossroads County: Articles in this series are examining the political issues, voters and stakes in Larimer County, Colo., one swing county in a crucial state.

Cambridge, Mass.
I RECENTLY wound up in the emergency room. Don't worry, it was probably nothing. But to treat my case of probably nothing, the doctor gave me a prescription for a week's worth of antibiotics, along with the usual stern warning about the importance of completing the full course.
I understood why I needed to complete the full course, of course. What I didn't understand was why a full course took precisely seven days. Why not six, eight or nine and a half? Did the number seven correspond to some biological fact about the human digestive tract or the life cycle of bacteria?
My doctor seemed smart. She probably went to one of the nation's finest medical schools, and regardless of where she trained, she certainly knew more about medicine than I did. And yet, as I walked out of the emergency room that night with my prescription in hand, I couldn't help but suspect that I'd just been treated with magic. 
Certain numbers have magical properties. E, pi and the Fibonacci series come quickly to mind -- if you are a mathematician, that is. For the rest of us, the magic numbers are the familiar ones that have something to do with the way we keep track of time (7, say, and 24) or something to do with the way we count (namely, on 10 fingers). The ''time numbers'' and the ''10 numbers'' hold remarkable sway over our lives. We think in these numbers (if you ask people to produce a random number between one and a hundred, their guesses will cluster around the handful that end in zero or five) and we talk in these numbers (we say we will be there in five or 10 minutes, not six or 11).
But these magic numbers don't just dominate our thoughts and dictate our words; they also drive our most important decisions.
Consider my prescription. Antibiotics are a godsend, but just how many pills should God be sending? A recent study of antibiotic treatment published in a leading medical journal began by noting that ''the usual treatment recommendation of 7 to 10 days for uncomplicated pneumonia is not based on scientific evidence'' and went on to show that an abbreviated course of three days was every bit as effective as the usual course of eight.
My doctor had recommended seven. Where in the world had seven come from?
Italy! Seven is a magic number because only it can make a week, and it was given this particular power in 321 A.D. by the Roman emperor Constantine, who officially reduced the week from eight days to seven. The problem isn't that Constantine's week was arbitrary -- units of time are often arbitrary, which is why the Soviets adopted the five-day week before they adopted the six-day week, and the French adopted the 10-day week before they adopted the 60-day vacation.
The problem is that Constantine didn't know a thing about bacteria, and yet modern doctors continue to honor his edict. If patients are typically told that every 24 hours (24 being the magic number that corresponds to the rotation of the earth) they should take three pills (three being the magic number that divides any time period into a beginning, middle and end) and that they should do this for seven days, they will end up taking 21 pills.
If even one of those pills is unnecessary -- that is, if people who take 20 pills get just as healthy just as fast as people who take 21 -- then millions of people are taking at least 5 percent more medication than they actually need. This overdose contributes not only to the punishing costs of health care, but also to the evolution of the antibiotic-resistant strains of ''superbugs'' that may someday decimate our species. All of which seems like a rather high price to pay for fealty to ancient Rome.
Magic ''time numbers'' cost a lot, but magic ''10 numbers'' may cost even more. In 1962, a physicist named M. F. M. Osborne noticed that stock prices tended to cluster around numbers ending in zero and five. Why? Well, on the one hand, most people have five fingers, and on the other hand, most people have five more. It isn't hard to understand why an animal with 10 fingers would use a base-10 counting system. But according to economic theory, a stock's price is supposed to be determined by the efficient workings of the free market and not by the phalanges of the people trading it.
And yet, research shows that fingers affect finances. For example, a stock that closed the previous day at $10.01 will perform about as well as a stock that closed at $10.03, but it will significantly outperform a stock that closed at $9.99. If stocks close two pennies apart, then why does it matter which pennies they are? Because for animals that go from thumb to pinkie in four easy steps, 10 is a magic number, and we just can't help but use it as a magic marker -- as a reference point that $10.01 exceeds and $9.99 does not. Retailers have known this for centuries, which is why so many prices end in nine and so few in one.
The hand is not the only part of our anatomy that gives certain numbers their magical powers. The tongue does too. Because of the acoustic properties of our vocal apparatus, some words just sound bigger than others. The back vowels (the ''u'' in buck) sound bigger than the front vowels (the ''i'' in sis), and the stops (the ''b'' in buck) sound bigger than the fricatives (the ''s'' in sis). As it turns out, in well over 100 languages, the words that denote bigness are made with bigger sounds.
The sound a number makes can influence our decisions about it. In a recent study, one group was shown an ad for an ice-cream scoop that was priced at $7.66, while another was shown an ad for a $7.22 scoop. The lower price is the better deal, of course, but the higher price (with its silky s's) makes a smaller sound than the lower price (with its rattling t's).
And because small sounds usually name small things, shoppers who were offered the scoop at the higher but whispery price of $7.66 were more likely to buy it than those offered the noisier price of $7.22 -- but only if they'd been asked to say the price aloud.
The magic that magic numbers do is all too often black. They hold special significance for terrestrial mammals with hands and watches, but they mean nothing to streptococcus or the value of Google. Which is why we should be suspicious when the steps to sobriety correspond to a half turn of our planet, when the eternal commandments of God correspond to the architecture of our paws and when the habits of highly effective people -- and highly trained doctors -- correspond to the whims of a dead emperor.

HEADLINE: The Old World

BYLINE: By TED C. FISHMAN. 
Ted C. Fishman is the author of ''Shock of Gray: The Aging of the World's Population and How It Pits Young Against Old, Child Against Parent, Worker Against Boss, Company Against Rival and Nation Against Nation,'' from which this article is adapted, and which is out later this month.

 BODY:
YOU MAY KNOW that the world's population is aging -- that the number of older people is expanding faster than the number of young -- but you probably don't realize how fast this is happening. Right now, the world is evenly divided between those under 28 and those over 28. By midcentury, the median age will have risen to 40. Demographers also use another measure, in addition to median age, to determine whether populations are aging: ''elder share.'' If the share, or proportion, of people over 60 (or sometimes 65) is growing, the population is aging. By that yardstick too, the world is quickly becoming older. Pick any age cohort above the median age of 28 and you'll find its share of the global population rising faster than that of any segment below the median. By 2018, 65-year-olds, for example, will outnumber those under 5 -- a historic first. In 2050, developed countries are on track to have half as many people under 15 as they do over 60. In short, the age mix of the world is turning upside down and at unprecedented rates. 
This means profound change in nearly every important relationship we have -- as family members, neighbors, citizens of nations and the world. Aging populations also alter how business is done everywhere. The globalization of the economy is accelerating because the world is rapidly aging, and at the same time the pace of global aging is quickened by the speed and scope of globalization. These intertwined dynamics also bear on the international competition for wealth and power. The high costs of keeping our aging population healthy and out of poverty has caused the United States and other rich democracies to lose their economic and political footing. Countries on the rise amass wealth and geopolitical clout by refusing to bear those costs. Older countries lose work to younger countries.
To see this process at work, look at China. In its march to prosperity, the country has encouraged hundreds of millions of its young people to move into cities. Chinese metropolises -- some, like Beijing, ancient but newly sprawling, others, like Shenzen, built from scratch -- are where the factories are. Foxconn Technology Group, for example, the giant electronics manufacturer that builds components for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Apple in gigantic plants in Shenzen and elsewhere in urban China, will soon employ enough people to fill 60 percent of the jobs in Manhattan. Foxconn has close to 920,000 workers, nearly all of whom are under 25; in August, the company announced plans to add 400,000 more workers in the next year. But China's is a kind of Dorian Gray economy, its young and footloose global identity hiding a grayer reality. By and large, older workers have been excluded from its remade, globalized economy. They are left behind in their rural villages, or they are pushed from their urban homes into the ghettos of dour apartment blocks on the urban edge to make room for the new apartments and offices occupied by younger urbanites and the companies eager to hire them. Discrimination -- ''age apartheid'' might be a better term -- is one way to describe what's going on here: no country sorts its population more ruthlessly by age.
The problem for China is that it is rapidly approaching the point after which it will no longer be the relatively young country we see today. In 2015, China's working population below the age of 65 will begin to shrink. Meanwhile, the number of people over 65 will be rising to 300 million by 2050, a threefold increase. Richard Jackson, the director of the Global Aging Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes that China will be older than the United States within a generation, making it the first big national population to age before it joins the ranks of developed countries. One of China's biggest fears, expressed repeatedly in public pronouncements, is that it will grow old before it grows rich.
To avoid this fate, China is doing all it can to lure the world's production and capital while its work force is young. In large part, it does this by denying meaningful pensions and health care to its people today. Not only do the vast majority of elderly Chinese have little more than their meager savings, but today's workers have pensions so measly as to be irrelevant. To keep the cost of manufacturing in China low for the rest of the world, the young Chinese work force is, for now, rarely provided more than token pensions, health care or disability insurance. In aging, developed countries, older workers with long tenure are usually at their peak in terms of pay and the cost of their benefits. Here in the United States, for example, health care costs for workers who are between 50 and 65 are, on average, almost two times what they are for their peers in their 30s and 40s. When the median age of workers climbs in the United States, so does the cost of insurance their employers must buy for them. China's leadership clearly believes its young workers would lose their allure if the future costs of old age were added to their costs today. When state-owned companies trimmed their ranks of tens of millions of workers following the country's transition to a market economy, older workers -- many only in middle age -- were often let go with small pensions and replaced by younger workers. So what China offers now is workers with short tenure and negligible benefits (as well as something of a free social safety net in the form of all the relatively young, physically fit grandparents who move in with their children to care for their grandchildren).
Companies that move production to China or buy goods from Chinese suppliers gain the leverage they need to rewrite the terms of employment with their older workers at home or the ability to push those workers off the payrolls altogether. In a 2006 analysis of how aging work forces influence global flows of capital, the economists Ronald Davies and Robert R. Reed noted that because ''older'' economies have smaller work forces and higher wages, they push investment to younger economies, which offer higher rates of return. And high costs in older economies reach beyond wages -- into taxes, which are used to pay for age-related public spending like social security. China's youthful labor force thus helps the country maintain its low-cost economic ecosystem and attract foreign investment that seeks the higher returns a ''younger'' economy offers, whether or not any particular pot of foreign money goes to employ young people.
China is not the only country in which a young labor force attracts global businesses and investors. Much of the developing world, particularly in Asia and Latin America, operates the same way. An outspoken champion of outsourcing, Nandan Nilekani, a former head of Infosys, the Indian technology giant, is well known for promoting India as a place to corral young workers in an otherwise aging world. Call it ''global age-arbitrage.''
THE OTHER PART of the feedback loop, the role globalization plays in speeding up how fast a country ages, is tied to the two big reasons that populations grow older. First and most obviously, more and more individuals are living longer than ever before. Average life expectancy is increasing nearly everywhere. Longer life is itself a kind of byproduct of globalization, the result of the worldwide exchange of public-health technology, medical breakthroughs and, perhaps the most life-giving development of all, the spread of literacy. Every person who can read has access to the world of health information, including Internet sites and government pamphlets on diseases. Countries educate their people in order to make it possible for them to enter the mainstream of global commerce and that extends their life spans -- making the countries older.
Above all, however, for communities or countries to age, people must have far fewer children. Today, almost no place in the developed world has a total fertility rate of 2.1 children, the replacement rate needed to keep a population from declining. The population of nearly every developed country is expected to shrink before midcentury. When emerging nations gear up for the global economy, they tend to take two steps that encourage smaller families: they extend educational and employment opportunities to young women, and they urbanize. Urban women postpone having children until they are prepared for and established in their jobs. Rearing children in the city is also more expensive. Cities serve the global economy, and the global economy drives people to cities. (According to the U.N. Population Fund, about half the world's population was urban in 2007, but by 2030 nearly 80 percent of it will live in the cities of the developing world.) The world gets older.
Such urbanization and globalization can take hold with remarkable swiftness. Japan was one of the youngest countries in the world until around 1950, and now its population is arguably the world's oldest. (Its median age will exceed 56 by midcentury, up from 43 today.) The median age in Western Europe today is just over 40; it will rise to near 50 by 2050. Population aging did not always happen so quickly. France was the first country in the world to see its share of 65-year-olds double, from 7 percent to 14 percent; this took about 115 years, starting in 1865. But China will experience the same doubling in 25 years.
One exception is the United States. The country is subject to the same two big trends -- longer lives, smaller families -- that are aging much of the world's populations, but we are not growing old as fast as countries in East Asia and Western Europe. Our median age will climb only 3 years, to 40, by 2050, a rate slowed by the arrival of young immigrants, including millions from Latin America.
Of course, immigration for one country means emigration from another -- and an older population left behind. Spain, which rivals Japan as the world's oldest country, was for much of the 20th century one of the youngest nations in the West. Before 2000, it had virtually no foreign-born residents. Today, nearly 12 percent of Spain's population is foreign born. Among the arrivals are hundreds of thousands of Ecuadoreans (many of them female caregivers for elderly Spanish) whose absence at home increases the median age of Ecuador's population. More than one in 10 Ecuadoreans has left in search of work, and the loss of so many of the country's youngest and most enterprising workers means Ecuador has little chance of developing. Recently, its president initiated the Welcome Home Program to lure emigrants back with tax breaks and money to start businesses.
How do globalization and an aging population affect the American workplace? According to the Economic Policy Institute, 2.3 million American jobs were lost to China alone between 2001 and 2007. Susan Houseman, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., notes that older employees in manufacturing jobs who are low-skilled have been among the most vulnerable workers of all. And when older workers lose their jobs, they search longer for new ones than people do in other age groups. They find it hard to remake themselves with new skills and grow less employable over time and more desperate to accept low pay. This, along with the prospect of additional outsourcing abroad, drives down the earnings of those older workers who manage to stay employed. Looking at data ending in 2002, a team of researchers including economists from the World Bank and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that older workers suffered greater income losses because of foreign outsourcing than women and union workers.
Keep in mind that these results predate the recent recession and the even more difficult times that have resulted for older workers. The ranks of the unemployed who are 55 and older grew 331 percent over the decade that ended last December. U.S. unemployment levels for workers over 50 are now at their all-time highs, nearly double what they were three years ago. AARP's Public Policy Institute reports that from December 2007 to February 2010 the number of workers 55 and older who gave up looking for work rose more than fivefold, to 287,000 from 53,000. Far more people have retired early than anyone predicted. In 2009, there were 465,000 more applications for Social Security and disability benefits than there were the year before, as employers made it clear to older workers that they were not wanted. This increase was nearly 50 percent greater than what the Social Security Administration expected.
One conundrum for aging societies is how to keep older people employed at a time when economic conditions favor the young, whether nearby or far away. The workplace left to itself comes up with some solutions, but they require older workers to accept more ''flexible'' conditions, which often means joining the so-called contingent work force of part-timers, self-employed contract workers and temps hired through agencies. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute, 21 percent of workers over 65 are part time, compared with 16 percent for the overall work force. Self-employment is also climbing among older workers, and Americans over 50 are the most active group of entrepreneurs, often out of necessity. This partly explains an apparent contradiction: at the same time that unemployment among older workers is at a peak, the percentage of older people with jobs is also near a high, because more people must work to make ends meet.
In the United States, the transformation of older workers into a giant contingent work force is just getting started. This year, as baby boomers begin to hit 65, the ''elder share'' of the U.S. population begins a sharp climb. From 2010 to 2030, the number of Americans between 25 and 64 will climb by 16 million, but two-thirds of the increase will consist of people 55 and 64. Countries that are older than the U.S., that are further along in reshaping their workplaces, give a glimpse of the future. In Japan, retirees from the biggest companies are well provided for, but for many of the rest -- workers at smaller companies, the self-employed -- the fear of outliving their money is real. One in five elderly Japanese lives in poverty. So the Japanese stay on the job when they can. Since 2006, the number of Japanese still working after the customary retirement age of 60 has risen by more than 11 million. Most are officially retired but are back at their companies, under contract. They typically earn about half their former wages.
WILL THE WORLD ever grow young again? Perhaps, but not anytime soon. Today, many of the places that are growing old the fastest are in the developing world, largely because that's where urbanization is most rapid. It is hard to conjure a situation in which people move back to the countryside and again have larger families. Instead, if past is prelude, today's young countries like China will be the countries that in the not-distant future go shopping for younger workers in younger places. Those places will be transformed by satisfying an older China's needs, and the cycle will repeat itself: when the world finds its next young place, that country may well age even more quickly than the formerly young countries that preceded it.
The rough adjustments that global aging imposes on populations can sound bleak. Nonetheless, the challenges do not trump what we gain by living longer. Remember, too, that smaller families enable parents to make greater investments in themselves and the children they do have. Still, as the world gets older, we need to anticipate how this extraordinary change might undermine our communities, weaken nations and push able older people to the side. There are also sobering geopolitical consequences to consider. It now looks as if global power rests on how willing a country is to neglect its older citizens. Faults in the welfare states of the West are highlighted by the world debt crisis. Fiscal woes driven by age-related expenses plague every level of government in the United States. Europeans take to the streets, strike and close down governments struggling to cover unsupportable pensions. The most advanced countries owe trillions in age-related public expenses. The most straightforward solutions, like higher payroll taxes to pay for benefits, raise the cost of doing business and chase off investors and producers to lower-cost economies. Mark Haas of Duquesne University has argued that aging forces all high-income democracies into triage mode. They can pay for income support and services for their elderly and drastically reduce financing for schools, defense, infrastructure and everything else, or they can decide older people will have to make do with far less.
China has gained new financial clout in relation to advanced industrial nations because it has grown rich enough as the youthful factory of the world to act as the developed countries' banker. Yet the Chinese government says the country is still too poor to put a more comprehensive social safety net in place. Perhaps, but it is the financial sacrifices of its people that give China the means to lend trillions of dollars to the United States and other industrialized nations. That's a bargain China may be happy to accept, but it, too, is caught in the irreversible dynamic of aging, and its demographic denouement is coming. By then, the United States will be older than it is now, but younger than most of the rest of the developed world, younger than much of the developing world and far younger than China. If we understand how aging populations and economic forces interact, perhaps we can make the most of our age and our youth.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Next Move: And a Pricier Renminbi

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve has yet to act, but officials in Europe and Russia are already complaining about the prospect of a much weaker dollar. More Fed intervention could ultimately do the global economy good -- especially if it gets China to stop cheapening its currency and squeezing out the rest of the world's exports. 
A lot of countries are hurting. Very few, except the United States, are speaking out. Some governments are instead choosing to manipulate their own currencies.
South Korea has been frantically buying dollars to cheapen the won. Japan, which intervened in its market but failed to stop the yen's rise, is now insisting that Beijing and Seoul ''act responsibly.'' Thailand imposed measures to stop incoming money from pushing up the already artificially low value of the baht.
Everybody can't devalue at once. And competitive devaluations won't change China's behavior.
If Beijing is determined to keep its currency down after the Fed acts, it will have to buy billions of dollars of Treasury bonds and other assets -- even as the dollar falls. Printing renminbi to buy the dollars would fuel inflation and bubbles in stocks and housing. Trying to avoid that by issuing bonds would also be expensive.
China has a better option: it can let the renminbi rise. Beijing's leaders know the country needs to become more reliant on domestic income and spending. They are also fearful of any change that might have unintended political consequences. Washington's lectures have only provoked more bluster.
The euro area of the European Union and Japan -- their economies are weaker than ours and are also taking a battering from Chinese exports -- should emulate the Fed, pump more money into their economies and lower the values of their currencies. That would increase the pressure on Beijing to let the renminbi rise. If they coordinated with the Fed, they could avoid sharp fluctuations among the dollar, the euro and the yen.
Other developing countries with stronger economies and higher inflation, like Brazil, would be faced with the same choice as China: inflation or letting their currencies rise. That would be painful. But if the United States slips back into recession, it will be devastating for world growth, including their own.

HEADLINE: Bus Drivers Take Appeal To Riders

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Clarceen Caldwell, a retired Muni driver, approached Jesus Romero Jr. to try to convince him to vote against a November ballot measure that takes aim at the pay of San Francisco's bus drivers. 
''Have you heard of Proposition G?'' Ms. Caldwell asked Mr. Romero, a former marine, as he filled up his white Ford F-250 in the Portola neighborhood on Thursday morning.
''Negative,'' he shouted.
Ms. Caldwell, an outgoing 63-year-old who is helping her former union fight the popular campaign, made her pitch: Proposition G will not fix Muni's problems. It will only cut drivers' pay.
The measure would set salaries by collective bargaining instead of by the unique provision in San Francisco's charter that guaranteed Muni operators the second-highest wages of any transit workers in the country.
The average pay for the 2,200 members of San Francisco Transport Workers Union Local 250-A is $29.50 an hour.
Mr. Romero, a tall energetic 34-year-old wearing sunglasses and a T-shirt with a local union logo, was not responding sympathetically to Ms. Caldwell's pitch.
The conversation with Ms. Caldwell provoked Mr. Romero -- as it does many voters -- to bemoan Muni. He complained about crowded buses and a driver who told him to lower his voice when he said good morning. During the recession, Mr. Romero told Ms. Caldwell, he went from being paid $30 an hour as a generator technician to $15 an hour working for a general contractor.
''I just lost my home,'' he said, waving his hands vigorously and talking loudly. ''When it comes to cutting pay, you know everyone's feeling the crunch.''
''It's rightfully ours, it's been in the charter'' for four decades, Ms. Caldwell said.
''But everybody's taking a pay cut these days!'' he answered.
After venting, however, he conceded that Muni operators have a difficult job. He said he did not become a bus driver because he probably would have smacked somebody.
After the conversation, Mr. Romero said he was still undecided.
Proposition G is being spearheaded by Supervisor Sean Elsbernd and easily got enough signatures from voters to make it onto the ballot. With the city struggling financially, public employee unions are under attack. Even in this pro-union city, sympathy from voters is fading.
As she walked away, Ms. Caldwell -- who had more success with other potential voters -- said the economy makes the unions' campaign more difficult.
''As they say, 'misery loves company,' '' she said. ''I understand that a lot of people are having hard times, but all I'm saying is don't bring me down there with you.''

HEADLINE: The Rage Won't End on Election Day

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
CARL Paladino began his New York gubernatorial campaign by bragging he'd ''clean out Albany with a baseball bat.'' When an ally likened his main Albany target, the (Jewish) leader of the State Assembly, to ''an antichrist or Hitler,'' he enthusiastically endorsed the slur. We also learned of Paladino's repertory of gag e-mails -- among them a pornographic picture of a woman having sex with a horse and a photo of an African tribal ritual captioned ''Obama Inauguration Rehearsal.'' How blind we were not to recognize that his victory in a Republican primary under the proud Tea Party banner was inevitable.
A week ago New Yorkers were presented with a vivid reminder of how a bat can be used as a weapon. A pack of young thugs was charged with torturing three men in the Bronx for being gay, one of whom, The Times reported, was sodomized with ''a small baseball bat.'' 
It's probably safe to assume that no one in this lynching party has heard of Paladino. Presumably he has heard of them, but a man of Tea Party principles will not compromise, no matter what may be happening in the real world. Don't tread on Carl! And so last Sunday, as the city was reeling from both the Bronx bloodbath and the earlier leap of a bullied gay Rutgers freshman off the George Washington Bridge, Paladino visited a fringe Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn to stand his ground. He attacked gays for supposedly plotting to brainwash children into accepting the validity of homosexuality.
We don't know what will happen on Election Day, but one fairly safe bet is this: Paladino will not be the next governor of New York. However tardily, he's been disowned not only by the state's extant, if endangered, cadre of mainstream Republicans but even by some of the hard right. No one apparently told him that while bigotry isn't always a disqualifier for public office, appearing on YouTube vowing to ''take out'' a reporter from Rupert Murdoch's New York Post can be. As a rule, it's career suicide to threaten to murder your own political base.
But if New Yorkers may take comfort from the pratfall of this particular barbarian at their gate, the national forecast is not so sunny. Paladino is no anomaly in American politics in 2010. He's just the most clownish illustration of where things have been heading for two years and are still heading. Like the farcical Christine O'Donnell in another blue Northeastern state, he's a political loss-leader, if you will, whose near-certain defeat on Nov. 2 allows us to indulge in a bit of denial about the level of rage still coursing, sometimes violently, through our national bloodstream.
That wave of anger began with the parallel 2008 cataclysms of the economy's collapse and Barack Obama's ascension. The mood has not subsided since. But in the final stretch of 2010, the radical right's anger is becoming less focused, more free-floating -- more likely to be aimed at ''government'' in general, whatever the location or officials in charge. The anger is also more likely to claim minorities like gays, Latinos and Muslims as collateral damage. This is a significant and understandable shift, if hardly a salutary one. The mad-as-hell crowd in America, still not seeing any solid economic recovery on the horizon, will lash out at any convenient scapegoat.
The rage was easier to parse at the Tea Party's birth, when, a month after Obama's inauguration, its founding father, CNBC's Rick Santelli, directed his rant at the ordinary American ''losers'' (as he called them) defaulting on their mortgages, and at those in Washington who proposed bailing the losers out. (Funny how the Bush-initiated bank bailouts went unmentioned.) Soon enough, the anger tilted toward Washington in general and the new president in particular. And it kept getting hotter. In June 2009, still just six months into the Obama presidency, the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith broke with his own network's party line to lament a rise in ''amped up'' Americans ''taking the extra step and getting the gun out.'' He viewed the killing of a guard by a neo-Nazi Obama hater at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington as the apotheosis of the ''more and more frightening'' post-election e-mail surging into Fox.
The moment passed. Glenn Beck, also on Fox, spoke for most on the right when he dismissed the shooter as a ''lone gunman nutjob.'' Those who showed up with assault rifles at presidential health care rallies that summer were similarly minimized as either solitary oddballs or overzealous Second Amendment patriots. Few cared when The Boston Globe reported last fall that the Secret Service was overwhelmed by death threats against the president as well as a rise in racist hate groups and antigovernment fervor. It's no better now. In a cover article last month, Barton Gellman wrote in Time that the magazine's six-month investigation found that ''the threat level against the president and other government targets'' is at its highest since the antigovernment frenzy that preceded Timothy McVeigh's bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.
While Obama-hatred remains a staple of the right, the ebbing of his political clout may have diminished him as a catchall for America's roiling, inchoate rage. The president is no longer the sole personification of evil. For those who see government as Public Enemy No. 1, other targets will do, potentially some as remote from Washington as Oklahoma City.
Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist who has written a new book on Beck, has been tracking the case of Byron Williams, a bank robber on parole who injured two California Highway Patrol officers in a July shootout. Williams was out to start a revolution, his mother said, because ''Congress was railroading through all these left-wing agenda items.'' But instead of picking Congress as his target, Williams was gunning for progressives closer to home, at the Tides Foundation and A.C.L.U. in San Francisco. The Tides Foundation? It's an obscure nonprofit whose agenda includes education and AIDS prevention. But it's not obscure to Beck fans, who heard him single it out for vilification 29 times in the 18 months before Williams grabbed his gun.
As Milbank has written, ''it's not fair to blame Beck for violence committed by his fans,'' but he would nonetheless ''do well to stop encouraging extremists.'' The same could be said of the many politicians who are emulating the Beck template -- especially given the tinderbox state of the nation. Whether it's Sarah Palin instructing her acolytes to ''reload'' or a congressman yelling ''baby killer!'' at a colleague on the House floor or Sharron Angle, the Tea Party senatorial candidate from Nevada, proposing that citizens consider ''Second Amendment remedies'' to ''protect themselves against a tyrannical government,'' we know where this can lead.
Even Paladino's short, crumbling campaign can take credit for a share of the real-world damage in New York's civil war over the ''ground zero mosque'' this summer. His television commercials calling the proposed Islamic center ''a monument to those who attacked our country'' helped push his primary campaign over the top, noticeably raising the city's temperature. The fever peaked not quite three weeks after his ads first appeared, when a passenger slashed a New York cab driver in the face and throat simply because he was a Muslim.
Paladino's fanning of Islamophobia was common among his national political brethren this summer. Equally common was the violence against Muslims and mosques that ensued, whether in Tennessee, Texas or California. Paladino's antediluvian brand of homophobia is also making a comeback, from O'Donnell, who has called homosexuality an ''identity disorder,'' to Carly Fiorina, the Senate candidate in California whose campaign is allied with the National Organization for Marriage, notorious for its fear-mongering horror-movie ads portraying same-sex marriage as the apocalypse. Two weeks ago, Jim DeMint, the South Carolina senator who serves as the G.O.P.'s Tea Party kingmaker, reiterated his desire to ban openly gay schoolteachers. Michele Bachmann, Tea Party doyenne of the House, refused to condemn Paladino's homophobia when asked about it last week on the ''Today'' show. As Stephen Colbert observed last week, after the G.O.P. repudiated a Congressional candidate in Ohio for wearing an SS uniform, the only line you can't cross as a Republican is dressing as a Nazi. (Though, as Colbert added, ''dressing the president as a Nazi'' is O.K.)
Don't expect the extremism and violence in our politics to subside magically after Election Day -- no matter what the results. If Tea Party candidates triumph, they'll be emboldened. If they lose, the anger and bitterness will grow. The only development that can change this equation is a decisive rescue from our prolonged economic crisis. Not for the first time in history -- and not just American history -- fear itself is at the root of a rabid outbreak of populist rage against government, minorities and conspiratorial ''elites.''
So far neither party has offered a comprehensive antidote to our economic pain. The Democrats have fallen short, and the cynics leading the G.O.P. haven't so much as tried. We shouldn't be surprised that this year even a state as seemingly well-mannered as Connecticut has produced a senatorial candidate best known for marching into a wrestling ring to gratuitously kick a man in the groin.

HEADLINE: Field Report: Market Share

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
In New York City, the push to eat locally can go only so far, allowing diners the occasional gotcha moment at restaurants that promote their sourcing. When I tasted the smooth, rich polenta at Roberta's, a restaurant in Brooklyn that grows vegetables out back, I was sure I'd caught them. ''Anson Mills, right?'' I asked the chef, Carlo Mirarchi, name-checking the South Carolina gristmill of choice. He'd got me: ''Cayuga Pure Organics, upstate.'' O.K. . . . Did the staff forager at Print, an upscale locavore restaurant, find the nutty freekeh (roasted green wheat berries, a Middle Eastern specialty) that anchors its vegetable plate at Kalustyan's, across town? Cayuga Pure Organics again. The heirloom beans at Gramercy Tavern? Exactly. 
Legumes and grains have come into play in New York in the last year, altering the lives of a small collective of farmers outside Ithaca along with it. Farro and polenta are no longer just Italian imports. Flour ground from organic buckwheat, rye or winter wheat can be found beyond the health-food store. Black, navy, pinto and heirloom beans like Jacob's Cattle are sold at New York City green markets and snazzy grocers. Now that the missing links on the plate have been filled in by Cayuga Pure Organics, New York locavores can have their polenta cake and eat it too.
Beans are grown on a large scale in western New York, but they get shipped off to distributors. And while Buffalo was once one of the largest grain-milling centers in the country, hard wheat moved to North Dakota as industrial flour mills sought uniformity and more beneficial weather. So when the movement to keep ingredients close to home swept the country, the farmers' markets drove the supply, even if it meant willing it into being.
In 2003, Erick Smith and Dan Lathwell -- men nearing 60 who'd farmed intermittently when not working at Cornell or teaching elsewhere -- thought they'd hit upon a smart niche when they created Cayuga Pure Organics to grow pesticide-free feed for the region's newly organic dairy farms. Two years later, the Ithaca food co-op and a natural-food distributor asked if they'd grow organic beans on their land in the town of Caroline. They were also connected with a local taqueria, and soon the two were struggling to keep up with the restaurant's weekly order for 500 pounds of black and pinto beans. Then, in the fall of 2008, the farm inspector for New York's Greenmarket tracked them down in her quest to find a grower to satisfy the demand for local beans and grains.
''We hemmed and hawed, thinking that going to New York City is a whole step up in the organizational process,'' said Smith, an articulate man for whom overalls and a graying beard are a natural fit after years of teaching math education. It also required getting up to speed in marketing, which for farmers means both self-promotion and literally selling at markets.
''When I was a student in agriculture economics,'' Smith told me, ''many said that if farmers would spend less time on the field and more time marketing, they would make more money for themselves than they would out in the field. Most farmers tend to fall in that category, including Dan and me.'' But they had a secret weapon: 25-year-olds.
Two years ago, they hired Adrian Smith, then 23, to run the beanery. Soon her girlfriend, Anne Riordan, was hanging around and lending a hand. Now Smith is more involved on the business side, and Riordan has taken charge of the beanery, a restored barn where the harvest from the farm's 600 various acres is taken for cleaning, sorting and bagging, using mostly old equipment that Smith has bought from farms that scaled up years ago.
One of C.P.O.'s employees, a puckish, fast-talking 32-year-old named Tycho Dan, offered to use his background in retail and activism to set up and manage the New York market and wholesale division. Now Cayuga Pure Organics sells its products at seven markets in New York, where it shares warehouse space with other vendors.
Like other farmers his age, Dan -- who throws around phrases like ''supply chain'' and ''value-added'' and refers to the farmers' market as the ''core tool'' -- understands that selling little brown bags of beans and barley is nice, but you've got to turn them into something else if you want to make money. And so the farm's different grains are milled into flour (C.P.O. is a partner in Farmer Ground Flour, a mill in nearby Trumansburg) and made into products that best bring out their flavors.
''Twenty years ago, nobody really talked about the flavor of wheat,'' said Smith, who researches heritage grains from around the world. ''Now we have whole tasting sessions; there was one at the French Culinary Institute.''
To get those flavors out there, they have contracted with Orwasher's bakery to make a whole-wheat loaf and with the Ravioli Store to make fresh buckwheat soba, emmer-wheat and spelt pasta; they recently started selling bean spreads. Oat-flour chocolate-chip cookies and pancake mix are in the works. ''That's really the future for us, if you want to talk about marketing,'' Dan said.
Smith and Lathwell know where the future lies: at 65 and 60 respectively, they are looking to their employees to take over the farm when it gets to be too much. (Lathwell will leave the company by the end of the year.)
''At some point we have to slow down, whether we want to or not,'' said Smith, sitting in a clearing near his home, which is also a bed and breakfast. ''The whole model of the old family farm that got passed down generations is really not changing, because traditional families are not what they used to be to a large extent. My kids have no interest, but we have these young people who are terribly interested.'' Smith is excited that Adrian Smith (no relation) and Riordan want to take over C.P.O., especially because few women operate mechanized farms.
For the moment, Smith is enjoying his work too much to retire. By bringing quality ingredients to New York's tables, he has discovered the true meaning of value-added. ''Part of what motivates me, and also the young people working with us, is that we are all being part of something that we believe in,'' he said. ''So many people have work, but they don't find it very meaningful. I spent my whole life not knowing what I wanted to do until we started C.P.O. Now I feel like I've hit it . . . at age 65.''
Recipe: Chicken With Freekeh 1 medium chicken (about 3 pounds)
1 medium onion, peeled
3 cinnamon sticks
Coarse sea salt, or kosher salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
11/2 cups freekeh (see note)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
Freshly ground black pepper
1 pound plain yogurt (optional)
Cilantro and lemon wedges, for serving.
1. Rinse the chicken and put in a medium saucepan. Add 7 cups water and set over high heat. When the water is about to boil, skim the surface, then add the onion, cinnamon sticks and 1 tablespoon salt. Reduce to a gentle simmer and cook for 45 minutes. Remove 3 cups of stock and reserve. Cook the chicken for 30 minutes more.
2. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the freekeh and stir until it is well coated. Let toast, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and add the ground cinnamon, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes or more, until the freekeh is cooked to your liking. (At this point if the stock has all been absorbed, turn off the heat, recover the pot and let steam while you prepare the chicken. If the freekeh is too wet, drain excess stock and let steam as above.)
3. Transfer the chicken to a chopping board and cut into 4 or 8 pieces, keeping the skin or not, as desired. Spoon the freekeh into a shallow serving bowl and arrange the chicken pieces on top. Garnish with cilantro, lemon, additional salt, pepper and ground cinnamon, if desired. Serve immediately with a bowl of plain yogurt. Serves 4. Adapted from ''Lebanese Cuisine,'' by Anissa Helou.
Note: Freekeh is available at cporganics.com.
Recipe: Spelt Sables 1 cup (4.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
1 scant cup (4 ounces) spelt or whole-wheat flour
14 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup (3.5 ounces) sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract.
1. Combine the flours in a bowl and mix together thoroughly with a whisk or fork.
2. In a medium bowl, with the back of a large spoon or with an electric mixer, beat the butter with the sugar, salt and vanilla until smooth and creamy but not fluffy, about 1 minute with the mixer. Add the flour and mix just until incorporated. Scrape the dough into a mass and, if necessary, knead it with your hands to be sure the flour is completely incorporated. 3. Form the dough into a 12-by-2-inch log. Wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. 4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil, dull side up. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Unwrap the dough log and use a sharp knife to cut the cold dough into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place the cookies at least 11/2 inches apart. 5. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until the cookies are light golden brown at the edges. Rotate the pans from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. Let the cookies firm up on the pans for about 1 minute before transferring to a rack with a metal spatula. Let the cookies cool completely before storing. The cookies are delicious fresh but are even better the next day. Makes about 48 cookies.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Scenes From Life in a Drug War: Tijuana Reclaimed

BYLINE: By FEDERICO CAMPBELL

 BODY:
Tijuana, Mexico
THERE are two Tijuanas: that of the locals, and that of the rest. The true Tijuana belongs only to the oldest families, the grandparents and great-grandparents of Tijuana. The view from outside, on the other hand, tends to come into focus through fantasy, stereotype and cliche.
But the outside world helped create Tijuana. 
In the 19th century, Tijuana resembled the set of an old Western -- a few houses, some wooden corrals, mud-caked roads and a customs hut to register the passage of caravans heading to the port at Ensenada.
The city came into its own only in the 1920s, thanks to Prohibition and laws outlawing gambling in the United States. Americans exported the vices they had banned at home to the new city emerging on this side of the border, which soon became a nerve center for the production of alcohol, from brandy to Mexicali beer.
Capital from the American underworld was largely responsible. American investors like Carl Withington opened saloons and broke ground for the construction of casinos like the Foreign Club, the Montecarlo and the Agua Caliente, which was built alongside the hot springs of the same name. And American tourists paid for the prostitutes, the boxing clubs and the opium.
Of course, the particular vices changed a bit during the 20th century, but the city kept on playing the same role for its northern neighbor. That is, until the 1990s, when everything began to change. This pressure started building from the south -- drugs (and the violence and law of the jungle that come with them) were heading north and Tijuana was the last stop before the border. The Arellano brothers had moved here from Sinaloa in the '80s, and other traffickers and assassins followed. It was like a tide shifting. Instead of an influx of visitors from the north, we had these smugglers from the south. And the tourists were scared away.
It had a devastating effect on Tijuana's economy. The murders, kidnappings and decapitations reached a peak in 2008. Americans stopped coming, and those Tijuana families who could afford it moved to California, to San Diego or Bonita, to sleep in peace. Even local politicians and officials bought or rented houses elsewhere. Stores closed. Bars were boarded up.
But now Tijuana is recovering. The violence has begun to subside, thanks to the local police and the Mexican military, as well as the capture last January of Teodoro Garcia Simental, an infamous drug lord known as El Teo. Avenida Revolucion, dead for the past three years, is showing signs of life. On Friday and Saturday nights it is packed with young people. Caesar's, a symbolic old restaurant and hotel (where the famous salad was invented), just reopened, and one block over, rock and blues bands play at the music hall.
No, the tourists haven't returned. It's the locals, the people of Tijuana -- who kept to themselves during the worst of the violence -- reclaiming their territory.
''We have to change our image,'' said Jaime Chaidez, a local journalist. ''We can't rely on tourism anymore. The city still stands, as noble as ever. It is surviving, growing, picking itself up.''
And for perhaps the first time in more than a century, the Tijuanans are driving that growth. In a sense, then, it is the very violence that plagues Mexico that has returned Tijuana to the people who live here.
A few days ago, a statue of Ruben Vizcaino Valencia, a writer, teacher and promoter of Mexican culture, was unveiled. He is the first Tijuana native to be honored in this way, and there he stands, presiding over one of the hallways of the Centro Cultural Tijuana.

AMERICANS FACE
Afghans' Disillusionment
United States forces have begun long-planned operations to regain control of the districts surrounding Kandahar city. If previous operations are any indication, the Americans can expect to encounter a region badly damaged by five years of fighting, and a wary and frustrated population that has been left disillusioned by past engagements. PAGE 6
A LETTER ON WIKILEAKS 
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in a private letter over the summer that while the release of 75,000 classified documents about the war in Afghanistan by the Web site WikiLeaks endangered the lives of Afghans helping the United States, the disclosures did not reveal any significant national intelligence secrets. PAGE 10
A PUSH FOR A TRIAL IN IRAN
Iran's intelligence minister insists that two American hikers who remain in custody more than a year after their capture near the Iraqi border must be tried in an Iranian court. Iranian officials have long accused the pair of spying, but no formal charges have been brought against them since their arrest in July 2009. PAGE 10

A RELIABLE BLOC
In an election year of hype and hyperbole, one fact resonates across all contests and candidates: in midterm elections, many people tune out and stay home, but older voters vote. It is a deeply rutted pattern in American history that could swing race after race. PAGE 17

His 'War on Cash' to India
A day after the Indian government started a campaign to give identification numbers to all of its 1.2 billion citizens, Ajay Banga, the chief executive of MasterCard, arrived in town, eager to lend a hand. Though Mr. Banga has risen to the top ranks of American business, the roots of his success are firmly planted in India, where he was born, raised and got his start in business. His success at MasterCard may well depend on India, too. PAGE 1

AN AGE OF DOCUMENTARIES
What is a documentary? These days, A.O. Scott writes, it might be more appropriate to ask what isn't? We seem to be living in the age of the small-screen ''docu-soap,'' a term that neatly collapses the boundary between the mundane and the melodramatic, between the uninflected capture of actual life and the brazen manipulation of people and emotion.

HEADLINE: The Elusive Small-House Utopia

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice, a contributing writer to the magazine, is the author of ''The Teeth May Smile but the Heart Does Not Forget.''

 BODY:
Every year, in conjunction with a big trade show, the magazine Builder creates something it calls its ''concept home.'' The house is an exhibition on a theme -- the 2004 edition, for example, was called the Ultimate Family Home -- but also a commercial venture. Attendees of the International Builders' Show can walk through a model, and when the show is over, the concept is quite literally put to a test when the finished house is offered up for sale on the open market. During the last decade's real estate boom, the annual demonstration kept up with the times: designs abounded with baronial features like colonnades, cathedral ceilings and observation towers, and they sometimes topped 6,000 square feet. But then the crash came, wiping out credit lines and shaking the industry's confidence. For this year's show, Boyce Thompson, the editorial director of Builder, wanted a look more attuned to curtailed appetites, so he came up with a concept that he called a Home for the New Economy. 
The most salient specification of the house was its modest proportions. At around 1,700 square feet, it was the size of the average American home built in 1980. Since then, new houses have on average grown by more than 40 percent, as dens have expanded into great rooms, and tubs and sinks have multiplied. ''Houses got too big, because people were chasing investment gains and there was cheap money, and the industry responded by building houses that were too large,'' Thompson says. ''So we really wanted to focus people's attention on doing smaller, better homes.'' He points to Census statistics that show a slight decline in the size of homes built over the past two years and to a much larger drop in the square footage of those that have just started construction, and suggests that the market may be headed toward a more austere norm.
That's certainly debatable. If dissecting the causes of the housing market's crash is a task for economists, predicting its future is a fuzzier matter of sociology. Will Americans re-evaluate cultural assumptions that equate ever-larger houses with success and stability? Or will they invest more in their lived environments, figuring that with the demise of the quick flip, they are now in for the long term? In the absence of much real market activity, imaginations are free to run wild. The Home for the New Economy is one such exercise in speculation, a proposal that the future lies in denser, more walkable, modestly scaled communities. Marianne Cusato, who designed the Home for the New Economy, sees it as a rebuke to the ethic of the McMansion. ''We're not going to go back to 2005,'' she says. ''What was built then is not going to come back, and this is not a bad thing. What we were building was so unsustainable, and it didn't really meet our needs.''
Cusato, who is 36, started her career drawing up million-dollar mansions, but she has made a name for herself by going smaller, designing a 300-square-foot Katrina Cottage meant to be a replacement for the trailers the government set up after the 2005 hurricane. When Cusato sat down to devise the Home for the New Economy, she tried to consider how families actually use their living areas. She started with a simple, symmetrical three-bedroom plan, excising extraneous spaces -- the seldom-used formal dining room, for instance -- while enlarging windows wherever she could and adding a wraparound porch. A result was a house that was compact, comfortable, bright and energy-efficient.
There was just one problem. Usually the concept homes are put up in partnership with a local builder, but this year's conference was held in Las Vegas, perhaps the nation's most disastrous real estate market, and it was presumed no investor there would be willing to take a risk, even a small one, on the Home for the New Economy. So Builder put together an interactive Web site and displayed Cusato's design at a booth inside the conference hall. The concept was a hit with at least one developer, LeylandAlliance, which was working on master-planned communities in New York, Connecticut, Virginia and South Carolina. Cusato began working with the company to bring her idea to life. The Home for the New Economy would be given the opportunity, after all, to meet the actual new economy.
The spirit of constraint that Cusato means to tap isn't purely a product of the recession. It's a cultural thread that runs from Henry David Thoreau's 10-by-15-foot cabin next to Walden Pond all the way to the New Urbanist communities that began appearing in the 1980s, reacting to the spread of soulless suburbanization by trying to recapture a traditional small-town aesthetic. But the wider buying public has never found much appeal in the idea that it ought to make do with less. ''Builders have tried quality rather than size, but they always fail,'' says Witold Rybczynski, an architecture professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The market always says: We don't care. If you're giving us a smaller house, we don't want it.''
Rybczynski speaks from experience. In 1990, he and a partner came up with a design they called the Grow Home, a 14-foot-wide row house that could be constructed for as little as $35,000. His intent was to produce something along the lines of Frank Lloyd Wright's famed Usonians, dwellings devised during the Great Depression as housing for the working man, which later became a model for the tiny tract homes of Levittown. Rybczynski built a Grow Home in Montreal and wrote an article about it for The Atlantic, in which he posited that the ''abundant resources that accounted for the success of the large single-family suburban house -- unlimited land, cheap transportation and plentiful energy -- can no longer be taken for granted.'' That was 20 years ago. While the Grow Home design proved to be a niche success, it didn't change popular tastes, which kept inflating in defiance of all warnings about sustainability. By the market's 2007 peak, the average American house had surpassed 2,500 square feet.
''This happened at the same time as household size declined, so it's a little bizarre,'' says John McIlwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute. ''But people seem to have liked the idea of having extra bedrooms and lots of room, big kitchens and big master bedrooms and big master baths. I think it's just cultural, an expression of wealth.'' But it's not just that -- studies have found that lower-class homes in the United States are also much larger than comparable residences in Europe.
''To me, the answer is that we subsidized it massively,'' says Christopher B. Leinberger, a housing scholar at the Brookings Institution. ''Over the last 30 years, we saw one of the largest social-engineering projects in the nation's history.'' The mortgage tax deduction encouraged a vast expansion of homeownership, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created new pools of capital through securitization. The federal government kept building highways to serve ever-more distant suburbs, where local authorities often mandated large home and lot sizes in the belief that it would encourage the construction of affluent communities. Facing a widespread revolt against property taxes, many of the same municipalities began financing suburban infrastructure -- roads, sewers and so on -- through ''impact fees'' levied at the outset of the development process. This and other factors effectively inflated the cost of developable land. The homebuilding industry, which was in the process of consolidating into the hands of a dozen or so publicly traded corporations, passed on the added expense to consumers through higher home prices. But because they enjoyed such economies of scale when it came to construction, the major homebuilders could offer buyers an inducement in return: a lot more room.
Some in the industry argue that buyers never truly craved all that surplus space and took it only because that was the way the marketplace measured the worth of their investment. ''We have to get out of the dollars-per-square-foot mind-set,'' says Sarah Susanka, an architect and author of ''The Not So Big House.'' ''I've been on a crusade to get people to think this way for years.'' She says she was inspired to write her book -- which recommends that home-buyers adjust their space expectations downward by a third and spend the money they save on creating a well-designed interior -- after years of hearing the same sentiment from her clients: they were hoping to make a profit at resale, so they had to meet the market's space expectations, not their own. Susanka says that the success of ''The Not So Big House,'' which has sold hundreds of thousands of copies since its publication 12 years ago, proves there is room for alternate conceptions of value.
In today's marketplace, homebuilders are finding that smaller models are selling more reliably, and many are reassessing old marketing assumptions. ''In many of our markets, there was an attitude that whatever you buy, you need to stretch, because in two years you'll be able to sell it for double,'' says Jeffrey Mezger, the chief executive of KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders. With quick profit expectations dispelled, the average size of a KB house has fallen by almost 20 percent since the peak. The company recently introduced a line called the Open Series, homes that have flexible floor plans and low energy costs and run as small as 1,200 square feet.
The trend does not necessarily indicate, however, that Americans have suddenly decided they desire less. Homebuilders are shifting to compete with the cut-rate prices of foreclosures. Nowhere in KB's marketing for the Open Series will you glimpse the word ''small.'' Even some enemies of the McMansion say it's impossible to make a selling point of asceticism.
''Everybody hates the Calvinist sacrifice; they just don't want to hear of it,'' says the architect Andres Duany, a founding father of the New Urbanist movement and a mentor of Marianne Cusato's. Duany argues that the sprawling homes of the last decade actually met a need, albeit imperfectly, by reproducing internally what suburban communities lacked: an exercise room substitutes for a park, a home theater for the Main Street cinema. Buyers will only accept smaller homes, he says, if their surroundings compensate them. ''The idea that you can promote things -- that a developer is actually going to come out and say, 'Marianne's house is more virtuous,' is ridiculous,'' Duany says.
A real, live edition of the Home for the New Economy now stands near the end of a street in North Augusta, S.C., behind a white picket fence in a residential development called Hammond's Ferry. The house owes its existence, in part, to the ideals of LeylandAlliance, which builds communities in the New Urbanist vein, but it's also a practical concession to the distressed times. Hammond's Ferry, which is situated along the Savannah River, hit the market in 2006, initially offering up a street of antebellum-style residences that ran as large as 4,000 square feet and cost an average of $500,000. The Home for the New Economy, priced at about half that much, represents a definite adjustment.
''If there was a tactical error we made, it was in the direction of going more toward the 'wow,' '' said Turner Simkins, the general manager of the project, as we stood atop a condominium building and surveyed a street of generously proportioned homes with columned two-story porches. On a color map of the Hammond's Ferry master plan, the building was surrounded by some 450 beige rectangles, lots mainly set aside for single-family homes. So far, 88 houses have been built, 78 of them sold, and many of the lots on the map were still covered by uncleared bramble. Simkins said the homes that were finding buyers, unsurprisingly, were those priced below $250,000, but the developer had found it difficult to convince upscale Southern builders that there was money in modesty. Marianne Cusato's house was there, as much as anything, to provide a different model.
Some skeptics have questioned whether the Home for the New Economy actually demonstrates much of a change. ''I really think the whole thing is a marketing ploy,'' Witold Rybczynski says. ''Seventeen hundred square feet is not a small house.'' Yet in North Augusta, the problem with the place appeared to be quite the opposite: people had trouble imagining how you could sell something so minuscule. One day I had lunch with Cusato and Thomas Blanchard Jr., whose firm was marketing Hammond's Ferry. Blanchard explained that along the Georgia border, the crash had actually caused new houses to grow even larger. Crown Communities, an Atlanta-area builder, had snapped up suburban land at depressed prices and was erecting billboards that crowed, ''Houses from $47 a square foot.'' One of its largest models was called the Titan.
Cusato wondered aloud about the ''sustainability'' of such development and said that she would prefer for people to think of a house's value not in terms of price per square foot but in its cost per month, taking into account the ongoing expenses of heating and cooling. ''They're meeting a segment of the market that needs to be served,'' Blanchard responded, diplomatically. ''You can't create markets; you can only respond to them.''
One afternoon, Cusato and I made our way through Hammond's Ferry to see the Home for the New Economy, walking down streets scaled to be bicycle friendly and passing Manuel's Bread Cafe, where the French chef cooks with ingredients from an on-site organic farm. The houses, big and small, were bunched close together on lots that averaged a fifth of an acre. Building at relatively high density helps LeylandAlliance to offset the profit it forgoes by reserving a substantial portion of land for public amenities, like a waterfront park, running paths and several restored ponds. Still, the small-town feel doesn't come cheap. For the price Cusato's house was going for, $280,000, a North Augusta consumer could just as easily get something truly titanic, if less neighborly.
''There's this machine we've created, this expectation that you have to have this huge home,'' Cusato said. We were joined at the house by its builder, David Blair, who financed the construction himself because no bank would do so. We walked through the front door, into a sunlit 25-by-15-foot living and dining room, which was adjoined by an open kitchen.
Cusato had never been inside this particular version of her home -- she had seen several others in upstate New York, where LeylandAlliance has another development -- and so Blair took over the tour to show us a few alterations he made to the design. Cusato had intended it to be adaptable. Buyers, Blair said as we walked upstairs, are ''used to the McMansions, and they say it's too small.'' At the top of the staircase was a loftlike open space, adjoined by two bedrooms and a windowless chamber that the builder said could be put to use as an office. Then, at the end of the hallway, there was a door. Blair opened it, and we entered an unfinished room, measuring 260 square feet. Blair said that it could be used for storage, but for a buyer willing to pay the asking price, he would finish it as a master bedroom. He explained that this allowed the house to be advertised as having four bedrooms and 2,000 square feet -- in other words, not as a small house, but one close to medium-size. ''People still have this . . . what I call a hang-up about price per square foot,'' the builder said.
Blair's stratagem had brought the Home for the New Economy's price, according to the accepted metric, down from $160 to $140 a square foot. But that was still almost three times the rate the billboards were advertising elsewhere. Since the home's debut in June, it had received a fair amount of public attention, but it still hadn't sold, and Blair had already been forced to drop what he was asking. ''To sell a house in this market is tough,'' Blair said. ''We're going to market the lifestyle -- the homes follow the lifestyle.'' And indeed, at an open house later that evening, the Home for the New Economy filled up with neighbors from around Hammond's Ferry: singles, retirees, families with kids. ''I think it's taken folks a while to get the concept of what we're doing down here,'' said Walker Posey, who lives in a three-bedroom house. ''Your dollar can go a long way in South Carolina in terms of square footage. But quality of life is not about square footage.''
Of course, these were people who had already bought into that proposition -- and it was unclear how many others would accept the trade-off of space for lifestyle. For more than 60 years, at least, American consumers have dreamed of one day having enough room to stretch out. It may take more than the shock of hard times to downsize that particular fantasy.

HEADLINE: Carp Invasion May Prompt Changes to Waterways

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN

 BODY:
The battle over closing Chicago-area outlets into Lake Michigan is not only about preventing Asian carp from decimating the $7 billion Great Lakes fishing industry, experts said. It has also prompted efforts to re-engineer a century-old waterway system that Joel Brammeier, president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, has compared to ''having left Michigan Avenue a dirt road while we built up a modern city around it.''
Michigan and four other states have filed suit in federal court demanding the closure of locks that connect rivers and channels to the lake. Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Monday. The Illinois Chamber of Commerce has countered that Asian carp pose no imminent ecological threat and shutting the locks would mean billions in losses for tour boats, shipping and other industries.
Urban planners and environmental groups said there is another way to deal with the Asian carp threat: separate the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins, which were joined a century ago by the man-made reversal of the Chicago River and the building of canals. 
Separation could also involve overhauling Chicago's outdated wastewater-treatment system and reduce the city's controversial diversion of two billion gallons of water a day out of Lake Michigan into the Chicago River.
The Army Corps of Engineers is among the groups studying ways to achieve what is formally called ''ecological or hydrological separation'' of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Great Lakes Commission, the Great Lakes & St. Lawrence Cities Initiative and others are conducting their own studies on separating the two great drainage basins. Thom Cmar, staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said its study, which will be released this week, shows that separation is a series of engineering challenges, but they are all solvable problems. ''It's a matter of unpacking all the issues that need to be addressed and finding the political will and resources to address them,'' he said.
Environmental experts have proposed building concrete walls or other means to separate the Calumet River from the Cal-Sag Channel and the Chicago River from the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. One barrier might be erected in Bridgeport, where the Chicago River meets the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. Both the Calumet and Chicago Rivers might also be ''re-reversed'' to flow into Lake Michigan and halt the diversion of Great Lakes water.
The Metropolitan Planning Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council, among other groups, said a break near Bridgeport could still allow tour and recreational boats to move freely north of that point between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan through the locks at Navy Pier. Barges carrying coal, gravel, grain and other low-value bulk commodities could still ply most of the waterway system. Cargo could be transferred to railcars or trucks at the separation point, which the planners said could create hundreds of jobs.
In a study commissioned by the State of Michigan, John Taylor, a transportation specialist at Wayne State University, put the cost of transferring goods at $70 million a year. That could ruin river shipping, said Mark Biel, president of Unlock Our Jobs, a coalition of industry groups that use the waterway. Commodities shipped by barge have a low profit margin, and extra transportation costs would probably make them unsellable, Mr. Biel said.
Other opponents of separation -- including the Port of Indiana -- agree that even if the canals remain open, cutting off access to Lake Michigan will change the economics of trade enough to seriously harm businesses from corn starch refineries to steel mills to chemical plants. They also said they are afraid it could set a precedent that would allow closure of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. Ballast water from ocean-going ships has been a source of invasive species, and environmental groups have proposed closing the seaway unless strict ballast-treatment regulations are imposed.
''If you can shut down the Chicago waterway over Asian carp, you could shut down the St. Lawrence Seaway over an invasive species,'' Mr. Biel said.
Mr. Brammeier, president of the Alliance for Great Lakes, disputed that notion. ''These are completely different situations except that they both involve protecting the status quo,'' he said. ''The only thing that will paralyze the shipping industry is its unwillingness to talk about improvements.''
The Port of Indiana recently released a study that said the O'Brien Lock in southeast Chicago accounted for $1.9 billion a year in economic activity in Indiana. Jody Peacock, the port spokesman, said separation of Chicago-area waterways from the Mississippi would cost Indiana steel mills and Midwestern farmers access to significant portions of their markets.
But Mr. Taylor, of Wayne State, said the study exaggerated the probable impact of a separation, noting that the approximately 5,000 barges that move through the O'Brien Lock each year represent only about 1 percent of the lock activity in Illinois and barges carry only 2 percent of the region's outbound steel.
''There are costs involved, but there are also benefits,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''For most companies, we don't believe the cost increases are enough to make them shut down.''
Michigan's lawsuit, filed in July, was prompted by findings of eDNA -- bits of biological material from Asian carp -- in Calumet Harbor and other spots near the lake. The suit called for the locks at Navy Pier and on the Calumet River to be closed immediately to prevent the carp from establishing a viable population in the lake. But lock closure is not considered a long-term option: closed locks still allow water -- and potentially eggs and juvenile fish -- to pass through screens.
Lawyers for the Army Corps of Engineers have disputed the idea that eDNA findings show that the corps' existing electric barriers on the sanitary and ship canal have failed to block Asian carp. Separation supporters said the corps will likely eventually oppose separation as not feasible and instead favor ''acoustic bubble'' curtains, low-oxygen zones and other ways to kill or block species.
Jo-Ellen Darcy, assistant secretary of the Army (Civil Works), said the corps would consider all options. ''We need to look not only at the aquatic and ecological impact, but also the impact on the economy and the people who depend on this waterway for a living,'' she said.
Restoring the original flow of the Chicago River could mean several of the area's northern wastewater-treatment plants would need to be improved. There are stricter water-quality standards for Lake Michigan than the Chicago River and canal system, where the wastewater currently goes, so re-reversing the river to flow back into Lake Michigan would entail a higher level of treatment.
''As the city grows we're going to need more water,'' said Josh Ellis, a water expert with the Metropolitan Planning Council. ''If we clean our water after we use it and return it to Lake Michigan like everyone else does, then we can use more.''

HEADLINE: BACK TO THE CIRCUS

BYLINE: By AARON BLOOM. 
Aaron Bloom divides his time between New York and Los Angeles. He is working on a novel.

 BODY:
It began in 2008, that improbably toxic year: an endless search for almost-jobs; the completion of an expensively worthless degree; a lying, cheating girlfriend; a crashed stock portfolio (bought with money from the Brooklyn home I flipped as a successful subprime borrower). I had to get away. I flew to Los Angeles, bought a motorcycle and rode for weeks as far as Seattle, only to be summoned overnight back to L.A., where my deaf aunt was dying of the leukemia she had managed for 23 years. According to her friends, she was dying because she quit her medical treatments after a Gypsy psychic convinced her that the doctors were lying to her.
Over the ensuing months in L.A., I discovered that the psychic had hustled my aunt for almost half a million dollars over three years. Her house was bled away through credit-card cash advances and annual refinancing, all at crazy rates, all of which left my aunt penniless when she died a 70-something-pound skeleton in my arms. I felt I had no choice but to buy another motorcycle (the other one was still in Seattle) and bounce from sublet to craigslist sublet, more or less homeless, as I sought contingency-fee lawyers to sue the psychic and formulated a plan to outsmart the predatory lender who demanded her deed. 
Before my aunt died, she used her last lucid day to antagonize my mother, in a way that was true to their 65-year relationship. My mother in turn went back East and refused to return for the funeral, leaving me to sort out my aunt's sordid estate. Luckily, I reunited with a cousin (first cousin to my mother and aunt) whom I lived with 20 years before, after I came back from Japan, where I worked as a clown for Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. I felt some symmetry because my cousin helped me move onto the circus train when I first joined, and now he was again my companion as I reconnected with an itinerant past -- one not so different from that of the Gypsies, or the Sephardim, which was our blood.
That heritage was bequeathed to me by my grandfather; he was a self-made man who in the Great Depression began to make the modest fortune that would later allow him to buy homes with cash for his two deaf daughters. My grandfather was the world to them, and when he died in 2003, my aunt crashed, spiraling into a great depression of her own and into the psychic's seductive web. It was the house he bought for her that was mortgaged to the hilt just as the great recession broke.
Inspired by my grandfather's wiles, I plunged into the task of selling my aunt's upside-down house, which begged to be made whole. I seduced a mystically inclined California family into lashing itself to the mast of a ferociously complicated sale, fraught with exploding septic systems and squatters. Later the buyers told me they were drawn by my very name, which echoed with the biblical Aaron as the one who could lead them home.
Just as I was celebrating the inconceivable completion of the sale this spring, a sublet roommate who had just scored a job on a Hollywood movie invited me, though I am not an actor, to audition for a part. The movie was based on a successful novel set in an American circus in the Great Depression, and even though I had not clowned in two decades, I was cast. So for weeks this past spring I drove my motorcycle to a set replete with authentic period trains, tents and costumes, where I performed for packed stands of extras who looked just like those who would have come during the Depression, people like my grandfather.
I was home again in the downside-up life of Clown Alley, and just as it did back then, the best clowning happened when it shouldn't have, offstage or off-camera, much to the irritation of one famous movie actor who accused the clowns of ''unfocused chaos.'' The complaint reminded me of one made years ago by Ringling management, accusing us of ''an attitude problem.''
This pretend life of the movie felt more real than my real life, and it made me whole. It was a gift, but perhaps not the greatest gift, which had to be that I walked away after being rear-ended on my motorcycle on the highway by a car going 80 on the morning of Independence Day. Two days after being sent flying to the highway with the greatest of ease, I returned to the set to film the climactic disaster scene, where characters die, though not the lead. At the story's outset, he accidentally joins the circus after his relatives die in a freak auto accident, which leads to the loss of his home to predatory Depression-era bankers. All of which, it now seems to me, was inevitable, or at the very least, predictable and probably foretold.

Higher Taxes, Less Work
To the Editor:
N. Gregory Mankiw claims some pretty severe consequences if high-income taxpayers decide to work less because they are taxed more. (''I Can Afford Higher Taxes. But They'll Make Me Work Less.'' Economic View, Oct. 10). 
The column chills us with the specters of our favorite actors and novelists not wanting to make that extra movie or write that extra book, a popular singer declining to perform a concert, or that surgeon who may not want to perform more operations.
Even if that were the case, we'd survive. We'd probably have plenty of new actors, artists and doctors whose success is made possible by a well-funded health care and educational system. And plenty of people may be willing to pay extra taxes for the basic opportunities that the rich enjoy. Cathy McNally
Northampton, Mass., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
Reading the column, I recalled a story a relative told me some 40 years ago. It went like this: ''I was doing well in my lab in Sweden, and they increased my pay to reward my hard work. But then taxes took all of it and more. Why should I work harder and receive even less? So I left Sweden for good and came to America.''
As our tax structure becomes even more destructive and limiting upon those with personal initiative and the intelligence to match, fewer and fewer will share their gifts. And then where will there be left to go?
Debra Darvick
Birmingham, Mich., Oct. 11
To the Editor:
Choosing to do less work is a completely rational choice for Professor Mankiw, or for anyone faced with higher tax rates.
But from society's perspective, the choice we should consider is not between higher taxes on the wealthy and their potential work hours, but between higher taxes on the wealthy and being able to pay for employment programs, national defense, public education, infrastructure, health care, etc.
When it comes to the latter choice, and without any disrespect to Mr. Mankiw, society could do without his extra article. Albert Sumell
Youngstown, Ohio, Oct. 10
The writer is an assistant professor of economics at Youngstown State University.
To the Editor:
There are plenty of high-income people (myself included) who evaluate work opportunities solely on the basis of how fulfilling or stimulating they seem likely to be -- and not on whether they will increase our net worth.
That you might get to take home only $523 out of every additional $1,000 you earn is neither here nor there. Sure, it would be nice to be able to keep more, but if you're lucky enough to be able to do work you love, marginal tax rates really don't figure into it at all. Allan Mayer

DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN
A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary
Edited by Steven R. Weisman
Illustrated. 705 pp. PublicAffairs. $35
Sometime in the late 1980s, I had lunch with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The drug war was a hot topic of conversation, and at the start of the lunch I asked him how he thought it was going. To answer the question fully, he said, would require a little historical background.
He proceeded to launch off on a fascinating survey of government efforts to control behavior and illegal substances, beginning with classical Greece. By the time our meal was over and Moynihan had to head off to another appointment, I think we were up to the 18th century, though it could have been the 16th. It was a great lunch, although it didn't help much with the newspaper article I was trying to write about the drug war.
That encounter did, however, raise the core question about Moynihan: Was he a scholar or a senator or some odd hybrid of the two? 
The answer, of course, is that he was a hybrid -- in that respect, but also in many others. He had the outlook of a poor, working-class boy, but was also a sophisticated Harvard intellectual. He was a liberal, but was suspicious of upper-middle-class liberals. He was an idealistic reformer, but also a conservative skeptic. He was a figure of the 18th-century Enlightenment, filled with grand thoughts and amateur enthusiasms, but he was also a mid-20th-century professional and policy expert, ensconced in some of his epoch's most bitter conflicts.
Like a relic from another era, Moynihan, for much of his public life, wrote long, substantive letters. These were neither gossipy notes nor dishy character sketches. Though a skilled writer, Moynihan didn't have a literary mind. He was in the Oval Office shortly after John F. Kennedy's assassination, and his description of the scene there was terse and uninformative. Instead, his letters recorded the evolving intellectual adventure of a restless mind. Moynihan explored the grand themes of history and tried to understand the times in the most ambitious of ways: the cultural implications of the shift from the industrial to the post-industrial society, the disaffection of the intellectual class, the foreign policy implications of ethnic tension in a post-Communist world.
Those letters have now been collected by a team led by Steven R. Weisman, once a colleague at The New York Times before he moved to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The letters make for absorbing reading because Moynihan's grand ideas were always driven by his own internal tensions. It was as if he were writing an intensely personal memoir but phrasing his discoveries in the language of Samuel Huntington.
Moynihan was born in 1927 and grew up poor. His father abandoned the family when the son was 10. ''Both my mother and father -- they let me down badly,'' he wrote later. ''The interesting thing is that I have almost no memory of Dad -- and no emotions -- on the other hand I find thru the years this enormous emotional attachment to Father substitutes.''
Moynihan became an adviser to a series of powerful elected leaders: Gov. Averell Harriman in New York, followed by Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. His official title in these administrations didn't matter much. He became the Big Thinker Without Portfolio, writing his bosses long, sweeping memos -- part flattery, part social science -- on the historical moment and their potential place in it.
During the Kennedy and Johnson years, university liberals were increasinly at odds with white ethnics, the cops and working-class populations in Chicago, Brooklyn and South Boston. Moynihan, the hybrid, had a foot in both camps. In books, in magazines and in policy papers, he addressed the educated class, but from his own hardscrabble Irish-American perspective. In 1965, for example, many well-educated reformers were optimistic about the war on poverty. Moynihan saw clouds looming: ''Negroes today are a grievously injured people who in fair and equal competition will by and large lose out,'' he wrote in a memo for Johnson.
The problems were caused not merely by white racism, he argued, but also weak family structure. ''Probably not much more than a third of Negro youth reach 18 having lived all their lives with both parents,'' Moynihan pointed out. ''The breakdown of the Negro family is the principal cause of all the problems of delinquency, crime, school dropouts, unemployment and poverty which are bankrupting our cities.''
Views like these -- expressed in the so-called Moynihan Report, a detailed analysis he prepared for Johnson in 1965 -- unleashed a wave of fury. Wounded by accusations that he was a racist despite his passionate interest in the dire costs of poverty and racial injustice, Moynihan was touched by the few liberals who stood up to defend him. No one ''has ever offered me more understanding when I so terribly needed to be understood,'' he wrote to the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, one of his champions,
Moynihan grew increasingly alarmed as he watched the Democratic Party become more defined by the salon liberalism of the Upper West Side. In the summer of 1968, he wrote a draft of a letter to Ted Kennedy, apparently never sent, in which he pleaded with Kennedy to stay true to the middle-class Irish his slain brother Robert seemed to have moved away from. The working class, he wrote, ''were Bob's people before he got religion, they have been abandoned, and our politics are very much the worst for it.''
Moynihan opposed the Vietnam War even while serving in administrations that waged it, but he became appalled by the effect late-'60s radicalism was having on the professoriate. ''The elite intelligentsia of the country are turning against the country -- in science, in politics, in the fundaments of patriotism. How can we not pay for this?'' he wrote in a memo to Richard Nixon in 1969.
When Moynihan returned to Harvard in 1971 he found pervasive intellectual decay. ''My impression of our graduating class this year was of persons who had apparently scarcely had an adult conversation in their full four years.''
The problem was that liberals were no longer willing to test their own assumptions. ''The liberal project began to fail when it began to lie,'' he remarked in 1991. When, for instance, the sociologist James Coleman wrote a tough-minded analysis on educational opportunity for The Public Interest, the policy journal Moynihan was closely identified with, the ''response was that said social scientists and their craven lackeys were objective right-wing deviationists.''
During the Nixon years, Moynihan was propelled by the tension between his academic side and his practical policy-maker side. His memos to Nixon were brilliant (he was always at his best in times of greatest flux, whether 1968 or 1989). Moreover, his relationship with Nixon was fascinating. He seemed to regard him as part fellow intellectual, part thug.
He urged Nixon to lead an administration of ''Tory men with Liberal principles'' -- a characteristically hybrid formulation, this time blending opposed ideologies. He asked Nixon to establish bold national minimum standards for welfare, so that every family would be guaranteed a base level of support. He deplored the rise of the New Left and the adversary culture of the intellectuals, and urged Nixon to meet and reconcile with moderate members of the peace movement: ''It would seem most important to de-escalate the rhetoric of crisis about the internal state of the society,'' he wrote at one point. ''Cease attacking,'' he pleaded, at another, to Vice President Spiro Agnew.
He also wrote a series of memos explaining why Vietnam was a domestic and foreign catastrophe. He became a strong internal critic of Agnew, and from his perch as ambassador to India, he was appalled by Watergate.
In May of 1973, he wrote a long, heartfelt letter to his Harvard colleague Nathan Glazer justifying his decision to get involved with the Nixon crowd in the first place. ''When a conservative government came in and seemed sensitive to the fooleries of its predecessors, we were too grateful by half, and altogether too willing to supply arguments. We were willing to be used.''
After Nixon, and after his ambassadorship, Moynihan was again betwixt and between. Saul Bellow, Edward Shils and others at the University of Chicago offered him the opportunity to become a full-time academic. He didn't think he was up to it. ''I am not their equal,'' Moynihan wrote in his journal (excerpts are included in this book). ''Were I to settle among them they would find it out, and while they would never in the least way suggest that they had come to realize this, I would know they had and that would make it a waste for everyone.''
In a letter to Jeane Kirkpatrick, he described his decision to run for the Senate, in 1976, in the most casual terms: ''The choice was between taking a nap and commencing a long, lovely summer or getting on the shuttle for New York and announcing for the Senate. It was, as the Duke said of the Battle of Waterloo, 'a damn close run thing.' By an internal vote of 51 to 49, I got on the shuttle.''
His letters while in the Senate are not so interesting as the preceding ones. He never really describes the culture of the Senate, the back and forth, the collision of personalities. He became much more self-referential, as senators do, and much more interested in defending his reputation.
He did, however, retain his enthusiasms. From first to last, Moynihan threw himself into causes. As a young man, he was fervent about traffic safety -- guiding a young Ralph Nader. All his life he was interested in the built environment, from creating a performing arts center in Washington to reviving Pennsylvania Avenue, one of his signature achievements.
In the Senate, he championed social security reform. He thought bullet control was more sensible than gun control. He wanted to eliminate the C.I.A. He fought with the Clintons over health care reform, and other things.
He put his hyper-intellectual cap back on in the late 1980s, with the fall of Communism. He had predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union as early as 1979 (all those years spent studying ethnic conflicts and failed economic development projects were not in vain). As the Berlin Wall came down, he began to rethink the world in the most sweeping terms. He decided that that moment was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to establish global rule of law. Needless to say, that project didn't come to anything. But his letters on the subject still make for fascinating reading.
This whole collection has been put together with superb care. While writing this review, I've been cursing Weisman's introduction for its mastery in highlighting all the crucial points about Moynihan's life. It is hard to write anything about this book that doesn't merely repeat that fine essay. Weisman has also written superb contextual paragraphs between the letters, so even people unfamiliar with Moynihan's career will be able to follow along easily.
Moynihan contained different tendencies that were often in tension with one another. This state of affairs energized him. It made him hard to classify and unfit for the partisan warfare he saw rising as his career came to its end.
He remains an exemplar for those who find that their lives and views don't fit neatly into a partisan camp, a guiding model for hybrids past and future.

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts, Obama Stumps

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
BOSTON -- President Obama sought to rally Massachusetts Democrats to help re-elect Gov. Deval Patrick, his close friend and political ally, whose 2006 campaign of ''hope'' and ''change'' presaged Mr. Obama's two years later, but who is struggling against voter anger in a weak economy.
Mr. Obama, speaking to about 8,000 people at the Hynes Convention Center here and more listening outside and in an overflow room, praised Mr. Patrick, the first African-American elected governor of Massachusetts, in ways that Mr. Obama often describes himself, calling him someone who ''represents the politics of conscience and conviction'' and who does what is right, not what is easy. 
But Mr. Patrick's accomplishments have been offset by stumbles and by the negative political winds that are buffeting Democrats nationwide, eroding his lead in the polls. A recent poll by Suffolk University/7 News showed that 46 percent of likely voters favored Mr. Patrick and 39 percent favored the Republican, Charles D. Baker, a former health insurance executive and state budget official.
A third candidate, Tim Cahill, the state treasurer who is a former Democrat running as an independent, received 10 percent in the poll. Mr. Cahill has lost ground since the Republican Governors Association began a negative ad campaign against him, fearing that he was getting support from conservative and independent voters that would otherwise go to Mr. Baker.
The loss of independents' backing has dragged down Mr. Patrick's popularity just as it has for Mr. Obama and Democrats nationwide. So Mr. Patrick is reliant on Democratic voters in a state where they outnumber Republican registrations by a three-to-one margin, but where independents are the majority.
To that end, Mr. Patrick brought in Mr. Obama -- who, like him, is a Harvard Law School graduate and a leader in the post-civil rights era of African-American politicians -- to fire up the faithful, many of whom were get-out-the-vote volunteers.
''Because Deval Patrick chose to lead in the toughest of times, this state will lead in the future, and that's why you've got to help him finish the work you all started in 2006,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's why you need him to help guard the change that you helped deliver in 2006 -- by giving Deval Patrick four more years.''
Mr. Obama was interrupted several times by protesters who held banners reading, ''Keep the Promise'' and ''Fight Global AIDS.'' His supporters sought to drown them out with chants of ''O-ba-ma,'' and Mr. Obama ad-libbed his own response with an addition to his stump-speech arguments against the dangers of electing Republicans.
''And if they win, they will cut AIDS funding right here in the United States of America,'' he said, shooting a look toward the hecklers. He added, ''We increased AIDS funding.''
Mr. Obama's remarks were a familiar recitation of Democratic achievements, which he said the party should be proud of, and Republican obstructionism, which he said was a tactic to gain advantage in the midterm elections. But at a fund-raiser later in West Newton, Mr. Obama added a new note to his complaint of Republicans' opposition: ''I don't anticipate that getting better next year. I anticipate that getting worse.''
Warming up the crowd before Mr. Obama's arrival, Representative Edward J. Markey, the senior Democrat in Massachusetts's Congressional delegation, lampooned Republicans' embrace of the Tea Party, saying it was more like an ''Alice in Wonderland'' tea party than a Boston Tea Party. ''And one thing they've got is plenty of mad hatters,'' he added.
Other speakers included Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator John Kerry and Mayor Thomas M. Menino. The musician James Taylor, a Massachusetts native, sang and played guitar, including a rendition of ''America the Beautiful'' -- but not before blaming Republicans for an ''unnecessary recession'' caused by their ''malfeasance and lack of leadership.''
Afterward, Mr. Obama went to the closed-door fund-raiser in West Newton at the home of Ralph de la Torre, the head of Caritas Christi, a network of Catholic hospitals. The event was expected to raise $900,000 for Democratic Senate candidates, a party official said.
According to the Boston Globe, Mr. de la Torre has been seeking state approval to sell six hospitals to a private equity firm, and state Republicans have made an issue of his support of Democratic state officials.

HEADLINE: Running Against Food Stamps

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
Jobless and hungry, Anthony Jedvabny stood in a charity grocery line in Philadelphia, shocked at how far he'd fallen from his well-paying career as a music producer. ''I never imagined this,'' he said, inching along North Sixth Street in a grateful crowd at a food center run by Philabundance. ''I'm down to basic survival,'' said Mr. Jedvabny -- a starkly human statistic in the news that Philadelphia's poverty rate has hit 25 percent, worst among the 10 largest cities in the nation. 
In the perverse ways of politics, Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, is advising his party's candidates to make a big issue of the fact that food stamp distribution has hit a historic high of more than 40 million Americans. ''It turns out that Barack Obama's idea of spreading the wealth around was spreading more food stamps around,'' said Mr. Gingrich in a supercynical stratagem that ignores the Republicans' central role in unleashing the recession and blocking programs that could speed a turnaround.
Democrats preoccupied with political survival have been nearly as hostile toward the food stamp program. Fecklessly invoking fiscal responsibility, the Democratic-controlled Congress voted to strip $11.9 billion in long-term food stamp financing in a Peter-to-Paul stunt to pay for emergency aid for state budgets. And the Senate has been aiming to cut another $2.2 billion in stamps to finance child nutrition reform.
Child nutrition is essential, but the legislation's title as the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act doesn't parse well in the face of parallel food stamp cuts. The administration has promised to seek a saner form of financing when the House takes up the measure after the election. Otherwise, the Congressional shell game could eventually cut $59 from a family of four's monthly stamp allowance, currently at $294.
Instead of playing politics, Philadelphia is confronting on-the-ground reality, fighting to get more food stamps to the poor. More than 427,000 residents -- a quarter of the city -- receive the stamps. But more than 150,000 other poor people need to apply, according to the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger, which has volunteers working the streets.
''Which future do I want?'' asks Mr. Gingrich, never at a loss for the simplistic. ''More food stamps? Or more paychecks?'' Unlike the upper-income tax cuts Republicans furiously protect, food stamps, minimalist as they are, are antirecession sparks that generate $9 in economic activity for every $5 spent, according to federal statistics. Everybody wants a paycheck, but people have to eat.

HEADLINE: Black Turnout Will Be Crucial For Democrats

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
LAURINBURG, N.C. -- A flood of black voters in North Carolina's Eighth Congressional District two years ago helped Barack Obama become the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry this state since Jimmy Carter and lifted the party's Congressional challenger, Larry Kissell, to victory.
Without Mr. Obama atop the ticket this year, Mr. Kissell and a number of other vulnerable Democrats, mostly in the rural South, face the challenge of reviving the spirit of 2008 for black voters without alienating right-leaning white majorities in their districts.
The candidates' ability to walk that line may decide whether Democrats maintain control of the House of Representatives, and could affect several Senate contests and governor's races.
The Democrats confront multiple obstacles, but also enjoy several advantages. 
Working against them: turnout for midterm elections is often a third lower than in presidential years; some African-Americans are disillusioned with the pace of economic recovery; and several Democratic incumbents, including Mr. Kissell, who is white, have angered black constituents by opposing Mr. Obama on major initiatives like the health care law.
In their favor: the Democratic National Committee plans to spend 10 times more than it did in 2006 to get out the black vote; the Tea Party movement and the questioning of Mr. Obama's religion and birthplace are motivating many black voters; and the Democrats are summoning them to defend the first black president from Republican assault.
''It very much is about having the president's back,'' said Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.
The campaign will provide a test of the maturation of the African-American electorate, which until 2008 had always voted at lower rates than whites in federal elections. The black turnout percentage that year exceeded white turnout by a fraction of 1 percentage point, according to the Census Bureau.
''It's really not black turnout that matters; it's the gap between black and white turnout,'' said David A. Bositis, who examines racial voting patterns for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. ''If there's not much gap, the Democrats will hang on to the House.''
Although polls show an erosion of white support for Mr. Obama, African-Americans have remained steadfast. Exit polls showed that 95 percent of black voters supported him in 2008, and a September survey by the Pew Research Center found that 88 percent approve of his performance, more than double the figure for whites.
But Democratic officials worry about a potential gap in interest between black and white voters.
''The Republicans have the advantage in enthusiasm, no doubt about that,'' said State Representative Garland E. Pierce, an African-American who is pastor of the Bright Hopewell Baptist Church here. ''People just feel like there's nothing they can do about it.''
Among the endangered Democrats counting on a substantial black turnout are Representatives Bobby Bright of Alabama, Allen Boyd of Florida, Sanford D. Bishop Jr. and Jim Marshall of Georgia, Frank Kratovil Jr. of Maryland, Travis W. Childers of Mississippi, Steve Driehaus and Betty Sutton of Ohio, John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Chet Edwards of Texas, and Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello of Virginia.
A large black turnout could influence races to fill open House seats in Arkansas, Delaware and Louisiana, as well as the New Orleans seat held by Representative Anh Cao, a Republican. It could also help Democratic prospects in statewide races in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri and Ohio.
But black leaders in those states say the sense of hope and history that drove turnout in 2008 seems in short supply. It has been difficult to sustain when black unemployment, at 16.1 percent, is nearly double that of whites.
''Many people have lost their jobs, they don't see the economy booming, and they feel there hasn't been much change,'' said State Senator Al Lawson Jr. of Florida, a black Democrat who narrowly lost a primary to Mr. Boyd. ''They've kind of given up on politics a little bit. They really don't see that their vote is going to make a difference in their lives.''
In one of this campaign's resonant moments, a black woman named Velma Hart told Mr. Obama at a town-hall-style meeting last month that she was exhausted from defending him and impatient for the change he had promised. Some African-Americans interviewed last week in the Eighth District, which stretches from Charlotte to Fayetteville, shared her view.
But many said that they, of all people, understood that change would not come overnight, given the depth of the problems. That only makes it more essential, they said, to return Democratic majorities to Congress that could buy Mr. Obama more time.
''I think people are beginning to see that all these expectations would not be out of line if the president were a magician,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, who as majority whip is the highest ranking African-American in the House. ''You lay a foundation and you build upon it.''
Mr. Obama has started to make that case directly to black-oriented media outlets and to party gatherings. At a Democratic rally in Philadelphia last Sunday, he emphasized that his election in 2008 ''was just the start of the journey'' and encouraged supporters to disprove those who predict a depressed vote.
''They think, oh, well, Obama's name is not on the ballot, maybe they're not going to turn out,'' he goaded. ''Look, everybody, I need you to understand, this election is a choice.''
Blacks cast a record 13 percent of the vote in 2008, up from 12 percent in 2004, according to exit polling. In the Eighth District, where blacks make up 30 percent of registered voters, the black share of the vote increased to 31 percent from 25 percent. The black turnout percentage exceeded white turnout in all 10 counties, and both Mr. Obama and Mr. Kissell won in a district that had twice been carried by President George W. Bush. Mr. Kissell ousted a five-term Republican.
The task of replicating that effort has been complicated by Mr. Kissell's vote against the health care overhaul, which many black constituents took as a betrayal. It earned him a primary challenge from a retired black educator who took 37 percent of the vote despite spending only $10,000.
Mr. Kissell, a former social studies teacher, explained his vote by saying he could not stomach the bill's Medicare cuts. But many blacks saw it as a purely political calculation intended to maintain viability with white conservatives.
J. E. Bazemore, the chairman of a black leadership committee in the district, said his members were so agitated last summer that he postponed a vote on endorsing Mr. Kissell. ''I knew what the vote would be,'' he said, ''and it was worse than I thought.''
After hearing from Mr. Kissell personally, the group endorsed him. He is running against Harold Johnson, a former sportscaster from Charlotte known to viewers as ''the Big Guy.''
''Really, the question is whether or not the black community feels it would be in their best interest to give Mr. Kissell a second chance,'' said Walter L. Rogers, a Laurinburg resident who heads a statewide black caucus.
Mr. Bazemore said his group's get-out-the-vote strategy would entail ''putting the emphasis on the president and not on the congressman.''
Last Monday, a day the Kissell campaign said would be devoted to black voter outreach, the candidate toured two community centers in black neighborhoods but did not invite questions. His campaign declined an interview request, and when he was approached after an appearance, he said he did not have time to talk and ducked into a waiting car.
A number of black leaders said they had made peace with the need to support Mr. Kissell in order to shield Mr. Obama.
''We know that politics has to be played,'' said JoAnn Jasper-Thomas, the mayor of Hoffman, a majority black town in the Sandhills region. ''In order for him to do 10 good things, he might have had to do that one that didn't sit well with the people.''
Although he had been in the vicinity, Mr. Kissell did not drop by a well-attended Democratic rally on Monday night in Laurinburg. Instead, he sent a black aide, Travis Manigan, to address the largely black crowd.
''Who says we're not fired up and ready to go?'' Mr. Manigan began. ''I'm here on behalf of Congressman Kissell, and I assume you are here because the hope and change that you voted for in 2008 didn't end in 2008. It's a work in progress. And you're here to make sure that you claim that progress, and that you see it to the promised land.''

HEADLINE: Gifts for the Broken-Hearted

BYLINE: By LEAH HANES. 
Leah Hanes lives in Jersey City and is working on a memoir.; E-mail: modernlove@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Obama volunteer coordinator assigned to find me a canvassing partner walked me toward a busload of elderly people. She must have noticed my dismay, because suddenly she veered left toward a smaller group of mostly male twentysomethings from Brooklyn. The day began looking up.
I'd hit bottom weeks earlier, just as the Alaska governor came on the national election scene. The positive momentum from my summer Himalaya trek had faded, along with all interest in a job search; I was in no condition to interview for -- let alone start -- a new job. I finally copped to depression.
It was all too much; I felt I'd lost everything. The shock of my only child's sudden death 19 months earlier at age 6 had worn off, the distractions I'd used to keep the full horror at bay finally gone. And while the losses that followed -- my 17-year marriage, our ''dream house,'' my job, several friends -- were comparatively minor, collectively it was devastating. Our two cats must have agreed, as they both died, too.
I weighed the options: Succumb to despair, or pick myself up and deal. I decided to make Prozac's acquaintance and get on with it. 
And thus found myself -- a 41-year-old childless mother and unemployed marketing executive -- at the Obama volunteer center in Allentown, Pa., in late September, paired with blue-eyed, 28-year-old Manuel. He had a shaved head, wrestler's build, a California surfer vibe and a peanut butter sandwich he tried to shove into his back pocket as we set out.
Amused, I said, ''Give me that,'' and placed it in my handbag.
Canvassing proved both inspiring and tedious. With Manuel, though, I almost felt normal. He asked questions I surprised myself by answering. Refreshingly, he was neither horrified nor struck speechless by my loss.
Later, as his crew was leaving, we made noise about getting together in the city sometime. As is the way, we connected on Facebook.
In the following weeks I obsessively followed the election, my own heart's need for hope tied to the outcome. I looked for Manuel in Allentown on Election Day, where I'd returned to help get out the vote, but he was in California, and we shared an electronic high-five.
We finally made plans to meet for dinner in early December. Given my age, I wasn't sure if he saw this as a date. Nevertheless, I was ready. Beyond careful grooming, a discreetly packed contact lens case and condoms, I'd told my housemate I might not be home.
Manuel came zipping down the street on his bike a few minutes late, and we awkwardly hugged. His head was still shaved, but he'd grown a goatee. He was adorable.
Dinner, however, was a bust. I hated the food, and his surfer vibe had me wondering if he was stoned (he wasn't). Sensing the direction of things, he suddenly turned -- ''Hey, you heard of Rao's?''
The legendary, impossible-to-get-into Italian restaurant in East Harlem? ''Yes.''
''I hear you can just walk in, sit at the bar, have a drink. Want to go?''
I was intrigued but began losing my nerve when we arrived, put off by the black cars idling outside. It was a club. We weren't members. Manuel leaned in -- ''It's just like knocking on doors in Allentown. Come on -- yes we can!''
And we did. Sometime during our second round, I thought how nice it would be to touch him, when suddenly my arm was on top of his. Shocked at myself, I leaned forward to apologize when he kissed me -- and didn't stop until the bouncer hissed, ''Hey, knock it off!''
Startled, we paid and left.
By midnight, we'd already spent an hour canoodling in the dark corner of a salsa bar, and another hour rolling around half-naked on his building's roof, Metro-North trains rumbling a few blocks away. I had no idea if I'd ever see him again, and inhaled every minute of the most uninhibited fun I'd had in years.
When we finally reached his apartment, I realized what I'd missed by marrying at 23. His bedroom was one of those only-in-New-York creations carved out of the living room -- no windows, walls that didn't reach the ceiling. Looking for a safe space to lay my pearl necklace and earrings, I knew I was a long way from my former five-bedroom colonial in the suburbs.
The morning was only slightly awkward. We were both exhausted and hung over, and he was kind enough to let me sleep while he went to work. Emerging from the Harlem town house into the bright sunshine later that morning, passing the neighborhood guys on the stoop, I felt every bit the lioness returning victorious from the hunt as I lazily made my way back to New Jersey.
By then I'd decided that taking care of myself and finding a way to live with my child's death had become my full-time job: therapy, yoga, meditation and Prozac were the tools of the trade. Manuel was a different modality entirely. I must have done something for him too -- he asked me out again.
We settled into a routine, getting together about every two weeks. We told each other it wasn't serious or exclusive, so we didn't talk or e-mail much in-between. But together, we made up for lost time. I surprised him on our second date with scarves and honey; my 42nd birthday included live jazz, drag queens, a demonstration of his rapping skills in the middle of Houston Street, and some late-night, creative role play. It was my best birthday ever.
In late January, the night before the second anniversary of my son's death, he lighted candles and invited me to say whatever needed saying. He understood loss; his mother had died when he was 14 months old. No one had ever opened himself up in quite this way to hearing my pain. It was one of his greatest gifts.
My heart broke more cruelly and deeply than I thought possible the day my son died. I worried that maybe I shouldn't be playing this game with a heart that would never quite heal. But this I now know: People we love come, and they frequently go. What matters is staying open: to possibility, to connection, to hope.
I didn't think I was risking much. I knew he was casually dating, and theoretically I was, too. But being with him brought me so much joy, and online dating was such a drag, that I put little effort into looking elsewhere.
Two months in I felt a shift -- he was less open. A month later, when he told me he'd slept with someone else, I went cold. He said he still wanted to see me but couldn't be monogamous. I struggled, intellect versus emotion. Did I want to marry him? No. So who cares? But I did. And in the morning I broke it off.
For only the first time. Over the next year we moved in and out of each other's lives and beds, renegotiating terms to work for a late-20s guy in an ''exploratory'' phase and fortysomething, monogamously inclined me.
This past Valentine's Day we went away, both of us acknowledging the danger and mixed signals of a country B & B, whirlpool tub and Champagne in bed. We'd slowed down -- our connection had mellowed, deepened. He hadn't promised not to date others, but he wasn't. A few days later, I caught myself thinking I wanted my family to meet him.
Damn. I'd fallen in love.
And took the chance. I told him I was open to bridging the age gap, seeing if we could work. It'd be challenging, but I had feelings for him and finally decided I was game.
But he wasn't. I know my age was a factor, which hurt, but you can't talk someone into wanting to be with you. When I ended it again, to save my heart, it was his turn to be surprised by the depth of his feelings -- he'd also gotten more attached than intended, though not enough to change his mind.
My son's friends are 10 now. A day rarely passes when I don't feel the pain of a child who will always be 6, of motherhood in the past, of bedtime stories read by another while I worked late. No more time, no second chances. I'm still working through my losses, even in my dreams. Almost four years later, I know the pain doesn't get better. I just learn, day by day, year by year, to live with it.
A month after our Valentine's breakup, 18 months after knocking on Allentown's doors, Manuel announced he was moving west for school. Knowing he'd soon be out of temptation's way, I reignited our ''thing.'' This time, no regrets.
Maybe because we knew the outcome, knew we'd be re-dressing our wounds one last time, we finally let down our guard. I told him I loved him. He admitted he loved me, too.
And then I let him go.
Once he left I realized the other gift he'd given me -- even in my sorrow, I still had the hope he'd helped me find.

LENGTH: 476 words

 BODY:
THE NEWS The Obama administration lifted its moratorium on deepwater oil and gas drilling, imposed after a blown-out BP well spilled millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico in the spring and summer. 
BEHIND THE NEWS The ban was set to expire Nov. 30, but the administration was under heavy pressure to relax it early because of the economic harm done by idling drill rigs and crews. It will still be weeks before deepwater drilling can resume, though, because rig operators must reapply for drilling permits under newly toughened safety and environmental rules.
THE NEWS A federal judge ordered the United States military to stop enforcing the ''don't ask, don't tell'' law, which bans openly gay men and women from serving.
BEHIND THE NEWS The judge, who declared the ban unconstitutional in September, rejected a government proposal to limit the reach of her decision to the members of the group who sued to overturn the ban. The Obama administration wants Congress to drop ''don't ask, don't tell.'' But officials said the order would disrupt efforts for a more orderly repeal of the policy and sought to block its enforcement.
THE NEWS The Georgia Board of Regents voted to ban illegal immigrants from attending the state's five most selective public colleges, starting in the fall of 2011.
BEHIND THE NEWS Lawmakers across the country, faced with mounting public anger over illegal immigration, are grappling with the question of whether illegal immigrants who attend American high schools should be allowed to go on to public colleges, and once there, get the tuition discounts meant for state residents. Immigrant rights groups said they would challenge the Georgia ban in court.
THE NEWSBisphenol A, a compound used to make plastics and epoxy resins, was formally declared to be a toxic substance by the Canadian government, making it much easier to ban its use.
BEHIND THE NEWS Environmentalists, medical doctors and the plastics industry have been arguing for decades over whether the bisphenol A that leaks into food products from plastic containers is a health threat. Studies have found that it imitates estrogen in lab animals; nearly everyone in the United States has some in his or her body. Several states and the European Union restrict its use in food containers.
THE NEWS A decades-old regulation in Indonesia giving the attorney general the power to ban books unilaterally was struck down by the country's constitutional court.
BEHIND THE NEWS Hundreds of books have been banned, ostensibly for being offensive or a threat to public order, but in fact often to silence dissent. Since the regulation was imposed by the Suharto dictatorship, the country has become more democratic. But the court did not object to book banning, only to who was doing it: The ruling said the power should rest with the judiciary, not the executive branch.

HEADLINE: The 19 Senate Races in Play

 BODY:
These races will make or break the current Democratic majority in the Senate.
Leaning Democratic
Calif Barbara Boxer
Carly Fiorina
The three-term incumbent, while somewhat unpopular, has held a lead in the polls. Her
multimillionaire rival is conservative on big issues in a decidedly Democratic state. The
San Francisco Chronicle said the choice was ''dismal.'' 
Conn. Richard Blumenthal
Linda McMahon
With a surge of support from female voters, Mr. Blumenthal remains the man to beat.
Yet the wrestling tycoon has already spent at least $21 million to win the race.
Del. Christopher Coons
Christine O'Donnell
Mr. Coons was once considered a long shot for the seat once held by Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr., when Mr. Biden's son toyed with running. But Mr. Coons has led in the polls against the Tea Party's star, known for her comments on evolution and masturbation.
Tossup
Colo. Michael Bennet
Ken Buck
This race has long been seen as competitive, and more than $16 million has been spent by outsiders to influence the outcome. Republicans see the two-year incumbentas vulnerable. Attack ads show Mr. Bennet hugging President Obama.
Ill Alexi Giannoulias
Mark Steven Kirk
This race has long been seen as competitive, and more than $16 million has been
spent by outsiders to influence the outcome. Republicans see the two-year incumbent
as vulnerable. Attack ads show Mr. Bennet hugging President Obama.
Mo. Robin Carnahan
Roy Blunt
The candidates are in a tight race for the seat vacated by Mr. Obama. Mr. Giannoulias
has called his opponent a liar. His rival countered, ''Alexi's truth hurts your wallet.''
Nev. Harry Reid
Sharron Angle
The tight race between the Washington insider and a Tea Party hero may well be the most
closely watched. Ms. Angle says he is a career politician. Mr. Reid pins her as ''extreme.''
Pa. Joe Sestak
Pat Toomey
Mr. Sestak's surprise primary victory over Senator Arlen Specter gave him momentum, but his Tea Party-backed opponent has led in the polls. Outsiders have spent $10 million.
Wash. Patty Murray
Dino Rossi
Images of Ms. Murray standing with Mr. Reid have helped energize Republicans. Mr.
Rossi, who twice lost bids for governor, portrays himself as an outsider.
W.Va . Joe Manchin III
John Raese
These opponents are closer in their politics than other Senate rivals. In an ad, Mr. Manchin fires a rifle at the cap-and-trade bill and says he will repeal parts of ''Obamacare.''
Wis Russ Feingold
Ron Johnson
The incumbent has been on the ballot in Wisconsin for the last 28 years. The newcomer
Republican says his experience as a businessman will be an asset to fixing the economy.
Leaning Republican
Alaska
Scott McAdams
Joe Miller
Lisa Murkowski
Mr. Miller, a Tea Party favorite, won the support of the Republican establishment after
defeating the incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, in the primary. But Ms. Murkowski hopes to win as a write-in candidate, a feat only two others have accomplished in the Senate's history.
Ark.
Blanche Lincoln
John Boozman
This seat, which has been held by Democrats for more than a century, is vulnerable. Mr.
Boozman has a healthy lead and the strong support of Washington Republicans.
Fla.
Kendrick B. Meek
Marco Rubio
Charlie Crist
Mr. Rubio has long led the polls against Mr. Meek and the Republican-turned-
independent governor. Mr. Rubio helped oust Mr. Crist from the Republican primary by
campaigning with an image of the governor hugging Mr. Obama.
Ind.
Brad Ellsworth
Daniel R. Coats
Although Mr. Coats is leading, Democrats hope to capitalize on the former senator's
recent employment as a Washington lobbyist.
Ky.
Jack Conway
Rand Paul
Mr. Paul's ''randslide'' primary victory was the Tea Party's first big success on the national stage. Yet the doctor has distanced himself from the group, perhaps to maintain his lead.
La.
Charlie Melancon
David Vitter
Attacks have been heated. Mr. Melancon recounted Mr. Vitter's involvement in a
prostitution scandal. Mr. Vitter criticizes his rival's record in an ad that some called racist.
N.H.
Paul W. Hodes
Kelly Ayotte
Both candidates are running on fiscal responsibility. But Ms. Ayotte says her opponent is
misleading voters, and Mr. Hodes says his rival has ''no record'' of cutting spending.
Ohio
Lee Fisher
Rob Portman
Mr. Portman plans to keep this seat in Republican hands. But he has been challenged
about his time as chief budget officer and trade negotiator for President George W. Bush.

HEADLINE: WHAT DOES HE DO NOW?

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER. 
Peter Baker is a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On a busy afternoon in the West Wing late last month, President Barack Obama seemed relaxed and unhurried as he sat down in a newly reupholstered brown leather chair in the Oval Office. He had just returned from the East Room, where he signed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 -- using eight pens so he could give away as many as possible. The act will be his administration's last piece of significant economic legislation before voters deliver their verdict on his first two years in office. For all intents and purposes, the first chapter of Obama's presidency has ended. On Election Day, the next chapter will begin. 
As he welcomed me, I told him I liked what he had done with the place. Gone was George W. Bush's yellow sunburst carpet (it says ''optimistic person,'' Bush would tell practically anyone who visited), and in its place was a much-derided earth-tone rug with inspirational quotations. The curved walls now had striped tan wallpaper, and the coffee table had been replaced by a walnut-and-mica table that, Obama noted, would resist stains from water glasses. The bust of Winston Churchill was replaced by one of Martin Luther King Jr. The couches were new. He told me he was happy with the redecorating of the office. ''I know Arianna doesn't like it,'' he said lightly. ''But I like taupe.''
If there was something incongruous about the president of the United States checking out reviews of his decor by Arianna Huffington, well, let's face it, he has endured worse reviews lately. The president who muscled through Congress perhaps the most ambitious domestic agenda in a generation finds himself vilified by the right, castigated by the left and abandoned by the middle. He heads into the final stretch of the midterm campaign season facing likely repudiation, with voters preparing to give him a Congress that, even if Democrats maintain control, will almost certainly be less friendly to the president than the one he has spent the last two years mud wrestling.
While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong -- and what he needs to do to change course for the next two years. He has spent what one aide called ''a lot of time talking about Obama 2.0'' with his new interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and his deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. During our hour together, Obama told me he had no regrets about the broad direction of his presidency. But he did identify what he called ''tactical lessons.'' He let himself look too much like ''the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.'' He realized too late that ''there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects'' when it comes to public works. Perhaps he should not have proposed tax breaks as part of his stimulus and instead ''let the Republicans insist on the tax cuts'' so it could be seen as a bipartisan compromise.
Most of all, he has learned that, for all his anti-Washington rhetoric, he has to play by Washington rules if he wants to win in Washington. It is not enough to be supremely sure that he is right if no one else agrees with him. ''Given how much stuff was coming at us,'' Obama told me, ''we probably spent much more time trying to get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration -- and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top -- that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.''
That presumes that what he did was the right thing, a matter of considerable debate. The left thinks he did too little; the right too much. But what is striking about Obama's self-diagnosis is that by his own rendering, the figure of inspiration from 2008 neglected the inspiration after his election. He didn't stay connected to the people who put him in office in the first place. Instead, he simultaneously disappointed those who considered him the embodiment of a new progressive movement and those who expected him to reach across the aisle to usher in a postpartisan age. On the campaign trail lately, Obama has been confronted by disillusionment -- the woman who was ''exhausted'' defending him, the mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking for work. Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued ''Hope'' poster, says he's losing hope.
Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008, he told an admiring crowd that someday ''we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth.''
I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying governance. ''It sounds ambitious,'' he agreed. ''But you know what? We've made progress on each of those fronts.'' He quoted Mario Cuomo's line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. ''But the prose and the poetry match up,'' he said. ''It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama didn't do what he's promised. I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. But I keep a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we talked about during the campaign. And I hope as long as I'm president, I've got a chance to work on the other 30 percent.''
But save the planet? If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save the planet? He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. ''I make no apologies for having set high expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations,'' he said. ''Now, the one thing that I will say -- which I anticipated and can be tough -- is the fact that in a big, messy democracy like this, everything takes time. And we're not a culture that's built on patience.''
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, ''The Clinton Tapes,'' Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his presidency. ''I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,'' Obama told me, ''and was reminded that in '94 -- when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up being bad for Democrats -- unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or didn't show empathy.''
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say. When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. ''There is an anti-establishment mood,'' Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. ''We just happen to be here when the music is stopping.''
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two dozen of his advisers -- some of whom spoke with permission, others without -- hoping to understand how the situation looks to them. The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the worst problems of any president in years. Or in generations. Or in American history. He prevented another Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. But it required him to do unpopular things that would inevitably cost him.
''He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic,'' Pete Rouse told me. Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign, said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the severity of his challenges. ''I told him at some point that at the end of '10, his approval rating could be low- to mid-30s,'' Plouffe told me.
Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. Many officials worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. They talk about whether it is time to move on. While not in the 30s, Obama's approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office -- just a point above where Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. Joel Benenson, Obama's pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent, the president's popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American life. ''We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution,'' he said, ''and President Obama still stands above that.'' Obama's team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises he laid out as pillars of his ''new foundation'' in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University -- health care, education reform and financial reregulation. And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while escalating the war in Afghanistan. ''History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,'' Rouse says.
But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. In their darkest moments, White House aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he signs. Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another Abraham Lincoln after all. In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern president is going to be, at best, average.
''We're all a lot more cynical now,'' one aide told me. The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White House aides do that with exuberance. But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. ''It's not that we believed our own press or press releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington,'' another White House official told me. '' 'Arrogance' isn't the right word, but we were overconfident.''
The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. While Republican leaders resolved to stand against Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. ''If anybody thought the Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken,'' former Senator Tom Daschle, a mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. ''I'm not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind of hoped the Republicans would go away. And obviously they didn't do that.''
Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama's ally from Illinois, said the Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. ''I think his fate was sealed,'' Durbin said. ''Once the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged it out for a longer period of time. The American people have a limited attention span. Once you convince them there's a problem, they want a solution.''
Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being more nimble in the face of opposition. ''B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments,'' he told me, ''and a D-plus or C-minus on communication.'' The health care legislation is ''an incredible achievement'' and the stimulus program was ''absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful,'' in Rendell's judgment, yet Obama allowed them to be tarnished by critics. ''They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they lost it early,'' said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. ''We didn't use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle.''
That's a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it's a communication problem. The first refuge of any politician in trouble is that it's a communication problem, not a policy problem. If only I explained what I was doing better, the people would be more supportive. Which roughly translates to If only you people paid attention, you wouldn't be kicking me upside the head.Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. ''I haven't been at a policy-problem meeting in 20 months,'' he noted.
The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory -- he is a liberal zealot, in the view of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush's unrelenting antiterror tactics at the expense of civil liberties.
''When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American people in our governing institutions,'' says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who voted for Obama in 2008. ''What we now know is that that did not work. If anything, people are even more dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. So to that extent, the transformational side has not worked. And frankly I would settle these days -- forget about transformational, how about a transactional president, somebody people could do business with? It seems there's an ideological rigidity that the American people did not sense.''
The other side would like more ideological rigidity. Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has ''totally blown this great opportunity'' to reinvent America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. Other liberals feel the same way about gays in the military or the prison at Guantanamo Bay. ''It's been so reflexive since he was elected, to just give ground and give ground,'' Solomon told me. ''If we don't call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word, he just seems to be backpedaling.'' Solomon added: ''It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. People just feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he's behaved in office.''
Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. At a Labor Day event in Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. ''They're not always happy with me,'' he told supporters. ''They talk about me like a dog -- that's not in my prepared remarks, but it's true.''
The friendly fire may bother him even more. ''Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,'' Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. ''If we get an historic health care bill passed -- oh, well, the public option wasn't there. If you get the financial reform bill passed -- then, well, I don't know about this particular derivatives rule, I'm not sure that I'm satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven't yet brought about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker.''
Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. As he pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: ''It took time to free the slaves. It took time for women to get the vote. It took time for workers to get the right to organize.''
One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama's administration, the president and his top aides gathered for their morning meeting in the Oval Office. As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. ''The number of people who don't pay their taxes,'' he answered sardonically.
From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern -- not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. Obama trusted his judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense of integrity -- and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him.
Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. While Obama was a senator when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. ''The story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington, gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was,'' a senior aide told me. ''Here's a guy who ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were going to have to work with Washington to fix that.''
Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. When he emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. ''He's still never gotten comfortable here,'' a top White House official told me. He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, calls ''the inevitable theatrics of Washington.''
But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly. His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no matter that it was paid for by private funds. On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and one day he showed up wearing one. Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren't sure he's Christian; sure enough, a few weeks later, he attended services at St. John's Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow.
Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. He seemed to believe he could overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world's most recalcitrant figures -- whether they be the mullahs in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to meet in his first year with some of America's enemies ''without precondition'' has met with none of them. And the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often.
He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. During the health care debate, Obama had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old business as usual. ''Perhaps we were naive,'' Axelrod told me. ''First, he's always had good relations across party lines. And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other side of the aisle to help deal with it. I don't think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we confronted.'' Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. ''Part of what they were doing was not just making us grind it out,'' he told me. ''They were souring the country on the mood of the country.''
Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall Street special interests. At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes.
Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from the outside. As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had become. ''I'd thought it was an 8, but it's more like a 10,'' he told me. ''And rather than wasting time debating whether it's legitimate,'' he added, referring to his former colleagues, ''the key is to recognize that it's affecting what they do.''
Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be draining. He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group settings can be harder for him. Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East Room event so he can gather his energy again. Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. That's what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. When Obama addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. He is not much for chitchat. When he and I sat down, he started our session matter-of-factly: ''All right,'' he said, ''fire away.''
By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. ''Zen'' is the word commonly used in the West Wing. That's not to say he never loses his temper. He has been known to snap at aides when he feels overscheduled. He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy ''I've already read that.'' He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. He was subdued during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an urban guy. He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. ''Come on, man, you've got to make that shot,'' he chides aides who play with him.
The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. ''He'll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I've noticed he's gotten a little grayer,'' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. ''These kinds of decisions do that to people.'' But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. ''We usually will talk about writing the condolence letters,'' Gates added. ''But other than that, we don't dwell on it.'' If anything, Obama more often than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big.
While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as a handful of personal friends. ''He's opaque even to us,'' an aide told me. ''Except maybe for a few people in the inner circle, he's a closed book.'' In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address. On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. (When I asked if he had an iPad, Obama said, ''I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place.'')
Jarrett attributes Obama's equilibrium to his upbringing. ''He's really different,'' she told me. ''It's rooted in his sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community organizer.'' As Gibbs put it: ''He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. It's not to say that he's immune from criticism. But he can categorize in his head the difference between what's a setback, what's a bump along the way and what's just noise.''
There is certainly no shortage of noise. But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his old spirit again. He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. ''That's the happiest I've seen him in a long time,'' an aide said. After one, Obama told the aide, ''This reminds me of Iowa on the bus.''
Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. After all, those were the romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear up over the promise of what will be. But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories really are. ''The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake, that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step,'' he told me. ''And somehow now, as president, things are messy and they don't always work as planned and people are mad at us. That's not how I look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. And it was just as messy and just as difficult. And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren't going to win. And we're going through that same period here.''
In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different circumstances -- Clinton's impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House intern, Bush's drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama's struggle to turn around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are starkly variable crises, but some dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it's almost always a mixture of both; they acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.
Talking with Obama and his aides, it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections, Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, ''They're not serious.'' In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase ''they're not serious'' four times in referring to Republican budget plans.
That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside, Obama at times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush, once he has made a decision, Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency, until they wore it comfortably.
As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win re-election, the lessons differ. In Reagan's case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.
Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors, particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. ''He's no Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle,'' says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich adviser. ''I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism.'' Ken Duberstein likewise doubts Obama's capacity for adjustment. ''They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing,'' he said.
Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later, Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before losing to Clinton in 1992.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months. (Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)
As the first African-American president, Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. ''History never precisely repeats itself,'' Obama told me. ''But there is a pattern in American presidencies -- at least modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially, having been beaten, says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington. People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say, This is the same old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit.''
To better understand history, and his role in it, Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about, among other things, the Tea Party movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Populists in the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. ''He listened,'' the historian H. W. Brands told me. ''What he concluded, I don't know.''
Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that ''Washington is even more broken than we thought,'' as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change the dynamics of governance. ''One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for him with the American people,'' the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. ''He's so good in front of an audience, and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras doesn't really do that.''
As we talked in the Oval Office, Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives, necessary as they may have been, wore on the public. ''That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people,'' he told me. ''They started feeling like: Gosh, here we are tightening our belts, we're cutting out restaurants, we're cutting out our gym membership, in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.
''And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway, which was Obama is not a different kind of Democrat -- he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.''
Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. ''The seeds of his political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps,'' he said. White House officials largely agree they should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never come. ''It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do, to be legislator in chief,'' a top adviser told me. ''It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy.'' Plouffe agreed that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. ''When you swim in those waters, you're going to be affected by that,'' he said. ''I do think he's paid a political price, somewhat, for having to be tied to Congress.''
Still, for all the second-guessing, what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic elements of the program -- Obama aides, liberal and moderate alike, reject complaints from the right that the stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much, as well as complaints from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care option. ''We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with,'' Larry Summers, the outgoing national economics adviser, told me. ''But we fought as hard as we could, and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going to give us at that time.''
And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. ''There's all this talk in this town -- if we had done energy before health care, if we had focused more on small business, if we had done an Oval on the economy instead of Iraq, we would be doing better,'' Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, says. ''I don't believe that. We could always do things differently, and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't know they'd change the overall trend.''
Melody Barnes, the president's domestic-policy adviser, says the biggest problem was that after eight years of Bush, Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. ''The pent-up demand across every issue area -- around science, around education, around health care, immigration, you name it -- there was a lot of desire to finally get these things done,'' she told me. ''Every segment of the population had something that was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line.''
Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's problem is that he is not insecure -- he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time, frenetically wooing lawmakers, power brokers, adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.
Instead, what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is ''not on the level.'' That's a phrase commonly used around the West Wing -- ''it's not on the level.'' By that, they mean the Republicans, the news media, the lobbyists, the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge, as they see it, is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time, as Emanuel told me, ''We have to play the game.''
As Brands, the historian, put it, ''It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective.''
''I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president.'' So Obama told Diane Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point, just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy, costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.
It's a good line, but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third, it starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).
But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political danger, back on the table. ''If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff,'' he told me, ''the answer is no.''
Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about 2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palin will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today, some in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor.
With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among those who wanted to leave -- for years, he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to Obama. Indeed, when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year, Messina bet him $400 that he would not. ''We'll see what happens,'' Rouse told me when I asked about the bet last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job, running Obama's presidential library.
Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a new national-security adviser, among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.
''There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative,'' said one aide familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his advisers. ''He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction,'' the aide said. ''He doesn't like confrontation.'' But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more continuity than change.
Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly even producing scaled-back energy legislation. ''You'll hear more about exports and less about public spending,'' a senior White House official said. ''You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government as a hirer.''
Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm elections. ''It may be that regardless of what happens after this election, they feel more responsible,'' he said, ''either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated, and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them, or they did reasonably well, in which case the American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way.''
I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart, but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself in a young, substantive policy thinker.
Even if such an alliance emerges, though, the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in his first two years -- and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. ''Even if I had the exact same Congress, even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House, I think the rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years,'' Obama told me. ''There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended.''
As a senior adviser put it, ''There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless there's some sort of crisis.'' Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. ''It's fair to assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years,'' Plouffe told me. ''His view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners.'' Before he left, Emanuel told me: ''I'm not of the view that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda.''
But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative, say some advisers. ''It will have to be limited and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people,'' Dick Durbin told me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. ''The lessons of the last two years are going to be critical,'' he told me. ''The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive.''
Rendell thinks otherwise. ''Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to cooperate,'' he advised. ''Do what you have to do. Fight back.'' At the same time, he said, stop moaning about what he inherited: ''After the election, I'd say no more pointing back, no more blaming the Bush administration. It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it, it sounds like a broken record. And after two years, you own it.''
Obama will own it for another two years, or six if he can find his way forward. As an author, Obama appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist, really? At bottom, this president is still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign, he sold himself -- or the idea of himself -- more than any particular policy, and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was, as he said at the time, the ultimate Rorschach test.
Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes, he further defines himself for better or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia, ''I start slow, but I finish strong.''
He will have to, if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths VIESER, RICHARD WILLIAM

 BODY:
VIESER--Richard William, 82, passed away peacefully on October 14th. Mr. Vieser was an esteemed corporate leader who achieved a national reputation for success in rebuilding, managing and transforming a wide range of businesses in the electronics, defense, oil and gas, automotive and medical fields. A native of New Jersey, he was among the pioneers of the leveraged buyout industry having worked with both Forstmann Little & Co and Hicks Muse before retiring in 1989. After retirement, Mr. Vieser maintained an active presence in business by serving on the boards of some twenty organizations, including prominent firms such as Varian Medical, where he served as Chairman, Fisher Scientific, Dresser Industries, Control Data Corporation, Ceridian and Viasystems. Mr. Vieser was a generous and loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. 
He is survived by his beloved wife of fifty-nine years, Lois (Johnson) and five adoring children, Richard (and Patricia) of Bernardsville, NJ, Cheryl (Vieser) Kleckner of Alpharetta, GA, Cynthia (Vieser) and Joseph Falco of Madison, NJ, William John David of Madison, NJ and Jaime (and Melinda) of London, UK. He also leaves behind a wide circle of family and friends, including his nine beloved grandchildren, Donald, Francecsa, David, Joseph, Anne, Katherine, Alexandra, Bella and his namesake, Richard William. Born in the Vailsburg section of Newark, New Jersey, on November 14, 1927, Mr. Vieser spent his formative years in South Orange, New Jersey, where he graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood. He was a member of a state championship baseball team in high school and active in scouting where he attained the distinction of Eagle Scout at the age of 15. After a year at Lafayette College, Mr. Vieser entered the U.S. Army in September 1946. He served sixteen months in Korea as a member of the Army of Occupation and was discharged in April 1948. Being a proud American with unwavering patriotism, he felt these years were some of the most formative of his life. Mr. Vieser re-entered Lafayette, where he was a member of Theta Delta Chi Fraternity, serving as its President in his senior year. His business career began as a trainee at AT&T headquarters in New York City. Mr. Vieser later joined Chatham Electronics Corporation where he oversaw construction of a new factory in Livingston, New Jersey that manufactured highly specialized electron tubes used in the DEW line and other early missile warning systems across Canada and the Arctic. Mr. Vieser went on to hold major executive positions, as Chatham Electronics was part of a series of corporate acquisitions and mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, involving such major and well-known businesses as Tung Sol Electric, Wagner Electric, Studebaker and Worthington Pump Company - ultimately leading to the formation of Studebaker-Worthington. Throughout the series of corporate changes, he continued his rapid rise in leadership positions. Mr. Vieser served as Executive Vice President of StudebakerWorthington and ultimately as Chief Operating Officer. After McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington in 1979, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later President and Chief Operating Officer of McGraw-Edison. When McGraw-Edison was acquired by Cooper Industries, Mr. Vieser was invited to join Forstmann Little & Co. While there, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of three Forstmann Little companies, Lear Siegler Corporation, FL Industries and Midland-Ross Corporation. He also served as Chairman of the National Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, where he hosted numerous foreign trade missions at the request of the U.S. State Department and received honors from the states of New Jersey, Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi. Mr. Vieser was an avid historian and voracious reader, with a profound love for music, art and travel. He was greatly involved in historical preservation and philanthropy. Mr. Vieser was a member of the President's Council of Colonial Williamsburg and a Trustee of Winterthur Museum. Mr. Vieser was an avid golfer and a member of several golf clubs, including famed courses such as Baltusrol, Pine Valley, and Morris County in New Jersey and Ocean Forest and Sea Island in Georgia. Mr. Vieser was devoted to his family and his friends. His enormous spirit, sense of humor, kindness and love for life inspired all those who knew him. He believed life was something to be celebrated. His greatest joy was to be with his family and friends around the dinner table. He especially treasured spending time with his family at his farm in New Hampshire in front of a roaring fire or enjoying a beautiful sunset. His infectious laugh, heart-warming smile, generous heart and beautiful spirit will never leave us. Relatives and friends are invited to call Monday, October 18, 2-4 and 7-9pm at the William R. Dangler Funeral Home, 309 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ (908-273-2323). Funeral Services will be on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 10am at Calvary Episcopal Church, Summit.

HEADLINE: Banks Shared Clients' Profits, But Not Losses

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase & Company has a proposition for the mutual funds and pension funds that oversee many Americans' savings: Heads, we win together. Tails, you lose -- alone.
Here is the deal: Funds lend some of their stocks and bonds to Wall Street, in return for cash that banks like JPMorgan then invest. If the trades do well, the bank takes a cut of the profits. If the trades do poorly, the funds absorb all of the losses.
The strategy is called securities lending, a practice that is thriving even though some investments linked to it were virtually wiped out during the financial panic of 2008. These trades were supposed to be safe enough to make a little extra money at little risk.
JPMorgan customers, including public or corporate pension funds of I.B.M., New York State and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, ended up owing JPMorgan more than $500 million to cover the losses. But JPMorgan protected itself on some of these investments and kept millions of dollars in profit, before the trades went awry. 
How JPMorgan won while its customers lost provides a glimpse into the ways Wall Street banks can, and often do, gain advantages over their customers. Today's giant banks not only create and sell investment products, but also bet on those products, and sometimes against them, putting the banks' interests at odds with those of their customers. The banks and their lobbyists also help fashion financial rules and regulations. And banks' traders know what their customers are buying and selling, giving them a valuable edge.
Some of JPMorgan's customers say they are disappointed with the bank. ''They took 40 percent of our profits, and even that was O.K.,'' said Jerry D. Davis, the chairman of the municipal employee pension fund in New Orleans, which lost about $340,000, enough to wipe out years of profits that it had earned through securities lending. ''But then we started losing money, and they didn't lose along with us.''
Through a spokesman, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, declined a request for an interview. The spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti, said that JPMorgan had a long record of success in securities lending, and that the losses represented only a small fraction of the funds in the program.
Moreover, Mr. Evangelisti said, all of the investments had been permitted under guidelines negotiated with the bank's clients. JPMorgan, he said, did not take undue risks.
''We have powerful incentives to take only prudent investment risks,'' Mr. Evangelisti said. If customers lose money that they have entrusted with the bank, he said, that ''can lead to a loss of clients and can affect the reputation of the business.''
The financial regulation bill that Congress just passed, after fierce lobbying by banks, is aimed at curtailing some of the practices that caused the financial crisis. But much of Wall Street has mostly gone back to business as usual. Nowhere are the potential conflicts more apparent than on the trading floors, where executives must balance their pursuit of profits and their duty to customers.
In addition to losing money for New Orleans workers and others, securities lending also played a central role in the near-collapse of the American International Group. Through securities lending, pensions and mutual funds borrow money to make trades, adding to the risks within the financial system.
Lawsuits are flying against JPMorgan and others, including Northern Trust. Clients say that they were not warned of the risks associated with this practice and that the banks breached their fiduciary duty. Wells Fargo lost such a suit over the summer and was ordered to pay four institutions a combined $30 million. The State Street Corporation, which took a $414 million charge in July to cover some of its customers' losses, faces suits from other clients.
Representatives for these banks said the companies had acted appropriately and that they intended to fight the suits.
Despite such troubles, the securities lending business has rebounded after plummeting during the crisis. Today shares with a combined value of $2.3 trillion are out on loan, according to SunGard, which provides technology services to financial companies. In 2007, before the bubble burst, the total on loan was worth $2.5 trillion.
The quick revival of securities lending raises concerns about whether banks and their pension customers have learned any lessons.
''What happened was the banks got greedy and they looked at the return they were getting on the collateral and said, 'Why don't we go further with this?' '' said Steve Niss, the managing partner at the NFS Consulting Group, an executive search firm specializing in investment management. ''But the clients got greedy right along with the banks.''
Quiet Growth
James Wilson entered the securities lending business in the 1990s, when it was still a backwater. The financial industry was then in the midst of a transformation that was threatening some of its traditional sources of earnings. Stock brokerage commissions were being squeezed, and profits from making loans were dwindling.
So at Chemical Bank, which was later absorbed into the JPMorgan empire, Mr. Wilson ratcheted up securities lending.
Though he was ambitious, former colleagues say Mr. Wilson had an unassuming way that won the confidence of clients. He was well-known at industry conferences, and he often stepped up to the microphone as a master of ceremonies.
Moreover, he saw the growth potential in securities lending and stayed in it longer than many of his peers and competitors, who moved on to more prestigious banking departments.
Mr. Wilson, 55, retired after the 2008 losses. He declined to comment last month when reached by phone at his home in New Jersey.
The idea behind securities lending is simple: it allows big investors like pension funds to make extra money on their investments, without having to sell them. In a typical transaction, a pension fund or other institution lets a bank like JPMorgan lend some of its stocks or bonds to other investors, like hedge funds or banks. In return, those investors put up a cash security deposit, in case they are unable to return the securities. The pension funds and other institutions then authorize JPMorgan traders, like Mr. Wilson, to use that cash deposit to trade.
To pension fund managers, this is an attractive proposition. That is because eking out marginally higher returns on investments -- even just another quarter or half of a percentage point a year -- can make a difference over time.
At Chemical Bank and later at JPMorgan, Mr. Wilson pushed the trading linked to securities lending to new heights, according to former colleagues. He urged his customers -- funds like the one for New Orleans workers -- to let him put the cash into longer-term investments. The bigger risks led to bigger rewards, and more pensions signed on.
''If you can throw around a billion or two and make a million and then you take half of it, that's not a bad day's work,'' said Evan Wolk, who worked with Mr. Wilson from 1993 until 2002 and now runs his own financial advisory firm in Florida.
Securities lending also fostered the rapid growth of hedge funds, which often borrow shares from pension funds to bet against those stocks. The practice also helped spur the creation of some of the arcane investments that eventually threatened the nation's financial system.
Today, institutions around the world have about seven trillion shares worth a total of $20 trillion that they are offering to lend out. That is roughly twice the market value of every corporation included in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Only about a tenth of those shares are out on loan at any point in time, depending on which ones hedge funds and others want to borrow, according to SunGard.
Banks often pressure pension funds to participate in securities lending, pension consultants say. If funds refuse, banks raise so-called custodial fees, the charge for holding a fund's securities.
''Whenever we say 'no securities lending,' then they say, 'well, we need to talk about your custodial fees,' '' said Jay Love, a pension consultant with Mercer.
Still, Mr. Love said, he advised clients against securities lending. Participating in such programs amounts to borrowing money to make trades in the financial markets, he said. Ultimately, the cash has to be returned. He said the stocks the pensions lend out can be viewed as a security deposit in exchange for cash used for other investments.
''It's not a free lunch,'' Mr. Love said.
The Temptation
No one would take Jerry Davis for a financial hotshot. A former commander in the Coast Guard, Mr. Davis, 67, worked until 2002 as the employee training officer for New Orleans. In 1986, he joined the board of the city's pension fund. He has watched over the fund ever since. Along the way, he has also become something of a shareholder activist. He says he has led the pension fund in suing more than 30 companies or boards of directors that he believed failed in their duties to shareholders.
During the 1990s, Mr. Davis said he began bumping into Mr. Wilson at industry conferences, where JPMorgan's bankers espoused the benefits of securities lending.
To Mr. Davis, the practice sounded like a low-risk proposition. So New Orleans began lending out some of the securities in its portfolio, turning modest profits. For instance, in 2007, the fund earned $70,000 by lending out its securities and letting JPMorgan reinvest the cash deposits. To earn even such small amounts of money, pensions have to lend out substantial amounts of securities -- $20 million on average for New Orleans that year.
But there were several aspects of the program that always bothered Mr. Davis. Not long after the New Orleans pension became a JPMorgan customer in 2004, Mr. Davis asked Mr. Wilson why the bank could not provide him with industrywide return data for securities lending, Mr. Davis recalled.
JPMorgan representatives said industry rankings were too difficult to come by, Mr. Davis recalled. And regarding Mr. Davis's other pet peeve, JPMorgan's practice of taking a 40 percent cut of profits?
''They told me we were too small to do any better,'' he said. That was in contrast to some giant pension funds, which share only 15 percent of investment gains with the bank.
JPMorgan declined to comment on its cut of profits and its discussions with Mr. Davis.
Still, Mr. Davis kept the New Orleans pension in the program. Securities lending helped the fund cover its operating costs, and unlike investing in, say, hedge funds, the fund officials did not consider securities lending to be risky.
It was, he said, ''almost like free money.''
Dangerous Investments
When Matthew B. Sarson arrived on the securities lending floor at JPMorgan in 2004, as part of the bank's merger with Bank One, Mr. Wilson and his team were hunting for new ways to expand their business.
Under Mr. Wilson, Mr. Sarson soon began managing a fund called CashCo, which pooled together the cash deposits that small pensions received for lending out their securities. One of those small pensions was the New Orleans fund.
Former colleagues described Mr. Sarson, 44, as a low-key Wall Street everyman. He invested his customers' money according to guidelines to which the funds had agreed, according to former employees, and he adopted the don't-blame-us attitude that pervaded the department. JPMorgan's contract with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, for instance, stated that the customer bore the ''sole risk'' for the investments. It included a five-page appendix describing investments that were permitted. Among the requirements was that the investment carry a safe credit rating, of A or better.
That turned out to be a problem in 2008, as the financial crisis began to unfold.
Mr. Sarson bought a variety of investments that, while highly rated, turned out to be risky, including I.O.U.'s from Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, two Wall Street banks that foundered in the collapse.
As Bear Stearns hit trouble in March that year, the phones on the securities lending trading floor began ringing nonstop. Pensions and other clients were demanding to know why JPMorgan had left their cash in the plunging Bear Stearns investments, former JPMorgan employees said. JPMorgan's response: the Bear investments were allowed under the clients' guidelines.
The calls were particularly tense because JPMorgan had bought the stricken Bear Stearns on attractive terms. Some clients believed the bank should have known trouble was coming.
In the end, investors did not lose money on the Bear notes, but the tremors were a sign of trouble. Around that time, Mr. Sarson and other traders began to focus on another troubled trade: an investment vehicle known as Sigma.
JPMorgan had inside knowledge of Sigma, because the bank had helped finance it. But Sigma collapsed after JPMorgan pulled out to protect itself.
''They sensed there were problems with these investments, but they didn't tell the clients,'' said one of the former employees. ''They knew all along: we've got the out -- the losses are yours.''
When Sigma collapsed, in September 2008, CashCo lost $99 million and other JPMorgan clients lost roughly $400 million more, according to JPMorgan client presentations. Sigma's notes have recovered a little since then and are now worth 4 cents on the dollar.
CashCo also invested in Lehman Brothers securities. When Lehman collapsed, JPMorgan's customers were on the hook. The value of those notes has plunged to 19.5 cents on the dollar.
Mr. Evangelisti, the JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank purchased Sigma and Lehman instruments ''only after careful credit analysis.'' The investments were widely held by major money market funds, other securities lending programs and other conservative investment vehicles, he said.
JPMorgan also had insights into Lehman's health as one of Lehman's business partners. A court-appointed examiner concluded this year that JPMorgan may have helped to push Lehman over the brink by demanding cash from the faltering bank. JPMorgan has said in a court filing that it actually helped Lehman stay alive by providing financing as others in the industry would not.
Bearing Losses Alone
When the bottom fell out, the officials in New Orleans were stunned.
In January 2009, a representative from JPMorgan, Robert Bentz, visited to discuss the situation.
''These are not easy meetings,'' Mr. Bentz began, according to a tape recording from the meeting.
Mr. Bentz told the New Orleans officials that former workers from Citigroup created Sigma.
''So it was like Bernie Madoff!'' one city official exclaimed.
Mr. Bentz replied: ''I would like to think he was more of a crook, and these people were just smart.''
But a deal was a deal, Mr. Bentz said, and he said JPMorgan did not plan to help the New Orleans workers cover their losses.
Mr. Sarson, who managed the New Orleans money, has been promoted at JPMorgan. JPMorgan did not make Mr. Sarson available for an interview.
There are few signs of change in the industry. Some pensions have begun asking banks whether they will agree to share not only potential profits but also potential losses. The Missouri State Employees' Retirement System, for instance, asked banks if they would promise to cover any such losses. All of the banks that replied declined to do so, according to Christine Rackers, a spokeswoman for that fund.
One of JPMorgan's current clients, the pension for employees of the State of Texas, solicited information from banks this fall, including whether they would cover such investment losses, according to Mary Jane Wardlow, a spokeswoman for the fund.
In late September, JPMorgan bankers paid another visit to the New Orleans fund, which decided not to sue the bank but stood to benefit if two class actions were successful. The conversation shifted to the Lehman and Sigma losses, the lawsuits against JPMorgan and the pension officials' belief that the bank had failed them. A JPMorgan banker mumbled apologies and rushed out.
Mr. Davis, the New Orleans official, said in an interview that the pension was considering looking for a new bank, even though leaving would mean his fund would have to immediately pay JPMorgan for its losses. He also said he was disappointed that regulators had not intervened on behalf of funds like his. He added, half-joking, that he wished his pension fund were a JPMorgan shareholder, rather than a JPMorgan customer.
''If I were a shareholder, I would say, 'I love Jamie Dimon to death because he's going to go out there and make money every way he can, no matter what happens to his customers,' '' he said. ''He's making money off of me.''
House Advantage: Articles in this series will examine how Wall Street tries to gain an upper hand.

HEADLINE: 'Culture of Poverty,' Long an Academic Slur, Makes a Comeback

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
For more than 40 years, social scientists investigating the causes of poverty have tended to treat cultural explanations like Lord Voldemort: That Which Must Not Be Named.
The reticence was a legacy of the ugly battles that erupted after Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an assistant labor secretary in the Johnson administration, introduced the idea of a ''culture of poverty'' to the public in a startling 1965 report. Although Moynihan didn't coin the phrase (that distinction belongs to the anthropologist Oscar Lewis), his description of the urban black family as caught in an inescapable ''tangle of pathology'' of unmarried mothers and welfare dependency was seen as attributing self-perpetuating moral deficiencies to black people, as if blaming them for their own misfortune.
Moynihan's analysis never lost its appeal to conservative thinkers, whose arguments ultimately succeeded when President Bill Clinton signed a bill in 1996 ''ending welfare as we know it.'' But in the overwhelmingly liberal ranks of academic sociology and anthropology the word ''culture'' became a live grenade, and the idea that attitudes and behavior patterns kept people poor was shunned.
Now, after decades of silence, these scholars are speaking openly about you-know-what, conceding that culture and persistent poverty are enmeshed. 
''We've finally reached the stage where people aren't afraid of being politically incorrect,'' said Douglas S. Massey, a sociologist at Princeton who has argued that Moynihan was unfairly maligned.
The old debate has shaped the new. Last month Princeton and the Brookings Institution released a collection of papers on unmarried parents, a subject, it noted, that became off-limits after the Moynihan report. At the recent annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, attendees discussed the resurgence of scholarship on culture. And in Washington last spring, social scientists participated in a Congressional briefing on culture and poverty linked to a special issue of The Annals, the journal of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.
''Culture is back on the poverty research agenda,'' the introduction declares, acknowledging that it should never have been removed.
The topic has generated interest on Capitol Hill because so much of the research intersects with policy debates. Views of the cultural roots of poverty ''play important roles in shaping how lawmakers choose to address poverty issues,'' Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, noted at the briefing.
This surge of academic research also comes as the percentage of Americans living in poverty hit a 15-year high: one in seven, or 44 million.
With these studies come many new and varied definitions of culture, but they all differ from the '60s-era model in these crucial respects: Today, social scientists are rejecting the notion of a monolithic and unchanging culture of poverty. And they attribute destructive attitudes and behavior not to inherent moral character but to sustained racism and isolation.
To Robert J. Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard, culture is best understood as ''shared understandings.''
''I study inequality, and the dominant focus is on structures of poverty,'' he said. But he added that the reason a neighborhood turns into a ''poverty trap'' is also related to a common perception of the way people in a community act and think. When people see graffiti and garbage, do they find it acceptable or see serious disorder? Do they respect the legal system or have a high level of ''moral cynicism,'' believing that ''laws were made to be broken''?
As part of a large research project in Chicago, Professor Sampson walked through different neighborhoods this summer, dropping stamped, addressed envelopes to see how many people would pick up an apparently lost letter and mail it, a sign that looking out for others is part of the community's culture.
In some neighborhoods, like Grand Boulevard, where the notorious Robert Taylor public housing projects once stood, almost no envelopes were mailed; in others researchers received more than half of the letters back. Income levels did not necessarily explain the difference, Professor Sampson said, but rather the community's cultural norms, the levels of moral cynicism and disorder.
The shared perception of a neighborhood -- is it on the rise or stagnant? -- does a better job of predicting a community's future than the actual level of poverty, he said.
William Julius Wilson, whose pioneering work boldly confronted ghetto life while focusing on economic explanations for persistent poverty, defines culture as the way ''individuals in a community develop an understanding of how the world works and make decisions based on that understanding.''
For some young black men, Professor Wilson, a Harvard sociologist, said, the world works like this: ''If you don't develop a tough demeanor, you won't survive. If you have access to weapons, you get them, and if you get into a fight, you have to use them.''
Seeking to recapture the topic from economists, sociologists have ventured into poor neighborhoods to delve deeper into the attitudes of residents. Their results have challenged some common assumptions, like the belief that poor mothers remain single because they don't value marriage.
In Philadelphia, for example, low-income mothers told the sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas that they thought marriage was profoundly important, even sacred, but doubted that their partners were ''marriage material.'' Their results have prompted some lawmakers and poverty experts to conclude that programs that promote marriage without changing economic and social conditions are unlikely to work.
Mario Luis Small, a sociologist at the University of Chicago and an editor of The Annals' special issue, tried to figure out why some New York City mothers with children in day care developed networks of support while others did not. As he explained in his 2009 book, ''Unanticipated Gains,'' the answer did not depend on income or ethnicity, but rather the rules of the day-care institution. Centers that held frequent field trips, organized parents' associations and had pick-up and drop-off procedures created more opportunities for parents to connect.
Younger academics like Professor Small, 35, attributed the upswing in cultural explanations to a ''new generation of scholars without the baggage of that debate.''
Scholars like Professor Wilson, 74, who have tilled the field much longer, mentioned the development of more sophisticated data and analytical tools. He said he felt compelled to look more closely at culture after the publication of Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein's controversial 1994 book, ''The Bell Curve,'' which attributed African-Americans' lower I.Q. scores to genetics.
The authors claimed to have taken family background into account, Professor Wilson said, but ''they had not captured the cumulative effects of living in poor, racially segregated neighborhoods.''
He added, ''I realized we needed a comprehensive measure of the environment, that we must consider structural and cultural forces.''
He mentioned a study by Professor Sampson, 54, that found that growing up in areas where violence limits socializing outside the family and where parents haven't attended college stunts verbal ability, lowering I.Q. scores by as much as six points, the equivalent of missing more than a year in school.
Changes outside campuses have made conversation about the cultural roots of poverty easier than it was in the '60s. Divorce, living together without marrying, and single motherhood are now commonplace. At the same time prominent African-Americans have begun to speak out on the subject. In 2004 the comedian Bill Cosby made headlines when he criticized poor blacks for ''not parenting'' and dropping out of school. President Obama, who was abandoned by his father, has repeatedly talked about ''responsible fatherhood.''
Conservatives also deserve credit, said Kay S. Hymowitz, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, for their sustained focus on family values and marriage even when cultural explanations were disparaged.
Still, worries about blaming the victim persist. Policy makers and the public still tend to view poverty through one of two competing lenses, Michele Lamont, another editor of the special issue of The Annals, said: ''Are the poor poor because they are lazy, or are the poor poor because they are a victim of the markets?''
So even now some sociologists avoid words like ''values'' and ''morals'' or reject the idea that, as The Annals put it, ''a group's culture is more or less coherent.'' Watered-down definitions of culture, Ms. Hymowitz complained, reduce some of the new work to ''sociological pablum.''
''If anthropologists had come away from doing field work in New Guinea concluding 'everyone's different,' but sometimes people help each other out,'' she wrote in an e-mail, ''there would be no field of anthropology -- and no word culture for cultural sociologists to bend to their will.''
Fuzzy definitions or not, culture is back. This prompted mock surprise from Rep. Woolsey at last spring's Congressional briefing: ''What a concept. Values, norms, beliefs play very important roles in the way people meet the challenges of poverty.''

HEADLINE: Rare And Foolish

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last month a Chinese trawler operating in Japanese-controlled waters collided with two vessels of Japan's Coast Guard. Japan detained the trawler's captain; China responded by cutting off Japan's access to crucial raw materials.
And there was nowhere else to turn: China accounts for 97 percent of the world's supply of rare earths, minerals that play an essential role in many high-technology products, including military equipment. Sure enough, Japan soon let the captain go. 
I don't know about you, but I find this story deeply disturbing, both for what it says about China and what it says about us. On one side, the affair highlights the fecklessness of U.S. policy makers, who did nothing while an unreliable regime acquired a stranglehold on key materials. On the other side, the incident shows a Chinese government that is dangerously trigger-happy, willing to wage economic warfare on the slightest provocation.
Some background: The rare earths are elements whose unique properties play a crucial role in applications ranging from hybrid motors to fiber optics. Until the mid-1980s the United States dominated production, but then China moved in.
''There is oil in the Middle East; there is rare earth in China,'' declared Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's economic transformation, in 1992. Indeed, China has about a third of the world's rare earth deposits. This relative abundance, combined with low extraction and processing costs -- reflecting both low wages and weak environmental standards -- allowed China's producers to undercut the U.S. industry.
You really have to wonder why nobody raised an alarm while this was happening, if only on national security grounds. But policy makers simply stood by as the U.S. rare earth industry shut down. In at least one case, in 2003 -- a time when, if you believed the Bush administration, considerations of national security governed every aspect of U.S. policy -- the Chinese literally packed up all the equipment in a U.S. production facility and shipped it to China.
The result was a monopoly position exceeding the wildest dreams of Middle Eastern oil-fueled tyrants. And even before the trawler incident, China showed itself willing to exploit that monopoly to the fullest. The United Steelworkers recently filed a complaint against Chinese trade practices, stepping in where U.S. businesses fear to tread because they fear Chinese retaliation. The union put China's imposition of export restrictions and taxes on rare earths -- restrictions that give Chinese production in a number of industries an important competitive advantage -- at the top of the list.
Then came the trawler event. Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports were already in violation of agreements China made before joining the World Trade Organization. But the embargo on rare earth exports to Japan was an even more blatant violation of international trade law.
Oh, and Chinese officials have not improved matters by insulting our intelligence, claiming that there was no official embargo. All of China's rare earth exporters, they say -- some of them foreign-owned -- simultaneously decided to halt shipments because of their personal feelings toward Japan. Right.
So what are the lessons of the rare earth fracas?
First, and most obviously, the world needs to develop non-Chinese sources of these materials. There are extensive rare earth deposits in the United States and elsewhere. However, developing these deposits and the facilities to process the raw materials will take both time and financial support. So will a prominent alternative: ''urban mining,'' a k a recycling of rare earths and other materials from used electronic devices.
Second, China's response to the trawler incident is, I'm sorry to say, further evidence that the world's newest economic superpower isn't prepared to assume the responsibilities that go with that status.
Major economic powers, realizing that they have an important stake in the international system, are normally very hesitant about resorting to economic warfare, even in the face of severe provocation -- witness the way U.S. policy makers have agonized and temporized over what to do about China's grossly protectionist exchange-rate policy. China, however, showed no hesitation at all about using its trade muscle to get its way in a political dispute, in clear -- if denied -- violation of international trade law.
Couple the rare earth story with China's behavior on other fronts -- the state subsidies that help firms gain key contracts, the pressure on foreign companies to move production to China and, above all, that exchange-rate policy -- and what you have is a portrait of a rogue economic superpower, unwilling to play by the rules. And the question is what the rest of us are going to do about it.

HEADLINE: For Our China Trade Emergency, Dial Section 301

BYLINE: By SHERROD BROWN. 
Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio, is a member of the President's Export Council and the author of ''Myths of Free Trade.''

 BODY:
Washington
TEN years ago this fall the Senate sold out American manufacturing. By a vote of 83 to 15, it established so-called permanent normal trade relations with China, paving the way for that country to join the World Trade Organization. As a result, Chinese imports to the United States fell under the same low tariffs and high quotas as those from countries like Canada and Britain.
Today, though, our trade relations with China are anything but normal. The 2000 agreement's proponents insisted it would enable a billion Chinese consumers to buy American products. Instead, our bilateral trade deficit has increased 170 percent, largely because China has undermined free-market competition through illegal subsidies and currency manipulation. 
Unless the administration takes punitive steps in response to China's unfair trade practices, the American economy -- and the American worker -- will continue to suffer.
The old agreement on trade with China was never really about promoting American manufacturing. Rather, it was a cynical ploy on the part of many multinational companies. They lobbied Congress to approve it, promising a boost to American exports; then, once it passed, they closed domestic plants, moved production overseas and sold their products back to American consumers.
As for those billion Chinese consumers? We now know that what the companies were really so excited about was a billion inexpensive Chinese workers.
True, our exports to China have increased. But reporting only exports is like reporting just one team's score in baseball: the Cubs scoring five runs sounds good, until you hear that the Reds tallied 12.
Indeed, our exports pale in comparison to the torrent of artificially cheap Chinese imports. Economists, including free-traders, estimate that price manipulation keeps Chinese products 40 percent cheaper than comparable American-made goods.
Inexpensive products might sound nice, but we lose 13,000 net jobs for every $1 billion increase in our trade deficit. Our $226 billion deficit with China has meant shuttered factories, lost jobs and devastated communities across America.
And it's no longer just Chinese bicycles and electronics that are flooding our markets. China will soon make half the world's wind turbines and solar panels, most of which it plans to export to America. And, as usual, China's clean-energy industry relies on large government subsidies, in direct violation of international trade laws.
In response, the Obama administration recently accepted a petition, filed by the United Steelworkers under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, to investigate China's state support for clean-energy exports. If the White House finds that the support violates international trade rules, Section 301 allows it to respond with a range of aggressive measures, including tariffs.
This strategy has worked before: in the 1980s and '90s, the United States used its 301 authority to combat Japanese and Korean subsidies and trade barriers. Though critics warned of bitter trade wars, the get-tough approach actually led to more balanced trade relationships, and even encouraged foreign investors, like Asian auto companies, to build plants in America.
In trying to get China to play fair, though, Washington has instead relied on rhetoric and moral suasion. It hasn't worked. Only rigorous enforcement of trade rules by the Obama administration can reverse the harm caused by the permanent normal trade relations agreement.
Congress has a role to play, too: when the Senate reconvenes next month, it should vote, as the House did in September, to expand the president's authority to impose tariffs on China or any other country that unfairly manipulates its currency.
Many politicians claim they support products ''made in America.'' But the phrase is more than an empty slogan; it means standing up for American manufacturers. Only by learning the lessons of ''normal'' trade with China -- and acknowledging buyer's remorse -- can we reach a truly balanced bilateral relationship that works for America.

HEADLINE: Weary of Debris, Haiti Finally Sees Some Vanish

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Wearing a Nike visor, sunglasses, a crisp linen shirt and pressed jeans, Randal Perkins of Pompano Beach, Fla., watched with satisfaction as his $400,000 hydraulic excavator clawed into a towering pile of concrete chunks in the shattered heart of this city.
''This is what the people have been waiting for,'' Mr. Perkins declared in his booming voice, sweeping his arm to take in a crowd of bystanders mesmerized for hours by the demolition and removal of a collapsed funeral home.
Mr. Perkins had been waiting, too, with increasing impatience, for the cleanup of Haiti to begin. Chief executive of a Florida-based disaster recovery firm, he had made a $25 million gamble that he could capitalize on the Jan. 12 earthquake. He had partnered with a Haitian conglomerate, imported a dozen shiploads of heavy equipment and set up a state-of-the-art base camp here -- but then, nothing. 
It has been obvious since January that clearing the wreckage is the necessary prelude to this country's reconstruction, physically and psychologically. But the problem was so dauntingly big and complex that the government and donors got stuck in visionary mode, planning the future while the present remained mired in rubble.
It was easier, in a way, to conceive ambitious projects that would, someday, address Haiti's longstanding issues, like its weak educational system or its crumbling roads.
By late summer, however, the need to tackle the earthquake damage directly became so glaring that some initial steps were taken. The government tendered its very first cleanup contract to Mr. Perkins's Haiti Recovery Group. Worth $7.5 million to $13.5 million -- nobody would be more precise -- the contract represented a minuscule piece of a debris removal operation expected to cost $1.2 billion.
But it was at last a start, breaking the paralysis symbolized by the teetering ruin of the destroyed national palace. ''Finally, something is moving in debris,'' Jessica Faieta, the United Nations Development Program's senior country director in Haiti, said with relief.
Mr. Perkins echoed her relief. ''All along I'd been thinking, 'Somebody finally has to take the initiative and say, 'Ready, set, go,' '' he said. ''You just pick a spot to begin and things will fall into place.''
Mr. Perkins, 46, competitive and ambitious with a loose-limbed swagger, flew to Haiti within days of the earthquake to start staking his claim. He knows that companies like his are sometimes seen as disaster vultures but dismisses the criticism.
''People always say you make money off other people's misery,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''But, listen, somebody's got to do the work.''
He did not know the headaches that lay ahead.
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the American military and several American contractors were busy clearing roads and setting up logistical support for the Haitian government and international groups. One of Mr. Perkins's chief competitors -- the DRC Group of Alabama -- already had an office in Haiti and started right in with the grisly task of recovering bodies.
After that initial burst of activity, though, the cleanup slowed to a crawl. International officials blamed the Haitian government for failing to take charge and create a master plan for debris removal and resettlement. Haitian officials, however, maintain that international donors themselves were slow to make rubble a priority.
''What is happening now could have happened in March if there had not been a laxity on the part of the international community,'' said one senior official in the planning ministry, who asked that he not be identified for what he called political reasons. ''As you know, we ourselves don't have the means.''
Chuck Prieur, senior vice president of DRC-Haiti, said that rubble removal was never ''sexy'' to donors. ''Nobody wants to do cleanup,'' he said. ''Everybody likes to do shiny stuff you can put your name on.''
Shortly after the earthquake, Mr. Prieur said, he sketched out a debris plan and calculated that the cleanup could, theoretically, be done in nine months. ''But I knew that nine months could be nine years if the forces weren't mobilized,'' he said.
Ms. Faieta said that the search for a perfect approach -- taking into account, say, environmental concerns and land ownership issues -- had proved ''paralyzing'' but added that the contractors had a different vantage point.
''They are entrepreneurs, there to remove rubble and remove it fast,'' she said.
Always a self-starter, Mr. Perkins ended up in the disaster recovery business by being in the right place at the right time. The son of a prison guard and a probation officer, a college dropout who had gotten married at 19, he was a landscape contractor in South Florida when Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992.
A large engineering company needed bucket trucks; he had bucket trucks. AshBritt Inc., named after his daughters Ashley and Brittany, was born.
After Hurricane Katrina, the Army Corp of Engineers gave AshBritt what Mr. Perkins said ultimately amounted to a $900 million contract to clean up debris. Mr. Perkins said AshBritt held hundreds of ''prepositioned'' federal, state and municipal contracts for disaster recovery, but Haiti's earthquake was its first international disaster.
Soon after the earthquake, Mr. Perkins made the rounds, visiting the ambassador to the United States, Haitian ministers and the country's president. He also met with the GB Group, a leading Haitian conglomerate.
Where AshBritt had disaster recovery experience, GB had a distribution network, relationships with local suppliers and political connections.
They formed the Haiti Recovery Group. In early spring Mr. Perkins started building a deluxe base camp inside GB's 35-acre industrial complex, outfitting shipping containers with air-conditioning, flat-screen TVs, a fully equipped gym and a cafeteria.
''We weren't assured of anything,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''The only thing we could control was setting up a first-class operation and bringing over the equipment we needed.''
When rubble removal finally became an urgent priority late this summer, only baby steps were taken.
At its September meeting, Haiti's reconstruction commission, led by Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and former President Bill Clinton, approved a $17 million United Nations Development Program plan to clean up six neighborhoods -- an important project but only a small piece of the $1 billion in reconstruction projects approved to date.
At the same time, the Haitian government set itself a goal to clean up the downtown area -- where government offices will be rebuilt -- by late November, when presidential elections are scheduled.
Major cleanup and rebuilding is not expected to happen until next year, frustrating contractors like Mr. Prieur, although his firm does have work, building shelters and a residential camp for the United Nations.
''I'm here, so I'd love to get going, and my American greed says I'd love to have everything given to me,'' Mr. Prieur said. His company's competitor, Mr. Perkins's firm, got the first major cleanup contract because it had ''the capacity,'' Michel Content of the planning ministry said.
The government is paying $32.50 to $58 a cubic yard for debris removal. That is considerably more than the American government paid contractors after Hurricane Katrina.
But the work in Haiti, contractors say, is tougher: trucks can haul fewer loads a day because of bad roads; fuel costs are higher; buildings have to be demolished. On the other hand, labor costs are far lower. The Haitians Mr. Perkins has hired and trained -- close to 100, he said -- are getting $1,000 a month, a substantial wage in Haiti, though much less than the $450 to $500 a day he is paying American machine operators here.
The government recently granted a second contract to a Haitian company, reportedly paying less. Both contracts were no-bid, Mr. Content said, because of the need for speed.
Once Mr. Perkins's Haiti Recovery Group got the go-ahead, HRG trucks were everywhere downtown. Collapsed buildings, their remains putrefying with oversize rats crawling through the rubble, are now spray-painted with a red ''HRG -- O.K.'' when they are cleared for removal.
Crowds gather to watch the demolitions, partly because they are big, noisy spectacles and partly because the glistening new dump trucks always leave something salvageable behind.
''It's beautiful,'' Ernst Saint Albor, 36, said as he leaned on his bicycle watching one building come down. ''It looks like destruction, but it's progress. We cannot bear to see these collapsed buildings any longer. Be gone with them.''

HEADLINE: In Poll, Voters Convey Wariness About Paladino

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan, Dalia Sussman and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York voters are profoundly pessimistic about the state economy, worried that they or someone in their household will be laid off in the coming year, and convinced that Albany is rife with corruption.
But in the race for governor, they are rallying not around the gruff outsider who has promised to take a baseball bat to Albany, but around an insider who has spent much of his adult life working in government: Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo.
A New York Times poll found that Mr. Cuomo had opened a big lead over Carl P. Paladino, drawing 59 percent of likely voters, to his Republican rival's 24 percent.
New Yorkers' embrace of Mr. Cuomo stands in vivid contrast to many races around the country, where establishment candidates face steep climbs to re-election, and insurgents backed by Tea Party activists appear poised to win a significant number of seats in Congress. 
Mr. Cuomo's popularity appears to be fueled in part by widespread doubts about Mr. Paladino's temperament and qualifications.
Some 59 percent of voters in the poll said that Mr. Paladino did not have the right temperament and personality to be a good governor, while 55 percent said that Mr. Paladino, a novice candidate who made millions as a real estate developer, did not have the right kind of experience.
Only 11 percent of voters in the poll had a favorable view of Mr. Paladino.
And when asked what comes to mind when they hear his name, voters who were surveyed offered a collection of negative personality traits, like ''angry,'' ''bigoted'' or ''obnoxious.''
''I've been reading about a lot of things he said and watching his ads, and he seems very angry,'' Michelle Sullivan, 52, a homemaker from Auburn who described herself as an independent, said in a follow-up interview. ''We're all upset in New York State with the way it's been run, but I don't think it's a good thing for a candidate to be that angry. He's scary-angry, actually.''
Mr. Paladino's standing in the poll may have been affected by its timing; it surveyed 1,139 adults from Oct. 10 through Oct. 15, as Mr. Paladino was being widely criticized for expressing disgust with gay pride parades and commenting that children should not be taught that homosexuality was acceptable. Earlier public polls showed Mr. Cuomo leading by smaller margins.
Of the Times poll's respondents, 943 said they were registered to vote.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, both for all respondents and for voters.
Mr. Paladino's decline has helped Mr. Cuomo assemble a broad coalition of voters; he is favored by upstate voters, independents and moderates. He is supported by a majority of affluent voters -- who tend to support Republican candidates -- and by a quarter of Republicans.
The survey also revealed voters' anxiety about their own financial situation.
Fully 69 percent worry that they or someone in their household will be laid off within the next year. Not surprisingly, they overwhelmingly want the next governor to focus on creating jobs.
Even as they express support for Mr. Cuomo, however, they are uncertain he can make a difference. While 27 percent say the economy will improve if Mr. Cuomo is elected, 53 percent say it will stay the same and 10 percent say it will worsen.
And despite both candidates' pledge to reduce the burden of state and local taxes, similar proportions of voters -- about 4 in 10 -- said they expected their taxes would go up if Mr. Cuomo won or if Mr. Paladino won.
While Mr. Cuomo's job approval ratings as attorney general are strong, he still appears to be best known as the scion of a political dynasty. When asked what first comes to mind when they hear Mr. Cuomo's name, 31 percent said his father, the former governor Mario M. Cuomo, or his family name. Just 14 percent said they thought of him first and foremost as New York's attorney general.
At the same time, 73 percent said he had the temperament and personality to be a good governor, suggesting that Mr. Cuomo has largely shed his own reputation for brashness and political hardball, at least where voters are concerned.
''I think Cuomo is doing his job as attorney general honorably and honestly, and I think he is working for the people of New York,'' said Diana Jeffords, 61, a retired postmaster from Albion, and a Republican.
''I heard Mr. Paladino speak a few months ago, and I don't like the terminology he used -- he said he's going to take a baseball bat to Albany,'' Mrs. Jeffords added.
''Yes, people are angry about their money and stuff, but anybody that's thinking has to know you get a lot more flies with honey than vinegar. As governor you are not going to go to Albany and say we're doing this and this and this. It's not a dictatorship.''
Mr. Cuomo, conscious of the electorate's anti-incumbent mood this year, has sought to distance himself from the dysfunction in Albany, limiting his appearances in the Capitol and saying the scandals and antics there ''would make Boss Tweed blush.''
The poll indicated that while seven-tenths of voters view Mr. Cuomo as an ''Albany insider,'' they appear to see his government experience as an asset. Almost 90 percent say Mr. Cuomo understands the complicated problems a governor would face in Albany.
''I think somebody who knows the workings of that labyrinthine system up there in Albany would be a good person to have as governor,'' Kathryn Zarczynski, 60, a sales representative from Brooklyn and an independent voter, said.
Mr. Cuomo, who was elected attorney general in 2006, has become popular even as the mood of New Yorkers has turned sharply against other state officials after four tumultuous years of scandal and gridlock in Albany.
Some 70 percent of New Yorkers surveyed disapprove of the way the Legislature is handling its job, compared with 47 percent in the spring of 2009, when The Times last surveyed New York State.
And 58 percent say they believe that corruption is widespread in the Capitol.
Far more residents blame state officials for New York's budget problems than blame Wall Street or the federal government.
Most see New York's budget problems -- the state faces a projected budget deficit of more than $8 billion next year -- as very serious. But they are divided about how to address them.
A plurality, 43 percent, say that reducing services is the best way to balance New York's budget, while 22 percent favor raising taxes and 24 percent favor borrowing. When respondents were asked which services should be reduced, the answer offered most was transportation, which 22 percent selected.
There is significant unease about laying off state employees at a time when work is scarce, with 58 percent saying it would be a bad idea to lay off 5 percent of the state work force, as Gov. David A. Paterson sought to do last year after unions refused to postpone scheduled raises.
Voters oppose reducing pension and health benefits for current state workers, but about half would support reducing pensions for future state employees.
''As in any state, New York has to understand where we are spending our money, and I think there has to be some realignment there,'' said Laurence Strubing, 66, a Democrat who lives in Manhattan. ''We are spending money for state pensions and civil workers, and that will be hard to realign, considering how powerful unions are in New York State and the city.''
The poll indicates that the Tea Party movement is somewhat less strong in New York than nationally. Seventeen percent of voters in the New York poll consider themselves to be supporters of the movement, while 22 percent of voters nationwide do. Among those New Yorkers who do, nearly half consider Mr. Paladino to be one of their own.

HEADLINE: New Spy Game: Firms' Secrets Sold Overseas

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW; Sarah Chen contributed research.

 BODY:
Huang Kexue, federal authorities say, is a new kind of spy.
For five years, Mr. Huang was a scientist at a Dow Chemical lab in Indiana, studying ways to improve insecticides. But before he was fired in 2008, Mr. Huang began sharing Dow's secrets with Chinese researchers, authorities say, then obtained grants from a state-run foundation in China with the goal of starting a rival business there.
Now, Mr. Huang, who was born in China and is a legal United States resident, faces a rare criminal charge -- that he engaged in economic espionage on China's behalf.
Law enforcement officials say the kind of spying Mr. Huang is accused of represents a new front in the battle for a global economic edge. As China and other countries broaden their efforts to obtain Western technology, American industries beyond the traditional military and high-tech targets risk having valuable secrets exposed by their own employees, court records show. 
Rather than relying on dead drops and secret directions from government handlers, the new trade in business secrets seems much more opportunistic, federal prosecutors say, and occurs in loose, underground markets throughout the world.
Prosecutors say it is difficult to prove links to a foreign government, but intelligence officials say China, Russia and Iran are among the countries pushing hardest to obtain the latest technologies.
''In the new global economy, our businesses are increasingly targets for theft,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division. ''In order to stay a leader in innovation, we've got to protect these trade secrets.''
Mr. Huang, 45, who says he is not guilty, is being prosecuted under an economic espionage provision in use for only the seventh time. Created by Congress in 1996 to address a shift toward industrial spying after the cold war, the law makes it a crime to steal business trade secrets, like software code and laboratory breakthroughs. The crime rises to espionage if the thefts are carried out to help a foreign government.
Economic espionage charges are also pending against Jin Hanjuan, a software engineer for Motorola, who was arrested with a laptop full of company documents while boarding a plane for China, prosecutors said. Over the last year, other charges involving the theft of trade secrets -- a charge less serious than espionage -- have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford who had business ties to China. And scientists at the DuPont Company and Valspar, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employer's secrets after taking jobs in China.
In two past espionage cases involving American computer companies, defendants said they saw a chance to make money and acted on their own, knowing that the information would be valuable to Chinese companies or agencies. In several cases, Chinese government agencies or scientific institutes provided money to start businesses or research to develop the ideas; that financing is what gave rise to the espionage charges.
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, appointed by Congress to study the national security issues arising from America's economic relationship with China, said in a report last year that even in instances without direct involvement by Chinese officials, China's government ''has been a major beneficiary of technology acquired through industrial espionage.''
China has denied that its intelligence services go after American industries. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the subject, but spokesmen for the Chinese foundation and the university that worked with Mr. Huang said they were not aware of any espionage.
''If it's true, we will start our own investigation into it,'' said Chen Yue, a spokesman for the Natural Science Foundation of China, which gave Mr. Huang grants to conduct research there.
American officials and corporate trade groups say they fear economic spying will increase as China's quest for Western know-how spreads from military systems to everyday commercial technologies.
After focusing for decades on low-cost assembly operations, China ''feels it really needs to turn the corner and become a technology power in its own right,'' said James Mulvenon, the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington, which tracks Chinese activities for federal agencies and corporate clients.
Mr. Mulvenon said China is trying to woo back thousands of ethnic Chinese scientists who have trained or worked in the United States. ''They basically roll out the red carpet for these guys,'' he said.
As economic crimes become easier to commit -- in some cases as simple as downloading data and pressing ''Send'' -- security analysts say some American companies must share the blame for thefts because they do not adequately monitor employees.
At Motorola, for example, court records show that Ms. Jin, the software engineer, downloaded company documents during two sick leaves and tapped into the company's computers from China, where, prosecutors say, she met with a company linked to the Chinese military. Ms. Jin, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in China, says she is not guilty, and is awaiting trial in Illinois.
Catching and prosecuting wrongdoers is also made difficult by the refusal of some companies to report breaches.
''When you have public companies with their stock values tied to their assets, the last thing they want the buyer of that stock to think is that their assets are compromised,'' said Michael Maloof, the chief technology officer of TriGeo Network Security, a company that provides computer monitoring systems.
The first economic espionage case, filed in 2001 against a Japanese scientist, collapsed when Japan refused to extradite him. The six other cases have involved China, and the Justice Department won the first three.
In one case, two Silicon Valley engineers admitted to stealing secrets about computer chips, then arranging financing from Chinese government agencies to start business. In another case, a retired Boeing engineer was convicted after a search of his home found documents on United States military and space programs, as well as letters from Chinese aviation officials seeking the data.
The Justice Department lost a case involving two California engineers. The government focused on documents showing that the engineers were working with a venture capitalist in China to seek financing for a microchip business from China's 863 program, which supports development of technologies with military applications.
But the men were arrested before they filed the grant application. The judge in the case concluded in May that the government had needed to prove that the men had ''intended to confer a benefit'' on China, ''not receive a benefit from it.''
In Mr. Huang's case, according to the indictment, he had received money from the Natural Science Foundation of China, a government organization, to conduct insecticide research.
Mr. Huang grew up in China, and has lived in the United States or Canada since 1995. While working for Dow's farm chemicals unit, Dow AgroSciences, he also took a job as a visiting professor at a Chinese university and made eight trips to China, court records show.
Besides directing research at the university while at Dow, he later smuggled samples of a bacterial strain from Dow to China in his son's suitcase, the authorities said.
Mr. Huang's lawyer, Michael Donahoe, said at a recent hearing that the case was ''hypothetical.'' But Cynthia Ridgeway, an assistant United States attorney, said that with Dow's Chinese patent due to expire in 2012, Mr. Huang had ''the full recipe'' needed to try to take its business to China.
Last week, a judge denied Mr. Huang's request for bail. He is awaiting trial in federal custody in Indiana.

HEADLINE: Obamas Rally For Democrats In Final Push

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JACKIE CALMES; Carl Hulse reported from Washington, and Jackie Calmes from Columbus, Ohio. Jeff Zeleny and Derek Willis contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael Luo from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is seeking to rally anxious Democrats for the final two weeks of the midterm election campaign, traveling to the heart of the electoral battleground to urge them not to be discouraged -- ''Don't let them tell you that change isn't possible'' -- even as resurgent Republicans continued to expand their sights with the help of deep-pocketed allies.
Campaigning for the first time since the 2008 election with his wife, Michelle, the president visited Cleveland and Columbus Sunday to try to build support for Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, one of the embattled Democratic candidates for governor, and to raise money while making the case for Democrats nationwide. The visits are part of an intensive two weeks of campaign travel leading up to the Nov. 2 elections, a sprint that started with trips to Massachusetts on Saturday and Delaware on Friday.
''The biggest mistake we could make right now, Ohio, is to go back to the very same policies that caused all this hurt in the first place,'' Mr. Obama, his voice hoarse, exhorted to an enthusiastic crowd of an estimated 35,000 people at Ohio State University in Columbus. 
''I know it gets discouraging sometimes,'' he added. ''But don't let anybody tell you this fight isn't worth it. Don't let them tell you you're not making a difference.''
As he spoke, candidates were preparing for the final stretch. Republican confidence about capturing control of the House remained high, though even Republicans considered the Senate more of a question mark, given the number of excruciatingly close races across the country.
Polls showed a tightening Senate contest in California between Senator Barbara Boxer, the Democrat, and Carly Fiorina, the Republican. In Colorado, Senator Michael Bennet, the Democratic candidate, appeared to be gaining ground on Ken Buck, the Republican. The deadlocked Illinois Senate race continued to worry Republicans as well.
Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said again on Sunday that his party could still come up short in its push for the 10 additional seats needed to capture the Senate.
''We have 12 seats in play,'' Mr. Cornyn said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' adding, ''I'm not predicting we're going to get back the majority. It may be a two-cycle process.''
Signs of Republican momentum were evident in quarterly fund-raising reports filed on Friday with the Federal Election Commission.
In the 112 House races The New York Times has identified as competitive, Republican candidates raised $53 million combined, compared with $48 million raised by their Democratic rivals. It was a stark reversal from previous quarters, in which Democrats held a commanding fund-raising advantage. Republicans raised more money than their Democratic counterparts in just under half of the races in play.
As they juggled financial resources, party operatives were making moves to give their side its best opportunity. In an illustration of how the expanding battlefield was causing Democrats to alter plans, officials said it was likely that they would soon begin advertising in Arizona to bolster Representative Raul M. Grijalva, a Democratic incumbent not previously considered in danger.
Senate Republicans said they remained optimistic about their prospects in Pennsylvania, where former Representative Pat Toomey is the party's choice. But Democrats, who have spent $4.2 million on behalf of Representative Joe Sestak, said they did not anticipate scaling back their investment because the race seemed more winnable than other tough contests, including in Missouri, where the party reduced its spending commitment.
At the same time, new outside advocacy groups were continuing to emerge, including the Committee for Working Families, which began making investments in seven House and four Senate races across the country on behalf of Republican candidates or against Democratic candidates. The origination of the group, like others that have played a significant role in the midterm elections, was difficult to determine because the donors are not required by law to be disclosed.
Even though many Republican candidates increased their own fund-raising, such outside groups were still playing an outsize role in key races across the country.
The disparity in many cases was profound. In Iowa, Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat, was hoping to rely on a substantial financial advantage against his Republican opponent, Ben Lange. Mr. Braley has raised $1.5 million, compared with $368,000 by Mr. Lange. But outside groups have spent nearly $500,000 on behalf of Mr. Lange and have reserved television advertising to double that investment.
With Democrats being swamped by such outside money, party officials were increasingly acknowledging that they were in for a rough election ride. They said that no matter which party ended up controlling the House and the Senate, the margins between majority and minority were going to be much closer, making legislative progress difficult -- a prospect raised by Mr. Obama himself on Saturday.
At a fund-raiser near Boston, he told Democratic donors that Republican obstructionism had turned out to be a ''smart tactical decision'' intended to leave Democrats to take the blame in the midterms for what would inevitably be a slow recovery, given the depths of the recession.
House Democratic leaders held out hope that experience and preparation could help their candidates thwart a Republican surge. They pointed out that many of the House incumbents long predicted to be all but finished remained in the fight.
''Republicans had hoped there would be a stampede against Democratic incumbents,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on Sunday. ''In fact what is happening is the American voter is taking a deep breath and beginning to take a look at the Republican candidates, and what they see, they don't like.''
Mr. Van Hollen and other Democrats pointed to South Florida, where a Tea Party favorite, Allen West, the Republican challenger to Representative Ron Klein, spent much of the weekend trying to refute news reports that he had ties to a motorcycle club linked to criminal activity.
Another potential advantage for Democrats was that while many incumbents had seen their opponents collect more money in recent months, a fund-raising head start meant that many Democrats had more money available for the final weeks.
The New York Times analysis of competitive races showed that Democrats have a cash-on-hand advantage in two-thirds of the races in play. On average, Democratic House candidates in competitive races have about $475,000 in the bank, compared with less than $370,000 for Republicans. That money could prove crucial in last-minute advertising and voter drives.
Many Democratic incumbents have spent heavily to hang on to their seats. About a quarter of them in competitive races poured out more than $1 million each in recent months, compared with just a few Republican challengers who did the same.
Republicans said they did not expect such factors to save Democrats given the anti-incumbent mood of the country over the economy and Washington spending. ''The budget just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger,'' Ms. Fiorina, the Republican Senate candidate in California, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''It's why voters in California and, I believe, a lot of voters all across the country are tired of career politicians.''
The White House chose the swing state of Ohio for the Obamas' first joint appearance for several reasons: because Mr. Strickland's re-election fight is one of the tightest governor's races in the country, because there are enough close Congressional races in Ohio to potentially determine control of the House, and because the state could be crucial for Mr. Obama's own re-election effort in 2012.
Administration officials are counting on the first lady to grab voters' attention. In remarks at an earlier fund-raiser in Cleveland for Mr. Strickland, and in introducing her husband at the rally, the self-described ''mom in chief'' never mentioned Republicans. Instead she praised the records of Mr. Strickland and Mr. Obama and urged supporters to re-elect Democrats.
''We've got so much more to do!'' she said. Then she roused the tens of thousands by twice asking, ''Can we do this?'' and twice getting back in response the slogan that dates to the 2008 campaign: ''Yes, we can!''

HEADLINE: A New Quandary for the Federal Reserve: Grappling With Low Inflation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
BOSTON -- A situation the Federal Reserve has long feared has come to pass: the central bank, after spending three decades taming inflation, now needs more of it.
And so the Fed is having to shift substantially from the approach that has come to define it and from which it has long derived its institutional self-esteem.
''In the 1980s and 1990s, few ever questioned the desired direction for inflation -- lower was always better,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a conference here this weekend, acknowledging the sea change in the Fed's orientation. 
Since the summer, Fed officials have grown increasingly worried that the United States could slip into deflation, a decrease in prices of the kind that has bedeviled Japan since the late 1990s.
That worry has taken center stage as Mr. Bernanke prepares the markets for a widely expected new round of unorthodox actions, starting in November, to prop up the recovery by lowering long-term interest rates. Nearly two years ago, the Fed lowered short-term interest rates to essentially zero.
The Fed is legally required to try to keep prices stable and maximize employment. Those often conflicting goals are, for the time being, no longer in tension as the economy limps along. In framing his cautious arguments for additional Fed action, Mr. Bernanke said inflation (about half of the implicit target of ''about 2 percent or a bit below'') was ''too low'' and that unemployment (9.6 percent) was ''clearly too high.''
Mr. Bernanke returned to Washington after giving the opening speech at the conference, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, on ''Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment.'' Had he stayed through the weekend, he would have heard colleagues expressing even graver anxieties.
Drawing on Japan's experiences with low but persistent deflation, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, said it seemed that the disease was much easier to prevent than cure. But getting Fed policy makers to agree on a course of action ''has turned out to be extremely challenging,'' he added.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said at the conference that he had had ''a dawning realization'' that the economy was in a ''liquidity trap'' -- a situation in which monetary policy is unable to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates or expanding the money supply. He announced his support for a much-debated strategy known as ''price-level targeting,'' in which the Fed would permit inflation to run at higher-than-normal rates in the future to make up for inflation being lower than desired today.
Fed officials closely monitor the markets' beliefs about future price movements because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. Since the recession began in 2007, those expectations have largely remained stable.
But Richard H. Clarida, an economist at Columbia, warned that the Fed should not take a premature victory lap.
''That expected inflation has thus far adjusted only modestly lower during this cycle may be the result not of Fed credibility to generate inflation in the future, but instead may be the result of the fact that the Fed in the past has delivered 2 percent inflation,'' he wrote in a paper presented here.
He added: ''Expectations of disinflation or even deflation could become entrenched as they did in Japan and be very difficult, given inflation inertia, to reverse.''
Mr. Clarida also noted that ''bank lending, much of it to small and medium-sized enterprises, has collapsed to an extent unprecedented in previous business cycles and continues to decline more than a year into recovery.'' Such a credit crisis makes it particularly difficult for the Fed to stimulate demand by manipulating interest rates, he said.
Another paper, by Jeffrey C. Fuhrer, Giovanni P. Olivei and Geoffrey M. B. Tootell of the Boston Fed, noted that it was common for inflation to fall after a recession and concluded that ''modest additional declines in inflation are likely.''
James D. Hamilton of the University of California, San Diego, argued in another paper here that trying to increase inflation expectations as a response to the crisis -- through price-level targeting, for instance -- was far easier in theory than in practice.
However, Mr. Hamilton did find reason to be hopeful. His research found that the Fed could lower long-term interest rates by selling short-term Treasury securities and buying longer-term securities. He also found that quantitative easing -- the strategy of buying long-term assets to lower long-term rates -- could be similarly effective.
Fear of deflation has loomed before. In 2003, as the economy recovered from the mild recession of 2001, Fed policy makers warned that further disinflation, or a slowdown in inflation, would be ''unwelcome.'' Mr. Bernanke called the moment ''something of a watershed,'' because ''central banks, for the first time in decades, had to take seriously the possibility that inflation can be too low as well as too high.''
To prop up the economy the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government debt last year and earlier this year. It is now considering resuming debt purchases, partly to stave off deflation.
Mr. Hamilton expressed hope for quantitative easing but said it might require creating huge sums of money. ''If hundreds of billions are not enough to make much difference, then perhaps purchases in the trillions, such as the Fed has embarked upon with its holdings of mortgage-backed securities, might do the trick,'' he wrote.
That argument seemed to find support from Kazuo Ueda, an economist at the University of Tokyo, who said that the Bank of Japan's continuing fight against deflation might have been more effective had the central bank bought Japanese government bonds ''on a much larger scale'' than it has.

HEADLINE: China Escalates Fight With U.S. on Clean Energy Aid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and XIYUN YANG; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- A dispute between China and the United States over Beijing's subsidies to clean energy industries escalated on Sunday when a senior Chinese economic official warned that Washington ''cannot win this trade fight.''
In an abruptly scheduled news briefing here, the official, Zhang Guobao, sharply rebuked the Obama administration for opening an inquiry on Friday into the subsidies. 
Mr. Zhang accused American trade officials of repeatedly delaying talks over the same issues that the White House now wanted to investigate and suggested the administration was playing election season politics.
''I have been thinking: What do the Americans want?'' said Mr. Zhang, the vice chairman of the government's National Development and Reform Commission. ''Do they want fair trade? Or an earnest dialogue? Or transparent information? I don't think they want any of this. I think more likely, the Americans just want votes.''
With campaigning for the November midterm elections defined in large part by bleak economic and employment statistics, candidates in both parties have increasingly blamed Chinese trade policies for slowing the American recovery from the 2008 economic collapse.
The White House has increased criticism of China in recent weeks, even as it dispatched senior officials to China to try to defuse trade tensions.
Mr. Zhang's comments signaled that tensions were rising not only over trade issues but also over longstanding claims that the Chinese have artificially depressed the value of their currency.
He is widely seen in the West as China's top policy maker on energy because he heads the country's National Energy Administration.
It is highly unusual for an official of Mr. Zhang's standing to convene a news conference on short notice and denounce the American government in such blunt terms.
Should the Americans pursue the subsidy issue with the World Trade Organization, Mr. Zhang said, ''the only ones who will be humiliated are themselves.''
Mr. Zhang was reacting to an announcement on Friday that the United States Trade Representative's office would investigate Chinese government support for manufacturers of wind turbines, solar energy products, energy-efficient vehicles and technologically advanced batteries.
''The United States is committed to the international trade rules in the W.T.O. and our other trade agreements,'' Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the trade representative, said on Sunday. ''We strive to ensure that our policies and programs are consistent with those rules, and ask that other countries also do so.''
The United Steelworkers trade union filed a complaint on Sept. 9 accusing China of ignoring W.T.O. rules prohibiting excessive subsidies of those markets. The trade representative's inquiry, in reaction to the Steelworkers' complaint, is potentially a first step toward filing formal charges against China with the W.T.O.
Mr. Zhang called the Steelworkers' complaint unfounded, saying the Obama administration had proposed subsidies totaling $60 billion for clean energy industries, adding that the American government had placed domestic-content provisions -- so-called Buy American clauses -- on certain clean energy products.
In contrast, he said, ''as far as I know, Chinese subsidies coming from all sectors, including taxes, are nominal,'' and China is a major buyer of American clean energy products.
For example, he said that while Chinese exports of wind turbines to the United States were small in 2009, Chinese manufacturers had imported crucial turbine components and ingredients like lubricants from American manufacturers.
''What America is blaming us for is exactly what they do themselves,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''Chinese subsidies to new energy companies are much smaller than those of the U.S. government. If the U.S. government can subsidize companies, then why can't we?''
The Steelworkers' complaint, however, echoes charges by other foreign manufacturers, who argue that China gives hidden subsidies like free land and low-interest loans to its clean energy industries, while substantially restricting access to its domestic market.
They also accuse China of depressing its currency so exports of clean energy products will sell cheaply abroad, while foreign imports will seem artificially expensive. China said in the summer that it would allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate. But its value has risen at a glacial pace, and only as a result of intense pressure from its trading partners.
The economic stimulus legislation in the United States included a so-called Buy American provision requiring that recipients of stimulus money purchase only steel and other construction materials, like solar panels, that were manufactured in the United States or in other countries that had signed the trade organization's side agreement requiring free trade in government procurement.
Virtually all industrialized countries have signed the government procurement agreement, which calls for signatories to open most government contracts to bids from other signatory countries. China promised to sign the side agreement ''as soon as possible'' when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001.
But municipal and provincial governments in China, particularly in inland provinces, have strongly opposed opening their procurement projects to international competition. So China has not yet signed the agreement, although some Chinese executives have begun advocating that it do so in the interest of helping Chinese companies export more goods.
While the United States has many programs to subsidize research and development of clean energy, China has been very successful in the last year at manufacturing and exporting clean energy technologies inexpensively, particularly in solar panels.
World Trade Organization rules tend to be stricter against export subsidies than against domestic subsidies, and they tend to be stricter against manufacturing subsidies than research and development subsidies.

HEADLINE: Calling on Old Reliable to Breathe New Life

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Philadelphia
Someday soon, all four teams in the league championship series will be starting pitchers who were dressing in some other clubhouse on opening day, who carry a lot of baggage, some of it with the insignias of other teams.
That is the only way baseball fans can look at the continuing age of the rent-a-pitcher, the transient star, the movable savior. 
As long as cable money talks, teams like the Phillies will be able to bring in a reliable old hand like Roy Oswalt, who gave up only three hits in eight innings Sunday night as the Phillies beat the Giants, 6-1, to even the series at a victory each.
And teams like the Texas Rangers will be able to import a star like Cliff Lee, who pitches against -- and auditions for -- the Yankees in the Bronx on Monday night.
Imported players are nothing new -- the Yankeesmade a habit of it in the post-war era -- but the practice has grown since the advent of free agency in the late '70s, when teams had just about as much loyalty to expensive stars as expensive stars had to teams.
But the practice of rent-a-pitcher is becoming a plague on fans of smaller franchises, who watch guys they cheered (and whose expensive jerseys they bought) in the heady early days of the season.
Cleveland fans will not soon forget watching their beloved C.C. Sabathia laboring on short rest for the Brewers in 2008 with everybody knowing the big fella was showing his stuff and his heart to the highest bidders, that is to say, the Yankees. But now it happens every year.
Happened in Philadelphia on July 29, when the Phillies traded young talent for Oswalt, the gritty veteran pitcher who was toiling bravely for a bad team, the Astros. Oswalt got time off for good behavior, headed right into a pennant race.
Oswalt was economical Sunday, giving up no hits until Cody Ross, who hit two homers on Saturday, reached the left-center stands in the fifth inning.
Oswalt also started a four-run rally in the seventh in old-fashioned National League no-designated-hitter style with a hard single, taking second on a sacrifice, then running right through a stop sign at third base and sliding home on Placido Polanco's single to center. That is baseball.
''I say go for it,'' said his admiring manager, Charlie Manuel, after the fact. ''After he run the bases, what the heck are you going to do, rope him?''
This was exactly the kind of postseason game the Phillies hoped they would get from Oswalt, age 33, who was having a tough year, including having to rush home to Mississippi when a tornado destroyed his parents' home.
With the Phillies, he promptly won seven of eight decisions to help them reach the postseason. For a team with loot, it is standard business procedure to bring in a star pitcher, and it certainly is for the Phillies, who rented Lee for a World Series run last year.
Now Lee is with the Rangers, as of this moment, although his destiny seems to be to pitch for the Yankees next year. There is no doubt he will pitch as well as he can against them Monday in front of the yapping hordes of the Bronx, who will probably not temper their verbal abuse despite knowing he could be theirs next spring.
Pitchers move around. Good old Andy Pettitte, who starts another big game for the Yankees, was devalued by George Steinbrenner and spent three years in Houston.
Look at Roy Halladay, who gave up four runs Saturday night after pitching a no-hitter in his previous start in the postseason. Halladay approved a trade from Toronto in the off-season just to be part of a team that could be playing this deep into October. There is no point in fans lamenting the power of money, since the players think it is a wonderful idea, and would like more of it, wherever.
It's getting worse. Some Mets fans are still mourning the fire sale of David Cone one hot summer day in 1992, a sign the organization was giving up on that season, that generation. He pitched Toronto into the post-season, and got the hang of it, and in 1995 he came over to the Yankees and nearly pitched them past Seattle in that epic first-round series. For a competitor like Cone, it was kind of cool being a rent-a-pitcher. Not for the sensitive or the squeamish. Walk into a clubhouse and say, Hi, guys.
Rent-a-pitchers go way back. The Yankees could not work out a deal for Pedro Ramos in 1964 until after the Aug. 31 deadline, but they watched him banter with Mickey Mantle about who could run faster and they watched him save eight victories in September. They lost the World Series partially because Pistol Pete was not eligible.
The opposite dynamics were in effect early in the 1956 season when the Brooklyn Dodgers picked up Sal Maglie, who had tormented them in earlier days with the crosstown Giants. Maglie and the Dodgers' Carl Furillo hated each other, but when Maglie walked into the Dodgers' tiny clubhouse he and Furillo traded a common Italian expression, ''Hey, paesan,'' and later they bonded over drinks in a reporter's suite. Maglie pitched a no-hitter and the Dodgers won the pennant. The spirit of Sal the Barber lives on. At higher prices.

HEADLINE: Finish Line Comes With A Real High: 8,000 Feet

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
ATOP MOUNT LEMMON, Ariz. -- The New York marathon is a walk in the park compared with what took place up the side of this mountain on Sunday. Boston's famed Heartbreak Hill? A molehill.
In what was billed as the world's toughest road marathon, 26.2 miles at high altitude that went up and up and then up some more, hundreds of runners huffed and puffed up one of Tucson's highest peaks.
They did it for bragging rights, for the challenge, for the health benefits, for the pure absurdity of it all. 
''Runners are like fishermen,'' said Bart Yasso, a well-known marathoner who was on hand as a celebrity guest, not a participant. ''They're going to talk about how steep this race was forever. It's steep. It's tough. But it will get steeper every time they tell it.''
It was indeed a steep and long and winding route -- even in a car. It followed the General Hitchcock Scenic Byway from the cactus and desert landscape of the Sonoran Desert to the pine forest of the Catalina Mountains. Along the way were not just mile markers but altitude signs showing runners that they were climbing, from about 3,000 feet above sea level at the start to more than 8,000 feet at the finish line.
Whether it is the toughest race is open to debate. The Pikes Peak Marathon climbs over 7,700 feet to the top of the 14,115-foot mountain in Colorado, and it passes not over pavement but dirt tracks, rocks and other obstacles. The Everest Marathon is certainly no slouch. And there is the Antarctic Ice Marathon, in which participants crunch atop snow and ice.
Those who took part in the first Mount Lemmon Marathon ran the gamut, from weekend warriors to die-hard runners who no longer consider a run-of-the-mill marathon a challenge. With the glut of triathlons, ultramarathons and other such races, there seems to be more and more runners who need more than 26 miles to break a sweat.
''To be honest, I just decided two days ago to do this,'' said James Miles, 25, the winner. It was only his third marathon, and the first one he won. His time, 3 hours, 13 minutes and 42 seconds, was more than a half-hour longer than his personal best, which he attributed to the steep inclines and thinner air.
There was also the temperature to deal with, which ranged from the high 80s to so chilly in some mountain passes that racers could see their breath.
''Your legs are getting tired and, at the same time, you're getting less air,'' Mr. Miles said, breathing heavily at the finish line. He suddenly leaned over and clutched the back of his thigh. ''Don't worry,'' he said. ''I'm just stretching. I'm not going to throw up.''
Among the runners was Pam Reed, 49, who has won the Badwater Ultramarathon, a 135-mile endurance test through Death Valley, and who, just for kicks, runs the Boston Marathon from finish to start before running it from start to finish with the rest of the pack.
''Why are people going further and harder and stronger?'' she asked. ''It makes other things in life seem much more doable. We have so many challenges in our lives with the economy and people losing their jobs and their homes. This is a way of defeating them and breaking the monotony of life.''
Ms. Reed said she had done higher altitude marathons than the one on Mount Lemmon, including one at 10,000 feet that had her gasping for air after 10 minutes. But even those races have considerable downhill parts, she said. All that Mount Lemmon offered in that regard was a little slope at the end.
''I don't love pain, but I do like challenges,'' Ms. Reed said. ''And unless something is difficult, it doesn't seem that satisfying.''
Ms. Reed just finished the Hawaii Ironman competition and is planning to run across the United States. When not running, she organizes the Tucson Marathon, which has more of a downhill route.
There were first-time marathoners who ran up Mount Lemmon, including Emily McGregor, 25, who was the first woman to cross the finish line at 3 hours, 59 minutes and 13 seconds. ''Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh,'' she said, repeating the phrase at least 15 times. Asked why she did it, she replied: ''If you can do this, any other marathon is a piece of cake, right?''
Nobody was sure what pace they ought to use to run uphill for so long.
''Everyone's asking me how to adjust their running, how many minutes they should add on,'' said Mr. Yasso, who writes for Runner's World magazine. ''I don't know what to tell them. I really don't. Some people are great on hills and others aren't. It will be grueling for everyone though.''
Laszlo Otvos, the race organizer, was ready for the worst. He had 10 ambulances on standby and a helicopter ready for medical evacuations. In the end, no serious injuries were reported.
One of those finishing near the top of the pack was Jordan Camastro, 27, who lives near the mountain. He is running a 100-mile race this coming weekend and used the uphill marathon as training.
''Once you conquer a regular marathon, you're left with a longing for more,'' he said. ''You reach a limit and then you push further. You reach that and then you do even more.''
Runners took buses back down the mountain this time. By next year, who knows, maybe some will run back down.

HEADLINE: New Tactic in California For Paying Pollution Bill

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
STOCKTON, Calif. -- Officials who have tried and failed to clean the air in California's smog-filled San Joaquin Valley have seized on a new strategy: getting millions of drivers to shoulder more of the cost.
Faced with a fine of at least $29 million for exceeding federal ozone limits, the San Joaquin Valley's air quality regulators are proposing an annual surcharge of $10 to $24 on registration fees for the region's 2.7 million cars and trucks beginning next year. A decision is expected when the governing board meets on Thursday. 
Although the surcharge is not expected to change how much people drive or what cars or trucks they buy, air pollution experts say it is a harbinger of the future. After decades of forcing industry to clean its smokestacks, retool car and truck engines and fine-tune gasoline, regulators are exploring what they can do to force consumers to face up to the pollution they cause.
''We, the people, are the ones whom we need to point the finger at,'' said Seyed Sadredin, executive director of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, which administers federal and state pollution laws here.
While it already uses registration fees to support part of its budget, it is extremely unusual, if not unprecedented, for such an agency to make a point of penalizing drivers for the smog they create.
''I think it's fair to say that this is the first time that a strategy has been directly targeted at the consumer, not at the manufacturer of the car or the manufacturer of the engine or of all the other pieces,'' said Susana M. Hildebrand, the chief engineer for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
A provision of the Clean Air Act that sets fines for exceeding pollution limits originally required industrial companies to pay them; in fact, the provision, which was added to the law in 1990, was specifically devised ''as a hammer to get them to do more,'' as Mr. Sadredin put it.
Today, vehicles are responsible for four-fifths of the region's smog-forming pollution.
This year, regulators here and around the country got the Environmental Protection Agency's approval to try alternative approaches like the surcharge. The California Legislature had already given the San Joaquin district the authority to impose fees up to $24 after regulators argued that local industries had done everything technologically feasible to control their emissions.
''We're saying that for the privilege of driving in the valley, paying an extra $1 a month is preferable to charging industry $29 million,'' Mr. Sadredin said.
Proceeds from the fees, he said, will be used to invest in pollution control. The executive director of the regional air agency for the traffic-clogged Los Angeles area, which is also in line for a multimillion-dollar fine, signaled in a recent interview that he hoped to follow the Central Valley's lead.
The agency is likely to add a $3 surcharge to vehicle registration fees for the area's 12 million vehicles if it gets a waiver from the Legislature.
''This is a prelude of things to come,'' said Barry Wallerstein, the executive director of the agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which covers the four counties around Los Angeles. Consumer product choices in motor vehicles are ''now the dominant source of our ozone problem,'' he said.
Mr. Sadredin said that the San Joaquin region had recorded record lows for ozone pollution at various points in recent years. But as in many other places, levels continue to spike in late summer, largely because of the heat and back-to-school traffic.
The local surcharge plan comes as the Environmental Protection Agency prepares to announce tighter standards for ozone pollution. Those new rules are likely to put many regions of the country that are currently in compliance in the same position as Central and Southern California -- facing big fines for pollution that is largely a product of truck and automobile exhaust.
Robert Wyman, a Los Angeles lawyer who has frequently represented industrial clients, predicted that more local regulators would follow Mr. Sadredin's lead. ''The problems that L.A. and the San Joaquin Valley have been struggling with for a decade or more will be problems most metro areas will have to grapple with,'' he said.
Ms. Hildebrand of the Texas commission said, ''It will be interesting to see how it plays out politically, because people don't like it when government does that sort of thing.''
Indeed, this approach is not likely to go down well in Fresno, Merced or Stockton, where unemployment rates remain well above 15 percent.
''We're already in crisis,'' said Kojo Amonoo, 55, a Stockton resident who said he drives his pickup truck about 10 miles a day. ''There are people who are hurting. Whether you have a job or not, you drive. When you don't have a job, you need the vehicle to go around and look for jobs.''
Standing in the line outside the Department of Motor Vehicles office in Stockton on one recent afternoon was Amber Chamizo, a 27-year-old nursing student from the nearby city of Lodi who drives a Subaru Impreza. She said she had no problem with the extra fee.
''If vehicles are 80 percent of the problem, then it's fair,'' said Ms. Chamizo, who compared a possible $12 fee to a few drinks at Starbucks.
But Dennis Ruitenbeck, 57, a technical manager who drives a small sport utility vehicle, lamented that the Clean Air Act did not give the government discretion to waive the fine.
''While the San Joaquin area is so depressed, it's going to be an undue hardship,'' he said. ''Why put an extra burden on people who are suffering?''

HEADLINE: Governor Hopefuls Try to Prepare for a 7-Way Debate Ripe for the Unexpected

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Will the minor-party candidates gang up on him? Will his Republican rival, Carl P. Paladino, raise questions -- again -- about his former marriage? Will the discussion veer out of control, diminishing the front-runner along with the also-rans?
The seven-way debate for governor on Monday has forced Andrew M. Cuomo to confront the kind of situation he dislikes most: an utterly unpredictable one.
Intent on avoiding a gaffe that could upend the race, the famously methodical Mr. Cuomo has been consumed with debate preparation over the last week. He has rearranged his schedule and canceled some events to allow more time to get ready, while aides have debated over what approach to take on Monday evening, according to people involved in the campaign.
The potential for shock, revelation and self-immolation are all high: the cast includes not only Mr. Cuomo, the attorney general, and Mr. Paladino, a Buffalo real estate developer, but also a convicted former madam, a Black Panther turned left-wing city councilman, and a self-described actor, rent activist, karate expert and private investigator. ''We could end up with Andy Warhol meets Salvador Dali,'' said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved with any of the campaigns. 
The debate has become one of the most anticipated moments of political theater in recent New York history. Some of Mr. Cuomo's aides believe that New Yorkers will want to see Mr. Cuomo show a fighting spirit and lay into Mr. Paladino over his remarks about sexual orientation, abortion and people who receive public assistance. Others have urged Mr. Cuomo, who holds a commanding lead in a New York Times poll released on Monday, to play it safe and try to steer each question toward a discussion of Albany's problems and his proposed solutions.
Benjamin Lawsky, general counsel to the Cuomo campaign, suggested in a statement that the campaign was unified that Mr. Cuomo should seek to strike a balance.
''If it's relevant to governing or to the issues or to qualifications for achieving your agenda, fine,'' Mr. Lawsky said of potential attacks and counterattacks by the candidates. ''But we don't think voters want to hear about gutter personal nonsense that is irrelevant to the candidates' respective visions for the future of New York.''
Mr. Cuomo is also said to be concerned that Mr. Paladino might coordinate with other candidates, particularly Kristin Davis, the former madam, and Charles Barron, the city councilman, to pummel him simultaneously from the right and the left. Ms. Davis favors the legalization of marijuana, prostitution, same-sex marriage and casino gambling; Mr. Barron has fiercely criticized Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats for their record on racial and economic justice. Mr. Paladino and Ms. Davis also share an adviser, Roger Stone, the Republican operative and well-known mischief-maker.
Through intermediaries, Mr. Cuomo's campaign has sought intelligence on whether the other candidates were coordinating and how they planned to attack him, according to two people involved in the campaign. A spokesman denied that the campaign had sought such information. Mr. Barron, for his part, said he had little interest in coordinating with other candidates.
''I'm not there to entertain; I'm not there to spoil,'' said Mr. Barron, a Democrat from Brooklyn running on the Freedom Party line. ''I'm in it to win it.''
In a foretaste of what Mr. Cuomo and his advisers are grappling with, Mr. Barron made clear he would try to address sensitive issues like the New York Police Department's stop-and-search policy and the lack of any black or Latino candidates on the Democrats' statewide ticket.
''He is engaged in racial malign neglect of the black community,'' Mr. Barron said of Mr. Cuomo.
The debate, which will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island, has forced Mr. Cuomo to spend hours with his policy team devising answers to questions that the moderators might ask.
Two campaign aides, Peter E. Kauffmann and James Malatras, have compiled a thick binder with all of Mr. Cuomo's positions on issues and suggested answers to potential questions. But Mr. Cuomo has also spent hours arguing with his aides over those answers -- sometimes at the expense of rehearsing them, according to people involved in the campaign. Those people insisted on anonymity because Mr. Cuomo had not authorized them to discuss his preparations and because they believed the candidate would not appreciate being portrayed as anxious about the debate.
Mr. Cuomo also decided against holding a mock-debate session with aides playing other candidates and spent his final sessions having his staff pepper him with questions.
To some extent, both Mr. Paladino and Mr. Cuomo minimized their risks by requiring that the debate include all seven candidates. Even with 90 minutes of debate, each candidate will speak for only a few minutes.
But the prospect that the unpredictable Mr. Paladino might loft more accusations about Mr. Cuomo's personal life or former marriage -- live and in person -- has worried Mr. Cuomo.
''He's had this strategy of laying low, and this is kind of his coming out,'' said one Democrat who deals regularly with the campaign. ''The worry is that Paladino will do the personal stuff, and how does Andrew handle that?''
For Mr. Paladino, the stakes are different, though not necessarily lower. He has struggled in recent days to turn his campaign back to issues like rising Medicaid costs and property taxes, only to undermine himself with controversies of his own making, like the furor last week over his comments about gay pride parades.
Mr. Paladino is a lawyer by training but has never been in a debate, aides said. ''It's a real heavy lift, because Andrew's very good at it and Carl's never done it,'' said Michael R. Caputo, Mr. Paladino's campaign manager. ''So you have to approach on a more fundamental basis than just a politician preparing for a debate.''
Last week, Mr. Paladino consulted Jeanine F. Pirro, the former Westchester district attorney and a Republican who debated Mr. Cuomo during the 2006 campaign for attorney general. He devoted substantial time in recent days to meeting with policy experts. (Like Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Paladino opted against a dress rehearsal.) But he does not always take counsel, some who speak to him regularly said, and there is trepidation among some of his allies about whether he will learn enough by Monday to appear knowledgeable beside the more experienced Mr. Cuomo.
For all of Mr. Paladino's volatility, his advisers said they viewed the debate as an opportunity for him to reintroduce himself to skeptical voters and, perhaps, surprise them with his grasp of substantive issues.
''Andrew has defined Carl Paladino,'' Mr. Caputo said. ''Now is Carl's chance to define himself.''

HEADLINE: Will Apple's Culture Hurt The iPhone?

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- If you want a smartphone powered by Google's Android software, you could get Motorola's Droid 2 or its cousin, the Droid X. Then there is the Droid Incredible from HTC, the Fascinate from Samsung and the Ally from LG.
That's just on Verizon Wireless. An additional 20 or so phones running Android are available in the United States, and there are about 90 worldwide.
But if your preference is an Apple-powered phone, you can buy -- an iPhone.
That very short list explains in part why, for all its success in the phone business, Apple suddenly has a real fight on its hands. 
Americans now are buying more Android phones than iPhones. If that trend continues, analysts say that in little more than a year, Android will have erased the iPhone's once enormous lead in the high end of the smartphone market.
But this is not the first time Apple has found itself in this kind of fight, where its flagship product is under siege from a loose alliance of rivals selling dozens of competing gadgets.
In the early 1980s, the Macintosh faced an onslaught of competition from an army of PC makers whose products ran Microsoft software. The fight did not end well for Apple. In a few years, Microsoft all but sidelined Apple, and the company almost went out of business.
Can Apple, which insists on tight control of its devices, win in an intensely competitive market against rivals that are openly licensing their software to scores of companies? It faces that challenge not only in phones, but also in the market for tablet computers, where the iPad is about to take on a similar set of rivals.
''This is a really big strategic question,'' said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Company. ''No one knows whether openness will ultimately prevail as it did on the PC.''
Apple declined to comment on the issue.
By some measures, the competition Apple faces this time is even more formidable than it was in PCs. In addition to the Android family, Apple already competes with Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry.
And the iPhone will soon have one more powerful, and familiar, foe: Microsoft. That company's well-reviewed Windows Phone 7 software will appear in as many as nine new smartphones beginning next month. Others like Nokia cannot be counted out.
The stakes are huge, as the mobile computing market could prove to be larger than the PC market ever was.
No one is counting out Apple, of course. The iPhone 4, which Apple began selling this year, has been its most successful phone introduction yet. On Monday, when the company reports financial results, it is expected to announce that it sold nearly 12 million iPhones in the quarter ending Sept. 25, according to analysts' estimates. That would represent a 60 percent increase from a year earlier.
And with Apple expected to bring the iPhone to Verizon early next year -- most likely in an attempt to slow Android's momentum -- the sales growth may well accelerate.
Among investors, there is little doubt that Apple's strategy is the right one. The company's stock has soared nearly 50 percent this year, and on Friday it closed at an all-time high of $314.74.
But the rise of Android has been both sudden and unexpected, and its ascent highlights some of the advantages of an open approach.
''There is much more rapid innovation taking place in an open environment,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has written recent case studies on Apple. While Apple comes out with a new iPhone model once a year, slick Android phones with new features hit the market often.
That leaves little room for error at Apple. The company must continue to create hit products, as a single misstep could give Android and other rivals an opportunity to make inroads and steal market share.
Also, as the number of people with Android phones grows, Android will grow more attractive for app developers. For now, Apple's App Store, with more than 250,000 applications, enjoys a large advantage over the Android Market, which has about 80,000. And those numbers don't tell the whole story. Apps made for the iPhone tend to be of better quality, are more frequently downloaded and on average are more profitable for developers.
But that edge may not last, especially as many developers fret about Apple's tight control over the App Store.
''Having a tightly controlled ecosystem, which is what Apple has, is a large short-term advantage and a large long-term disadvantage,'' said Mitchell Kapor, who as founder of the Lotus Development Corporation is a veteran of the PC-versus-Mac wars, and is now an investor in app makers. ''The question is, how long is the short term?''
But for all the similarities in Apple's approaches to mobile computing and desktop computing, there are plenty of differences, and most analysts doubt that history will repeat itself.
For starters, Apple is the richest company in the technology industry. With $45.8 billion in cash, it can afford to invest heavily in research and development. Apple's large early lead in devices and developers puts it in a much stronger position than it ever had in the PC market. And because it is one of the largest purchasers of Flash memory, which is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone, it has ''enormous economies of scale,'' Professor Yoffie said.
What's more, the iPhone isn't really fighting alone. The two other devices that run Apple's iOS mobile software, the iPad and the iPod Touch, further strengthen the iPhone, because consumers like being able to access the content and applications they bought on iTunes and the App Store on multiple devices. Apple has sold more than 120 million iOS devices.
And while Apple's personal computers were by and large technically superior to Microsoft-based PCs, they were also far more expensive. In the smartphone market, carriers, who play a vital role in distribution, have been willing to subsidize the iPhone so that its cost to consumers is roughly the same as that of comparable Android phones.
For now, the smartphone market is growing so rapidly that the rise of Android has not necessarily been at the expense of the iPhone. That will change as the market matures. But most experts predict that no single company or operating system will rule the mobile market like Microsoft ruled the PC.
''I don't think we'll be in a situation where there is one operating system,'' said Matt Murphy, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, where he manages a fund that invests in applications for iOS devices. ''This market will be more fragmented than the PC market.'' Mr. Murphy said he expected one or two operating systems to co-exist with Apple's, though iOS is likely to remain the most lucrative for developers.
Professor Yoffie said: ''Apple will lose its overall leadership, but maintain a share of the market that could easily be in the 25 percent to 30 percent range.'' He added: ''That's enough to sustain a very large and very profitable business.''

HEADLINE: Testing a Student, and a System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''State Long Ignored Red Flags on Test Scores'' (front page, Oct. 11) doesn't mention New York City's forward-looking decision in 2007 to evaluate schools on how much each student knows at the end of the year compared with what she knew at the beginning.
This approach avoids the problems you describe with New York State's definition of ''proficiency,'' because it looks at each student's progress across the whole scale, rather than focusing on a single, arbitrary line, and better predicts high school success. 
Simultaneously, the city urged the state to adopt a similar system, which it is now starting to do.
James S. Liebman New York, Oct. 11, 2010
The writer, a professor at Columbia Law School, was chief accountability officer for the New York City Department of Education from 2006 to 2009.
To the Editor:
New York's deceptive test scores were not caused by making questions public after administering the test. States, including Massachusetts and Florida, have long made exam items public without any problems. Disclosure of SAT items, required for more than 20 years, created no score scandals.
The real problem is that New York officials, starting with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein, ignored the recommendations of assessment experts in pursuit of their shortsighted school ''reform'' agenda. By judging classrooms primarily on standardized exams, they encouraged testing gamesmanship. The predictable result, inflated scores without improved educational quality, is common in the No Child Left Behind era.
Parents, children and taxpayers would be far better served if politicians understood the well-documented limitations of standardized exams rather than continuing to pursue misguided high-stakes testing policies that undermine real learning.
Monty Neill Boston, Oct. 12, 2010
The writer is interim executive director of FairTest.
To the Editor:
You are right to bring the difficulties of high-stakes testing to light. But the true problem with the exams is not the one you cite; rather, it is obscured by the typical reaction to quantitative measures of teacher efficacy.
Politicians' use of the test scores for political gain has become rampant in the No Child Left Behind regime. By tweaking the test or the standards used to gauge proficiency, state and local officials can exert a great deal of influence on the scores under their jurisdiction.
Thus, the exams, and education itself, become far too politicized. Any tests and metrics used so extensively to grade our students, teachers and schools must be created and administered by third parties with no stake in the outcome.
Jeffrey Ober New York, Oct. 11, 2010
To the Editor:
Your article prompts the following question:
The National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association and many other professional organizations for decades have expressed their opposition to making educational decisions based on mandated standardized test scores. They have pointed out that diagnostic teaching is far better than standardized testing.
In light of the above, choose the best answer:
A. Cities do not pay attention to the views expressed in resolutions by professional organizations.
B. States do not pay attention to the views expressed in resolutions by professional organizations.
C. Teachers know what's going on in their classrooms.
D. All of the above.
Allen Berger Savannah, Ga., Oct. 11, 2010
The writer is a former chairman of the Resolutions Committee of the National Council of Teachers of English.
To the Editor:
You highlighted critical questions regarding the New York State Education Department's role in perpetuating the use of flawed test data. Three points demand a follow-up:
(1) The idea that teachers ''could gauge their students' performance better than mass-produced tests'':
Public schools in Finland, which rank first on international assessments, depend on teachers' assessments. How much of taxpayers' money has been wasted on flawed commercial tests instead of valuing teachers' assessments?
(2) Reviewing past tests accounts for the huge grade inflation:
Using past tests as test prep has been standard practice for decades. And would McGraw Hill's $80 million contract for interim assessments that mimic test questions count as test prep?
(3) Chancellor Joel I. Klein's proposal that the state Education Department adopt New York City's accountability system:
Since 85 percent of a New York City school's grade comes from test scores, Mr. Klein's proposal just perpetuates the problem. Isn't it time we support other factors when evaluating schools?
Deborah Meier Hillsdale, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2010
The writer is a founding principal of four New York City public schools.

HEADLINE: Sorkin: Felix Rohatyn Looks Back, and Sighs

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
In his DealBook column, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes about a conversation with Felix Rohatyn, the veteran investment banker who helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, advised RJR Nabisco on its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in the 1980s and sold Columbia Pictures to Sony in the 1990s.
About to publish a memoir about his major deals in finance, Mr. Rohatyn reveals some uneasiness about his own industry and its effect on society. ''No matter how much I try to be really objective, the financial community has not covered itself with glory in these last 50 years,'' he said. 
Deal Maker Looks Back, and Sighs
By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN
Felix G. Rohatyn, one of Wall Street's last old wise-men, was sitting in his office at Lazard overlooking the Empire State Building on Monday morning.
At 82, Mr. Rohatyn has quite a history: he helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, advised RJR Nabisco on its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in the 1980s and sold Columbia Pictures to Sony in the 1990s before becoming ambassador to France under President Bill Clinton. In the last decade, he returned to Wall Street, first to Lehman Brothers and now to his longtime home, Lazard.
Mr. Rohatyn, whose revealing memoir, ''Dealings: A Political and Financial Life'' (Simon & Schuster), comes out in two weeks, is a proud man and has a lot to be proud of.
But, surprisingly, he has also grown uneasy about his own industry and perhaps himself.
Mr. Rohatyn's self-aware views about the economy and Wall Street's effect on society are the sort that are often left unspoken. And I got the sense that he was worried about saying it himself.
''No matter what anybody says, there is a maldistribution of wealth in this country that I think is very unhealthy,'' he said, leaning back in his chair. ''It's very easy to fall into the mode of saying, well this whole thing is casinos and paper money.'' But he added, ''I don't think everyone in the financial community is a rogue - it's just that that's the way the world is.''
I asked him to explain why he thought this happened.
He paused for a moment, before indicting himself and the world he inhabits.
''The leveraged buyouts, the takeovers - and questionable behavior,'' he said matter-of-factly.He said that for much of his career, he, like so many in the financial industry, didn't spend much time reflecting on the larger implications of his work. But he said he had an awakening in 1986 as he was working on the sale of RJR Nabisco. It happened at an RJR board meeting.
''One of the directors was talking about stakeholders' rights. That got me,'' he said, referring to William Anderson.
''The experience with RJR had caused me to rethink my traditional bankers' calculus. The bottom line was no longer simply the bottom line - the ultimate cost of the profit had to be considered,'' he wrote in his book. ''The issues Bill Anderson had raised at RJR's board meeting about laid-off employees, damaged communities and cutbacks in employee benefits necessitated by higher corporate debt needed to be addressed.''
Still, almost 25 years later, he is grappling with how to fix a system built upon selling to the highest bidder.
''The trouble with this is that it is very difficult to quantify,'' he said of valuing the impact on all the other constituents. ''I am very troubled by my difficulty in trying to determine which was the better of the two deals.''
His book is filled with tales of deal-making and prominent names: the time Frank Sinatra came to meet with him; when Michael Ovitz told him over lunch that Matsushita wanted to buy MCA; and the scandal over ITT that plagued him for years.
For the most part, however, he does not use the book to settle scores. Surprisingly, he makes no mention of Steven Rattner, his former protege who, some say, pushed him out of Lazard. In 1996, Mr. Rohatyn uncharacteristically said Mr. Rattner was ''social climbing without doing any public service.'' Mr. Rattner went on to oversee the Obama administration's overhaul of the auto industry before becoming the subject of a pension fund fraud scandal, which he is in the process of trying to settle.
The closest Mr. Rohatyn comes to a swipe is his retelling of the time he was a candidate to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
''I began to hear that Alan Greenspan at the Fed and Bob Rubin at Treasury were unwilling to support my appointment,'' he wrote. ''I decided there was little point in trying to join a club where even your friends don't want to admit you.''
Mr. Rohatyn, who may be a bit of relic, seems to yearn for a different time, when deals were done over lunch and business wasn't a zero-sum game.
''The crisis of New York City was resolved by mutual respect. You don't see this very much in the present,'' he said. He explained how he was able to work with the unions because everyone had an interest in saving the city. ''We'd fight like hell during the day and then Victor and I would take our kids and go to a Chinese restaurant,'' he said of Victor Gotbaum, the municipal union leader.
He blames a cultural shift in business and politics. Of President Obama, for whom he voted, he says he is now disappointed. ''It's rather frightening mostly because of the collapse of the ability to communicate with other people in a civilized way. The world demands a relationship of mutual civility.''
Right before I left his office, I began to say, ''The world you inhabited - .'' Before I could finish my sentence, he jumped in with, ''is gone.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: DAYS TO ELECTION 15: Wielding Two-by-Fours Instead of Talking Points

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO - In Election 2010, there's no time for subtlety anymore.
Here in California and in much of the rest of the country, early voting has begun. Election Day itself arrives in 15 days.
That has President Obama and fellow Democrats racing, this week and next, to outrun the Republican wave. And as they rip into Republican adversaries, they're not mincing words.
Take Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who is battling Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, in her bid for a fourth term. Her television advertisements portray Ms. Fiorina as callously enriching herself while sending Hewlett-Packard jobs abroad; in an interview late last week, she excoriated her Republican rival as a failure. 
''She doesn't tell people that she got fired from that job,'' said Ms. Boxer, above. ''She doesn't tell people that the stock price went down more than 50 percent when she was there.
''She doesn't tell people she got a $20 million severance pay when she was fired. It would take the ordinary Californian 400 years working full time to make that much.''
Ms. Fiorina responded in kind. She accused Ms. Boxer of having ''destroyed jobs in our state'' while having ''become a multimillionaire since she came to the U.S. Senate.''
Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, came to Ms. Fiorina's aid over the weekend by calling Ms. Boxer ''the most bitterly partisan, antidefense senator'' and an ''unpleasant'' colleague to boot. Still, Ms. Boxer's feistiness and financial edge have given her a narrow lead.
Across the country, Democrats are scrambling to deflect voters' unhappiness with the party in power over the sputtering economy. In many cases, that is producing a counterattack of striking ferocity.
Sometimes that ferocity takes the form of discrediting their rivals' backgrounds, as in a release by the House Democratic Campaign Committee late last week titled ''Breaking News: Allen West (FL-22) Tied to Criminal Organization.'' (The campaign of Mr. West, who is challenging Representative Ron Klein of Florida, the Democratic incumbent, said he had no ties to the organization in question, a motorcycle group.)
Other times it involves linking their opponents' policy agendas to objects of their constituents' fear (China's economic might) or loathing (Wall Street executives). In Michigan, an ad for Representative Mark Schauer, a Democrat, accuses his Republican opponent, Tim Wahlberg, of helping businesses outsource jobs to China during his earlier service in the House. Mr. Wahlberg called the ad ''deceptive.''
As President Obama continues his cross-country barnstorming to save Democratic candidates, he is warning of dire consequences from Republican rule for college students, clean energy projects, Head Start beneficiaries, AIDS patients and others. Republicans insist these are distortions.
The president himself rarely mentions by name the Republican opponents of Democrats he is stumping for. His efforts are largely geared toward framing a national message and spurring Democratic turnout.
But a look at Mr. Obama's travel this week underscores the aggressiveness his party is displaying. He will appear with three veteran Democratic incumbents who are scrapping to extend their careers.
''Dino's out for himself and not on our side,'' says an ad for Senator Patty Murray of Washington slamming her Republican opponent, Dino Rossi, for having ''founded a bank with business lobbyists.'' Mr. Obama will appear with Ms. Murray on Thursday.
''Extreme and dangerous,'' an ad for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, says of his Republican opponent, the Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle. The president campaigns with Mr. Reid on Friday, after campaigning earlier that day with Ms. Boxer.
California would seem to be comparatively safe territory, since there, unlike in many other states, Mr. Obama retains a job approval rating above 50 percent. But virtually no Democrat can afford to let up in the final campaign sprint - and Ms. Boxer, one of the most outspoken feminists in Congress, isn't in her fight against Ms. Fiorina.
''She broke the glass ceiling when she got her job as C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard,'' Ms. Boxer concluded. ''But she got fired. She failed. So what she's bringing to the table is a failed record.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Old Maryland Rivals Face Off in a Changed Landscape

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

 BODY:
REISTERSTOWN, Md. -- Former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland, the only Republican to have held that position over the last four decades, thought he was done as a political candidate after the 2008 elections.
''I thought the state and the country had gone so hard left, away from everything I believed in,'' Mr. Ehrlich said in an interview after working a crowd of about 3,500 at an annual corn roast fund-raiser in this Baltimore suburb.
But the argument for change works both ways, and Mr. Ehrlich is back, asking voters to take another look after they rejected his bid for a second term. He is challenging Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who defeated him in 2006, in a contest that offers him a changed political environment. 
At the corn roast, where he spent nearly two hours posing for pictures with supporters, Mr. Ehrlich told the crowd about his speaking engagements after the 2008 elections, saying he met self-identified Democrats, Republicans and independents. What they had in common, Mr. Ehrlich said, was a desire to change how their state and federal governments were operating.
''Enough with the class warfare,'' Mr. Ehrlich said. ''Enough with the anti-success mentality.''
Mr. Ehrlich is one of five former governors around the country this year running to reclaim his old job. But Mr. Ehrlich's decision to take another crack at Mr. O'Malley sets up a contest unlike any other in the country -- it is November's sole rematch between major-party candidates in a governor's race, with two men who both have records to promote and to defend from his opponent's attacks.
Four years ago, Mr. O'Malley catapulted himself to victory at least in part by linking Mr. Ehrlich to President George W. Bush, even on issues seemingly unrelated to politics on the state level, like the war in Iraq. Mr. O'Malley captured 53 percent of the vote against Mr. Ehrlich, a former Princeton linebacker who even Democrats say is often affable and charming.
But this year, as Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Ehrlich try to woo voters on pocketbook issues in large part by assailing the other's record on taxes and the economy, observers in both parties acknowledge that the political landscape is much more challenging for Democrats than it was the last time the two men faced off.
''A lot of people are frustrated,'' said James T. Smith Jr., the Democratic county executive in Baltimore County, where Mr. Ehrlich is from and is looking to expand his share of the vote from four years ago. ''Some are angry, and most of that is related to the economy. But I don't get the sense they're blaming the governor.''
In a midterm campaign where voters have shown their willingness to lodge their disapproval with officeholders and establishment candidates from both parties, Mr. O'Malley's camp and other Democrats wonder whether Mr. Ehrlich can win over enough independents and disaffected Democrats in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly two to one.
(Both campaigns say they believe that Mr. Ehrlich faces an uphill battle in the race's final stretch, though he speaks confidently of his chances.)
''For Bob Ehrlich to win, he has to run a perfect campaign -- and he knows it,'' said Howard Denis, a former Republican member of the Montgomery County Council who has been advising the Ehrlich campaign. ''I happen to think he will.''
Mr. O'Malley, a former Baltimore mayor who still occasionally picks up his guitar to play a set with his Celtic rock band, also appears to have an asset that might not be much of one in other states: the full-throated support of President Obama, who remains popular among blacks, an important voting bloc here.
At a get-out-the-vote rally this month headlined by the president in Prince George's County, just outside Washington, Mr. O'Malley embraced Mr. Obama's policies -- and, as he often does on the campaign trail, put the blame for the country's economic troubles squarely at the feet of Mr. Bush and other Republicans.
''The last fellow took eight years to drive our economy into a ditch,'' Mr. O'Malley told the raucous crowd of several thousand at Bowie State University, a historically black institution, echoing a line used almost daily by Mr. Obama. ''And now they wonder why any mortal human being can't make it right as rain again in 18 months.''
Mr. O'Malley also frequently makes the case that his state's residents need a governor who is ''on your side.'' He often points out that Maryland was the only state in the nation that froze in-state college tuition for four straight years, and says it increased 40 percent when Mr. Ehrlich was governor.
Mr. O'Malley has also raised questions about how his opponent spent his time out of office, calling Mr. Ehrlich a lobbyist (even though he never registered as one). He released a radio advertisement earlier in the campaign that attempted to link Mr. Ehrlich to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in part because of work his law firm did with big oil companies, although none of those were BP.
For his part, Mr. Ehrlich, who has also served in the legislature and Congress, said that Mr. O'Malley's ''pseudopopulism'' is divisive, and that Mr. O'Malley has fostered a regulatory environment that is hostile to small business and entrepreneurs.

Ehrlich Jr., the Republican he unseated four years ago.

HEADLINE: White House Urges Calm On Lenders

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Amid a rising uproar over slipshod bank foreclosure practices, members of the Obama administration on Sunday expressed anger about the revelations, but urged caution as multiple investigations into the crisis unfold.
In a piece posted on the Huffington Post Web site, Shaun Donovan, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, wrote: ''The notion that many of the very same institutions that helped cause this housing crisis may well be making it worse is not only frustrating -- it's shameful.''
But, he added, ''a national, blanket moratorium on all foreclosure sales would do far more harm than good, hurting homeowners and home buyers alike at a time when foreclosed homes make up 25 percent of home sales.'' 
It was the second effort in two weeks by the administration to deflect pressure for a national moratorium on foreclosures. In televised comments last Sunday, David Axelrod, a senior White House adviser, urged moderation, saying there were foreclosures with valid documents ''that probably should go forward.''
Given the outrage over the foreclosure revelations in the last two weeks, the administration's comments Sunday sounded like an appeal for calm and restraint. They may also signal an attempt to defuse the potential for a party rift on the issue. Some Democratic leaders, including Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader from Nevada, have supported a nationwide moratorium.
On Wednesday, all 50 state attorneys general promised to conduct their own inquiries into foreclosure abuses, which center on accusations that banks cut corners in a rush to get signatures on thousands of documents required for the proceedings.
That move came after a number of the country's largest banks announced partial or total halts to foreclosures. Bank of America last week announced a moratorium on foreclosures in all 50 states, while JP Morgan Chase halted action in 41 states.
With no clear idea of the financial implications of this legal morass, bank stocks have swooned. Shares in Bank of America, for example, were off by 9.1 percent last week. Some analysts have suggested that Bank of America failed to set aside enough money to cover any number of potential liabilities -- including buying back loans that were not appropriately processed -- raising the prospect that it and other banks could face bigger losses related to foreclosure transactions.
As the foreclosure abuses have come to light, the Obama administration has resisted calls for a more forceful response, worried that added pressure might spook the banks and hobble the broader economy. But members of the administration who weighed in on the subject on Sunday signaled that there were no plans to alter their tone or tactics.
In an interview on C-Span, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila C. Bair, suggested the fallout from this issue might not be as severe as many now predict.
''If it turns out this is just a process issue, then I don't anticipate the exposures to be significant,'' she said on ''Newsmakers.''
''If it turns out to be something more fundamental, then we'll have to deal with that,'' she said. ''But I think we need to get all the information before we jump to any conclusions.''
The full extent of the foreclosure mess is still coming into focus. Congress has called for a hearing on the subject, and the housing market in certain parts of the country has come to a near standstill.
The officials on Sunday stopped short of announcing a criminal investigation, and did not suggest that one was imminent. Instead, Mr. Donovan wrote that the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force -- a coalition of federal agencies and United States attorney's offices -- has made the foreclosure issue ''priority No. 1,'' adding that Attorney General Eric Holder has said that if wrongdoing was discovered by the task force, it ''will take the appropriate action.''
''Banks must follow the law,'' Mr. Donovan wrote on The Huffington Post, ''and those that haven't should immediately fix what is wrong.''
If the goal of running the article in the Huffington Post was to win over converts among its liberal readership, it did not seem to work. ''We don't need a diagnosis, Einstein. We would like your department to do something about it,'' wrote one reader in the site's comments section.
Another said that the moment for stern talk had long since passed, writing, ''The time to get tough was when it first became evident that the crash was caused by unconscionable greed and criminal fraud, misfeasance, malfeasance, and hubris on the part of Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Hold Out Some Hope

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
With little more than two weeks left before the midterm elections, the White House on Sunday predicted that Democrats would hold onto their majorities in the House and the Senate. 
Though many political analysts and polling data indicate the Democrats could well lose their majority in the House on Nov. 2 and possibly even their nine-seat majority in the Senate, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' cited a ''new excitement'' and ''shrinking enthusiasm gap'' working in the Democrats' favor. Among other things, he pointed to the large numbers of people planning to turn out for Sunday's joint appearances by President Obama and his wife, Michelle, at campaign stops in Ohio.
''Come election night, we'll retain control of both the House and the Senate,'' Mr. Gibbs said flatly in the television interview.
That was a seemingly more optimistic forecast than a much-chewed-over statement he made in July when he was asked whether the House majority was in jeopardy. At the time, he said, ''There's no doubt that there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control -- there's no doubt about that.''
However, David Axelrod, the senior White House adviser, seemed more guarded in his assessment when he appeared Sunday on CNN's ''State of the Union,'' predicting that the Republicans would eat into the Democratic majorities.
''The Republicans will have more seats in Congress regardless of whether they have control or not,'' he conceded.
But he also assailed the Republicans for their unwillingness to work with Democrats during the first two years of Mr. Obama's presidency on such issues as an economic stimulus program.
''One of our great disappointments was that the Republican Party made a political decision essentially not to cooperate,'' he said.
The White House, he said, would ''continue to reach out'' and '' look for common ground'' and he expressed the hope that with a larger Republican presence in Congress ''comes a greater sense of responsibility.''
''I think it's up to us to extend our hand, as we have before,'' he said. ''It's up to them to decide whether they're going to take it or whether they're going to do what they've done for the last two years.''
Mr. Gibbs said that whatever disaffection Americans have with the Democratic Party was not because of the president's policies but because of the difficult economic picture, with 8 million jobs having been lost and unemployment at 9.6 percent, a situation he largely blamed on the previous Republican administration.
''I think at the end of the day, people are going to understand that message and not turn over control of Congress to people that want to take us back to what we're trying to get out of,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths VIESER, RICHARD WILLIAM

 BODY:
VIESER--Richard William, 82, passed away peacefully on October 14th. Mr. Vieser was an esteemed corporate leader who achieved a national reputation for success in rebuilding, managing and transforming a wide range of businesses in the electronics, defense, oil and gas, automotive and medical fields. A native of New Jersey, he was among the pioneers of the leveraged buyout industry having worked with both Forstmann Little & Co and Hicks Muse before retiring in 1989. After retirement, Mr. Vieser maintained an active presence in business by serving on the boards of some twenty organizations, including prominent firms such as Varian Medical, where he served as Chairman, Fisher Scientific, Dresser Industries, Control Data Corporation, Ceridian and Viasystems. Mr. Vieser was a generous and loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. 
He is survived by his beloved wife of fifty-nine years, Lois (Johnson) and five adoring children, Richard (and Patricia) of Bernardsville, NJ, Cheryl (Vieser) Kleckner of Alpharetta, GA, Cynthia (Vieser) and Joseph Falco of Madison, NJ, William John David of Madison, NJ and Jaime (and Melinda) of London, UK. He also leaves behind a wide circle of family and friends, including his nine beloved grandchildren, Donald, Francecsa, David, Joseph, Anne, Katherine, Alexandra, Bella and his namesake, Richard William. Born in the Vailsburg section of Newark, New Jersey, on November 14, 1927, Mr. Vieser spent his formative years in South Orange, New Jersey, where he graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood. He was a member of a state championship baseball team in high school and active in scouting where he attained the distinction of Eagle Scout at the age of 15. After a year at Lafayette College, Mr. Vieser entered the U.S. Army in September 1946. He served sixteen months in Korea as a member of the Army of Occupation and was discharged in April 1948. Being a proud American with unwavering patriotism, he felt these years were some of the most formative of his life. Mr. Vieser re-entered Lafayette, where he was a member of Theta Delta Chi Fraternity, serving as its President in his senior year. His business career began as a trainee at AT&T headquarters in New York City. Mr. Vieser later joined Chatham Electronics Corporation where he oversaw construction of a new factory in Livingston, New Jersey that manufactured highly specialized electron tubes used in the DEW line and other early missile warning systems across Canada and the Arctic. Mr. Vieser went on to hold major executive positions, as Chatham Electronics was part of a series of corporate acquisitions and mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, involving such major and well-known businesses as Tung Sol Electric, Wagner Electric, Studebaker and Worthington Pump Company - ultimately leading to the formation of Studebaker-Worthington. Throughout the series of corporate changes, he continued his rapid rise in leadership positions. Mr. Vieser served as Executive Vice President of StudebakerWorthington and ultimately as Chief Operating Officer. After McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington in 1979, he was appointed Executive Vice President and later President and Chief Operating Officer of McGraw-Edison. When McGraw-Edison was acquired by Cooper Industries, Mr. Vieser was invited to join Forstmann Little & Co. While there, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of three Forstmann Little companies, Lear Siegler Corporation, FL Industries and Midland-Ross Corporation. He also served as Chairman of the National Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association, where he hosted numerous foreign trade missions at the request of the U.S. State Department and received honors from the states of New Jersey, Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi. Mr. Vieser was an avid historian and voracious reader, with a profound love for music, art and travel. He was greatly involved in historical preservation and philanthropy. Mr. Vieser was a member of the President's Council of Colonial Williamsburg and a Trustee of Winterthur Museum. Mr. Vieser was an avid golfer and a member of several golf clubs, including famed courses such as Baltusrol, Pine Valley, and Morris County in New Jersey and Ocean Forest and Sea Island in Georgia. Mr. Vieser was devoted to his family and his friends. His enormous spirit, sense of humor, kindness and love for life inspired all those who knew him. He believed life was something to be celebrated. His greatest joy was to be with his family and friends around the dinner table. He especially treasured spending time with his family at his farm in New Hampshire in front of a roaring fire or enjoying a beautiful sunset. His infectious laugh, heart-warming smile, generous heart and beautiful spirit will never leave us. Relatives and friends are invited to call Monday, October 18, 2-4 and 7-9pm at the William R. Dangler Funeral Home, 309 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ (908-273-2323). Funeral Services will be on Tuesday, Oct. 19, 10am at Calvary Episcopal Church, Summit.

HEADLINE: Kansans Scoff at Global Warming but Embrace Cleaner Energy

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
SALINA, Kan. -- Residents of this deeply conservative city do not put much stock in scientific predictions of climate change.
''Don't mention global warming,'' warned Nancy Jackson, chairwoman of the Climate and Energy Project, a small nonprofit group that aims to get people to rein in the fossil fuel emissions that contribute to climate change. ''And don't mention Al Gore. People out here just hate him.''
Saving energy, though, is another matter.
Last Halloween, schoolchildren here searched for ''vampire'' electric loads, or appliances that sap energy even when they seem to be off. Energy-efficient LED lights twinkled on the town's Christmas tree. On Valentine's Day, local restaurants left their dining room lights off and served meals by candlelight. 
The fever for reducing dependence on fossil fuels has spread beyond this city of red-brick Eisenhower-era buildings to other towns on the Kansas plains. A Lutheran church in nearby Lindsborg was inspired to install geothermal heating. The principal of Mount Hope's elementary school dressed up as an energy bandit at a student assembly on home-energy conservation. Hutchinson won a contract to become home to a $50 million wind turbine factory.
Town managers attribute the new resolve mostly to a yearlong competition sponsored by the Climate and Energy Project, which set out to extricate energy issues from the charged arena of climate politics.
Attempts by the Obama administration to regulate greenhouse gases are highly unpopular here because of opposition to large-scale government intervention. Some are skeptical that humans might fundamentally alter a world that was created by God.
If the heartland is to seriously reduce its dependence on coal and oil, Ms. Jackson and others decided, the issues must be separated. So the project ran an experiment to see if by focusing on thrift, patriotism, spiritual conviction and economic prosperity, it could rally residents of six Kansas towns to take meaningful steps to conserve energy and consider renewable fuels.
Think of it as a green variation on ''What's the Matter with Kansas?'' Ms. Jackson suggested, referring to the 2004 book by Thomas Frank that contended that Republicans had come to dominate the state's elections by exploiting social values.
The project's strategy seems to have worked. In the course of the program, which ended last spring, energy use in the towns declined as much as 5 percent relative to other areas -- a giant step in the world of energy conservation, where a program that yields a 1.5 percent decline is considered successful.
The towns were featured as a case study on changing behavior by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. And the Climate and Energy Project just received a grant from the Kansas Energy Office to coordinate a competition among 16 Kansas cities to cut energy use in 2011.
The energy experiment started as a kitchen-table challenge three years ago.
Over dinner, Wes Jackson, the president of the Land Institute, which promotes environmentally sustainable agriculture, complained to Ms. Jackson, his daughter-in-law, that even though many local farmers would suffer from climate change, few believed that it was happening or were willing to take steps to avoid it.
Why did the conversation have to be about climate change? Ms. Jackson countered. If the goal was to persuade people to reduce their use of fossil fuels, why not identify issues that motivated them instead of getting stuck on something that did not?
Only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is ''solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,'' a poll conducted in the fall of 2009 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed -- far fewer than in other regions of the country.
The Jacksons already knew firsthand that such skepticism was not just broad, but also deep. Like opposition to abortion or affirmations of religious faith, they felt, it was becoming a cultural marker that helped some Kansans define themselves.
Nevertheless, Ms. Jackson felt so strongly that this opposition could be overcome that she left a job as development director at the University of Kansas in Lawrence to start the Climate and Energy Project with a one-time grant from the Land Institute. (The project is now independent.)
At the outset she commissioned focus groups of independents and Republicans around Wichita and Kansas City to get a sense of where they stood. Many participants suggested that global warming could be explained mostly by natural earth cycles, and a vocal minority even asserted that it was a cynical hoax perpetrated by climate scientists who were greedy for grants.
Yet Ms. Jackson found plenty of openings. Many lamented the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Some articulated an amorphous desire, often based in religious values, to protect the earth. Some even spoke of changes in the natural world -- birds arriving weeks earlier in the spring than they had before -- leading her to wonder whether, deep down, they might suspect that climate change was afoot.
Ms. Jackson settled on a three-pronged strategy. Invoking the notion of thrift, she set out to persuade towns to compete with one another to become more energy-efficient. She worked with civic leaders to embrace green jobs as a way of shoring up or rescuing their communities. And she spoke with local ministers about ''creation care,'' the obligation of Christians to act as stewards of the world that God gave them, even creating a sermon bank with talking points they could download.
Relatively little was said about climate.
''I don't recall us being recruited under a climate change label at all,'' said Stacy Huff, an executive for the Coronado Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which was enlisted to help the project. Mr. Huff describes himself as ''somewhat skeptical'' about global warming.
Mr. Huff said the project workers emphasized conservation for future generations when they recruited his group. The message resonated, and the scouts went door to door in low-income neighborhoods to deliver and install weatherization kits.
''It is in our DNA to leave a place better than we found it,'' he said.
Elliot Lahn, a community development planner for Merriam, a city that reduced its energy use by 5 percent, said that when public meetings were held on the six-town competition to save energy, some residents offered their view that global warming was a hoax.
But they were very eager to hear about saving money, Mr. Lahn said. ''That's what really motivated them.''
Jerry Clasen, a grain farmer in Reno County, south of Salina, said he largely discounted global warming. ''I believe we are going through a cycle and it is not a big deal,'' he said. But his ears pricked up when project workers came to town to talk about harnessing wind power. ''There is no sense in our dependency on foreign oil,'' he said, ''especially since we have got this resource here.''
Mr. Clasen helped organize a group of local leaders to lobby the electronics and energy giant Siemens to build a wind turbine factory in the area. When the company signed a deal in 2009 promising to create as many as 400 local jobs, it stirred a wave of excitement about the future of wind power.
Now, farmers expect to lease some of their land for turbines and rely on wind power as a stable source of income, he said, and land prices are rising as result.
''Whether or not the earth is getting warmer,'' he said, ''it feels good to be part of something that works for Kansas and for the nation.''

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Rides Global Focus on Services to Deliver a 12% Increase in Profit

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The leading high-technology industrial companies like Intel, General Electric and I.B.M., which have reported quarterly results in the last several days, are seen by analysts and economists as bellwethers of the economy, because their chips, equipment and services are used in so many industries.
But the quarterly scorecards from such giants of corporate America increasingly point to trends in the global economy rather than at home. Large technology companies typically have most of their sales overseas, and they are tilting more abroad to pursue the fast-growing markets in China, India and elsewhere. 
The current wave of globalization, analysts say, is different from in the past. Now companies are also spreading work and production worldwide to improve productivity and profits.
The migration abroad of sales and operations, analysts say, also helps explain why American corporations are in good health, while the economy sputters and unemployment remains high.
''The success of large corporations that are headquartered in the United States has less and less to do with the success of the American economy,'' said Robert B. Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.
The global stance of many big corporations is contributing to a projected 35 percent jump in profits this year among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500.
For the last six quarters, Wall Street has underestimated the profits of S.&.P. 500 companies by an average of 10 percent, and Edward Yardeni, an independent economist, says analysts are struggling to keep up. ''It's really hard for them to model into their spreadsheets the full impact of globalization,'' Mr. Yardeni said.
I.B.M. is at the forefront of the recent wave of globalization. In reporting its third-quarter results on Monday, I.B.M. said it received a lift from strong growth in big emerging markets, led by China, India, Brazil and Russia, where revenue jumped 29 percent. A broader category earmarked by I.B.M. as growth markets, which include South Africa, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, experienced a 16 percent increase in revenue.
''The real slugger in the quarter was the growth markets,'' Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said.
Last month, I.B.M. announced that it had cinched a large deal in Africa to provide the technology behind new cellphone services. The deal, a 10-year agreement with India's largest cellphone operator, Bharti Airtel, will be worth up to $1.5 billion, analysts estimate.
I.B.M. reported a 12 percent increase in net income to $3.6 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Its earnings of $2.82 a share were above the $2.75 estimate of Wall Street analysts.
Revenue was $24.3 billion, a 3 percent rise, and slightly above analysts' forecast of $24.1 billion.
I.B.M. raised its full-year earnings forecast to ''at least $11.40'' a share from ''at least $11.25.''
Still, part of the improvement in profits came from lower taxes. And the total of services contracts signed -- an indicator of future revenue -- was weaker than expected. I.B.M. said one big contract signed in early October, if signed a few days earlier, would have put total signings for the quarter at $12.7 billion, slightly above analysts' estimates.
After reaching a 52-week high during the day, I.B.M.'s stock price dropped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading.
The most far-reaching change at I.B.M. has been the global overhaul of its services and software businesses, which now account for 80 percent of revenue. The transformation was partly of necessity -- to address the competitive threat posed by low-cost Indian outsourcing companies including Infosys, Wipro and Tata.
In services, I.B.M viewed the Indian outsourcers as a challenge unnervingly similar to the one faced by its mainframe business in the early 1990s. In hardware, the new low-cost technology of microprocessors, used in personal computers, disrupted the mainframe business, sending its profits plummeting.
In the mainframe case, I.B.M.'s researchers saw the new technology and gave a warning in the 1980s. But shifting then would have required retooling plants and cutting workers, when I.B.M. was still comfortably profitable.
''Management waited until the tsunami was hitting before the action was taken,'' recalled Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a former I.B.M. executive.
Under Samuel J. Palmisano, who became chief executive in 2002, I.B.M. was determined to move earlier in services. Indian programmers worked for a fraction of the wages of their counterparts in America and Europe.
So the company expanded in India. In 2003, it had 9,000 workers in India. Today, it has more than 75,000, analysts estimate.
Cutting costs was a crucial step, but I.B.M. also shifted the focus of its research labs to services. Applying science and software automation to services has increased productivity and let I.B.M. do more sophisticated work with higher profit margins.
''In services, we got way ahead of the game,'' said Mr. Wladawsky-Berger, who retired from I.B.M. in 2007.
The transition has not come easily. I.B.M. sets aside about $400 million a year for severance costs and other payments to cut about 8,000 employees annually, analysts estimate. Since 2003, I.B.M. has cut its payroll in the United States by roughly 30,000 workers, to about 105,000.
I.B.M. has also hired thousands of workers in the United States, to tap new skills like data scientists and analysts, even as it cuts elsewhere. The trimming these days is a steady, evolutionary process by a company that is prospering -- not the drastic surgery of a company in deep trouble, as I.B.M. was in the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Prescription Drug Use Soared in Past Decade

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
If you are taking a prescription medicine and you are older than 60, it is probably a cholesterol-lowering drug. If you are 20 to 59, it is more likely to be an antidepressant. 
These are just two findings from a recent report from the National Center for Health Statistics on the increasing use of prescription drugs from 1999 to 2008.
Among people older than 60, the researchers found, about 88 percent were using at least one medicine, and more than one-third were taking five or more.
''People may be taking too many drugs -- that's a big concern in the older age groups,'' said Dr. Qiuping Gu, the epidemiologist who led the research. ''When you see such a big percentage taking five or more drugs, side effects and safety become very serious issues.''
Almost 45 percent of people over 60 now take cholesterol-lowering prescription medicine, more than twice the rate in 1999.
Even among children under 12, more than 22 percent were using at least one prescription drug (most commonly for asthma), and so were almost 30 percent of teenagers.
Among adolescents, the most commonly used drugs were for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related conditions -- 6 percent in 2008, up from 3 percent in 1999. ''That's a significant trend,'' Dr. Gu said.
In the under-12 group, antibiotic use declined, and there was no statistically significant change in the use of other drugs.
Use also varied by sex, race and ethnicity. Women were heavier users than men, and white people used more prescription medicine than non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican-Americans.
Having health insurance, and especially prescription drug coverage, had a predictable effect: those with insurance were almost twice as likely to use drugs as those without.
The data came from the government's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, known as Nhanes, which examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 children and adults around the country each year. Unlike other such surveys, this one combines material from interviews and physical examinations.
The report also cited data finding that spending on prescription drugs more than doubled over the decade, even after accounting for inflation. In constant dollars, Americans spent more than $234 billion on prescription drugs in 2008, up from $104.6 billion in 1999. NICHOLAS BAKALAR
Correction: October 21, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the increasing use of prescription drugs in the last decade misstated the proportion of Americans older than 60 who reported taking five or more medicines. It is more than one-third, not more than two-thirds.

HEADLINE: Many Views On Recovery; Shared Hate For 'Glocal'

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
HERE is a look at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights from the 100th anniversary conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which a record 1,600 people attended from Wednesday through Saturday in Orlando, Fla.
HOW NOW, DOW JONES? Anyone who attended the conference hoping to learn more about the direction of the economy must have left confused.
Materials for the conference distributed by the association declared: ''Goodbye recession ... it's time to gear up for long-term, sustainable growth!'' Some speakers referred to the nation's economic woes in the past tense. 
Others took a different view. ''The world didn't end,'' Joseph V. Tripodi, chief marketing and commercial officer at the Coca-Cola Company, said in an interview before a speech he gave, but ''no one would say it is back'' to where it had been.
James D. Speros, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Fidelity Investments, declared, ''We're all feeling the pain of the economy in our businesses,'' and discussed ''the new frugality'' as consumers ''have reset the way they spend their dollars.''
The most pessimistic comments came from Paul Krugman, the economist and New York Times columnist, whose speech on Thursday was titled ''The (Dire) State of the Economy.'' He forecast ''a very painful, long period when recovery doesn't feel like recovery.''
Many attendees said they agreed with a subsequent speaker, Cindy Gallop, chief executive of If We Ran the World, who characterized his remarks as ''very depressing.''
IS TURNABOUT FAIR PLAY? For decades, marketers have interrupted consumers' lives with sales spiels. During the conference, the proverbial shoe was on the other foot as some of the sponsors of meals, receptions and parties subjected their captive audiences of attendees to infomercial-style pitches.
A luncheon on Thursday, sponsored by NBC Universal, was devoted to a panel discussion of ''The Journey of the Idea.'' But all the panelists, and the moderator, were executives at NBC Universal, and their remarks seemed rehearsed.
A concert that evening by the Goo Goo Dolls was preceded by a 20-minute presentation by the sponsor, Clear Channel Communications, of a case study of a music promotion with Subway restaurants. ''This made the NBC luncheon look good,'' said an audience member impatient to hear the band perform.
MUSIC, MAESTRO, PLEASE The Goo Goo Dolls, who played 16 songs in an hour, were only one of the many musical acts provided by sponsors. The country singer LeAnn Rimes sang a 10-song, 45-minute set, courtesy of the A&E Television Networks.
A reception on Friday, bankrolled by the Vevo music service, featured a five-song performance by Keri Hilson, a singer-songwriter in the rhythm-and-blues vein. At the dinner that followed, the Meredith Corporation presented a trio of Broadway divas -- Janet Dacal, Cady Huffman and LaChanze -- who sang for 30 minutes and signed autographs afterward.
A CONFERENCE WITH SWAG-GER As usual, attendees found all manner of giveaway goodies in their hotel rooms before and after conference sessions.
Vevo delivered CDs from Ms. Hilson, Maroon 5 and Sheryl Crow. There were bathrobes, courtesy of AOL; luggage tags and DVDs, courtesy of Bloomberg L.P.; books, courtesy of Powered; and customized candies, courtesy of Nielsen.
The most offbeat attention-getter was pieces of cardboard, resembling ''Do not disturb'' signs, that were affixed to shower heads in the bathrooms. ''Do your best ideas happen here?'' it asked, encouraging attendees to come to the NBC Universal luncheon.
GALAXY QUEST It is difficult to drum up attendance for the final general session of the conference, which this time took place on Saturday morning. To counter that, a speaker offered some special incentives.
At the end of his remarks, Ralph Santana, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Samsung Electronics North America, removed from his pocket a Samsung Galaxy Tab, a tablet that will compete against the AppleiPad when it comes out next month. He asked Robert D. Liodice, president and chief executive of the association, to run into the audience, choose a table at random and ask those sitting there to pick numbers from 1 to 10. Mr. Santana then wrote a number on a card.
After the attendees said their numbers aloud, Mr. Santana revealed that the card bore the number 5. Because no one had chosen 5, he said he would make arrangements to give tablets to the two attendees who had picked 3 and 4. Estimates for prices for the Galaxy have ranged from $400 to $649.
INSIDER VERBIAGE The conference always gives students of language an earful of industry jargon in vogue among marketers. This time, the always-popular ''touch point'' was heard constantly, as in ''experiential touch point,'' along with ''holistic'' and its variation ''holistic alignment''; ''incented'' and ''incentivized''; ''journey'' as a synonym for history or case study; ''go-to-market marketing''; ''team member,'' for employee; ''guest,'' for customer; and using ''benchmark'' and ''laser'' as verbs.
At a sponsored breakfast on Friday, the Starcom media agency -- part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe -- sent up jargonmania with the results of a poll, conducted through Facebook, to identify the least favorite buzzwords.
The winners, or losers, as selected by more than 15,330 respondents, were ''glocal,'' ''go viral,'' ''on the same page'' and ''out of the box.'' Starcom distributed 500 T-shirts bearing fanciful illustrations that ''translate those buzzwords into human language,'' said Lisa Donohue, chief executive of Starcom USA.

HEADLINE: Who's in Charge Here?

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Jane Buchan is a rarity in the big-money boys' club of hedge funds.
Amid the testosterone-fueled trading floors of Wall Street, Ms. Buchan has not only built a hugely successful hedge fund investment firm but also one that is, on paper, owned and run by women.
But questions have surfaced about whether her firm, Pacific Alternative Asset Management Company, is now -- or ever was -- controlled by women at all.
It turns out that S. Donald Sussman, a hedge fund mogul who has bankrolled some of the biggest (male) names in the business, has quietly stood behind Paamco for years, pocketing much of its profit. A recent court ruling officially put a chunk of Paamco's parent company in his hands. 
Equally troubling is the suggestion that Paamco, which collects tens of millions of dollars in fees annually to vet hedge funds for pension funds and other clients, disguised aspects of its own business from its customers, partners and federal regulators.
The arrangement with Mr. Sussman ''may have been designed to mislead a number of observers, from the tax authorities to the S.E.C. to entities wishing to invest in women-owned businesses,'' Judge Richard J. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in an August ruling in the case, which centered on a contract dispute between Mr. Sussman and Paamco.
In an e-mailed statement, Paamco said its relationship with Mr. Sussman had not been structured to mislead anyone and that the transaction in question had been properly treated, and approved by the firm's legal advisers and auditors.
Furthermore, Paamco said it had never taken any ''set aside'' business or minority mandates.
A lawyer for Mr. Sussman said in an e-mailed statement that Paamco executives ''relied on their own counsel and advisers'' and that they had built a ''world-class fund of funds business to the benefit of their investors.''
But from the start, Paamco trumpeted the fact that it was run by Ms. Buchan, one of only a handful of women who have made a big mark in the mostly male world of hedge funds.
The question raised by the lawsuit was whether Paamco's status as a company owned by women, albeit with a scant 51 percent majority for many years, gave it an edge over the competition.
Some states like Illinois and Ohio and corporations like Verizon steer a portion of their pension fund business to investment companies owned by women or minorities, which often fall into the category euphemistically referred to in the industry as ''emerging managers.''
For investment professionals trying to stand out in a crowded field, the designation can be ''a tool for competitive advantage,'' said Thurman V. White Jr., the chief executive officer of Progress Investment Management Company, a San Francisco-based firm that invests in emerging managers. ''It's clear they've had some benefits from these kind of initiatives,'' he said of Paamco.
Verizon Communications, for instance, hired Paamco as part of the Verizon Diversity Managers program, which was established in the late 1990s to attract funds managed by minorities. Ms. Buchan's firm oversees a small part of the communication company's $28.6 billion pension fund. In recent state budget and presentation materials, public pension funds in California and Pennsylvania highlighted Paamco's status as a firm owned by women.
Documents and depositions related to the case involving Mr. Sussman paint a somewhat different picture. The case centered on whether Mr. Sussman had the right to convert a $2 million loan he made to Paamco's founding partners in 2000 into an equity stake in Paamco's parent company. In a countersuit, Paamco's founding partners claimed the interest Mr. Sussman had charged them violated state laws that set maximum rates on loans.
Paamco, according to the documents, went to great lengths to avoid disclosing that Mr. Sussman had bankrolled its early operations, helped select the name of the firm and had been ''periodically'' consulted. Moreover, he collected 40 percent of the profit and, at any time, could lay claim to a big stake in the parent company of Paamco.
There was another reason to keep Mr. Sussman off the radar. In 1997, Mr. Sussman, who had earlier withdrawn his investment adviser registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, settled a claim with the commission that he had failed to disclose a loan he made from a hedge fund he controlled to acquire a building that was used as offices.
In a deposition taken a year ago, James L. Berens, a Paamco co-founder, said there were ''two important factors'' behind why the firm had structured its relationship with Mr. Sussman as it did: ''The first was the potential impact of disclosing Mr. Sussman's involvement on our Form ADV,'' a registration filing with the S.E.C.
''And the second was our -- the potential to have status as a majority female-owned entity.''
The designation as women-owned could ''lead to consideration for engagement as an investment manager to an extent that otherwise wouldn't be the case,'' Mr. Berens continued. The four founding executives agreed to give Ms. Buchan and another female partner, Judith F. Posnikoff, 51 percent of the firm.
Paamco's relationship with Mr. Sussman dates back to 2000, when Ms. Buchan and three other individuals approached him about providing financing for a new hedge fund investment venture.
Ms. Buchan, a former All-Ivy League high jumper at Yale who later earned a Ph.D. in business economics from Harvard, was a rising star in the hedge fund world. She had developed a reputation while at another investment firm for digging deep into the records of hedge fund managers to determine what was real and what was fraudulent about their returns.
Mr. Sussman, the founder of Paloma Partners in Greenwich, Conn., provided early financing to dozens of hedge fund managers, including David Shaw of D. E. Shaw & Company.
At first, Mr. Sussman agreed to invest $2 million for a 40 percent ownership stake in the firm with Ms. Buchan and her three partners contributing a total of $10,000, according to the complaint filed last year against Paamco by Mr. Sussman.
But a few weeks later, Ms. Buchan and her partners told Mr. Sussman they wanted his contribution to be made as a loan rather than an equity stake. In doing so, the partners believed they could hide Mr. Sussman's relationship from investors and regulators, according to the depositions.
Later, when Paamco created the parent company, the principals once again wanted Mr. Sussman off of Paamco's audited financial statements to keep Paamco's new partners in the dark about him, Ms. Buchan said in her deposition.
Terms of the loan that Mr. Sussman extended to Paamco were extraordinary. Mr. Sussman was paid the greater of either 10 percent annual interest rate or 40 percent of the company's profit. From 2003 to 2007, as Paamco's profit soared, Mr. Sussman collected his share -- $55 million, according to his suit.
In addition, after a change in 2002, the loan could be converted into a 40 percent ownership stake in Paamco's parent at any time. That conversion would have reduced the two women's share into a minority stake, according to a copy of the loan agreement entered as evidence.
To some, the conversion option raises red flags. ''One of the reasons we look at where the money came from to fund the business is if someone has the ability to control something or change something, we are probably not going to certify them or, at least, have different language on the document,'' said Janet Harris Lange, president of the National Women Business Owners Corporation. Ms. Lange said Paamco never sought certification from her organization.

HEADLINE: Aviation World at Odds Over Plane Loans

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
Back in the mid-1980s, Boeing and Airbus avoided a trade war by making a gentlemen's agreement not to seek government financing to sell planes in each other's home markets. The deal symbolized an aviation world dominated by the United States and Europe.
That world is a lot different now.
No longer can Airbus and Boeing count on being the biggest manufacturers of large airplanes. Manufacturers in Canada and Brazil are seeking to gain a foothold in this lucrative market. And not too far in the future, China, Japan and Russia will be competing as well.
At the same time, airlines from Asia and the Middle East that did not exist three decades ago, or were small players, are now vying for a much bigger piece of the global aviation market. 
The old rules, some airlines and plane manufacturers contend, are not working anymore.
This week, negotiators from the European Union and countries including the United States, Japan and Brazil will meet in Ottawa to grapple with the politically charged issue. Their goal is to draw up a new agreement by the end of the year on the rules for financing the airplane business -- and specifically, how much government assistance is permitted.
The various interests are in conflict, and it is unclear if the talks will be successful. ''The home market restriction has become unsustainable,'' said Scott Scherer, vice president for strategic regulatory policy at Boeing's financing unit. ''It's the big elephant in the room.''
The discussions, which are taking place under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are complicated by the fact that what might be in the interest of the airlines may not necessarily work for aircraft manufacturers.
The so-called home market rule applies to only four European countries -- France, Germany, Britain and Spain -- where Airbus planes are produced, and to the United States, where Boeing is based. As a result, for example, Ryanair, which is based in Dublin and is one of Europe's biggest low-cost carriers, has tapped into export-credit financing to buy most of its fleet of 200 Boeing planes. Its London-based rival, EasyJet, cannot make a similar deal.
The loudest objections to the current rules have come from European airlines, which say that cheaper, government-backed loans have helped fuel the growth of their rivals in Asia and the Middle East and given them an unfair advantage.
The charge is mostly aimed at Emirates Airlines in Dubai, whose rapid expansion in recent years has rattled airlines in Britain, France and Germany. The airline threatens to take their international passengers away from European hubs and fly them instead through its gleaming new terminals in Dubai.
Boeing and Airbus also worry about new competition. At the moment, their biggest concern is the emergence of a new jet from Bombardier of Canada, the C-Series. This single-aisle plane, due to enter service in 2013, will be able to seat about 130 passengers, posing a direct challenge for the first time to the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.
The current rules set separate financing standards for large airplanes and regional jets with 100 or fewer seats. But the C-Series, with its larger capacity and range, has now blurred that line, Boeing and Airbus say. This, they argue, puts them at a competitive disadvantage for sales in the single-aisle category, the most profitable segment of the market.
Bombardier said it would welcome a new arrangement where airlines could obtain financing, regardless of where they were based. ''We do not support the so-called home market rule,'' Marc Meloche, the senior director for structured finance at Bombardier Aerospace, said. ''All customers should have access to all financing sources, based on market principles.''
Besides the Canadian factor, the other major catalyst for the talks has been the economic downturn, which essentially shut down commercial credit markets and left official export agencies, especially the Export-Import Bank of the United States, as outsize purveyors of financing.
In 2009, about 35 percent of Boeing and Airbus sales were financed by credit agencies, according to the manufacturers, up from about 20 percent before the economic downturn.
In the United States, the Export-Import bank guaranteed $8.6 billion in commercial aviation loans in its fiscal year ending September 2009, nearly double what it typically helped finance each year since 2002. This year, export credit agencies in the United States and Europe are expected to guarantee more than $15 billion in civil aviation loans, about the same as in 2009.
Export agencies, set up to help finance exports to countries with weaker credit, usually require quicker repayment than commercial loans and impose more restrictions on the airlines. But in today's depressed market, industry experts say, the agencies' loans are on average about three to five percentage points lower than commercial loans. This can be a significant factor for planes whose list price ranges from $60 million for a single-aisle plane to about $350 million for the largest plane today, the Airbus A380.
The export credit agencies ''did a great job in 2009, when banks were unable to fulfill their role,'' said Christian McCormick, chief executive of Natixis Transport Finance in Paris. ''They have created something of an addiction by the airlines to this product that is completely out of the market.''
Because of the home market restrictions, American and European airlines could not get government backing for new planes. But airlines did, including Emirates Airlines, Korean Airlines and Cathay Pacific.
European airlines were already hurting from the rapid rise of some of these carriers, particularly Emirates and Etihad Airlines in the Persian Gulf, saying they pay lower fuel prices, airport fees and corporate taxes. Opposition to the government loans has become the latest tactic the airlines are now using to curtail these carriers' growth.
In a joint letter dated Oct. 11, airlines from Europe and the United States proposed limiting to 20 percent of new plane deliveries the export-credit backing that an airline can receive each year. The letter was signed by nine European airlines, including Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa, and the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines in the United States.
They also want export credit to be provided on less favorable terms than commercial bank loans.
The airlines may get some of what they want. A draft agreement that began circulating among governments this month would increase the price of export agency financing to airlines, according to one person involved in the negotiations, but not include the cap on lending.
''This is becoming a big political fight,'' said Adam Pilarski, an economist and senior vice president at Avitas, a consultancy in Chantilly, Va. ''Incumbent airlines are beginning to feel that if they do not do something, somebody may take their place.''
''Nobody complains about airlines from Uganda having this advantage,'' Mr. Pilarski said.
The complaints have raised hackles in Dubai, where Emirates dismisses claims that it has received any competitive advantage from state-subsidized loans, saying it has financed only 20 percent of its fleet through export credits.
''We have grown without subsidy through the success of our commercially driven business model -- and see no reason to apologize for what we have achieved,'' Tim Clark, the president of Emirates Airline, said in a statement.
Some aircraft financiers, however, were skeptical of Emirates' claims. One European banker, who would speak only anonymously because his bank provides loans to the airline, estimated that nearly 50 percent of the Emirates jet purchases had been subsidized by Western export credit agencies.
Emirates raised eyebrows again this summer with two more huge jet orders -- including plans to buy an additional 32 Airbus A380 jets valued at $11 billion at list prices, bringing its total orders for the twin-deck superjumbo to 90. In July, Emirates placed another huge order, for 30 Boeing 777s.

HEADLINE: Killings Signal Violent Revival Of Nigeria Sect

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Isa Gusau contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- A rash of mysterious killings by gun-wielding motorcycle assassins of policemen, politicians and others in this city near the desert has led authorities to declare that a radical Islamic sect thought to have been crushed by Nigerian troops last year has been revived.
Soldiers have been deployed here again, a curfew has been imposed and many residents worry about bold daylight attacks that officials call a renewal of the anti-Western sect's strikes on police stations and soldiers that took place last year.
An outright challenge to the Nigerian government appears to be under way, with an audacious twilight prison break last month in Bauchi that freed over 700 -- including many jailed sect members -- the firebombing of a police station in Maiduguri last week and the killing of numerous police officers and other leaders in recent months.
The violence here in the north comes at a delicate time for Nigeria, one of the world's top oil producers and a major supplier to the United States. Though the nation remains stable, it is struggling to organize elections next year that will test the capacity and, ultimately, the legitimacy of its young democracy. 
Beyond that, the government faces a renewed threat from militants in the oil-producing south, who claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing during Independence Day celebrations in the capital, Abuja, this month. The southern militants had been waging an insurgency for years against the oil industry, but the bombing was the first time they had struck so directly at the heart of Nigerian power.
There, as here, the restiveness is fueled by corruption and glaring economic inequality. States in this region are the country's poorest, with over 70 percent of the population living in poverty, according to the United Nations, while the few rich live in mansions behind high walls.
In Maiduguri, a hot, low-rise city of about one million people near the border with Cameroon -- where exhortations to Allah are posted at traffic circles, women are veiled and bands of ragged boys carry plastic begging bowls -- the discontent is tinged with religion. Islamic law is in force here, as it is across Nigeria's north, but not strictly enough for the sect, Boko Haram, whose name is an expression in the local language, Hausa, indicating disgust with Western education.
In the market, men in flowing robes expressed anger at the government, which violently suppressed Boko Haram in a military operation last year that killed perhaps 800 people, but not at the sect members suspected of the recent killings.
''It's the government's fault,'' said Alhaji Abdullahi Malari, a cloth trader. ''Our representatives and our government, they are not sincere. What one person acquires is enough to care for a massive amount of people.''
A twine merchant, Alhaji Abu Abaja, concurred: ''If government money was equally shared, there would not be this problem.''
Last year's bloodshed and destruction is visible in buildings that remain riddled with bullet holes and burned-out vehicles that have still not been cleared. It did little to address the underlying social problems that led to unrest here, just as it apparently failed to stop the sect's campaign.
''It's an actual insurrection,'' said Paul Lubeck, a specialist on northern Nigeria at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He added: ''The attack on the Bauchi prison is much more sophisticated than anything that's been seen. They're drawing, for cannon fire, on massive poverty.''
The police here say 11 people have been gunned down in Maiduguri since July -- the local news media count 14, including 6 policemen -- in a series of killings by stocky, taciturn men on motorcycles wielding Kalashnikov rifles, who shoot their victims and drive off, sometimes firing into the air for good measure.
Two more policemen were killed in Bauchi late Thursday night, prompting a nighttime motorcycle ban there, along with the one in force in Maiduguri.
The police, as symbols of hated government authority, are particular targets, as they have been during religious unrest in the past. But some killings have aroused particular fear because of the widening circle of victims.
The national vice chairman of the All Nigeria People's Party, Alhaji Awana Ali Ngala, was killed in his living room on Oct. 6. Three days later, Sheik Bashir Mustapha, a prominent Islamic cleric critical of Boko Haram, was killed while teaching in his home.
Bullet holes pockmark the walls, still smeared with blood, where the cleric was shot. The gunmen had greeted a 13-year-old student of the cleric on a quiet Saturday afternoon, asking him to show them inside. The boy then watched in horror as they gunned down his teacher and another student.
Yet out of fear or neglect, the police still had not interviewed the witness or even collected the many bullets left behind, angering students and families.
''He would always say, 'Killing people is not religious,' '' a student remembered. ''He would go to the radio station and say that.''
About 250 miles away, on the muddy streets behind the Bauchi prison, through which hundreds of freed Boko Haram members streamed after their liberation last month by machine-gun-wielding sect members shouting ''Allahu akbar!'' there was sympathy for the sect. ''Boko Haram is fighting the government because of the level of injustice,'' said Dan Lami Aminu, a mechanic. ''All the people are in support.''
The jubilant former prisoners marched past Mohammadu Bello's tire repair shack that evening. ''What they did was right,'' Mr. Bello said. ''There is serious injustice.''
The prison attack, on Sept. 8, took place at the busiest intersection in town, while crowds moved between the pink-walled Emir's Palace and the sprawling central mosque, full of worshipers for the end of Ramadan. Amazed, people watched through plate-glass windows of the mosque as Boko Haram members calmly blasted into the central prison.
Still, the wave of recent killings has fed apprehension. The nighttime streets in Maiduguri, controlled by soldiers at numerous checkpoints, are deserted. A list of prominent targets -- opponents of the sect -- is believed to be circulating.
''There is fear,'' said Ibrahim Abuya, chief imam of the main mosque in Maiduguri. ''People are openly attacked in daylight.''
A sociologist at the university here, Abdul Mumin-Sa'ad, spoke reluctantly: ''You don't know when it's going to be next, or who. It's a very scary situation.''
Dozens of Boko Haram members are still being prosecuted in the wake of last year's attack. The mysterious death of their leader, Mohammed Yusuf, while in police custody remains unresolved. Memories of bodies piled up from last year are fresh.
''They were summarily executed; the authorities didn't even listen to them,'' said Abba Babangida, a merchant, across the street from the charred police station that was firebombed last week. ''They just killed them. So people have to sympathize.''

HEADLINE: Signs That Business Jets Are Poised for a Comeback

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ATLANTA
THE business jet industry has been clobbered in the last two years by the dismal economy and public revulsion at some reported excesses of executives and their corporate jets. But there was Ed Bolen, the head of the group that represents the business aviation industry, making a bold assertion about the industry's outlook.
''We are out of our defensive crouch,'' he said, as 25,000 industry representatives began wandering into the convention center here on Monday for the opening on Tuesday of the annual convention and trade show for the group, the National Business Aviation Association. 
His comments seemed even bolder, considering that the annual industry outlook released here Sunday by Honeywell Aerospace still showed a grim landscape. This year, the report says, 675 to 700 new business jets will be delivered to customers worldwide, down from 849 last year. Next year, it says, deliveries will remain below 700 jets. When you compare those figures with the 1,313 jets delivered in 2008, a year that capped a record five-year run of good times, it still seems that a defensive game may be in order.
But, Mr. Bolen argued, ''things have stabilized.''
Of course, the captain of the Titanic might accurately have said the same once the ship settled on the ocean floor. But the fact is, there are indications that the business aviation industry is poised for a comeback. Honeywell's forecast, for one, says that the deliveries of new jets, after bottoming out in 2011, will begin rising again in 2012, starting ''another period of expansion.''
''We'll be bouncing on the bottom till 2012,'' Rob Wilson, the president for business and general aviation at Honeywell, said, ''but then we're seeing an overall recovery.'' Honeywell bases its forecasts on historical data and on interviews with business jet owners and prospective owners about their plans to replace or buy jets in the next five years.
Zenith Jet, a business aircraft sales company and consultant, predicted in its recent 10-year forecast that the ''trough'' in deliveries would occur this year, rather than next, and that 2011 would ''be a transitional year'' leading to a sustained period of 9 percent compounded annual growth in the industry.
And Mr. Bolen said that flight hours, a basic measure of overall business jet activity, are up about 13 percent over last year.
In the last two years, I have sometimes gotten on the nerves of people in the industry because I keep pressing them to evaluate the ''optics'' -- that is, how the public perceives chief executives riding on corporate planes when they themselves are languishing in a commercial airport.
Of course, industry executives point out correctly that the economy was the main cause of the setbacks in recent years in business aviation. But adverse public reaction was, and is, a big problem for the industry, at least in the United States, which accounts for about half of all sales.
It is one reason many companies sold corporate planes, contributing to a glut of used jets (which has now shrunk, industry experts say). As the midterm elections approach, woe betide any politician running for office who is discovered taking rides on someone's private jet.
Even some who continue to use corporate jets regularly try to stay off the public perception radar screen. Last spring, the online investigative journalism site ProPublica reported an upsurge in use of a previously little-known government program that allows private jet owners, citing security reasons, to block their flight operations from routine public view on aviation-tracking sites like FlightAware.
Public revulsion about perceived wretched excess caused ''a terrible blow to business aviation,'' said F. Lee Bailey, the lawyer and a longtime user of private jets. Mr. Bailey, like other proponents of business aviation, argues that abuses are few and that most company plane flights, whether in jets, propeller-driven planes or even helicopters, make good business sense.
Mr. Bolen of the business aviation group said that the argument for business aviation as a tool for better productivity was stronger than ever. Commercial airlines have been cutting not only overall seating capacity, but also entire routes, especially in small and midsize cities where revenue is soft. Business aviation increasingly fills a void for companies that need to send employees on the road in an efficient manner, he said, adding:
''Just over the course of this recession, over 100 communities have lost all, or substantially all, of their commercial airline service.''

HEADLINE: Pooling Resources, Two Newsrooms Merge

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
The nonprofit investigative journalism world continues to expand with the announcement on Tuesday that the Center for Public Integrity will absorb the Huffington Post Investigative Fund, a nonprofit journalism arm of The Huffington Post. The move would bring the total headcount at the center to more than 50 employees, making it one of the largest nonprofit investigative newsrooms in the country. 
''When the opportunity came up, I felt that we could accelerate all that we wanted to achieve by joining forces,'' Arianna Huffington, a founder and editor in chief of The Huffington Post, said of the merger. ''The need for investigative work is so great at the moment, as we have so many stories that have not been told.''
As part of the deal, The Huffington Post will transfer $2 million in grants and financing from the investigative fund to support the new venture. The Huffington Post has also agreed to post three articles a day and a handful of headlines on its Web site in a new section dedicated to promoting investigative journalism. The investigative fund brand will be discontinued.
William E. Buzenberg, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, said he expected the merger would increase the number of visitors to the center's site. In 2009 the center won awards from various journalism organizations for its reports on the hidden costs of clean coal, the underground global tobacco trade and sexual assaults on college campuses. Recent investigative work from the Huffington Post Investigative Fund include reports on the risks of electronic health record technology and the efforts of payday lenders to resist government regulation.
''It would double our operation,'' said Mr. Buzenberg, adding that the center expected to file 500 investigative reports this year, with a dozen of them being major projects. ''I do feel like we're filling a void on the for-profit side that's being filled on the nonprofit side,'' he added. ''Because of cutbacks, they have fewer people and less time to do that.''
The center has won additional financial support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which recently gave it a $1.7 million grant to complete a digital newsroom transformation, and an additional $250,000 grant to support the merger.
''In general investigative journalism has been suffering in the commercial sector, more than other kinds of reporting during the economic downturn and the digital transition,'' said Eric Newton, vice president of the journalism program at the foundation. ''The operation will be more efficient, but the newsroom will be larger, the reach of the stories will be greater. It's a good thing for investigative reporting.''
Other major centers of nonprofit investigative reporting include the Manhattan-based ProPublica, founded in 2007, and the Center for Investigative Reporting in Berkeley, Calif., which was founded in 1977.

HEADLINE: That Sinking Feeling

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Barack Obama seems to think he's done a pretty terrific job as president, but maybe he hasn't trumpeted his accomplishments effectively enough.
He told The Times's Peter Baker, in an interview for the Sunday magazine, ''Given how much stuff was coming at us, we probably spent much more time trying to get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration -- and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top -- that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular.''
This assessment by the president is debatable, but it won't be among the things that are front and center in the minds of voters as the November elections approach. The problem for Mr. Obama and the Democrats is the widespread sense among anxiety-riddled Americans that the country is still in very bad shape and headed in the wrong direction. 
A Gallup poll last week found that 62 percent feel that economic conditions are deteriorating.
The president and his party may have racked up one legislative victory after another -- on the bank bailouts, the stimulus package, the health care bill, and so forth -- but ordinary Americans do not feel as if their lives or their prospects are improving. And they don't think it's a public relations problem.
Nearly 15 million are jobless and many who are working are worried that they (or a close relative) will soon become unemployed. The once solid foundation of home ownership has grown increasingly wobbly, with the number of foreclosures this year expected to surpass a million. And the country is still at war.
The voter unrest that is manifesting itself in myriad (and often peculiar) ways reflects a real fear that not just family finances but the country itself is in a state of decline. ''I don't know where we're headed,'' said a businessman named Chuck Carruthers, who chatted with me in a coffee shop in Atlanta last week. ''But I'll tell you the truth, I don't think it's anyplace good.''
Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have come to grips with this fear, although the Republicans have done yeoman's work exploiting it.
President Obama and the Democrats blew an important opportunity at the beginning of the president's term. That was the time, with the economy in virtual free fall, to rally the American people behind a grand plan to rebuild the nation and its economy for the long term. Yes, the emergency had to be dealt with. And, yes, the bailouts and the stimulus package (however flawed) were essential.
But even in the midst of the crisis, the public needed to be presented with a clear idea -- a vision, to use the term once derided by President George H.W. Bush -- of where the Obama administration wanted to take the country.
Job creation was the most important issue. With his sky-high approval ratings and the economy hemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, a bold and creative employment initiative, tied to long-term investments in infrastructure and green energy, was the issue that President Obama could -- and should -- have used to trump Republican obstructionism.
But Mr. Obama wanted his health care bill, and had a misplaced faith in the willingness of the G.O.P. to work with him on that and any number of other issues. He would also escalate the monumentally debilitating war in Afghanistan. Employment never seemed to be the top priority.
What ordinary voters see is an economy that is not working for them and an increasingly dismal outlook for their children. From that perspective, the enormous budget deficits don't seem to be providing much of a tangible return.
Democrats are making the seemingly logical argument that the policies pushed by their Republican opponents will only make matters worse. They are constantly urging voters to remember that it was conservative Republican laissez-faire policies that landed us in this horrid mess in the first place.
The problem for President Obama and his party is that logic does not always rule the electoral roost. Voters want the same thing they wanted in 2008: change.
However the elections turn out, the Obama administration needs to begin focusing much more intently on the economic plight of ordinary Americans. Nearly 44 million are living in poverty. A third of all Hispanic children and more than a third of black children are poor.
Job security and benefits like paid vacations, health insurance and a secure retirement are going the way of the typewriter. More than 11 million new jobs would have to be created just to get us back to where we were when the Great Recession began. No one sees that happening anytime soon.
Democrats are in trouble because they have not been nearly aggressive enough in confronting this profound economic crisis facing so many millions of ordinary Americans.

HEADLINE: From Obama, the Tax Cut Nobody Heard Of

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. -- What if a president cut Americans' income taxes by $116 billion and nobody noticed?
It is not a rhetorical question. At Pig Pickin' and Politickin', a barbecue-fed rally organized here last week by a Republican women's club, a half-dozen guests were asked by a reporter what had happened to their taxes since President Obama took office.
''Federal and state have both gone up,'' said Bob Paratore, 59, from nearby Charlotte, echoing the comments of others.
After further prodding -- including a reminder that a provision of the stimulus bill had cut taxes for 95 percent of working families by changing withholding rates -- Mr. Paratore's memory was jogged. 
''You're right, you're right,'' he said. ''I'll be honest with you: it was so subtle that personally, I didn't notice it.''
Few people apparently did.
In a troubling sign for Democrats as they head into the midterm elections, their signature tax cut of the past two years, which decreased income taxes by up to $400 a year for individuals and $800 for married couples, has gone largely unnoticed.
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll last month, fewer than one in 10 respondents knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for most Americans. Half of those polled said they thought that their taxes had stayed the same, a third thought that their taxes had gone up, and about a tenth said they did not know. As Thom Tillis, a Republican state representative, put it as the dinner wound down here, ''This was the tax cut that fell in the woods -- nobody heard it.''
Actually, the tax cut was, by design, hard to notice. Faced with evidence that people were more likely to save than spend the tax rebate checks they received during the Bush administration, the Obama administration decided to take a different tack: it arranged for less tax money to be withheld from people's paychecks.
They reasoned that people would be more likely to spend a small, recurring extra bit of money that they might not even notice, and that the quicker the money was spent, the faster it would cycle through the economy.
Economists are still measuring how stimulative the tax cut was. But the hard-to-notice part has succeeded wildly. In a recent interview, President Obama said that structuring the tax cuts so that a little more money showed up regularly in people's paychecks ''was the right thing to do economically, but politically it meant that nobody knew that they were getting a tax cut.''
''And in fact what ended up happening was six months into it, or nine months into it,'' the president said, ''people had thought we had raised their taxes instead of cutting their taxes.''
There are plenty of explanations as to why many taxpayers did not feel richer when the cuts kicked in, giving typical families an extra $65 a month. Some people were making less money to begin with, as businesses cut back. Others saw their take-home pay shrink as the amounts deducted for health insurance rose.
And taxpayers in more than 30 states saw their state taxes rise, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
That is what happened here in North Carolina. The Treasury Department estimated that the federal tax cut would put $1.7 billion back in the hands of North Carolina taxpayers this year. Last year, though, North Carolina, facing a large budget shortfall, raised a variety of state taxes by roughly a billion dollars.
''It was a wash,'' said Mr. Tillis, the state representative.
The guests at the Pig Pickin' rally here could rattle off the names of the House speaker and the Senate majority leader with ease, if with disdain, and were up on many of the political controversies of the day. They studied the campaign fliers at their tables, and pocketed the 1.5-ounce jars of strawberry preserves with special labels urging them to vote for Judge Bill Constangy for Superior Court (''Preserving Justice,'' the labels read).
Many volunteered that they thought the Bush tax cuts should be extended for all taxpayers, even for the wealthy ones whom Mr. Obama would like to exclude. But few had heard that there had also been Obama tax cuts -- which will also expire next year unless extended, but have generated far less public debate.
Bob Deaton, 73, who wore a ''Fair Tax'' baseball cap, was surprised to hear that there were tax cuts in the $787 billion stimulus bill, which was wildly unpopular with many at the rally even though roughly a third of it was in the form of tax cuts.
''Tax cuts?'' he asked. ''Where were the tax cuts?''
Ron Julian, 50, a Huntersville town commissioner, said he thought his taxes had gone up under Mr. Obama. And Mr. Paratore, a former Hearst executive, said he might have noticed the tax cuts if his paycheck had jumped more in the weeks before he retired last year: ''I couldn't even tell you what it was, to be honest with you.''
The Obama administration wants to extend the little-noticed tax cut next year. Jason Furman, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, said the administration still believes that changing the withholdings was a more effective form of stimulus than sending out rebate checks would have been.
''In retrospect, we think that judgment was right,'' he said. ''It's harder to predict what's good for politics. Ultimately, the best thing for politics is going to be helping the economy.''
But at least one prominent economist is questioning whether the method really was more effective. Joel B. Slemrod, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, analyzed consumer surveys after the last rebate checks were sent out in 2008 by the Bush administration, and after this tax cut, called Making Work Pay, went into effect under the Obama administration.
After the 2008 rebates, he found that about a quarter of the households surveyed said they would use the money primarily to increase their spending. After the Obama tax cut took effect, he said, only 13 percent said they would use the money primarily to increase their spending. The Obama administration believes that people did spend the money, and cites analyses calling the cut one of the more effective forms of stimulus.
Mr. Slemrod said it was not unheard of for voters to miss tax cuts. Just a few years after a 1986 overhaul of the tax system made significant cuts to most people's taxes, he said, a survey asked people what had happened to their taxes. ''Most people didn't answer that they went down,'' he said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s Fight to Retake House Puts Drama in New York Races

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
RYE BROOK, N.Y. -- New York has turned into a major battleground over the future of the House of Representatives, with Democrats forced to defend at least a half-dozen Congressional seats from unexpectedly strong Republican challenges.
Aided by third-party expenditures and President Obama's sagging popularity, Republicans believe they are in a position to pick up seats in upstate and suburban swing districts that will help them retake control of the House. 
In the Utica area, conservative groups and the National Republican Congressional Committee have unleashed a flurry of ads attacking Representative Michael A. Arcuri, a two-term Democrat trying to fend off Richard Hanna, a mall developer.
''It's thermonuclear,'' Mr. Arcuri said, referring to the ferocity of the campaign being waged against him. He added, ''It's going to be a close election.''
On Long Island, Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a four-term Democrat who has cruised to re-election in the past, faces an aggressive challenge from Randy Altschuler, a wealthy businessman who has poured his own money into his campaign.
In suburbs north of New York City, Representative John J. Hall, a two-term Democratic incumbent, has called on former President Bill Clinton for help in his fight against the Republican nominee, Dr. Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist and first-time candidate.
The Democrats' problems here underscore the degree to which Republicans have expanded the map of competitive races around the country. In addition, Republicans see opportunity in New York because many of the seats now in play were won by Democrats during the past two election cycles.
''The fact that the Republicans are doing so well in New York suggests that Democrats are in trouble,'' said Tory Mazzola, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Republican strategists also said that the message that they are trying to hammer home -- over big government programs advanced by Democrats, the economy and the federal deficit -- resonates in the politically moderate districts that are their targets.
And while 60 percent of New York City residents approve of how President Obama is handling his job, his support is much lower in the suburbs around the city, according to a poll conducted by The New York Times last week. Forty-six percent of suburban voters approve of the president's job performance while 40 percent disapprove.
The degree to which Democrats have been forced on the defensive can be seen in the 19th Congressional District, which Mr. Hall won in an upset in 2006 as Democrats took control of the House.
At a debate last week, the audience groaned loudly when Mr. Hall gave President Obama a grade of ''B'' for his job performance.
''He inherited a very difficult situation,'' Mr. Hall said, later adding, ''You don't get credit for keeping a bad situation from getting worse.''
Mr. Hall reacted strongly when the debate moderator asked him if he would accept support from Representative Charles B. Rangel, the powerful Harlem Democrat who is facing a trial in the House next month on 13 ethics violations.
''I have not asked Charlie Rangel to come up here since his ethical difficulties surfaced,'' he said before denouncing his rival, Ms. Hayworth, for accusing him of donating $1,000 to Mr. Rangel, the dean of the New York Congressional delegation. ''I did not!''
As elsewhere in the country, Republican challengers in New York are getting support from numerous conservative advocacy groups pouring money into television advertisements.
They include Revere America, a group run by former Gov. George E. Pataki that is dedicated to repealing the health care law enacted earlier this year; the 60 Plus Association, which offers itself as the conservative alternative to AARP; and the Alliance for America's Future, which is associated with former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter Mary Cheney.
The groups have spent about $1 million on advertisements in New York since the campaign season began heating up in September, according to strategists who are monitoring the races. Those attack ads have forced Democrats to spend time responding, instead of focusing on their Republican opponents.
Mr. Arcuri suggested the barrage of advertisements in the Utica area was taking a toll. ''It is hard to keep a sizable lead when you are being outspent two to one,'' he said.
But he indicated that meddling by outside groups in his district would likely backfire. ''These are groups that have no presence or interest whatsoever in our district,'' he said. ''And I think people know that. And it is resented.''
On Long Island, Mr. Bishop's campaign has dispatched volunteers to hand out literature countering claims by the 60 Plus group that medical coverage for the elderly will be cut by the new health care law, which Mr. Bishop supported. ''Virtually every one of the claims they make are inaccurate,'' said Mr. Bishop, who predicted the race would be close right up to Election Day. ''It's a tough race.''
Republicans also seem well positioned to pick up a seat in the state's Southern Tier in the western part of the state that became vacant this year when the Democratic incumbent, Eric J. Massa, resigned after being accused of sexually harassing an aide.
In that race, a Siena College poll taken a month ago indicated that Tom Reed, a former Republican mayor of Corning, had a 14-point lead over the Democrat, Matt Zeller, an Army veteran who enlisted in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but 26 percent were undecided.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee appears resigned to Mr. Zeller's loss, and has not devoted any spending to that race, though they are aggressively helping other Democrats who are targets. Republicans are also waging a strong challenge in the 23rd Congressional District in the northernmost region of upstate New York.
In the race there, a recent Siena poll showed the Democratic incumbent, Representative Bill Owens, had 46 percent, and the Republican, Matt Doheny, was supported by 39 percent. Mr. Doheny's campaign got unexpected help this month when a third-party conservative candidate, Douglas L. Hoffman, withdrew from the race and threw his support behind the Republican.
Both parties are also closely watching a few other Democratic-held districts in New York that analysts say Republicans could capture if conditions deteriorate further for Democrats.
The districts include the 25th in the Syracuse area, where Representative Dan Maffei, a first-term Democrat, is facing Ann Marie Buerkle, an anti-abortion activist who picked up an endorsement from Sarah Palin.

HEADLINE: Questioning the Guilt Of an Executed Father

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
''Frontline'' begins its 29th season in a relatively low-key manner. Rather than hot-button topics like the election season, the economy or the financial prospects of the Chilean miners, it looks at the 2004 execution of a Texas man convicted of killing his three children by setting fire to his home.
The report, ''Death by Fire,'' on Tuesday night is polished, persuasive and restrained -- hallmarks of the ''Frontline'' ethos. The graphics don't drip blood; an anchor didn't parachute in at the last minute to stand in front of a prison and read a few overheated lines. It's tasteful muckraking. That might sound like faint praise, but in the current news climate, it's one way to stand out. 
''Death by Fire'' is also well timed, in one sense: A Texas judge convened a hearing last week to examine whether the program's subject, Cameron Todd Willingham, was wrongly convicted of murder in the 1991 fire in Corsicana, Tex., that killed his three daughters -- and whether, therefore, Texas had killed an innocent man. On Thursday a state court of appeals granted a county prosecutor's motion to stop the proceedings temporarily.
The stir created by the largely symbolic hearing confirms one of the points made in ''Death by Fire,'' which is that the central question in the Willingham case -- Did he set the fire that consumed his house, or did it start accidentally? -- has been overtaken by Texas politics, the emotions surrounding the death penalty and the pride of Corsicana, a small city in the oil fields south of Dallas.
In another sense, the program feels a little past the curve, coming a year after David Grann's Polk Award-winning article in The New Yorker, ''Trial by Fire,'' put the Willingham case and its implications for the death penalty in the national spotlight. But this television account gives faces and voices to the key players on both sides.
Strictly speaking, the case is a battle about forensics, pitting local fire and police officials who decided on arson (using 1991 fire investigation methods) against a phalanx of outside experts who looked at the evidence years later and agreed that the fire was accidental and that Mr. Willingham was innocent.
The program interviews investigators and scientists and recaps the evidence for both arson and accident. It's impossible for the layman to know who's right. But it's also hard to see how the reports arguing against arson, delivered to the courts and to Rick Perry, the Texas governor, in the last days before Mr. Willingham was killed, did not merit at least a stay of execution.
The report is also about the importance of moral and class distinctions in a small, conservative community, and about how judgments of Mr. Willingham's character might have affected his case. A police detective describes his reaction to the boastful, cavalier suspect: ''After a while of being this, you get to judge people by their actions and their looks, you know. And you're not 100 percent right, but usually it's a good thing to go on.''
Mr. Willingham was portrayed at his trial as a sociopath with satanic tendencies who cheated on and reportedly abused his wife. (The artwork from his bedroom used as evidence of Satanism would later be identified as Iron Maiden and Led Zeppelin posters.) ''Todd Willingham had not treated his family in a respected manner,'' a local bar owner says, ''and he didn't get the benefit of the doubt that some people would have.''
The most compelling witness in ''Death by Fire'' is one who speaks in Mr. Willingham's defense: his stepmother, Eugenia, who appears calm but still a bit shellshocked as she refutes charges that he beat his wife and would have wanted to harm his children. The nearly 20-year-old case comes to life, wrenchingly, when she says she was told she could go to the funeral home after the execution ''and touch him while he was still warm, so that's what we did.''
Here and there ''Death by Fire'' is marred by condescension toward Corsicana's small-town defensiveness. The narrator's last words are, ''In Corsicana they made up their minds a long time ago.'' The program closes with a local firefighter saying, ''I don't care how many degrees you may have, how many books you may have written,'' and another resident declaring that Mr. Willingham should have been put to death three times (once for each daughter).
That has no bearing on his guilt or innocence, though, and it doesn't reduce our debt to ''Frontline'' and PBS for continuing to present this kind of programming. As a report in the current issue of American Journalism Review points out, ''Frontline'' and CBS's ''60 Minutes'' are the only network newsmagazines regularly doing investigations. Attention should be paid.

HEADLINE: Not Slowing Down for Age

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
MOHNTON, Pa. -- It was late, and John Force was working out after spending most of the day traveling from California to Pennsylvania for yet another National Hot Rod Association event. In the old days, he would have found another spot at the hotel to relax.
''I went from two hours a day in the bar to two hours a day in the gym,'' Force said recently as he sat in his motor home at Maple Grove Raceway.
Force, as fast as ever at the age of 61, stayed until the manager told him he had to close the gym. It was 11:30 p.m., but Force asked for a little more time. He has recovered from a horrifying accident more than three years ago and is racing again, driven by a quest to prove he is not finished yet.
''They're going to have to drag me from this racecar, screaming,'' said Force, who is aiming to become the first N.H.R.A. major-class champion older than 60. 
Al Unser Sr. was 47 when he won the 1987 Indianapolis 500, and Harry Gant was 52 when he won a Nascar top-series race in 1992. Drag racers require less staying power than drivers in other motorsports -- excellence is measured in smoky, frighteningly loud four-second bursts -- but Force is aware that another championship would be quite an accomplishment.
Force has won 14 N.H.R.A. championships in the funny car class, but none since Sept. 23, 2007, when he crashed at an event in Ennis, Tex., seriously injuring his hands and legs and keeping him out of a racecar for more than four months.
''He was determined,'' Force's wife, Laurie, said. ''And who am I to say, 'I don't think you should go back.' ''
He did come back, but his progress came slowly, especially for a loud-talking and gregarious titan like Force, who spends weekends piloting a thundering 8,000-horsepower car down a track at 300 miles an hour.
His hands, mangled in the accident, were wrapped so thoroughly that he remembered struggling to drive his car to the gas station and being unable to pluck his credit card out of the slot above the pump. A woman asked, ''Do you need help?''
Force and his family later went to find a Christmas tree. His walker, which Force still calls a ''creeper,'' fell off the car and stuck in the grill of a trailing garbage truck. While his family got a big kick out of the way the truck reduced the walker to scrap metal, Force cried.
Ashley Force Hood, the Forces' daughter, who also races funny cars, said of his doctors: ''For them, a realistic goal was for him to walk again. They were looking at us like we were a bunch of crazies for thinking he could drive an 8,000-horsepower car again.''
He was still so tender from his injuries after he returned that he could not hop to the ground from the hatch on the top of his car without gritting his teeth, Laurie Force recalled. Force, who owns his car, also struggled to win, making his recovery even more tedious.
Although he did not win in 2009, one of his drivers, Robert Hight, won the funny car championship, leading Force to believe the safer cars -- developed by his racing team after his accident and the death of the driver Eric Medlen after a training crash earlier in 2007 -- were also capable of winning.
Force shook up his race team, bringing in Mike Neff as his co-crew chief. Force won an event in February in Pomona, Calif., and has not slowed since. Austin Coil, his co-crew chief, said Force's change in lifestyle had sharpened his reactions.
''I guess you could say the eye of the tiger is back, like it was back in the 1990s,'' Coil said.
A night owl, Force said he liked to drink beer, the other fuel of drag racing besides nitromethane, because it helped him fall asleep. Drag racers live like vagabonds, and many do not eat well. Force remembers that he would stop by the snack bars at racetracks late at night to collect sandwiches that the proprietors were going to throw away.
The accident in Texas changed his style. Force, using an appropriate metaphor for a drag racer, said he was headed down a dead-end street. He had never visited the gym, but as part of his therapy, he started working out, and he has become zealous about it.
''I was given a great motivational tool,'' he said. ''It's called your health. It's called getting your life back.''
Force, who grew up in a trailer park, never had trouble with motivation. Immediately after his accident in Texas, as he sat in the wreck, he yelled, ''Fix the car!'' as if he could get out for another run. After Force came out of surgery at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, he called a staff meeting.
''The will has always been there after his crash,'' Hight said. ''He just hasn't had a good racecar. Even laying in his hospital bed, until reality set in, he was saying, 'I could set up a car to drive next week.' ''
He entered the event at Maple Grove in first place in the standings but left in second, behind Matt Hagan. Hood, 27, was in fourth place and Hight, 41, was sixth. It would mean a lot to Force to see his daughter win a title. But he has reasons for winning another.
''I wanted my kids to see I still had it,'' he said.
He said he wanted to keep doing well because his corporate sponsors and the Ford Motor Company had been good to him during the economic downturn. He said he expected to drive for at least five more years. His wife said he did not talk at all about quitting.
The only thing she has tried to talk him into is running -- or maybe more like walking -- in a marathon in California. Force once would have scoffed at such an idea. But he looks at his life a little differently now.
''He's back to his usual fired-up self -- back to the person I remember being around for most of my life,'' Hood said.
She added: ''He wants to do this as long as he can. But he wants to do it the right way.''
Now that he is contending for another championship, Force wants to do it as fast as possible. He came back, in part, because he did not want to end his career with a crash, particularly since it came so soon after the death of Medlen, a rising star.
''The heart is right and the mind is right for the first time since the crash,'' Force said. ''I want to put closure on Dallas. The mind now tells me, You can win the championship.''

PERSON: Patricia Herzog 

HEADLINE: Patricia Herzog, 88; Changed Marital Law

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
It was an advertisement on a matchbook cover that inspired Patricia Herzog's legal career and, eventually, led to a significant change in California marital law -- allowing one divorcing spouse to be reimbursed for having helped the other obtain an advanced degree.
The matchbook ad said, ''You, too, can become a lawyer.'' 
This was in the early 1950s in Santa Ana, Calif. Prompted by the ad, Ms. Herzog, who was working as a newspaper reporter at the time and who died on Oct. 1 at 88, promptly signed up for mail-order law classes through the LaSalle Extension University in Chicago.
She soon found, however, that she would need several years of tutoring from lawyer friends and other law review courses before she could pass the bar. But she did, in 1957, and by 1960 she had her own practice.
One day in 1978, Janet Sullivan walked into Ms. Herzog's office and said that she and her husband, Mark, who had just graduated from medical school, were getting a divorce. Ms. Sullivan insisted that her work as an accountant during the marriage meant that her husband's medical degree had been a ''joint investment in time and money.''
The case that Ms. Herzog took through California's lower courts and to its Supreme Court eventually prompted the State Legislature to pass what became known as the Sullivan Law, with reverberations throughout the country.
Ms. Sullivan sought a share of the value of her husband's medical practice as part of the divorce settlement. The lower courts ruled against her, citing state law holding that education was not a form of property. In 1982, Ms. Herzog filed an appeal with the California Supreme Court, which did not issue a ruling for nearly three years.
Publicity surrounding the case prompted the Legislature to pass an amendment to California's marital property law in 1985. While it stated that advanced degrees do not constitute property -- and thus a divorced spouse was not entitled to a former spouse's future earnings -- it did authorize courts to reimburse the supporting spouses for their expenses. Their share of the costs of tuition and books, for example, could be included in alimony settlements. The Supreme Court then remanded Ms. Sullivan's case to a lower court, which ordered her reimbursement.
''The Sullivan case, and then the Sullivan Law, was one of the first in the country to expand property rights for spouses and to recognize their contributions to the accumulation of marital property,'' Sheila Prell Sonenshine, a retired state appellate judge and an expert on family law, said last week.
Scott Altman, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said Ms. Herzog's actions ''proved very important in getting the Legislature to act.''
Patricia Reid Chamberlain was born on July 27, 1922, in Japan, where her father, Leo Chamberlain, was a banker and her mother, Eleanor White Chamberlain, was a teacher. Patricia came to the United States to live with her grandparents when she was 10.
During World War II, she helped build Hellcats and torpedo bombers at a factory in California while singing in a band at night. In the 1950s, she moved to Santa Ana with her first husband, Charles Herzog. Though they divorced in 1960, she kept his last name for professional purposes.
Ms. Herzog died at her home in Corona del Mar, Calif., her son Reid Shapiro said. Her husband of 44 years, Haskell Shapiro, died last year.
Besides her son Reid, she is survived by two children from her first marriage, Charlie Herzog and Christine Herzog; two stepchildren, Lynn Shapiro and Paul Shapiro; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
Ms. Herzog earned a degree in economics from the University of Texas and later became a reporter for several newspapers in California. Besides working in her own practice, she was a volunteer lawyer for the Legal Aid Society of Orange County for almost 40 years.
Of her partial victory in the Sullivan case, she told The Los Angeles Times in 1986, ''I felt that half a loaf was better than none.''

HEADLINE: Sanctions Are Ending For Museum

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When the National Academy Museum sold two important Hudson River School paintings in 2008 to pay its bills, the Association of Art Museum Directors came down hard with sanctions, making the academy a pariah in the museum world and a symbol for the evils of deaccessioning.
Now the association has removed the scarlet letter. On Oct. 4 the association's board voted unanimously to suspend its sanctions in recognition of the academy's actions over the last 20 months toward better financial planning and management. 
''We've decided the National Academy has put all the steps in place that we wanted to see for it to be a healthy organization that would not contemplate deaccessioning for operating purposes in the future,'' said Kaywin Feldman, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors and president of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.
The academy case suggests that sanctions -- which banned loans and other program collaborations between the academy and the association's members -- can be effective as a deterrent, especially in New York where regulatory and legislative efforts to curb such sales have stalled or failed. ''Sanctions really hurt,'' Carmine Branagan, the academy's director, said in an interview Monday. ''You're completely incapable of designing exhibition programming going forward because you can't loan and you can't get loans, and sanctions also affect funding. Sanctions were very, very painful.''
Ms. Branagan said the approach by the association had been good for the museum, prompting a series of measures that made it stronger. ''The standards that'' the association ''is holding museums to are the standards that museums should be holding themselves to,'' she said. ''They don't have expectations that museums shouldn't have of themselves.'' Ms. Branagan was appointed director in December 2008.
The sale of the Hudson River landscapes by the museum, which is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, had heightened concerns that, in an economic downturn, cultural institutions would turn to their collections to plug shortfalls.
''The National Academy's actions violated one of our most core beliefs: that the collection is sacred and not a fungible asset,'' Ms. Feldman said. ''We thought it was very important to make that statement, that they had acted improperly, and that A.A.M.D. as an organization did not condone that behavior. And we also wanted to see positive change for the organization.''
In the aftermath of that sale and others the New York State Board of Regents began debating whether to make permanent a set of regulations regarding deaccessioning while state lawmakers considered a bill to block the practice. But neither the regulations nor the law were adopted, in part because some of the state's major cultural institutions argued they were unnecessary. Proponents say they plan to continue their efforts.
Even with the lifting of the sanctions, the 184-year-old academy, which also has a school, is not completely in the clear. The association's board also voted to establish a five-year probation period during which it will review the academy's progress, even as loans between the academy and the its members may resume.
Ms. Branagan characterized the probation as fair and appropriate. ''The future for the academy is very strong, so we look forward to sharing that,'' she said.
In addition to changing its governance structure, the academy has developed a long-range financial and strategic plan and has expanded the fund-raising capacities of its staff and board, Ms. Branagan said. The academy, which serves as an honorary association of 333 American artists, now has nonacademicians on its board for the first time -- 10 out of a total of 21 members.
Although the academy had considered selling its Beaux Arts museum building, on Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, it is now renovating instead. In June it closed the building to improve its exhibition galleries and create a new visitor center and a school studio gallery. The museum, with more than 7,000 paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures by American artists and architects, is to reopen in September; the school has been open throughout.
In the 2008 sale that prompted the sanctions, the academy raised $13.5 million from Frederic Edwin Church's ''Scene on the Magdalene'' from 1854 and Sanford Robinson Gifford's ''Mount Mansfield, Vermont,'' from 1859. At the time the academy said it hoped to raise an additional $1.5 million from the sale of two other works: John White Alexander's ''Portrait of Mrs. Thomas Hastings'' (1901) and Robert Blum's ''Study for a Japanese Beggar'' (1891). But Ms. Branagan said such plans were off the table. ''Never again,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Lively Debate, Albany Candidates Flirt With the Absurd

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Michael M. Grynbaum and Angela Macropoulos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The moderators' questions were frequently ignored. The candidates barely looked at one another. One wore black gloves and spoke of himself repeatedly in the third person. And Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate and the race's front-runner, at times struggled to suppress laughter.
The first -- and possibly last -- debate in the New York race for governor unfolded as 90 minutes of political theater verging on farce Monday night, with a format that allowed even cursory discussion of issues like taxes and schools to be interrupted by random one-liners and sometimes inexplicable answers. 
Kristin Davis, a former prostitution madam, made frequent brothel jokes.
Jimmy McMillan, the candidate of the Rent Is Too Damn High Party, responded to a question about same-sex marriage by declaring ''If you want to marry a shoe, I'll marry you.''
And Carl P. Paladino, the Republican candidate, startled those watching by accidentally walking off stage during the closing statements, in search of the men's room.
''When you gotta go, you gotta go,'' Mr. Paladino's campaign manager, Michael R. Caputo, said afterward, by way of explanation.
Even Mr. Cuomo found it difficult to resist the increasingly giddy mood, lasting an hour and 15 minutes before finally cracking a smile and telling the audience he agreed with Mr. McMillan on one point.
''I'm with Jimmy,'' Mr. Cuomo said laughing. ''The rent is too damn high.''
Anyone expecting fireworks between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Paladino, the two leading candidates, was sorely disappointed.
The debate format did not give the candidates an opportunity to directly question one another. And neither Mr. Paladino nor Mr. Cuomo -- dressed identically in navy suits, white shirts, and red ties -- criticized the other or unleashed any prepared attack lines. In fact, neither man mentioned the other during the entire debate.
Instead, it was largely Charles Barron, a Brooklyn city councilman and former Black Panther, who emerged as Mr. Cuomo's foil, criticizing him for suggesting he would cut state spending and saying he had failed to take on corruption in the Legislature.
''Asking Andrew Cuomo and Carl Paladino to end corruption is like asking an arsonist to help us put out the fires,'' Mr. Barron said. ''It doesn't make sense.''
His attacks, though not unexpected by the attorney general and his advisers, drew one of the few off-the-cuff ripostes Mr. Cuomo offered during the debate.
''Cuomo is going to be the king of layoffs,'' Mr. Barron said. ''You vote for him, your job will be gone. Your pension is gone. Your health care is gone.''
Mr. Cuomo shook his head. ''They go with you, Charles, there's no jobs,'' he said, provoking a few ''oohs'' from the audience.
But at times it felt as if it was Mr. Cuomo, not the parade of unconventional minor-party candidates with their striking mutton chops and dramatic eye shadow, who was the debate's sideshow. His carefully rehearsed comments about job incubators and targeted tax incentives, delivered in the modulated tones of a panelist at the 92nd Street Y, sounded almost alien next to the provocations and asides of Mr. McMillan and Mr. Barron, or the earnest pleas of Howie Hawkins of the Green Party.
Mr. Cuomo continued to avoid, as he has for much of the campaign, being very specific about exactly how he would bring the state's budget under control. Asked to name three or four programs he would cut, Mr. Cuomo largely ducked the question, giving the equivalent of a two-minute opening statement and speaking vaguely of the need to cut Medicaid and ''find savings in education.''
The audience ignored a moderator's request to stay silent, unleashing rounds of raucous laughter and gleeful hisses at the wilder moments in the evening.
Mr. Cuomo and two other candidates, Mr. Barron and Warren Redlich of the Libertarian Party, debated the proper way to describe the process of extracting natural gas from rock formations using high-pressure water. (Mr. Cuomo called it ''hydrofracking,'' the slang term in common use; Mr. Barron scolded him, saying the appropriate description was ''hydraulic fracturing'' and urged him to consult a dictionary.)
And Ms. Davis suggested that her experience running an escort service made her the candidate best prepared to reform the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
''The key difference between the M.T.A. and my former escort agency is I operated one set of books and I offered on-time and reliable service,'' Ms. Davis said to laughter and applause.
Mr. Paladino seemed especially sedate, as if, after enduring weeks of criticism for his near-altercation with a reporter and provocative statements on gay people, he wanted to show New Yorkers he was more than merely an angry man.
''My critics, they want to say I'm angry,'' he said. ''No, I'm passionate about saving the State of New York. Our government doesn't need a tweaking. It needs a major overhaul, now.''
The debate was not entirely without substance. Mr. Cuomo, echoing his well-rehearsed stump speeches, talked about jobs, fixing Albany, and economic development. Mr. Paladino, who appeared to get his rhythm midway through the evening, argued urgently for a 10 percent income tax cut and a reduction of -- not merely a cap on -- local property taxes. Mr. Hawkins, the Green Party candidate, unspooled an array of proposals, including more money for environmental enforcement.
Even Ms. Davis, who came equipped with a quiver of one-liners playing off her career as a madam, delivered crisp (if rehearsed) sound bites about job growth and against a tax on stock transfers.
''Businesses will leave the state,'' she added, ''faster than Carl Paladino at a gay bar.''

HEADLINE: California's Crystal Cathedral Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By REBECCA CATHCART

 BODY:
Crystal Cathedral, the landmark megachurch in Orange County, Calif., where the ''Hour of Power'' is taped, filed for bankruptcy protection, church officials announced Monday.
''Budgets could not be cut fast enough to keep up with the unprecedented rapid decline in revenue due to the recession,'' Sheila Schuller Coleman, the church's senior pastor, said in a statement. In a news conference on Monday, church officials said ministry outreach and programs, including the weekly broadcast, would continue. But the church, which is $55 million in debt, has reduced the number of stations that it pays to broadcast the program. 
''Challenging situations are nothing new to our 55-year ministry,'' said the Rev. Robert H. Schuller, who founded the church in a drive-in theater and was instrumental in starting the worship broadcast in 1970. A decade later, the church moved to a cavernous glass building that seats almost 3,000 on a 40-acre campus in Garden Grove. Since 2006, church leadership has changed hands three times. Dr. Schuller retired, passing control to his son. Robert A. Schuller left in 2008, leaving his sister in charge.
Crystal Cathedral's leadership announced the sale of unused property and the layoffs of 50 employees in January to cushion a 27 percent drop in revenue since 2008. The church also canceled this year's ''Glory of Easter'' pageant, a holiday staple here.
In April, the church's vendors agreed to a 90-day ''voluntary moratorium'' on payments, the church statement said. The deal expired in July. ''As is often the case, negotiations and decisions do not move fast enough to satisfy all parties,'' the church said. ''A small number of creditors chose to file lawsuits and obtained writs of attachment.''

HEADLINE: Ads Urge Fathers to 'Take Time' to Be a Dad

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
A new series of public service ads, promoting greater involvement by fathers in their children's lives and aimed at American-Indian, Asian-American and Hispanic fathers, will be introduced today by the Advertising Council.
Created pro bono by Campbell-Ewald for the Administration for Children and Families and the Office of Family Assistance, two arms of the Department of Health and Human Services, the ads are the latest iteration of a successful campaign introduced in 2008. The campaign previously featured an African-American father teaching his daughter to cheerlead, as well as Hispanic and Caucasian fathers.
Roland C. Warren, media campaign director for the National Responsible Fatherhood Clearinghouse, a government project to support fatherhood that will run the campaign's Web site, said the new ads geared toward American-Indian, Asian-American and Hispanic fathers were created ''to make sure the campaign represents a broader community of fathers.'' 
He also said the message was consistent with previous advertising: All ads created by Campbell-Ewald since 2008 have told fathers ''the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life'' and urged them to ''take time to be a dad today.''
The campaign follows recent research that underscores what many consider to be a crisis in fathering in the United States. According to a survey by the National Fatherhood Initiative, a nonprofit organization, nine out of 10 parents believe there is a ''father absence crisis'' in America. And the National Responsible Fatherhood Clearinghouse has found that children who live without their biological fathers are, on average, two to three times more likely to have educational and health problems, be victims of child abuse and engage in criminal behavior than peers who live with their married biological or adoptive parents.
Conversely, the group also has found that children with involved, loving fathers are far more likely to do well in school, have healthy self-esteem and avoid high-risk behavior. Some 24 million children in the United States -- one-third of the total -- do not live with their biological father, according to the N.R.F.C. And nearly 20 million live in single-parent homes.
The new campaign -- featuring television, outdoor, online and mobile advertising -- includes two TV spots, in 15 and 30-second versions.
A spot featuring an American-Indian father and child depicts the father watching a football game on TV with two male friends; he leaves them to go down to the basement, where his son is plugging in an electric guitar to practice. The father sits down at a kit of drums and starts playing with his son, ignoring his friends and the football game upstairs.
In a spot with an Asian-American father and daughter, the two are conducting an operation, dressed in masks and with their hair covered; the father asks the daughter for cotton balls, duct tape, a wooden spoon, a needle, thread and a scalpel. It turns out he is operating on his daughter's teddy bear.
The voiceover in both ads -- provided by the actor Tom Selleck, who also did the voiceover in previous ads promoting more active parenting by fathers -- announces, as did previous ads, that ''the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life.'' Ads conclude with the campaign's tagline, ''Take time to be a dad today,'' and direct fathers to www.fatherhood.gov, the campaign's Web site, or to call a toll-free number for parenting tips and other assistance.
Similar outdoor advertising depicts an Asian-American father and daughter dressed in wet suits and standing on a beach, where the father teaches his daughter how to use a surfboard. In another outdoor ad, another Asian-American father and his son sit on a bed, eating cereal together, while in a third outdoor ad, a Hispanic daughter whispers into her father's ear. Certain outdoor ads also direct viewers to use their mobile phone to obtain the campaign's Web site address.
Bill Ludwig, chairman and chief executive of Campbell-Ewald, which is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said when his agency created cause-related advertising, it aimed to inform and inspire audiences to take action.
''The fatherhood campaign does that in spades. It makes it easy to take action. You don't need to be a hero to be a great dad, just spend time with your kids,'' he said.
The new ads -- which the agency developed after consulting with American-Indian, Korean and Hispanic organizations -- are meant to reach ''uninvolved fathers regardless of where they are in life or their socio-economic background,'' Mr. Ludwig said.
Priscilla Natkins, executive vice president and director of client services of the Advertising Council, said the new ads also tried to ''engage dads with more of a carrot than a stick, to encourage them in a disarming way to be involved with their children.''
The Advertising Council has helped promote involvement by fathers in their children's lives since the mid-1990s, with Campell-Ewald creating all advertising.
According to Ms. Natkins, the campaign historically has been one of the Ad Council's ''most successful in terms of donated media,'' with over $600 million worth of advertising spots donated between 1996 and the second quarter of this year.
''Anecdotally we've gotten a wildly enthusiastic response from dads who write in,'' she added.

HEADLINE: Deal Maker Looks Back, And Sighs

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
In his DealBook column, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes about a conversation with Felix Rohatyn, the veteran investment banker who helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, advised RJR Nabisco on its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in the 1980s and sold Columbia Pictures to Sony in the 1990s.
About to publish a memoir about his major deals in finance, Mr. Rohatyn reveals some uneasiness about his own industry and its effect on society. ''No matter how much I try to be really objective, the financial community has not covered itself with glory in these last 50 years,'' he said. 
''I'm terrified of having people think that I'm lecturing them.''
Felix G. Rohatyn, one of Wall Street's last old wise-men, was sitting in his office at Lazard overlooking the Empire State Building on Monday morning.
At 82, Mr. Rohatyn has quite a history: he helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, advised RJR Nabisco on its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in the 1980s and sold Columbia Pictures to Sony in the 1990s before becoming ambassador to France under President Bill Clinton. In the last decade, he returned to Wall Street, first to Lehman Brothers and now to his longtime home, Lazard.
Mr. Rohatyn, whose revealing memoir, ''Dealings: A Political and Financial Life'' (Simon & Schuster), comes out in two weeks, is a proud man and has a lot to be proud of.
But, surprisingly, he has also grown uneasy about his own industry and perhaps himself.
''No matter how much I try to be really objective, the financial community has not covered itself with glory in these last 50 years,'' he said, betraying a sense of apprehension. ''It's a subject that is difficult for me to deal with because I've lived in the milieu for the last 50 years.''
Mr. Rohatyn's self-aware views about the economy and Wall Street's effect on society are the sort that are often left unspoken. And I got the sense that he was worried about saying it himself.
''No matter what anybody says, there is a maldistribution of wealth in this country that I think is very unhealthy,'' he said, leaning back in his chair. ''It's very easy to fall into the mode of saying, well this whole thing is casinos and paper money.'' But he added, ''I don't think everyone in the financial community is a rogue -- it's just that that's the way the world is.''
I asked him to explain why he thought this happened.
He paused for a moment, before indicting himself and the world he inhabits.
''The leveraged buyouts, the takeovers -- and questionable behavior,'' he said matter-of-factly.He said that for much of his career, he, like so many in the financial industry, didn't spend much time reflecting on the larger implications of his work. But he said he had an awakening in 1986 as he was working on the sale of RJR Nabisco. It happened at an RJR board meeting.
''One of the directors was talking about stakeholders' rights. That got me,'' he said, referring to William Anderson.
''The experience with RJR had caused me to rethink my traditional bankers' calculus. The bottom line was no longer simply the bottom line - the ultimate cost of the profit had to be considered,'' he wrote in his book. ''The issues Bill Anderson had raised at RJR's board meeting about laid-off employees, damaged communities and cutbacks in employee benefits necessitated by higher corporate debt needed to be addressed.''
Still, almost 25 years later, he is grappling with how to fix a system built upon selling to the highest bidder.
''The trouble with this is that it is very difficult to quantify,'' he said of valuing the impact on all the other constituents. ''I am very troubled by my difficulty in trying to determine which was the better of the two deals.''
His book is filled with tales of deal-making and prominent names: the time Frank Sinatra came to meet with him; when Michael Ovitz told him over lunch that Matsushita wanted to buy MCA; and the scandal over ITT that plagued him for years.
For the most part, however, he does not use the book to settle scores. Surprisingly, he makes no mention of Steven Rattner, his former protege who, some say, pushed him out of Lazard. In 1996, Mr. Rohatyn uncharacteristically said Mr. Rattner was ''social climbing without doing any public service.'' Mr. Rattner went on to oversee the Obama administration's overhaul of the auto industry before becoming the subject of a pension fund fraud scandal, which he is in the process of trying to settle.
The closest Mr. Rohatyn comes to a swipe is his retelling of the time he was a candidate to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
''I began to hear that Alan Greenspan at the Fed and Bob Rubin at Treasury were unwilling to support my appointment,'' he wrote. ''I decided there was little point in trying to join a club where even your friends don't want to admit you.''
Mr. Rohatyn, who may be a bit of relic, seems to yearn for a different time, when deals were done over lunch and business wasn't a zero-sum game.
''The crisis of New York City was resolved by mutual respect. You don't see this very much in the present,'' he said. He explained how he was able to work with the unions because everyone had an interest in saving the city. ''We'd fight like hell during the day and then Victor and I would take our kids and go to a Chinese restaurant,'' he said of Victor Gotbaum, the municipal union leader.
He blames a cultural shift in business and politics. Of President Obama, for whom he voted, he says he is now disappointed. ''It's rather frightening mostly because of the collapse of the ability to communicate with other people in a civilized way. The world demands a relationship of mutual civility.''
Right before I left his office, I began to say, ''The world you inhabited - .'' Before I could finish my sentence, he jumped in with, ''is gone.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Grip on the South Continues to Slip

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Kitty Bennett, Barclay Walsh and Amanda Cox contributed research.

 BODY:
JONESBORO, Ark. -- The Southern white Democrat, long on the endangered list, is at risk of being pushed one step closer to extinction.
From Virginia to Florida and South Carolina to Texas, nearly two dozen Democratic seats are susceptible to a potential Republican surge in Congressional races on Election Day, leaving the party facing a situation where its only safe presence in the South is in urban and predominantly black districts.
The swing has been under way since the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson predicted that his fellow Democrats would face a backlash of white voters that would cost the party the South. It continued with Ronald Reagan's election and reached a tipping point in the Republican sweep of 1994, with more than one-third of the victories coming from previously Democratic seats in the South.
This year, retirements of Democrats have left the party scrambling to retain four open seats in Arkansas and Tennessee that have been in their control for most of the last century. Those districts, along with others held by incumbents in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, are central to the Republican strategy to win the House. 
For the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans also are well-positioned to control more state legislative chambers and seats than Democrats in the South, which would have far-reaching effects for redistricting.
''It's not a good prospect for the Democratic Party in the South,'' said Glen Browder, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama. ''It should be a moment of reflection for Democrats. When you forfeit the South, your sights tend to drift too far left.''
The vulnerable Democrats across the South have moved to distance themselves from the party's agenda and President Obama. Several candidates have declared they would not support keeping Nancy Pelosi of California as House speaker if the party holds its majority.
Should a large number of Democratic candidates lose, it would be a significant step in one of the most fundamental, if slow-moving, political realignments in American politics.
There are 59 Democrats in House seats across the South from the 11 states of the old Confederacy, totaling 43 white representatives and 16 black ones. Of those seats in predominantly white districts, nine are leaning Republican, eight are tossups and at least five more are competitive, according to the latest rankings by The New York Times, creating the prospect of the biggest Democratic losses since 1994, when 19 seats fell.
Here in Jonesboro, the First Congressional District has not sent a Republican to Washington since 1873. But the retirement of Representative Marion Berry has created the best opening that Republicans can recall, with Mr. Obama and his party viewed with suspicion. Democrats see the district as a firewall if they are to retain a foothold in the South.
Former President Bill Clinton, who spent his career navigating between his party's liberal sensibilities and the far more centrist instincts of Democrats in his home region, visited the district last week, passing through Batesville and Paragould before arriving for a rally in Jonesboro. He warned voters, ''You are being played,'' and urged people to cast ballots with their economic self interest in mind.
''If it's a referendum on Democrats against some imagined perfection, we'll get whacked,'' Mr. Clinton said in a brief interview. ''If it's a real, informed choice, we'll do fine.''
At every stop, the Democratic Congressional candidate, Chad Causey, stood at Mr. Clinton's side, smiling as the former president offered a lesson on the economy, a defense of Mr. Obama and a plea for voters not to act out of anger on Election Day. Mr. Causey allowed Mr. Clinton to do most of the talking, but he pledged not to be a rubber stamp for the Obama administration or a Democratic Congress.
''I wouldn't have voted for the cap-and-trade bill, and I couldn't have supported the health care bill,'' Mr. Causey said. ''The Constitution doesn't say anything about Democrats and Republicans. It talks about representing constituents, regardless of who's in control in Washington, and carry their voice. That's what I'm going to do.''
Mr. Clinton also took his pitch to Little Rock, where Republicans are poised to pick up another open Democratic district, and later to Mississippi, where Representative Travis W. Childers, a first-term Democrat, is locked in a tough battle to hold a seat that had been in Democratic hands for a century until 1994.
The campaigns, along with the cotton and corn harvest, were in full swing last week across a wide area of the Mississippi Delta. Many of the competitive districts are stitched together on a map from Arkansas to Tennessee to Mississippi, and Republicans argue that a political realignment is overdue, considering the underlying conservatism of the region.
Rick Crawford, a farm broadcaster here in Jonesboro, is the Republican candidate seeking to replace Mr. Berry, who was elected to the House in 1996 after working on agriculture policy in the Clinton White House. Mr. Crawford said that a cultural and generational change was under way, with voters willing to give a Republican candidate a chance that years ago they would not have.
''It's getting easier to run as a Republican here,'' Mr. Crawford said in an interview. ''We have a lot of folks who have moved into Arkansas who were not necessarily brought up with the idea that they had to vote Democrat because their daddy did it and their granddaddy did it that way.''
Democratic candidates across the South are working to adjust to the new realities. Roy Herron, a candidate in the open Sixth District of Tennessee, said he was trying to persuade people that he is still ''a Tennessee Democrat, a conservative.'' As he campaigns, he calls himself a ''truck-driving, shotgun- shooting, Bible-reading, gospel-preaching, crime-fighting, family-loving country boy.''
Representatives John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Chet Edwards of Texas and Tom Perriello of Virginia are among those on the list of at-risk Democrats. Democrats concede that at least three Florida seats might be out of reach, while several districts in North Carolina are suddenly competitive.
The ranks of Southern Democrats could be significantly thinner next year, with the makeup of rural lawmakers particularly different. The only incumbents with easy paths to re-election appear to be Democrats from majority black districts, like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina and 15 others.
Don Fowler of South Carolina, who is a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the party could lose those seats for years to come if Republicans win the districts in November. He said the Southern states with significant population growth, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, might be the only ones to retain significant Democratic representation.
''In those places where there has not been a demographic change and you are relying on a split between most white people and African-Americans, the move toward Republicans is going to proceed at pace,'' Mr. Fowler said. ''But if there were 18 to 20 losses this year, that would be catastrophic.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Are at Odds On Relevance of Keynes

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A rift has emerged within the Democratic Party between liberal economists, who generally view the 2009 stimulus package as a success and say that Keynesian economics should remain the heart of the party's economic policy, and elected officials, who in growing numbers have shunned affiliation with the $787 billion effort and are expressing doubts about the effectiveness of fiscal intervention.
For decades, Keynesian policies, which call for government spending to make up for the shortfall in private-sector demand during an economic downturn, have been a central element of the Democratic tool kit and a principle of the party's identity. But the unpopularity of the stimulus package signed into law by President Obama has left many Democrats in competitive races distancing themselves from such programs, raising questions about whether the party is beginning a more fundamental rethinking of its approach to the economy. 
The implications could extend well beyond this election cycle. To the extent that faith in deficit spending during downturns is eroded, the Federal Reserve could face increasing pressure to deploy monetary policy to lift the economy out of a rut -- a prospect that has unsettled officials at the central bank. A shift among Democrats could increase pressure in Congress to rein in the growth of government spending, slash the budget deficit and reduce the national debt -- even during a period of weakness that traditional Keynesian theory would say requires more deficit spending.
Ambivalence about using government borrowing and spending to spur the economy is longstanding. During the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wavered repeatedly over the size of the New Deal; budgetary retrenchment helped set off a second deep recession in 1937-38.
''Not until World War II, with the need for revenue so large and the unity around winning the war so strong, was that ambivalence pushed aside,'' said Gary Gerstle, a historian at Vanderbilt University.
A Keynesian consensus held until the 1970s -- even President Richard M. Nixon accepted the label -- but began to be discredited during the ''stagflation'' of the latter part of that decade. The apparent revival of Keynesian doctrine during the 2007-9 recession now appears to have been short-lived.
''Obama had a brief opening, he probably thought it was more of an opening than it was,'' Mr. Gerstle said. ''For him to have been able to build upon it, he would have needed more results: not only lower unemployment but also a greater manifestation of the stimulus's impact.''
And yet, a spate of recent research from the Congressional Budget Office, Wall Street banks and independent economists has documented that the stimulus, while imperfect, helped avert greater job losses and a greater drop in economic output.
Moreover, top Democratic economists favor more stimulus. ''The stimulus performed more or less as predicted,'' said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. ''The problem is the economy is worse than predicted.''
At a recent forum at the International Monetary Fund, Joseph E. Stiglitz, who later led the same council under Mr. Clinton, said: ''The question is: Do we face up to the reality and do what we clearly need to do, which is have a second round of stimulus?''
Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the council until last month, favors additional action, too. She had advocated an even larger package -- on the order of $1.2 trillion -- than what was passed in February 2009.
''If we take sensible actions that involve more fiscal, more monetary stimulus, we can start growing again, we can bring that unemployment rate down to much more normal levels,'' Ms. Romer said in the same forum as Mr. Stiglitz. ''If we don't, then I think we're in for a long, hard slog.''
It is difficult to find Congressional Democrats expressing such views.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee oversees efforts to help scores of House members, acknowledged that ''there are not a lot that are arguing for more stimulus,'' but added, ''There are a lot that argue that the recovery bill helped stabilize an economy that was in free fall.''
Mr. Van Hollen pointed to several lawmakers who have created advertisements around stimulus provisions, like Representatives Tom Perriello of Virginia, Steve Driehaus of Ohio and James L. Oberstar of Minnesota. But an ad by Mr. Perriello, a vulnerable freshman, highlights his support for expanding broadband, clearing park trails, preserving police officers' jobs, weatherizing homes and promoting alternative energy -- all without mentioning the stimulus package of which those efforts were a part. His Republican opponent has denounced the stimulus.
The design of the stimulus -- which included tax cuts, aid to state and local governments and investments in public works -- may have contributed to the perception that it was ineffective. For example, while Roosevelt's investments on infrastructure were highly visible, under the Obama plan, money on public works has largely gone to mundane projects like road repair.
The administration's latest proposals -- letting businesses deduct from their taxes the full value of new equipment purchases, making permanent a tax credit for corporate research and development, and creating an infrastructure bank for long-term projects -- are far more modest.
''The president has this year been proposing historically bipartisan policies that would help stand up the private sector and accelerate our recovery,'' said Austan D. Goolsbee, who succeeded Ms. Romer as chairman of the council. ''I hope that at some point opposition, for the sake of opposition, is going to lessen.''
But that seems unlikely, as long as the recovery plods along slowly. ''It would be a mistake to attribute the distancing from Obama's stimulus entirely to political caution or opportunism,'' said Robert S. Weisbrot, a historian at Colby College. ''As much as those factors may be important, it is dismaying how little evidence there is to show for it. Maybe we need even more, but surely $800 billion should have counted for something.''

HEADLINE: In a Meeting With Pakistanis, U.S. Will Seek to Repair a Strained Relationship

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ERIC SCHMITT; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Pakistani civilian and military leaders arrive here this week for high-level meetings, the Obama administration will begin trying to mend a relationship badly damaged by the American military's tough new stance in the region.
Among the sweeteners on the table will be a multiyear security pact with Pakistan, complete with more reliable military aid -- something the Pakistani military has long sought to complement the five-year, $7.5 billion package of nonmilitary aid approved by Congress last year. The administration will also discuss how to channel money to help Pakistan rebuild after its ruinous flood. 
But the American gestures come at a time of fraying patience on the part of the Obama administration, and they will carry a familiar warning, a senior American official said: if Pakistan does not intensify its efforts to crack down on militants hiding out in the tribal areas of North Waziristan, or if another terrorist plot against the United States were to emanate from Pakistani soil, the administration would find it hard to persuade Congress or the American public to keep supporting the country.
''Pakistan has taken aggressive action within its own borders. But clearly, this is an ongoing threat and more needs to be done,'' the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said Monday. ''That will be among the issues talked about.''
The Pakistanis will come with a similarly mixed message. While Pakistan is grateful for the strong American support after the flood, Pakistani officials said, it remains frustrated by what it perceives as the slow pace of economic aid, the lack of access to American markets for Pakistani goods and the administration's continued lack of sympathy for the country's confrontation with India.
Other potentially divisive topics are likely to come up, too, including NATO's role in reconciliation talks between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and the Taliban. Pakistani officials say they are nervous about being left out of any political settlement involving the Taliban.
Still, in a relationship suffused by tension and flare-ups -- most recently over a NATO helicopter gunship that accidentally killed three Pakistani soldiers and Pakistan's subsequent decision to close a supply route into Afghanistan -- this regular meeting, known here as the strategic dialogue, serves as a lubricant to keep both countries talking.
At this meeting, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will formally introduce the new American ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter. Mr. Munter, who recently served in Iraq, replaces Anne W. Patterson, who just wrapped up her tour of duty in Islamabad.
''No country has gotten more attention from Secretary Clinton than Pakistan,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan's delegation will be led by its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, but much of the attention will be on another official, the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who is viewed by many as the most powerful man in Pakistan.
White House and Pentagon officials said one immediate goal of this meeting was to ease the tensions that led Pakistan to close the border crossing at Torkham, halting NATO supplies into Afghanistan. Officials on both sides said that acrimony from the border flare-up had already receded, soothed by the multiple apologies that American officials made to Pakistan last week.
Last week, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that General Kayani had assured him that Pakistan's army would tackle the North Waziristan haven, but on Pakistan's timetable. In an interview, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said, ''Our American partners understand that we have 34,000 troops in North Waziristan. Our soldiers have been engaged in flood relief after history's worst floods. It is not a question of lack of will.''
The new security pact would have three parts: the sale of American military equipment to Pakistan, a program to allow Pakistani military officers to study at American war colleges and counterinsurgency assistance to Pakistani troops.
Currently, the United States spends about $1.5 billion a year to provide this same assistance, but it is doled out year by year. The new agreement, if endorsed by Congress, would approve a multiyear plan assuring stability and continuity in the programs, although Congress would continue to appropriate the financing on a yearly basis. ''This is designed to make our military and security assistance to Pakistan predictable and to signal to them that they can count on us,'' said a senior official.
At the last dialogue in Islamabad in July, Mrs. Clinton presented more than $500 million in economic aid, including plans to renovate hospitals, upgrade hydroelectric dams, improve water distribution and help farmers export mangoes. But the floods upended those plans, and officials said they now planned to redirect funds to more urgent needs.
This week's meeting will also be shadowed by a new eruption of political instability in Pakistan: the government of President Asif Ali Zardari is locked in a confrontation with the Supreme Court over the court's demand that senior ministers be fired on corruption charges. Analysts said they were less worried about the atmospherics than the underlying differences in perspective. The administration's public contrition for the cross-border attack has largely resolved that issue, said Daniel S. Markey, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.
But Mr. Markey said he saw potential friction stemming from the American openness to reconciliation with the Taliban. With the United States facilitating rather than guiding the talks, he said, there could be poor coordination between the Afghans, NATO and others -- all of which would rattle the Pakistanis.
''Washington is opening the door to a range of negotiations with groups that it has discouraged Pakistan against working with in the past,'' he said. ''This sends a mixed signal, and cannot help but encourage hedging on Islamabad's part.''
Another potential bone of contention is one of President Obama's nuclear objectives: a global accord to end the production of new nuclear fuel. Pakistan has led the opposition to the accord. And without its agreement, the treaty would be basically useless.
Mr. Qureshi blamed the United States for the situation, saying Washington signed a civilian nuclear accord with India that discriminated against Pakistan. ''You have disturbed the nuclear balance,'' he said in a recent interview in New York, ''and we have been forced to develop a new strategy.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Sits at an International Table to Discuss Afghanistan

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
ROME -- For the first time, Iran has sent a representative to a meeting of an international group that convenes regularly to discuss developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a move welcomed Monday by both American and international officials.
The Iranian, Mohammed Ali Qanezadeh, a high-ranking diplomat, even attended an in-depth briefing Monday morning by the American military commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus, on NATO's strategy for transition in Afghanistan. Iran, which shares a long and porous border with western Afghanistan, has deep political, cultural and economic ties there.
Iran may have been motivated to attend by the theme of the conference, which was transition -- another term for so-called Afghanization, plans by NATO forces to hand over responsibility for security to the Afghans. The meeting was intended to prepare for transition talks at the NATO summit meeting in Lisbon next month. 
Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the United States had been forewarned of the Iranian presence. ''We were asked if we had any problems with that, and we said no,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.
Mr. Holbrooke said that Iran had serious concerns about drug trafficking and immigration from Afghanistan and stressed that the representative was there only to discuss that country. He said other issues between the United States and Iran, including friction over Iran's nuclear program, would not be on the table.
A Western diplomat said Mr. Qanezadeh, the Foreign Ministry's director general for Asia, had reacted favorably.
''He said he was pleased by the transparency of the briefings, impressed by the transparency of the presentations,'' the official said, speaking anonymously because of diplomatic sensitivities.
It was the ninth meeting of the international contact group, which now includes 44 countries concerned with Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group was formed in April 2009 after President Obama suggested that it should include Iran and other neighboring countries, as well as countries that were contributing troops to the war in Afghanistan.
But Iran had previously refrained from taking part in the contact group, even though it had at first said that it welcomed the idea.
The German representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Michael Steiner, chairman of the contact group, said that during a visit he made to Tehran in August he encouraged the Iranians to attend.
''It's the most natural thing to have the Iranian representative here,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''It proves that we are on the right track. I think it's good news.''
Mr. Steiner said that Mr. Qanezadeh did not express Iran's stated position calling for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. The Iranian delegate told the other members that ''when it comes to dealing with extremists of the Taliban, there needs to be a mix of soft and hard approaches,'' meaning military action and political negotiations, Mr. Steiner said.
The Iranian delegate listened to General Petraeus's PowerPoint presentation ''very attentively,'' Mr. Steiner said.
A senior Western official said: ''This is one area where Iran and the West have similar overlapping strategic interests. They see us entering a new phase and they want to be part of it.''
An Afghan analyst said he saw the Iranians' presence at the meeting as an attempt to keep pace with Pakistan.
''Lately we hear Pakistan saying they will help with talks with the Taliban and other issues relating to Afghanistan, and so Iran now has to move forward, too, and show its participation in being engaged in Afghanistan,'' said Waheed Muzhda, a former Taliban official and a political analyst in Kabul. ''Iran and Pakistan have always tried to curb one another's influence in the area.''
Iran has also called for a withdrawal of forces from Iraq, but has appeared willing not to press that position too vigorously, because the Americans are supporting the Shiite-led government that the Iranians also back.
Mr. Holbrooke noted that 10 members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference were also attending the Rome session for the first time.
''This is a living refutation of the clash of civilizations theory that is so popular with Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.
Mr. Steiner said: ''There's something which unites us. We don't want chaos in Afghanistan. Also the Iranians don't want a situation where the international community leaves Afghanistan and leaves behind chaos.''
More simply, the Italian representative, Attilio Massimo Iannucci, said, ''Iran is too important to exclude.''

HEADLINE: Claiming Responsibility: Understanding the Rise and Popularity of Hitler

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Interpreting primary source material to develop historical theories about Nazi Germany. 

 BODY:
 Overview | Did the German people elevate Hitler, or did Hitler victimize the Germans? How do historians formulate claims about complex historical events? In this lesson, students consider competing historical claims about responsibility for the rise of Adolf Hitler and then examine primary sources to generate and support their own historical claims. They also consider what the significance of these claims might be for contemporary society. 
 Materials | Computers with Internet access and projector, research materials, copies of the handout Staking a Historical Claim (PDF)
 Warm-Up | Show students a short film of crowds cheering as Adolf Hitler is driven through the streets of Berlin in 1940. As they watch, have students write down everything they notice. Afterward, tell students to write down at least two questions. 
Have a short discussion focused on the following questions: What is happening in this film? What does it tell you about the time and place that it depicts? What more do you want to know about the setting and context? (Tell them that it shows a victory parade celebrating the Nazis' victory over France.) What have you learned previously about Hitler and Nazi Germany? What perspective does this film give you on Hitler and his supporters? What questions do you have? And finally: How and why do you think Hitler was able to become so popular in Germany?
 Related | In the article "Hitler Exhibition Explores a Wider Circle of Guilt," Michael Slackman discusses an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin that focuses on the society that gave rise to Hitler:
As artifacts go, they are mere trinkets - an old purse, playing cards, a lantern. Even the display that caused the crowds to stop and stare is a simple embroidered tapestry, stitched by village women.
But the exhibits that opened Friday at the German Historical Museum are intentionally prosaic: they emphasize the everyday way that ordinary Germans once accepted, and often celebrated, Hitler.
The household items had Nazi logos and colors. The tapestry, a tribute to the union of church, state and party, was woven by a church congregation at the behest of their priest.
"This is what we call self-mobilization of society," said Hans-Ulrich Thamer, one of three curators to assemble the exhibit at the German Historical Museum. "As a person, Hitler was a very ordinary man. He was nothing without the people."
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
 Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
What does it mean that the exhibition is "intentionally prosaic"? Why was it designed that way?
        
 What is the message of the exhibition? Is this a new way for you to think about Hitler and pre-World War II Germany?
        
Why does the curator of the exhibition think that Germans today need to hear this particular story about Hitler and the Germans who supported him? Do you think the message of this exhibition could be valuable for people in your community? Why or why not?
        
Why does Hans-Ulrich Thamer believe that extremists need to be isolated from society? Do you agree? Why or why not?
        
 Klaus Peter Triebel says, "Our teachers in the past were integrated in that system." What system is he talking about? What role does education play in how we remember history? Why does it matter how teachers tell the story of Hitler?
Related resources:
 Activity | Write the following two quotations from the article on the board: "Hitler did not corral the Germans as much as the Germans elevated Hitler" and "The Germans were the first victims of Hitler." You may also choose to look in your course textbook or classroom encyclopedia and identify related claims made in these sources.
Explain to students that these statements are competing historical claims about the German people's responsibility in promoting the rise of Hitler. Let students know that the job of a historian is to examine historical evidence and then make historical claims supported by that evidence.
Tell students that today they will take on the job of historians. In small groups, they will examine primary source evidence in the form of videos, images, artifacts and historical newspaper articles. Using the evidence and scholarship that they collect, they will then make their own historical claims about the extent to which the German people were responsible for the rise of Hitler.
Make sure to inform them that this activity is a significantly abbreviated version of historical practice and that historians often spend years investigating primary source materials before formulating their own claims.
Explain that after their small-group work is complete, the class will come together to engage in a round-table discussion at which all groups of historians will present their claims and supporting evidence and engage in discussion about the significance of their findings for contemporary society. Inform them that conversations like this round-table discussion are central to the practice of history because in order for historians' claims to be considered valid, they usually have to engage with existing historical scholarship.
Split the class into small groups and provide them with research materials, which might include the following sources, from which to collect evidence and develop a claim:

        
The 1934 New York Times front-page article "Hitler Endorsed by 9 to 1 in Poll on His Dictatorship, But Opposition is Doubled" and other related historical Times articles (accessible to home-delivery subscribers on NYTimes.com and via subscription to the Proquest database)
        
The video they watched at the start of class (and perhaps other existing videos)
        
The slide show of artifacts in the exhibition
        
About.com's collection of photographs of Hitler
        
Spiegel Online's graph of German election results from 1928 to 1933
        
The German Propaganda Archive's collection of pre-1933 Nazi propaganda and photographs of children at play
Give students the Staking a Historical Claim handout (PDF) to record the primary source evidence that they find, to formulate their historical claim and to generate further ideas and questions.
Once all groups have completed their task, bring the class together to engage in a round-table discussion during which all groups present their claims, supporting evidence and further questions. Encourage students to ask questions of presenting groups. Look for instances in which groups present differing interpretations of evidence, conflicting pieces of evidence or conflicting claims. Push students to discuss the conflicts between evidence, interpretations and claims.
After all groups' claims have been discussed, ask students what they noticed about the round-table discussion. Did groups identify different pieces of evidence? Did groups interpret evidence in different ways? How can we tell which interpretations are valid and which are not? What further information would we need in order to make sure our claims have historical validity? Where would they begin to look for more evidence? How did discussing claims and evidence with other historians affect their own ideas? Did this activity help them to understand the job of the historian? If so, how?
 Going Further | Remind students of the following quotation from the article that they read as a class:
One curator said the message was arguably more vital for Germany now than at any time in the past six decades, as rising nationalism, more open hostility to immigrants and a generational disconnect from the events of the Nazi era have older Germans concerned about repeating the past.
Students search recent Times articles for evidence of "rising nationalism" and "open hostility to immigrants," either in Germany or in their home country, then write essays examining current events through the lens of history.
 Standards | This lesson is correlated to McREL's national standards (it can also be aligned to the new Common Core State Standards):

HEADLINE: China Said To Widen Its Embargo Of Minerals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China, which has been blocking shipments of crucial minerals to Japan for the last month, has now quietly halted shipments of those materials to the United States and Europe, three industry officials said on Tuesday.
The Chinese action, involving rare earth minerals that are crucial to manufacturing many advanced products, seems certain to further intensify already rising trade and currency tensions with the West. Until recently, China typically sought quick and quiet accommodations on trade issues. But the interruption in rare earth supplies is the latest sign from Beijing that Chinese leaders are willing to use their growing economic muscle.
''The embargo is expanding'' beyond Japan, said one of the three rare earth industry officials, all of whom insisted on anonymity for fear of business retaliation by Chinese authorities.
They said Chinese customs officials imposed the broader restrictions on Monday morning, hours after a top Chinese official summoned international news media Sunday night to denounce United States trade actions. 
China mines 95 percent of the world's rare earth elements, which have broad commercial and military applications, and are vital to the manufacture of products as diverse as cellphones, large wind turbines and guided missiles. Any curtailment of Chinese supplies of rare earths is likely to be greeted with alarm in Western capitals, particularly because Western companies are believed to keep much smaller stockpiles of rare earths than Japanese companies.
China experts said on Tuesday that Beijing's assertive stance on rare earths might also signal the ascendance of economic nationalists, noting that the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened over the weekend.
Officials at the media relations office of China's commerce ministry did not respond all day on Tuesday to e-mail or telephone calls seeking confirmation of the expanded embargo.
A few rare earth shipments to the West have been delayed by customs officials in recent weeks, said industry officials in China, Japan and the United States, but new restrictions on exports appear to have been imposed on Monday morning.
Industry executives said there had been no signal from Beijing of how long rare earth shipments intended for the West would be held by Chinese customs officials. Nor is it clear if occasional shipments are still being allowed out of the country, or if all shipments have now been suspended.
Word of the blocked shipments emerged from industry officials on Tuesday after an official China newspaper reported earlier in the day that Beijing planned next year to further reduce its annual export quota for rare earths.
The signals of a tougher Chinese trade stance come after American trade officials announced on Friday that they would investigate whether China was violating World Trade Organization rules by subsidizing its clean energy exports and limiting clean energy imports. The inquiry includes whether China's steady reductions in rare earth export quotas since 2005, along with steep export taxes on rare earths, are illegal attempts to force multinational companies to produce more of their high-technology goods in China.
Despite a widely confirmed suspension of rare earth shipments from China to Japan, now nearly a month old, Beijing has continued to deny that any embargo exists.
Industry executives and analysts have interpreted that official denial as a way to wield an undeclared trade weapon without creating a policy trail that could make it easier for other countries to bring a case against China at the World Trade Organization.
So far, China seems to be taking a similar approach in expanding the embargo to the West.
Wang Baodong, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said on Tuesday that the Chinese government was putting new restrictions on the mining, processing and export of rare earths to protect the environment. But he said that China was not violating any W.T.O. rules in doing so and that it was not imposing an embargo or trying to use rare earths as a bargaining chip.
''With stricter export mechanism gradually in place, outbound shipments to other countries might understandably begin to feel the effect,'' Mr. Wang said in an e-mail. ''But I don't see any link between China's reasonable rare earth export control policy and the irrational U.S. decision of protectionist nature to investigate China's clean energy industries.''
Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative in Washington, said that American trade officials were looking into the matter, after a report of the Chinese customs restrictions was published on Tuesday afternoon on the Web site of The New York Times.
''We've seen the news report and are seeking more information in keeping with our recent announcement of an investigation into whether China's actions and policies are consistent with W.T.O. rules.''
Jeremie Waterman, the China director of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that he was still checking government and industry sources to learn the extent of a suspension of Chinese rare earth shipments. ''If it's true, it's disturbing news to say the least,'' he said.
Mr. Waterman said that rare earths were so important to advanced manufacturing that restrictions on their trade might need to be put on the agenda of the Group of 20 meeting of heads of state, scheduled next month in Seoul, South Korea.
The Chinese government office that oversees rare earth policy, which operated with considerable independence for many years, was moved early last year into the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. That ministry, formed only two years ago to draft plans for global leadership in many industries, has emerged as a bastion of economic nationalism.
Despite their name, most rare earths are not particularly rare. But most of the industry has moved to China over the last two decades because of lower costs and weak environmental enforcement there.
Congress is considering legislation to provide loan guarantees for the re-establishment of rare earth mining and manufacturing in the United States. But new mines are likely to take three to five years to reach full production, according to industry executives, although existing uranium mines may be able to move faster by reprocessing previously mined material, which often contains rare earths.
China reduced in July its export quota for rare earths for the second half of the year by 72 percent. Exporters had only six weeks' of quotas left when China imposed its unannounced embargo on shipments to Japan.
China is considering further reductions of up to 30 percent in its 2011 quotas compared with quotas issued in 2010. Dudley Kingsnorth, a rare earth market analyst at Industrial Minerals Company of Australia in Perth, said that if China further reduced export quotas by 30 percent for next year, manufacturers elsewhere could face difficulties.
''That will create some problems,'' he said. ''It'll force some people to look very carefully at the use of rare earths, and we might be reverting to some older technologies until alternative sources of rare earths are developed.''

HEADLINE: A Rising Currency Has Turkey Glowing, In Spite of the Risks

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Day after day, the Turkish stock market has been setting records, lifted by a flood of foreign capital in search of higher yields in Turkey and other fast-growing emerging markets.
So it is no wonder that Mahmut Unlu, the chief executive of Standard Unlu, one of the largest investment banks in Turkey, is smiling.
''This will be our best year ever,'' he said, pointing out that nine of the 10 deals his bank has worked on this year have involved foreign investors. ''And next year will be even better.''
In a bull market, the rewards of hot money can be many. These include financing booming growth and easily covering any consequent widening of a country's trade deficit, not to mention lifting the fortunes of bankers and brokers. 
But, as with most good things, there is a downside: a rapidly appreciating currency that hurts exports and, over the longer run, could lead to a bubble and its eventual bursting as notoriously fickle foreign investors flee for safer harbors.
Like the Turkish lira, which has gained 11 percent against the dollar since early May, currencies of emerging markets the world over -- with the notable exception of the closely controlled Chinese renminbi -- are hitting new highs.
China's surprise decision to raise its interest rates on Tuesday may well be a sign that it is willing to accept a stronger renminbi, although analysts say it is too early to tell.
Elsewhere, emerging-market currencies are being driven by expanding economies in places like India, Brazil, South Africa and Thailand, which are soaking up billions of dollars of capital fleeing low interest rates. Investors are also wary of a weakening dollar if the Federal Reserve moves as expected to increase efforts to revive the United States economy by buying more government securities. But as Thailand and Brazil, among other countries, move to reduce foreign inflows by imposing capital controls -- in part because they worry about losing out in global markets to a China that continues to prevent the renminbi from appreciating more than a tiny amount -- Turkey is following a different path. It has chosen to enjoy its good fortune rather than fight it.
''We won't put up any restrictions,'' said Vedat Akgiray, the chairman of the Capital Markets Board in Turkey. ''If money is going to come into our country, it has to go out.''
Mr. Akgiray scoffs at capital controls imposed by Brazilian regulators -- on Monday they again raised taxes on foreign investors, with fixed income investments now drawing a 6 percent levy, up from 4 percent, while a 2 percent tax remains on stocks -- arguing that they cannot work successfully in today's globalized economies.
''This is a free market, and the currency is just a price that you have to live with,'' he continued. ''Maybe one day we can even have one Turkish lira equal one dollar. Why not?'' (The lira is worth about 70 cents.)
While it is the Turkish treasury and the central bank that have the last say on this topic, Mr. Akgiray's view echoes a broad feeling here that the lira's rise is a just reward for the recent dynamism of Turkey's economy.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have best captured this feeling when he said recently that ''a strong lira is my pride'' on being asked if the government might intervene more aggressively in currency markets in response to complaints from exporters.
With growth of 11 percent through the first two quarters of 2010, Turkey is one of the fastest rising economies in the world. And with its strategic location and surprisingly low levels of debt, it has rapidly become an investor favorite.
In a country that has had many self-inflicted financial crises, and not long ago had a currency that lost 80 percent of its value each year, it is not surprising that the lira's strength has been embraced as an emblem of national pride.
Still, signs are emerging that the stronger currency is taking a toll.
Turkey's current account deficit is one of the fastest growing in emerging markets and it has widened sharply from a small surplus last year to a gap of 5 percent of gross domestic product as vibrant corporate and consumer demand pulls in more and more imports as export growth slows. A richer currency is also pinching Turkey's important tourist trade, which brings in $12 billion a year and, with investor inflows, plays a big role in financing the current account deficit.
''The strong lira is definitely not good for my business,'' said Hasan Huseyin Yokus, who sells carpets in Istanbul's covered bazaar. Mr. Yokus has noticed that his high prices are driving away foreign customers. ''I am not selling enough carpets. People just don't buy as much.''
Tim Lee, an independent economist at Pi Economics in Stamford, Conn., calculated in a recent report that the Turkish lira may be overvalued by as much as 100 percent. He contends, counterintuitively, that local residents, more than foreign investors, are behind the lira's increasing strength. Few other analysts see the lira as being that overvalued, with a majority estimating that the Turkish lira is 10 percent to 15 percent more expensive than it should be against the dollar.
And while some local savers are indeed moving to their own currency from dollars, that may well reflect their confidence in Turkey's economic prospects -- a confidence that has been borne out by the numbers.
Still, there is no doubt that the currency appreciation has dented Turkey's competitiveness. This week the head of a leading export trade group warned that the overvalued currency and hot money flows would lead to financial ruin.
Turkey has also become a more costly place to do business.
''This is a country that has just become too expensive,'' said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based economist for Global Source partners. ''Our foreign direct investment numbers are the lowest they have been for five years -- its cheaper now to invest in Bulgaria, Romania and even Poland.''
To a visitor, there are certainly fewer bargains to be found in Turkey.
From the covered bazaar in Istanbul's old city, where even a modest carpet can cost $1,000, to the more recent opulence of the gleaming Istinye Park mall, where a handbag by the Turkish designer Vakko can be had for $2,450 (not to mention designer chocolate bars for $13), the effect of a robust currency is apparent.
Recently, the Turkish central bank has increased its purchases of dollars to about $400 million to $600 million a day in what has been a relatively unconvincing attempt to restrain the rise of the lira.
But with inflows showing no sign of letting up -- $2 billion poured into bonds and equities in the last two weeks of September alone -- and with the Chinese government saying it, too, will become a big buyer of Turkish bonds, the lira is likely to keep rising.
''People are betting that Turkey will remain stable and the prime minister's view is, Let the money come in,'' said Mr. Unlu, the investment banker. ''As long as this continues, no one can stem the tide.''

HEADLINE: Intel to Build New Chip Plant in Oregon, and Upgrade Others

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation said on Tuesday that it planned to invest $6 billion to $8 billion to upgrade manufacturing plants in the United States and build a new one in Oregon, adding as many as 1,000 new high-tech positions and thousands of construction jobs. 
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has historically used its substantial cash reserves to invest in its manufacturing plants through economic downturns, advancing its technology while rivals struggled to stay afloat. It is a strategy that has been largely successful. Indeed, last week, the company reported better-than-expected earnings on a sharp increase in revenue.
''These investments will create capacity for innovation we haven't yet imagined,'' said Brian M. Krzanich, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's manufacturing and supply chain.
A similar $7 billion investment by Intel about 20 months ago was focused on making chips using 32-nanometer process technology. Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, vowed at that time to invest in chip factories in the United States rather than send the business abroad. He also urged other companies to follow Intel's model of investing in future products despite the recession.
In recent months, Mr. Otellini has railed against incentives and other practices that make it far cheaper for companies to build and operate chip plants abroad. He has estimated it costs $1 billion less to operate a chip factory overseas than in the United States, not because of lower labor costs but because of incentives from foreign governments. Intel generates three-fourths of its revenue from overseas business, but three-fourths of its chip-making employees are in the United States.
Mr. Krzanich told reporters in a conference call that Intel benefited from the large manufacturing base in the United States despite the potential cost savings of manufacturing abroad. He called the plants a great asset ''from a hardware standpoint,'' but also because the employees were highly skilled. ''We're going to utilize that,'' he said.
The upgraded plants will pave the way for higher-performing and sleeker electronic devices by allowing Intel to produce a new generation of 22-nanometer chips. The new Hillsboro, Ore., plant -- Intel's first new plant since 2007 -- is scheduled to start production in 2013.

HEADLINE: Murder Trial Puts Death Penalty in Spotlight in Connecticut Campaigns

BYLINE: By PAUL BASS. 
Paul Bass edits the online New Haven Independent (www.newhavenindependent.org).

 BODY:
If Dannel P. Malloy's gubernatorial campaign had the authority to set Connecticut's court calendar, it probably would have scheduled the state's most sensational murder trial for some other time. Like after Election Day.
As it is, the trial of Steven J. Hayes , one of two men accused of rape and murder in a Cheshire home invasion, has been riveting the state all fall, increasing the majority of voters who tell pollsters they support the death penalty.
Mr. Malloy is one of two Democrats in this fall's two marquee races in Connecticut -- for governor and United States Senate -- who have called for the abolition of the death penalty. The other is Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd.
The two candidates have ended up in different places and have taken different approaches this campaign season, as the Hayes trial kicked up questions about the death penalty and its enforcement. 
In the 1980s, Mr. Blumenthal testified in the State Legislature in favor of abolishing Connecticut's death penalty statute. He did so after representing a Florida death row inmate named Joseph Green Brown, who was wrongly convicted. Mr. Blumenthal succeeded in staving off the man's execution just 15 hours before it was scheduled to take place.
That was then. At a news conference following a Senate campaign debate on Oct. 4. Mr. Blumenthal was asked about that position. He acknowledged it, then noted that as far back as 1990 his changed view had been on public record. ''When I started running for attorney general, I supported the death penalty,'' he said. ''I'm a strong supporter now.''
Mr. Blumenthal argues that DNA advances since the 1980s have reduced the chances of false convictions.
Case closed. He and his Republican opponent, Linda McMahon, went back to trashing each other -- she portrayed by Mr. Blumenthal as a heartless, outsourcing private employer hostile to the minimum wage, and he labeled by Ms. McMahon as a mendacious, clueless, job-killing career politician. No more talk about the death penalty.
In the governor's race, on the other hand, Mr. Malloy never stops hearing about his opposition to the death penalty in light of the shocking murder of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, and the beating of their father, Dr. William A. Petit. When he held a news conference on expanding Connecticut's ports, Mr. Malloy was asked about it. In debates and on the campaign trail, his Republican opponent, Thomas C. Foley, who supports the death penalty, makes sure to mention it and try to force him to reiterate his position.
Mr. Malloy has stuck by his opposition. He has promised to sign a bill to abolish the death penalty if elected. (One of his early supporters, State Representative Gary A. Holder-Winfield of New Haven, succeeded in getting such a bill passed in 2009, only to have Gov. M. Jodi Rell veto it.
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 65 percent of voters expressed support for the death penalty, up from 60 percent a year earlier. A mere 23 percent were opposed. More than three-quarters supported giving the Cheshire defendants the death penalty.
''It's uncomfortable,'' Mr. Malloy acknowledged in an interview Monday. ''In this environment, that does cause consternation.''
As he is asked and reasked his position almost daily on the trail, Mr. Malloy always responds the same way.
He begins by practically begging reporters to allow him to speak in more than a sound bite, to explain how he came to his position from both moral and practical perspectives.
Then he notes that he is a former prosecutor who tried four homicide cases.
He expresses his support for life imprisonment for certain crimes.
He speaks about how Connecticut's death penalty law ''doesn't work,'' how taxpayers spend decades and millions of dollars on death row cases that rarely end in execution.
He notes that it does not appear to be a deterrent. ''There is no data that indicates that it has anything to do with the homicide rate,'' he says. ''If it did, Texas would have one of the lowest homicide rates as opposed to one of the highest homicide rates.''
He brings up the string of cases of innocent people on death row exonerated by DNA evidence. ''You can't unring a bell,'' he says. ''You can't bring back somebody to life that you have mistakenly put to death.''
He says the death sentences disproportionately fall on African-Americans.
But he also says that if elected governor, he will not interfere should a jury decide that the death penalty is an appropriate sentence for the two Cheshire murder defendants.
Moral and practical arguments aside, Mr. Malloy takes solace in another result of the new Quinnipiac poll: Only 6 percent of respondents said a candidate's position on the death penalty would be a deciding factor in their vote.
There's no way to fact-check that finding -- at least not before Nov. 2.
Embracing Bush: Democrats haven't tired of demonizing George W. Bush, but the way they're doing so shows how successfully the former president redefined the tax debate in this country. Witness a pitch Mr. Blumenthal made in rallying his labor base earlier this month. ''We can't go back to the Bush administration's trickle-down economics,'' the candidate told union activists at a New Haven rally. Then he offered one example of what's at stake: ''We need a middle-class tax cut now.'' He was referring to Democrats' efforts to renew all the soon-to-expire Bush cuts except those on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Like their counterparts in Washington, Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. McMahon basically agree on 98 percent of the Bush cuts.
No News Here: After their third and final televised debate last week, Ms. McMahon broke with tradition and immediately left the premises without first answering questions from reporters. She had good reason: Her encounters with pack reporting have ended badly. In one case, she stumbled on her position on the minimum wage, as well as her knowledge of the law; at another, her campaign's intention to stay on message about positive poll results devolved into an effort to pin her down on the details of her positions on health care and taxes. With no more debates or formal news conferences scheduled, look for Ms. McMahon to avoid packs of reporters and exert better control of her news media encounters. She can also rely on paid media, including the continued broadcasting of a powerful commercial produced by Scott Howell & Company showing Mr. Blumenthal stumbling in a debate when asked, ''How do you create a job?''

HEADLINE: Goldman Not Leading the Pack

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs is coming down to earth with a bit of a bump. Sure, the third-quarter earnings of $1.9 billion handily beat what analysts had expected for the Wall Street giant, led by Lloyd Blankfein. That's good news any time, and especially after talk of a summer slowdown. But Goldman's results usually lead the pack. Not this time.
Take the company's market-leading franchise in fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, where revenue fell 14 percent from the second quarter, or around 10 percent after accounting for losses taken by marking up the value of its own debt. 
That's not bad. But it's the biggest drop of the major companies that have reported so far. Citigroup's revenue in the same business area was almost flat, and JPMorgan Chase's actually improved slightly after adjusting for marking its liabilities to market value. Traders at a resurgent Bank of America took in more than 50 percent more revenue than in the previous three months and crowed about logging a perfect record, meaning no trading losses on any day in the quarter.
It's the second quarter in a row that Goldman's traders have slipped. Last time, revenue at the company's equities unit fell precipitously. That helped push company's second-quarter return on equity down to 9.5 percent, excluding the one-time British bonus tax and the cost of settling a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, the company managed to improve only to a humdrum 10.3 percent return on equity. Compare that to JPMorgan: its investment bank returned 13 percent, and its asset management unit 25 percent.
Goldman's showing is hardly disastrous. Its investment bankers enjoyed a decent summer, with underwriting revenue jumping 40 percent and mergers bringing in 5 percent more income. Equities trading recovered somewhat, and at $3.77 billion, Goldman's revenue from trading in fixed income, currency and commodities is still the largest in its peer group.
And the relative underperformance of the bank's traders of late may just be a blip in their otherwise enviable record. But for once, these sometimes omniscient-seeming masters of the financial universe are looking like mere mortals.
Renminbi Hope
China's first interest rate increase since 2007 sounds more momentous than it actually is. But the modesty of the 0.25 percentage point move means there's scope for more substantial action on the country's too-cheap currency.
There are two good reasons for China to tighten, namely to push interest rates above inflation and to curb runaway property prices. The new, higher deposit rate of 2.5 percent and lending rate of 5.56 percent won't really do either. The central bank's action may just take the edge off stirring inflation, but the maximum allowable reward for holding deposits is still below the hoped-for inflation rate of 3 percent. Depositors' own inflation expectations are likely to be much higher. China's savings are still being bled away.
Dwindling savings returns have driven depositors back to real-estate speculation, and the rate increases won't be enough to reverse that. Urban property prices rose 9.1 percent year-on-year in September, and total transactions by value were up more than 50 percent from August. Raising interest rates might threaten a property crash if buyers were highly mortgaged, but they are not. Moreover, the expectation of property gains is now so engrained that a tiny rise in rates is unlikely to dampen the mania.
The rate increases may be only a baby step, but they aren't pointless. Data on the country's gross domestic product and on inflation to be released Thursday are likely to show that demand remains strong and price pressures are rising. China's G.D.P. is expected to grow by 10 percent this year. That means interest rates are still low in absolute terms and there is room for more tightening of the kind that both China's consumers and trade partners really need.
Beijing can help control inflation by allowing its currency to appreciate, putting a damper on commodity and other input prices. That would make Chinese exporters less competitive but not deter the budding consumers the country hopes to promote.
A stronger renminbi is what almost all of China's trade partners crave, especially given the currency's recent declines against almost all of its major trading partners. By raising rates just a little, Beijing may have left itself room for a welcome sequel.

HEADLINE: Intermission, at Best, in Battle Over Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Bank of America may be trying to bring down the curtain on the foreclosure furor, but there were numerous indications Tuesday that the problems would not move off-stage so quickly.
A day after the bank said it would once again pursue defaulting borrowers in the 23 states where foreclosures were overseen by the courts, judges in Florida said they were expecting even more challenges from defaulting homeowners.
The White House is convening a meeting of regulators and administration officials on Wednesday to review federal investigations into the foreclosure crisis, while state law enforcement officials emphasized their inquiry into flawed foreclosures was continuing. 
''There has been an attempt by some of the major servicers to indicate there are no problems,'' said Patrick Madigan, an assistant attorney general in Iowa. ''We're not at the end of this process. We're at the beginning.''
All 50 state attorneys general have joined in an investigation into lenders' foreclosure processes, which in at least some cases appear to have been so sloppy that legal requirements went by the wayside.
The lenders maintain the errors involved mere technicalities, while lawyers for defaulting homeowners say they are symptomatic of a foreclosure system out of control.
The Obama administration, which declined last week to push for a national freeze on foreclosures, emphasized Tuesday that it was committed to holding accountable any bank that had violated the law.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said that the administration was ''strongly supporting the investigation by the state attorneys general'' while noting that the Federal Housing Administration and Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force have undertaken their own investigation.
Federal regulators have been looking into loan servicing problems for some months before the recent freezes by the big lenders. The meeting at the White House on Wednesday, which will be attended by the housing and urban development secretary, Shaun Donovan, among others, will focus in part on concerns about the foreclosure crisis's effect on the housing market and the larger economy.
In remarks at a quarterly news briefing Tuesday, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the Fed was ''seeking to establish the facts'' in conjunction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
''We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back office operations,'' he said. He gave no timetable for when such a review might be completed.
Whatever the outcome of the various investigations, the era when the vast majority of foreclosures were unopposed and easily granted may be waning. Some judges in Florida, the state whose courtrooms are the most overwhelmed by foreclosures, said they were likely to scrutinize the papers submitted by the big lenders with extra care.
''If we get information that there was a problem with a prior affidavit, maybe we look more carefully at the next one,'' said Peter D. Blanc, chief judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Thomas McGrady, chief judge of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Clearwater, said it was still an open question for him and other judges whether they would accept amended documents from Bank of America or force the lender to refile its cases.
''All of the courts are struggling with this,'' Mr. McGrady said.
The investigation by the state attorneys general is so new -- it was formed last week -- that its scope is still being settled. Behind the question of improper foreclosure documentation lies a more important issue of whether lenders even have legal standing to foreclose because they lack the original mortgage note as required by law.
''The problems are not over, but their extent remains to be seen,'' said Mr. Madigan, the Iowa assistant attorney general.
Bank of America, the country's largest lender, announced it was unfreezing foreclosures in the 23 states less than three weeks after it froze them. A process that many expected to take months was completed in days.
In its statement, the bank said that it had ''reviewed our process'' and found it satisfactory enough to file new affidavits in 102,000 pending cases starting next week. Documents in those cases were presumably improperly done before. A bank spokesman declined Tuesday to explain more fully the lender's review process.
GMAC Mortgage, another large lender that had announced a freeze, also said it was refiling cases. ''We have more training, more people, a more robust policy now,'' Gina Proia, a spokeswoman said.
Four years ago, in a case that foreshadowed the current uproar, a Florida court censured GMAC for false testimony. An employee said in a deposition that she had neither reviewed the record of the mortgage in the case nor known how it was created, which contradicted her sworn affidavit.
GMAC promised at the time to clean up its procedures, reminding employees not to sign court pleadings unless they had independently reviewed and checked the facts.
Despite GMAC and Bank of America's proclamations that everything is now being done by the book, some legal and financial experts are disbelieving.
''The banks have dragged their feet and taken forever to do loan modifications, yet within less than two weeks they have managed to review hundreds of thousands of foreclosure cases,'' said Adam J. Levitin, an associate professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center. ''It is simply not credible.''
Mr. Levitin is convinced that the lenders will suffer for what he sees as their attempt to put themselves above the rules. ''The genie is out of the bottle,'' he said.
While most cases in Florida are still unopposed, the judges there are already starting to see an increase in defendants with counsel, even if they are simply acting as their own lawyer.
''The largest impact has been from the publicity,'' said Lee E. Haworth, chief justice of the 12th Judicial Circuit in Sarasota. ''A lot more borrowers are coming forward to oppose summary judgment. More hearings are going to be contested.''

HEADLINE: In G.O.P. Calls to Cut Spending, Hows Are Few

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In Indiana, Representative Mike Pence, the No. 3 House Republican, complains about ''runaway federal spending on steroids.''
In Alaska, the Republican candidate for the Senate, Joe Miller, talks about ''out of control spending.'' And in Arizona, Jesse Kelly, a Republican hoping to oust Representative Gabrielle Giffords, says, ''We're spending our way into bankruptcy.''
If there is a single message unifying Republican candidates this year, it is a call to grab hold of the federal checkbook, slam it closed and begin to slash spending. To bolster their case that action is needed, Republicans are citing major legislation over the four years that Democrats have controlled Congress, notably the financial system bailout, the economic stimulus and the new health care law.
But while polls show that the Republicans' message is succeeding politically, Republican candidates and party leaders are offering few specifics about how they would tackle the nation's $13.7 trillion debt, and budget analysts said the party was glossing over the difficulty of carrying out its ideas, especially when sharp spending cuts could impede an already weak economic recovery. 
''On the actual campaign trail, you are hearing virtually none of the kind of blatant honesty that we need about what changes would fix this situation,'' said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group in Washington that promotes fiscal restraint.
The parties share blame for the current fiscal situation, but federal budget statistics show that Republican policies over the last decade, and the cost of the two wars, added far more to the deficit than initiatives approved by the Democratic Congress since 2006, giving voters reason to be skeptical of campaign promises.
Calculations by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and other independent fiscal experts show that the $1.1 trillion cost over the next 10 years of the Medicare prescription drug program, which the Republican-controlled Congress adopted in 2003, by itself would add more to the deficit than the combined costs of the bailout, the stimulus and the health care law.
The House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, has called for immediate cuts in ''non-security discretionary'' spending to prerecession 2008 levels. Independent analysts say that would require eliminating about $105 billion -- or more than 20 percent of spending by departments like Education, Transportation, Interior, Commerce and Energy -- a level of reductions that history suggests would be extremely hard to execute. (Since 1982, nonmilitary discretionary spending has never dropped by more than 5.5 percentage points in any given year.)
At the same time, most Republicans are calling for the permanent extension of all Bush-era tax cuts, which would add $700 billion more to the deficit over the next 10 years than President Obama and Democratic leaders have proposed by continuing only some of the lower rates.
Republicans say extending the cuts will spur economic activity, but that is hardly guaranteed. And the cost of either plan is astronomical: Mr. Obama's plan will add more than $3 trillion to the deficit; the Republicans' plan will add more than $4 trillion.
Mr. Boehner, who is the likely speaker in a Republican-controlled House, has also said he would move to overhaul the Congressional appropriations process, to give more power to rank-and-file lawmakers, and cast sunlight on proposed expenditures.
But he is likely to encounter fierce resistance among veteran appropriators who zealously protect the Congressional power of the purse enshrined in the Constitution, and who will be eager to flex the legislative muscle of their committee and subcommittee chairmanships, a main perquisite of winning a majority.
On the campaign trail, many Republicans are calling for a repeal of the health care law, a step that would actually increase the deficit by more than $100 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, by eliminating some cost-saving provisions -- a fact that typically goes unmentioned. Republicans counter that the full cost of the health care law will only kick in later, so that repeal would save money in the long run.
''It's very easy in the course of a campaign to run against deficit spending as this abstract monster, but when you are actually in power, you have to propose actual policies and follow through on them and that's something they are much less willing to do,'' said John Irons, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning Washington research group.
''Everyone is saying there's hard choices, there are tough decisions to be made, but not one is actually telling the voters how they would make those tradeoffs,'' Mr. Irons said. ''No one is saying, 'Here's what I would cut.' The Boehner plan is clearly in that vein.''
Some Republican candidates are pressing the anti-spending message into largely uncharted terrain. Rand Paul, the Republican candidate for Senate in Kentucky, has said Congress must consider paring military programs, putting him at odds with the dominant Republican view since the Reagan era.
A small number of Republicans, notably Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have called for sharp reductions to Social Security and Medicare to change the nation's fiscal trajectory. But party leaders and candidates on the stump have largely shunned those proposals, which risk alienating core segments of voters.
As a result, the campaign rhetoric has been largely general if not simplistic.
''For Michael Bennet, reckless spending has become a bad habit,'' a Republican attack ad against the Democratic incumbent declares in the Colorado Senate race. ''Obama's failed stimulus. Trillion-dollar government-run health care. And to pay for it? More taxes, higher national debt. Michael Bennet: he spends, we pay.''
A commercial against Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, shows schoolchildren stooping under the weight of heavy backpacks. ''There's a lot on the backs of our kids today, thanks to Congressman Gerry Connolly,'' the ad says, urging voters to demand lower spending.
In New Hampshire, Frank Guinta, a Republican running against Representative Carol Shea-Porter, declares, ''We're fed up. Government is too big; it's spending too much money.''
Ms. MacGuineas, who advised Senator John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, said that she welcomed the public's growing recognition of the severity of the nation's fiscal problems but that the partisan campaign rhetoric could impede the bipartisan cooperation needed to impose tough policy changes. And both sides, she said, bear responsibility.
The fight over the expiring Bush-era tax cuts illustrates the point, she said. Democrats say they want to continue tax cuts only for ''the middle class.'' Republicans say allowing any of the reduced rates to rise again amounts to an unconscionable tax increase. For fiscal experts, it is a false choice. ''The debate is between two just mind-bogglingly irresponsible approaches to tax policy,'' Ms. MacGuineas said.
In Congress, an early test of Republican resolve will come shortly after the election when lawmakers return to Washington for a lame-duck session. Democrats will almost certainly try to pass the regular appropriations bills, or an omnibus spending measure for the 2011 fiscal year.
At that point, given the likely difficulties of enacting their own proposed cuts, Republicans will have to choose between allowing Democrats to adopt the spending measures for 2011 and being able to criticize Democrats for their choices (while also potentially securing some spending increases favored by Republicans) or using the power of Senate Republicans to filibuster and delay action on the spending bills until the new Congress takes over next year.
Of course, who actually serves in the next Congress could depend on the more simplistic discussion of fiscal issues now dominating the airwaves in campaign commercials.
''The reckless spending must stop,'' declares a commercial for Carly Fiorina, who is running against Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California.
Moments later, Ms. Fiorina appears on screen. ''We can make Washington work,'' she says reassuringly. ''Cut spending, ban earmarks.''

HEADLINE: China's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates, Jolting World Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Barboza reported from Beijing, and Christine Hauser from New York. Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- A surprise announcement by China's central bank that it would raise interest rates for the first time in nearly three years jolted world financial markets Tuesday, as investors worried that China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, could slow and crimp the global recovery.
Stocks were sharply lower on exchanges in Europe and the United States. Oil and other commodities, all affected by the world economic outlook, also declined. 
''Any time China tries to tighten the reins on their economy, it will have a ripple-down effect on the rest of the globe,'' said Brad Sorensen, the director for market and sector analysis at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Weak quarterly reports from financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, and signs of weakness from technology companies like Apple and I.B.M., also weighed on the United States markets.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 165.07 points, or 1.48 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 43.71 points, or 1.76 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 18.81 points, or 1.59 percent. The yield for the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note yield fell to 2.48 percent, from 2.51 percent Monday.
In London, the FTSE 100 index was down 38.63 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,703.89, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 25.94 points, or 0.40 percent, to 6,490.69.
In Asia on Wednesday, the stock market reaction was mixed. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan was down 1.6 percent in afternoon trade, while the key indexes in Hong Kong and Australia sagged about 0.9 percent. But in mainland China, the Shanghai composite index reversed morning losses, to stand about 0.7 percent higher by around noon. The markets in Taiwan and South Korea rose by similar amounts.
Mr. Sorensen said that China's rate increase was small. The People's Bank of China increased its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage point, so deposit rates will rise to 2.25 percent, and a crucial lending rate will climb to 5.56 percent. He suggested that investors had been preparing to take profits anyway after several weeks in which the dollar weakened and stocks declined.
''Really it was just time to sell, take some profits and that was a good excuse to do it,'' he said, referring to the Chinese rate increase.
China's effort to take control of its galloping economy contrasts sharply with economic policies in developed nations like the United States, where officials are trying to spur growth by keeping interest rates low. In Washington, the Federal Reserve declined to comment, in keeping with its policy of not remarking on the actions of other central banks.
The prospect that the Federal Reserve may pump more money into the American economy has Chinese officials worried that much of that money will find its way here, creating even more problems with higher asset prices and other forms of inflation. Fed policy makers will meet on Nov. 2 and 3.
Charles L. Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, signaled in a speech on Tuesday that the Fed could buy assets to raise prices temporarily. ''I think this could be helpful, I think we should talk about it,'' he said.
China's rate increase is the latest indication that it is struggling against stubborn inflation, soaring housing prices and an overly buoyant economy that is pumping out exports, resulting in the accumulation of huge amounts of foreign exchange reserves.
It acted after the government reported a surge in bank lending and property prices in September and found indications that inflation may have also risen sharply last month, after a big jump in August.
Analysts said they were surprised by the decision, because a central bank official had suggested recently that no rate increase was needed.
''This move is symbolically huge,'' Dong Tao, a Hong Kong-based economist at Credit Suisse, said by e-mail. ''Yet it may only have limited impact on the real economy because overall rates are still at excessively low levels. This move probably will dampen sentiment in the property sector and equity market in the short run. However, we think excess liquidity will still prevail, if this is just a one-off rate hike.''
The market declines on Tuesday also occurred against the backdrop of corporate earnings reports. Apple said after the market closed on Monday that it expected declines in its gross margins in the current quarter. And I.B.M. said late Monday that the pace of its services contracts was slower than it had expected.
The technology sector ended the day nearly 2 percent lower, with shares of Apple and I.B.M. down about 3 percent. Materials and energy stocks were also down more than 2 percent.
Financials were down more than 1.5 percent, after rising more than 2 percent on Monday because of an upbeat earnings report from Citigroup. Bank of America said Tuesday that although its operating profit had rebounded, it had a loss of $7.3 billion in the third quarter because of a $10.4 billion write-down in the value of its credit card business. It traded down more than 4 percent.
Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that it had declines in most of its major business units for the third quarter. Still, its shares rose about 2 percent.
Analysts said that the numbers were better than expected, and that the amount of Bank of America's write-down had already been built into its share price.
''We knew they were not going to do as well as last year,'' said David Kelly, the chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds.
Mr. Kelly said the midterm Congressional elections and the outlook for tax policy had caused a lot of uncertainty in the market.
On Tuesday the government also released statistics showing that housing starts inched up 0.3 percent last month, with single-family permits rising just 0.5 percent.
''Housing starts stabilized at depressed levels two years ago, and have made little headway since,'' said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
''Over the past 24 months, builders have put up an average of 595,000 units a month,'' he said in a research note, referring to an annualized rate. ''Under normal conditions, they would put up at least 1.5 million units a month to meet demand from a growing population, and to replace old and damaged homes.''

HEADLINE: Ross Gives Giants Plenty in Return

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO
Cody Ross made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers in 2003, when they lost 119 games. The next spring, the Tigers traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a pitcher named Steve Colyer. Two years later, Ross moved on to the Cincinnati Reds for a pitcher named Ben Kozlowski. A month later, he was sold to the Florida Marlins.
Colyer, Kozlowski and cash. That is not much of a package for the player who, years later, would become the breakout star of the National League playoffs. But at least his first three teams got something in return. The Marlins let Ross go for nothing. 
Ross was at it again in Game 3 of the N.L. Championship Series on Tuesday, smoking a two-out, fourth-inning single to left for the first run of the San Francisco Giants' 3-0 victory over Cole Hamels and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Giants lead the series, two games to one, with Ross batting .348. The rest of the team is hitting .186.
''I've played against Cody for so long, and I've seen it,'' the Giants' Freddy Sanchez said. ''He has the power, he can hit, he plays great defense. He's just a great overall player. I'm glad he's coming up big in this postseason. Who knows where we'd be without him?''
They would not be two victories from the World Series, it seems certain. But if Ross was really that great, why did the Marlins simply give him away when the Giants plucked him off waivers in August? For Ross, the economics of the move -- Florida saved the remainder of his $4.45 million salary -- did not make it sting any less.
''When I found out the way it went down, I was pretty upset, actually,'' Ross said on Tuesday from a podium in yet another interview room. ''My emotions were so high at that point. I started off feeling really sad that I was leaving my buddies there, then realizing where I was coming and the opportunity that I was going to have to get a chance to get to the postseason. And then hearing that they gave me away for nothing -- it didn't settle with me very well. But let bygones be bygones. I'm in a way better place.''
Aaron Rowand, who doubled and scored the Giants' last run, said the secret to Ross's success was obvious: ''The beard and the bald head.'' Ross, though, said he has opened his stance a bit and exaggerated the way he plants his front foot.
But he may just be a hot hitter, in a zone or a trance or some kind of magic October vortex. Ross homered and drove in the winning run in the division series clincher in Atlanta. In each game of this series, he has slain a different ace: two home runs off Roy Halladay in Game 1, another off Roy Oswalt in Game 2, and the critical hit off Hamels in Game 3.
''He's been battling and hitting pitches that most normal people can't hit at this time,'' Hamels said. ''If he can hit that through the regular season, we'll be very impressed, but that's what happens when guys are hot: they can hit anything.''
Hamels was behind in the count to Ross, 2-1, when catcher Carlos Ruiz called for a fastball low and away. Hamels said he hit his target, at 94 miles per hour, low enough that he expected Ross to take it. And if Ross swung, Hamels said, there was no way he could lift it into left.
But he did, of course. That is how things are going for Ross, who said he could not remember ever swinging so well. And though the question is perhaps the most cliched of all, somebody had to ask Ross: just how does this feel?
''To be honest with you, there's no feeling,'' he said. ''When you go out there, you don't really have any sort of feeling. You go up there and try to do your job. And he's right, it was probably a pitch that I probably shouldn't have swung at. It was down and away and somehow hooked it down the line. But that's what happens when you're swinging the bat well or feeling good.''
The Phillies must have never thought that their season could hinge on containing a career .265 hitter. But right now, it seems that way. How do they devise a game plan for a hitter who cannot be stopped?
''Hit him,'' Hamels said, to laughter. ''I'm just kidding.''
The Phillies have tried intimidation before. Oswalt brushed back Ross in Game 2, not quite with the ferocity of Dickie Noles to George Brett in the 1980 World Series, but some kind of statement, anyway. Ross said he simply dug in harder, conscious of the pitch low and away, and he homered the next time up.
A long flight, a different coast and a different pitcher brought the same kind of result on Tuesday. The Phillies cannot solve the man nobody used to want.
''It's been an unbelievable ride,'' Ross said, ''and hopefully, it will keep going.''

HEADLINE: Renewal, Slow-Cooked

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
DETROIT
HOW much good can a restaurant do?
In this city, a much-heralded emblem of industrial-age decline, and home to a cripplingly bad economy, a troubled school system, racial segregation and sometimes unheeded crime, there is one place where most everyone -- black, white, poor, rich, urban, not -- will invariably recommend you eat: Slows Bar B Q.
Slows opened in 2005 at the edge of downtown Detroit, in Corktown, across from the long-abandoned central train station, itself a symbol of widespread blight. Hidden behind a stylish wooden door with no discernible handle, it has become a beacon, drawing longtime Detroiters, newly arrived young people and scores of suburbanites, who wait for hours to sample the pulled pork and dry-smoked ribs and coo over the upcycled design. The restaurant and its sleek decor were dreamed up by one of Slows' owners, Phillip Cooley, who has emerged as a de facto spokesman for the now-hip revitalization of this city.
''Before Slows was built, generally speaking people came into the city for hockey games, ball games and to see the 'Sesame Street Spectacular,' '' said Toby Barlow, Detroit's other de facto spokesperson. Mr. Cooley, he said, has ''validated the idea that people will come into the city.'' 
Anywhere but Detroit, the notion that people will show up and pay money for barbecue and beer would not be seen as revolutionary. But destination restaurants are still rare enough inside the city limits that Slows was a notable success. Few have taken it as an exact blueprint -- the mix of things that make it work are hard to copy -- but it has helped change the reputation of a city where a night on the town used to offer mostly the wrong kind of thrills.
To make sure the positive change takes hold, Mr. Cooley has parlayed the good will of his barbecue joint into a restless pursuit of community-building. He advises other business owners on everything from liquor licenses to using salvaged lumber. Most people in Detroit who are involved in food -- or art, or music, or night life, or civic service -- have brushed up against him at some point, a function both of how involved he is and how interconnected the city is.
Also: ''You're not going to talk about how cute he is, are you?'' Mr. Barlow said, teasing.
Well, not exactly, but it's not lost on anyone that Mr. Cooley, 32, used to be a fashion model, walking European runways for the likes of Louis Vuitton before returning home to Michigan at 24.
''He's a pretty idiosyncratic character,'' said Mr. Barlow, an author and ad agency executive. ''He's like a living Venn diagram, he's got a lot of circles that are colliding around him.'' (Mr. Barlow among them: he is working with Mr. Cooley on a new restaurant in a former pawn shop.)
Mayor Dave Bing appointed him to be a chair of his Detroit Works Project, a major initiative to map the future of the city. It is one of a half-dozen boards that Mr. Cooley serves on, including the Greening of Detroit and the A.C.L.U. of Southeastern Michigan. The scale of his activity as a restaurateur-turned-do-gooder would be rare anywhere, but it particularly stands out here.
''Phil doesn't give lip service to getting involved in challenges,'' Mayor Bing said through a spokesperson. ''He is out there getting his hands dirty and working to make changes.''
Mr. Cooley, the son of a prominent real estate developer and city council member in Marysville, Mich., a lakefront town of about 10,000 an hour from Detroit, has an exalted indie lifestyle and mainstream clout. He goes to several events a night. ''I'm needed here,'' he said. ''It's rewarding, the day-to-day work that I do. I wake up and I feel like I'm making a difference.''
In Detroit, he added, ''I could get involved and not be judged by my age.'' He was driving from Slows to the site of Slows to Go, a catering and take-out outpost that he and his partners -- who include his father, Ron, and brother, Ryan -- are opening in the coming weeks. ''This is an incredibly fruitful place to do business, because we're so starving for anything,'' he said.
Rent is cheap here, but spaces in good condition are hard to find. So are investors, which is why entrepreneurs often double as carpenters. With his parents as co-signers on the leases for two buildings totaling $159,000, and the chef and sous-chef as sweat-equity partners, Mr. Cooley opened Slows using an advance on his inheritance, helping to refurbish the space himself.
''We were going to do fine dining,'' he said, ''and we looked around the neighborhood and said, 'What the hell are we thinking?' '' Barbecue was an affordable, populist option.
''Slows was almost a zeitgeist thing,'' said Todd Abrams, a restaurant critic for the Metro Times, a local weekly, and the founder of Gourmet Underground Detroit, a dining and drinking club. ''They came into that neighborhood at a time when it really needed it. I'm there probably once every other week, if not more.''
In its first year, Slows did $1.8 million in sales, triple what the owners expected, Mr. Cooley said. And now they are eager to spread their wealth.
When Dave Mancini was opening Supino Pizzeria, one of the city's two artisanal pie places, two years ago, Mr. Cooley was building a coffee shop, Mercury Bar. ''He would bring his whole crew here for lunch once a week,'' Mr. Mancini said. ''That's a nice chunk of change when you're opening up. And the people that Phil knows are the insider-hipster crowd, so they spread the word -- social networking.'' Slows sometimes sends its overflow crowds to the pizzeria, too.
Places like Supino, by Eastern Market, the city's bustling food hall, are stops on the welcome-to-Detroit, it's-more-than-just-grit tour that Mr. Cooley has given to Matthew Barney, Johnny Knoxville, the musician Sufjan Stevens and countless other V.I.P. guests. His standard greeting for out-of-towners: ''Are you staying with me?''
The airy, modern loft apartment above Slows, where he lives with his girlfriend, is ''kind of a flophouse,'' he said in an interview there. Case in point: an urban-revitalization entrepreneur from Chattanooga sat typing at his laptop at the dining room table, preparing for a conference; he wound up serving beer at a Slows party. ''We're working on getting him to move here,'' Mr. Cooley whispered.
''This is always how he's been -- he just has an aura about him that attracts people,'' said Kevin Griffin, a friend from DePaul University in Chicago, where Mr. Cooley briefly attended business school.
Not all of Mr. Cooley's projects are successful. Mercury Bar, a high-style neon-accented place that he opened with eight partners across the street from Slows in 2008, closed less than half a year later. Mr. Cooley blamed high prices and mismanagement by some of his partners. Others chalked it up to a misunderstanding of the marketplace; it was simply too slick for Detroit. But Mr. Cooley did not give up on espresso: he leased another space he owns to Mercury's head barista to build another coffee bar, the kind of risk that traditional landlords might not take.
''Lenders are very reluctant to lend anybody money for anything in downtown Detroit because it's still viewed as a gamble,'' said Dave Kwiatkowski, an owner of Detroit Bros. Custom Cycles, a motorcycle shop in suburban Ferndale. Mr. Kwiatkowski is set to open the Sugar House, a classic cocktail bar, in the building next to Slows. He and his wife plan to move into an apartment upstairs, a la Mr. Cooley. The rest of the block is also a Cooley corridor: Ryan Cooley's real estate agency is next door to Slows, and the family and their partners own two more buildings, which they plan to turn into lofts, art spaces, a pop-up shop or business incubator and, eventually, another restaurant.
As Slows grew, the food scene in Detroit expanded around it. Gourmet Underground, started in the spring, quickly grew to over 100 members; they get together regularly for events like Bloody Mary-and-bacon tastings. An artisanal butcher has cropped up, and D.I.Y. projects like the Detroit Zymology Guild, a weekly canning session held in the back of an art gallery, thrive alongside food trucks and backyard organic farmers. An Iron Chef, Michael Symon, even has a presence, at Roast, a restaurant popular with locals and tourists in a luxury hotel downtown. And, in the surest sign of success, several new barbecue restaurants have recently opened in the city.
Though he is occasionally called the Prince of Detroit, Mr. Cooley still describes things as ''fancy pants,'' dresses in torn T-shirts, and is quick to rail against chain stores, mass development and other symbols of late-stage gentrification. He plays in a summer soccer league and organizes an underground restaurant, ClandesDine, a secretive, invite-only affair where meals are served in abandoned buildings.
His boosterism was evident on a recent Sunday, when Slows celebrated its fifth anniversary in Roosevelt Park, in front of the train station. More than 2,000 people showed up on a chilly, rainy day for microbrews, $5 plates of Niman Ranch pork sliders and mac and cheese. On the lawn, 128 teams competed at cornhole, a Midwestern beanbag-toss game. The whole thing was a benefit for the park, another of Mr. Cooley's projects. He hopes to open a skate park there -- a visible notch of coolness.
Dressed in a blue blazer and an ascot, he played on a cornhole team alongside his father and brother, losing in the semifinals. ''You have to dedicate a lot of time to it,'' he said, sitting at the bar at Slows the day after. ''And also not drink.'' Moments later he was deep in conversation with the suburban stranger sitting next to him, and moments after that the guy had volunteered to help build the skate park.

HEADLINE: Tea Party Incumbent Raises Profile, and $9.5 Million

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
STILLWATER, Minn. -- The challengers to Representative Michele Bachmann, the polarizing Republican who founded a Tea Party caucus in Congress, sat on the stage of a half-filled junior high school auditorium on a recent evening, hurling critiques, one after the next, against Ms. Bachmann and her views on energy policy, Social Security, veterans' health care, and on and on.
The blows were unvarnished, especially by Minnesota standards, but they still fell a bit flat. The reason? Ms. Bachman was absent, her campaign citing scheduling conflicts for not attending the candidate forum in this town. That very day, Ms. Bachmann had made other stops, but in somewhat larger spheres -- on the ''Today'' show and Glenn Beck's program -- a circumstance that Tarryl Clark, her opponent from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (Minnesota's version of the Democratic Party), was more than happy to relay to the crowd. 
''It's hard for me to believe that she can't come just a few miles from her house even though she was on TV this morning and, I understand, just not too long ago,'' Ms. Clark said.
Ms. Bachmann won election to Congress in 2006, but her national profile has expanded enormously over the past two years with her biting condemnations of Democrats -- and tax increases, big government, the health care law and big spending -- and with her frequent, telegenic and sound-bite-packed visits to the universe of cable news. And so, in a district that sits like a hat atop the Twin Cities, Ms. Bachmann is adored by some and despised by others, but she rarely draws a tepid response.
The result has been one of the most feverish and expensive races anywhere. Last week, Ms. Bachmann reported raising about $9.5 million on the race by the end of September, $5.4 million of that just in the last few months (a figure that experts here said was more than any other House candidate from Minnesota had ever raised in an entire campaign). Ms. Clark, a state lawmaker, has also collected a lot -- nearly $4 million, one more sign of how this Sixth District race has come to carry symbolic value larger than just control of one more House seat.
The television commercials, voters here say, have been endless: on one side, photographs of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ominous music, and descriptions of Ms. Clark as ''Taxin' Tarryl'' and an ally of the Democratic leaders in Washington; on the other, images of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and a narrator calling Ms. Bachmann a supporter of special interests, Wall Street and BP.
Ms. Clark faces difficult odds. Democrats note that Ms. Bachmann's previous wins have been closer than some might presume: in 2008, she won with 46 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent for the Democrat. (Bob Anderson, an Independence Party candidate who is running again this year, got about 10 percent.) But this is a Republican-leaning district in a moment when Democrats nationally are struggling, and Ms. Bachmann has become a national figure.
She first drew broader note in 2008, when she expressed concern in a television interview that Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, ''may have anti-American views.''
Since then, Ms. Bachmann has become something of a lightning rod -- even drawing speculation here among Republicans that Democrats hope to redraw the state's Congressional boundaries to erase Ms. Bachmann's seat. (Democratic leaders deny that.)
Her supporters adore her outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion and what she sees as government spending gone mad, while her critics contend her comments are bizarre. They note her public comments, at various points, that some census forms are inappropriately intrusive, that she viewed her role in Washington as a ''foreign correspondent on enemy lines,'' and that she wondered whether what had transpired during the current administration might be likened to ''turning our country into a nation of slaves.''
For all the issues Ms. Clark says she disagrees with Ms. Bachmann over, she says one requirement trumps everything -- showing up. Ms. Clark said she talked to constituents who regularly said that Ms. Bachmann was not focused on this district anymore -- but on a national identity or perhaps some higher office. ''It's important not to confuse celebrity with people really seeing you as being somebody who's out there fighting for you,'' Ms. Clark said. ''She says good words but it's all about creating headlines.''
Ms. Bachmann dismissed all such suggestions. After wandering through a restaurant in Woodbury, greeting diners and inquiring about their lunches, Ms. Bachmann, who wore a Minnesota Vikings jersey, said her thoughts were firmly focused on her job in Congress.
She has agreed, she noted, to three debate-style meetings with her opponents, all set for the final week of the campaign. Meanwhile, she said, she was out nearly every day meeting with people in the district and talking about the things that worry them most -- jobs, the economy, and ''nonsense spending'' in Washington. ''I am not focused on anything other than running and winning this race,'' Ms. Bachmann said.
As for the money she has raised, Ms. Bachmann said she was merely trying to get out her message in an expensive media market. ''I am running for the House of Representatives,'' she said, ''and it's a very hard slog.''
Her campaign said it has been overrun with requests from reporters around the world, receiving 30 to 40 requests every few days from as far away as England, Poland, Japan and India.

HEADLINE: For Attorney General, a Contest Over Who's Best at Fighting Corruption

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Between majoring in English and East Asian studies on Amherst's campus and joining the rarefied ranks of Harvard Law students, Eric T. Schneiderman, a product of private schools on the West Side of Manhattan, made what must have struck his classmates as a curious career choice: he enlisted as a deputy sheriff in Berkshire County in western Massachusetts.
In retrospect, though, the job was the first step on a path that would lead Mr. Schneiderman into public service law, politics, elective office with a specialization in criminal justice and, this year, into a campaign for New York State attorney general to succeed Andrew M. Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer, who became famous as the self-styled ''Sheriff of Wall Street.''
''I want to be the sheriff of Wall Street, of Albany, of Main Street,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. 
A 55-year-old state senator who represents a diverse sliver of Manhattan's West Side, he emerged from a fractious five-way primary last month as the Democratic nominee (he also has the support of the Working Families and Independence Parties). He faces Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, who is running on the Republican and Conservative lines.
During the Democratic primary, Mr. Schneiderman defined himself as the most liberal candidate in the race. But now, with Mr. Donovan warning that Mr. Schneiderman would be a ''radical, left-wing'' attorney general pursuing what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg denounces as a ''social agenda,'' Mr. Schneiderman has cloaked himself in the record and more modulated mantle of Mr. Cuomo, the incumbent attorney general and the Democratic candidate for governor.
''I'm running to build on the record of Andrew Cuomo,'' Mr. Schneiderman said.
Still, he hardly shies away from two issues that distinguish him from his opponent -- a record of support for abortion rights and for same-sex marriage. While Mr. Donovan vows to enforce the law regardless of his personal views (he opposes abortion in most cases and prefers civil unions between same-sex partners over legalized marriage), Mr. Schneiderman repeatedly reminds voters that ''the front line of defense for reproductive rights is the attorney general's office.''
As a six-term state senator, he has sought to transform incumbency into an asset while also distancing himself from the state government's dysfunction.
He reminds voters that he led a committee that urged the expulsion of Senator Hiram Monserrate, a Queens Democrat, after his conviction on misdemeanor assault charges. Mr. Monserrate became the first legislator expelled in nearly 90 years.
''This is not something I'm talking about for the first time,'' he says in a slap at his opponent, whom he accuses of failing to pursue political corruption on Staten Island. ''I've been a reformer when it was lonely in Albany.''
Both candidates have been burnishing their criminal justice bona fides, although the attorney general, as the state's chief legal officer, typically spends much more time defending the state than going after people accused of breaking the law. Like Mr. Schneiderman, two of New York's more respected attorneys general, Louis J. Lefkowitz and Robert Abrams, had never prosecuted a case before they were elected.
''It's a bogus issue,'' said Mr. Abrams, who has endorsed Mr. Schneiderman.
Mr. Schneiderman vows that a top priority will be to restore integrity to government (another will be dealing with the consequences of the recession).
His father is a corporate lawyer; his mother volunteered at the Art Students League. Though he gravitated to the deputy sheriff job as an unemployed college graduate in need of work, Mr. Schneiderman proudly claims to have launched what he called the first comprehensive drug and alcohol treatment program at the county jail.
After law school, Mr. Schneiderman clerked for a federal judge and became a partner in a Manhattan firm, where he also worked as a public interest lawyer (he did well enough in the firm to personally give or lend his current campaign $855,000; his father contributed an additional $242,700). He counseled the West Side Crime Prevention Program, and he represented tenants seeking to evict crack dealers from buildings in Manhattan and Queens, taxpayers against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and health clinics that were picketed by anti-abortion activists.
''I pretty quickly realized my heart was in public interest and public policy work, and I was less interested in my regular clients,'' he said.
In 1998, as a Democratic district leader, he won the nomination for the seat being vacated by Franz S. Leichter, a veteran state senator.
''I don't think there's anyone who has a demonstrated record of independence and standing up to the bosses in Albany that can compare to me, and I have the scars to prove it,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''After just one term they redrew my district in an effort to get rid of me.''
As a senator and later chairman of the criminal justice committee, he was instrumental in passing tougher ethics laws, a women's health clinic access bill, hate-crimes legislation and revisions in the Rockefeller-era drug laws that gave judges more discretion to send nonviolent addicts to treatment.
Mr. Schneiderman's drive has invited comparisons to United State Senator Charles E. Schumer. ''As far as the work ethic and intensity of my commitment to my job, I think it's a high compliment,'' Mr. Schneiderman said.
Still, his intensity strikes some people as cavalier. ''He tends to talk down to people,'' said Assemblyman Daniel J. O'Donnell, whom Mr. Schneiderman defeated in the 1998 Senate primary. ''I'm happy he went to Harvard Law. I went to CUNY Law, but that doesn't mean I'm not smart.''
Still, Mr. O'Donnell added, ''that would be more of a weakness in my job, which is retail, than in the job of attorney general. It's a very deliberative, thoughtful job rather than a reactive kind of job. This job is about the most perfect fit for him.''
Mr. Schneiderman, who is divorced from Jennifer Cunningham, a political consultant and friend of Mr. Cuomo's, has a 17-year-old daughter.
A fellow state senator, Liz Krueger, also a Manhattan Democrat, credits Mr. Schneiderman with understanding ''the nuance of the law and how you can use it for good against evil. He believes in government. Anybody who has watched him on the Senate floor, with his ability to debate the flaws of a bad bill from a legal and policy perspective with humor and intelligence -- it's almost like watching a really good ice skater perform.''

HEADLINE: In a Digital Age, Students Still Cling To Paper Textbooks

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
CLINTON, N.Y. -- They text their friends all day long. At night, they do research for their term papers on laptops and commune with their parents on Skype. But as they walk the paths of Hamilton College, a poster-perfect liberal arts school in this upstate village, students are still hauling around bulky, old-fashioned textbooks -- and loving it.
''The screen won't go blank,'' said Faton Begolli, a sophomore from Boston. ''There can't be a virus. It wouldn't be the same without books. They've defined 'academia' for a thousand years.''
Though the world of print is receding before a tide of digital books, blogs and other Web sites, a generation of college students weaned on technology appears to be holding fast to traditional textbooks. That loyalty comes at a price. Textbooks are expensive -- a year's worth can cost $700 to $900 -- and students' frustrations with the expense, as well as the emergence of new technology, have produced a confounding array of options for obtaining them. 
Internet retailers like Amazon and Textbooks.com are selling new and used books. They have been joined by several Web services that rent textbooks to students by the semester. Some 1,500 college bookstores are also offering rentals this fall, up from 300 last year. Here at Hamilton, students this year have a new way to avoid the middleman: a nonprofit Web site, created by the college's Entrepreneur Club, that lets them sell used books directly to one another.
The explosion of outlets and formats -- including digital books, which are rapidly becoming more sophisticated -- has left some students bewildered. After completing the heavy lifting of course selection, they are forced to weigh cost versus convenience, analyze their own study habits and guess which texts they will want for years to come and which they will not miss.
''It depends on the course,'' said Victoria Adesoba, a pre-med student at New York University who was standing outside that school's bookstore, a powder-blue book bag slung over her shoulder. ''Last semester, I rented for psychology, and it was cheaper. But for something like organic chemistry, I need to keep the book. E-textbooks are good, but it's tempting to go on Facebook, and it can strain your eyes.''
For all the talk that her generation is the most technologically adept in history, paper-and-ink textbooks do not seem destined for oblivion anytime soon.
According to the National Association of College Stores, digital books make up just under 3 percent of textbook sales, although the association expects that share to grow to 10 percent to 15 percent by 2012 as more titles are made available as e-books.
In two recent studies -- one by the association and another by the Student Public Interest Research Groups, a national advocacy network -- three-quarters of the students surveyed said they still preferred a bound book to a digital version.
Many students are reluctant to give up the ability to flip quickly between chapters, write in the margins and highlight passages, although new software applications are beginning to allow students to use e-textbooks that way.
''Students grew up learning from print books,'' said Nicole Allen, the textbooks campaign director for the research groups, ''so as they transition to higher education, it's not surprising that they carry a preference for a format that they are most accustomed to.''
Indeed, many Hamilton students waxed passionate about the weighty tomes they still lug from dorm room to lecture hall to library, even as they compulsively check their smartphones for text messages and e-mails.
''I believe that the codex is one of mankind's best inventions,'' said Jonathan Piskor, a sophomore from North Carolina, using the Latin term for book.
That passion may be one reason that Barnes & Noble College Booksellers is working so hard to market its new software application, NOOKstudy, which allows students to navigate e-textbooks on Macs and PCs. The company, which operates 636 campus bookstores nationwide, including Hamilton's, introduced the free application last summer in hopes of luring more students to buy its electronic textbooks.
''The real hurdle is getting them to try it,'' said Tracey Weber, the company's executive vice president for textbooks and digital education.
The company is giving away ''College Kick-Start Kits'' to students who download NOOKstudy in the fall semester, with ramen noodle recipes and a dozen classic e-books like ''The Canterbury Tales'' and ''The Scarlet Letter.'' CourseSmart, a consortium of major textbook publishers, is letting students try any e-textbook free for two weeks.
But not every textbook is available in digital or rental format. At Hamilton, for instance, only about one-fifth of the titles are sold as e-textbooks this fall. A stroll through the campus store revealed the price difference. A book on constitutional law, for instance, was $189.85 new, $142.40 used and $85.45 for rent. (Typically, an e-textbook is cheaper than a used book, though more expensive than a rental.)
The expense of college textbooks, which is estimated to have risen four times the inflation rate in recent years, has become such a concern that some politicians are taking up the cause. Last month, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York urged more college stores to rent books, after a survey of 38 campus bookstores in New York City and on Long Island by his office found that 16 did not offer the option.
On Thursday, students at more than 40 colleges nationwide are planning an Affordable Textbooks Day of Action, organized by the Student Public Interest Research Groups, to encourage faculty members to assign texts that are less expensive, or offered free online.
For now, buying books the old-fashioned way -- new or used -- prevails. Charles Schmidt, the spokesman for the National Association of College Stores, said that if a campus store sold a new book for $100, it would typically buy the book back for $50 at semester's end and sell it to the next student for $75.
The buy-back price plummets, however, if the professor drops the book (or edition) from the syllabus or if the bookstore has bought enough books to meet demand. When Louis Boguchwal, a junior at Hamilton who is majoring in economics and math, tried to sell a $100 linear algebra textbook back to the college bookstore, he was offered $15.
''It was insulting,'' he said. ''They give you next to nothing.''
Thus, the creation of Hamilton's new nonprofit Web site, getmytextbooks.org. So far, traffic has been light: only about 70 books have been sold this fall. But Jason Mariasis, president of the Entrepreneur Club, said he expected sales to pick up as word spread. The site also lists hundreds of other colleges.
Mr. Begolli, a member of the club, recently sold three German novels for $17 on the site. ''If I had sold them back to the bookstore, I would have gotten $7 or $8,'' he said. ''The bookstore is king when it comes to textbook sales. We felt there should be something for students, by students.''
Yet some students have to go it alone. Rosemary Rocha, 26, an N.Y.U. student pursuing a degree in hospitality and tourism management, tallied up her required reading for the semester: $600. ''It's harsh,'' she said. ''I'm currently collecting unemployment, so that's not going to happen.''
Instead, she waits to borrow the few copies her professors leave on reserve at the library, or relies on the kindness of classmates. ''My friends will let me borrow their books in exchange for coffee or a slice of pizza,'' she said. ''I very seldom buy the textbooks, but I'm always like a chicken without a head.''

HEADLINE: Secretive Republican Donors Are Planning Ahead

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
A secretive network of Republican donors is heading to the Palm Springs area for a long weekend in January, but it will not be to relax after a hard-fought election -- it will be to plan for the next one.
Koch Industries, the longtime underwriter of libertarian causes from the Cato Institute in Washington to the ballot initiative that would suspend California's landmark law capping greenhouse gases, is planning a confidential meeting at the Rancho Las Palmas Resort and Spa to, as an invitation says, ''develop strategies to counter the most severe threats facing our free society and outline a vision of how we can foster a renewal of American free enterprise and prosperity.''
The invitation, sent to potential new participants, offers a rare peek at the Koch network of the ultrawealthy and the politically well-connected, its far-reaching agenda to enlist ordinary Americans to its cause, and its desire for the utmost secrecy.
Koch Industries, a Wichita-based energy and manufacturing conglomerate run by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, operates a foundation that finances political advocacy groups, but tax law protects those groups from having to disclose much about what they do and who contributes. 
With a personalized letter signed by Charles Koch, the invitation to the four-day Rancho Mirage meeting opens with a grand call to action: ''If not us, who? If not now, when?''
The Koch network meets twice a year to plan and expand its efforts -- as the letter says, ''to review strategies for combating the multitude of public policies that threaten to destroy America as we know it.''
Those efforts, the letter makes clear, include countering ''climate change alarmism and the move to socialized health care,'' as well as ''the regulatory assault on energy,'' and making donations to higher education and philanthropic organizations to advance the Koch agenda.
The Kochs also seek to cultivate Americans' growing concern about the growth of government: at the most recent meeting, in Aspen, Colo., in June, some of the wealthiest people in America listened to a presentation on ''a vision of how we can retain the moral high ground and make the new case for liberty and smaller government that appeals to all Americans, rich and poor.''
The goals for the twice-yearly meetings, the brochure says, include attracting more investors to the cause, but also building institutions ''to identify, educate and mobilize citizens'' and ''fashioning the message and building the education channels to re-establish widespread belief in the benefits of a free and prosperous society.''
Charles Koch, whose wealth Forbes magazine calculates at about $21.5 billion, argues in his letter that ''prosperity is under attack by the current administration and many of our elected officials.'' He repeatedly warns about the ''internal assault'' and ''unrelenting attacks'' on freedom and prosperity. A brochure with the invitation underscores that to the Koch network, ''freedom'' means freedom from taxes and government regulation. Mr. Koch warns of policies that ''threaten to erode our economic freedom and transfer vast sums of money to the state.''
The Kochs insist on strict confidentiality surrounding the California meetings, which are entitled ''Understanding and Addressing Threats to American Free Enterprise and Prosperity.'' The letter advises participants that it is closed to the public, including the news media, and admonishes them not to post updates or information about the meeting on the Web, blogs, social media or traditional media, and to ''be mindful of the security and confidentiality of your meeting notes and materials.''
Invited participants are told they must wear nametags for all meeting functions. And, ensuring that no one tries to gain access by posing as a participant, the invitation says that reservations will be handled through Koch Industries' office in Washington: ''Please do not contact the Rancho Las Palmas directly to place a reservation.''
To give prospective participants a sense of what to expect, Mr. Koch's letter enclosed a brochure from the group's meeting at the St. Regis Resort in Aspen, including a list of the roughly 200 participants -- a confab of hedge fund executives, Republican donors, free-market evangelists and prominent members of the New York social circuit.
They listened to a presentations on ''microtargeting'' to identify like-minded voters, as well as a discussion about voter mobilization featuring Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity, the political action group founded by the Kochs in 2004, which campaigned against the health care legislation passed in March and is helping Tea Party groups set up get-out-the-vote operations.
Other sessions discussed the opportunities in the presidential election of 2012 to address threats to free enterprise and ''how supporters of economic freedom might start planning today.''
Impressed by the Koch efforts for the midterms, the invitation cover letter says, Aspen participants ''committed to an unprecedented level of support.''
''However,'' it adds, ''even if these efforts succeed, other serious threats demand action.''
The participants in Aspen dined under the stars at the top of the gondola run on Aspen Mountain, and listened to Glenn Beck of Fox News in a session titled, ''Is America on the Road to Serfdom?'' (The title refers to a classic of Austrian economic thought that informs libertarian ideology, popularized by Mr. Beck on his show.)The participants included some of the nation's wealthiest families and biggest names in finance: private equity and hedge fund executives like John Childs, Cliff Asness, Steve Schwarzman and Ken Griffin; Phil Anschutz, the entertainment and media mogul ranked by Forbes as the 34th-richest person in the country; Rich DeVos, the co-founder of Amway; Steve Bechtel of the giant construction firm; and Kenneth Langone of Home Depot.
The group also included longtime Republican donors and officials, including Foster Friess, Fred Malek and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
Participants listened to presentations from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as people who played leading roles in John McCain's presidential campaign in 2008, like Nancy Pfotenhauer and Annie Dickerson, who also runs a foundation for Paul Singer, a hedge fund executive who like the Kochs is active in promoting libertarian causes.
To encourage new participants, Mr. Koch offers to waive the $1,500 registration fee. And he notes that previous guests have included Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court, Gov. Haley Barbour and Gov. Bobby Jindal, Senators Jim DeMint and Tom Coburn, and Representatives Mike Pence, Tom Price and Paul D. Ryan.
Mr. Koch also notes the beautiful setting. But he advises against thinking of this as a vacation.
''Our ultimate goal is not 'fun in the sun,' '' he concludes. ''This is a gathering of doers who are willing to engage in the hard work necessary to advance our shared principles. Success in this endeavor will require all the help we can muster.''

HEADLINE: In Five Different Lives, Many Ties That Bind

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
It's a small world, and for the disparate and troubled characters in ''Interchange,'' Ken Jaworowski's engrossing new play at the WorkShop Theater Company, their universe will be reduced to one degree of separation before the evening is done. 
In a series of 19 taut and well-constructed scenes, Mr. Jaworowski plots the course of five seemingly unrelated lives that are gradually revealed to be closely interconnected and that will be irrevocably altered through circumstance and coincidence.
In the poignant opening, a son tells his irascible father while on a fishing trip that his cancer is no longer in remission. The son, a single father of a 7-year-old, pleads with his dad to raise his grandson in kindness rather than anger. Other vignettes introduce a milquetoast economics professor who secretly pines for an English professor colleague; a former Wall Street trader just out of prison and desperate for a job; a middle-management executive under the thumb of her harridan of a boss; and a disturbed young man in a court-ordered counseling program bent on a private vendetta.
As their stories unfold, each will face disillusion and disappointment as the thread that will ultimately bind them together becomes discernible. By the end, there will be heartache for some and hope for others. Along the way, each will learn that a little compassion can have resounding repercussions.
In an earlier play, ''Never Missed a Day,'' Mr. Jaworowski, a staff editor at The New York Times, created interesting characters. But in ''Interchange'' he provides the dramatic conflict that brings his characters to life.
Under Thomas Cote's brisk direction, swift scene changes -- no small feat for a play with so many -- allow the momentum to build as the audience puts the pieces of the plot's puzzle together.
A solid cast of 10 gives credible performances, some more than others. Jeff Paul is excellent as the lovesick economics professor and gives the play its occasional shots of humor. Cecily Benjamin is especially good as the corporate climber faced with a dilemma; Sean Singer is convincing as the angry young man seeking vengeance; and Shaun Bennet Wilson contributes fine turns in three supporting roles.
''Interchange'' continues through Oct. 30 at the WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, Manhattan; (866) 811-4111, workshoptheater.org.

HEADLINE: Scolding City, Judge Bans New Hiring By Fire Dept.

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
In blunt, scolding language, a federal judge on Tuesday criticized the city's conduct during legal negotiations aimed at diversifying the Fire Department, accusing the Bloomberg administration of shirking its responsibility for redressing discrimination and of exaggerating claims about threats to public safety during the dispute. 
The judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, also raised the possibility of imposing sanctions on New York City. In a 20-page decision, the judge, who had previously found that the city administered tests that discriminated against black and Hispanic firefighter candidates, ordered the city not to hire new firefighters.
That permanent ban replaced a temporary injunction that was set to expire at the end of the month. It would be lifted, the judge wrote, if the city agreed to a hiring method proposed by the court.
The move essentially prevents the Fire Department, which last hired members in June 2008, from replenishing its ranks. The city has said it needed to hire about 300 firefighters for public safety reasons and to prevent exorbitant overtime costs. But the judge said the city had abandoned those reasons, and was in fact considering eliminating firefighter jobs.
''The city's shifting and contradictory positions have needlessly diverted the parties from the critical work of developing a new examination,'' he wrote. ''While the court is dismayed by the city's apparent duplicity and lack of good faith, it is not entirely surprised.''
Georgia Pestana, a city lawyer, said in a statement that it was ''inaccurate to accuse the city of altering its position on the need for hiring. Testimony established that had the court permitted hiring, the significant economic cost to the taxpayers for overtime could have been reduced.''
The latest arguments underscored the tortured process of overhauling the Fire Department, which for decades has been overwhelmingly white.
The current debate stems from a lawsuit against the city brought by the Justice Department in 2007, acting on behalf of the Vulcan Society, a group of black firefighters. In 2009, Judge Garaufis ruled that two entrance exams were discriminatory and ordered the city to give 300 minority applicants priority hiring status and retroactive seniority, and to financially compensate thousands more who had taken the test.
City lawyers objected to the judge's appointment of Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney, as a special master to oversee the discrimination lawsuit. Mr. Morgenthau withdrew, and Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, was appointed instead.
In September, the city rejected five hiring methods proposed by the judge. Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, said the proposals involved quotas that were ''both illegal and unwise public policy.''
Judge Garaufis chided Mr. Cardozo for rarely signing submissions to the court and ordered him to ''personally sign all further submissions by the city in this matter,'' or they would be ''struck.''

HEADLINE: Science and Cooking: The Kitchen as Lab

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
IN a basement laboratory at Harvard, Ashley Prince read from the instructions as her lab partner, Allan Jean-Baptiste, poured fruit nectar into a pot.
''Heat it to 113,'' Ms. Prince said.
Then Mr. Jean-Baptiste added a mix of sugar and pectin, and Ms. Prince whisked.
''So far, so good,'' Ms. Prince said.
These Harvard students were making chewy fruit gelees for From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science, an undergraduate course that uses the kitchen to convey the basics of physics and chemistry, a most unusual Ivy League approach to science. 
Each Thursday, David A. Weitz, a physics professor, or Michael P. Brenner, a professor of applied mathematics, covers the science concepts. On the following Tuesday, one of a select group of top chefs, some well versed in kitchen technology -- like Wylie Dufresne, of WD-50 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, or Grant Achatz, of Alinea in Chicago -- talks about cooking techniques that illustrate the science.
Besides the laboratory work -- the week before the fruit gelees, the students made ceviche; the week after, molten chocolate cake and ice cream -- the students also work on projects tackling some sort of culinary science conundrum.
The guest chefs have suggested ideas and problems that they hope the students can solve.
Mr. Dufresne and the other chefs at WD-50 have concocted Parmesan noodles for the fall menu, but the texture deteriorates too quickly.
''They're e-mailing and calling, 'Is there any team you have yet that can run this project?' '' said Amy Rowat, a postdoctoral researcher who is also involved in putting together the course.
Mr. Achatz wants help with some dessert geometry. At Alinea, some desserts are served by pouring them onto a latex sheet draped on the table. Cream will pool into the expected circular puddle. But chocolate flows, to spectacular effect, into a square puddle, and Mr. Achatz would like to know why.
The projects will culminate in a science fair in December, at which the students will be judged on their science (by the instructors) and the culinary presentation (by chefs including David Chang, of the Momofuku restaurants).
For Mr. Jean-Baptiste, a junior majoring in economics, it's been an introduction to two worlds. ''I think I will start to cook,'' he said. ''I actually think I will take more science classes.''
His gelee experiment was part of a lesson on elasticity (how easily a solid, like gelatin, can be squeezed or pulled) and viscosity (whether a liquid flows fast or slow).
Dr. Weitz also used a steak to demonstrate elasticity, measuring its thickness, applying some weight to it and seeing how much it was squeezed.
''A steak is a spring,'' he said enthusiastically. ''We're going to understand the difference between a raw, rare and well-done steak. Tofu has exactly the same behavior. It's all the same.''
Cooks increase the viscosity of gravies and sauces by using flour and cornstarch as thickeners. In recent years, some chefs have manipulated the textures of their dishes by tapping ingredients from the processed-food industry like xanthan gum and guar gum.
To show how that worked, Dr. Weitz had a brainstorm in the morning, saying in an e-mail to Dr. Rowat, ''Please bring spaghetti.''
Pouring cooked spaghetti out of the pot, Dr. Weitz explained to the students that the strands entangle and rub against one another and that the friction slows their movement, increasing the viscosity. In the same way, the proteins in flour, cornstarch and xanthan gum also increase viscosity and thicken the liquid.
If the spaghetti strands -- or these proteins -- stick together, the liquid turns into a gel.
In the laboratory, as their fruit gelees were cooling and solidifying in a freezer, the students measured the viscosity of water mixed with varying amounts of guar gum and the elasticity of blocks of gelatin.
The experimental apparatus was an improvised mash-up of science and cooking tools. To measure the viscosity, the liquids were poured into measuring columns -- standard equipment for a chemistry lab. The funnels were upside-down mustard squeeze bottles with the bottoms cut off.
This particular week, Carles Tejedor, the chef at Via Veneto in Barcelona, had flown in to give the Tuesday lecture. He stopped by the laboratory to see what the students were doing and then started experimenting himself.
In his kitchen, Mr. Tejedor has been developing olive oil jellies. A tiny bit of xanthan gum can thicken water but does nothing when added to olive oil. But if he first made a mixture of water and xanthan gum and then blended in olive oil, the result would be olive oil jelly.
In the Harvard lab, he did something similar but with guar gum, a thickener he had not used before.
''And it's really good,'' Mr. Tejedor said. ''It's like creme brulee.''
(The guar gum was actually a second choice of the instructors. Originally, the lab was to use xanthan gum solutions, but ''at high concentrations, it has strange properties we couldn't explain,'' Dr. Rowat said.)
Explaining how all this works -- why, say, honey is viscous and sugar water is not -- has turned out to be a tough task, even for the professional scientists.
''What we realized is we also don't completely understand it,'' Dr. Weitz said. ''We learn a lot in trying to explain it.''
The science-of-cooking class grew out of a visit to Harvard a couple of years ago by Ferran Adria, the wizard chef of El Bulli in Spain. At the time, Harvard was looking to revamp and revitalize the core undergraduate curriculum, and the idea of such a class popped up. Mr. Adria liked the idea, and his foundation collaborated on the course material, which covers the phases of matter, thermodynamics and the various chemical reactions that turn ingredients into food.
The subject material appealed to the students as well, many of whom are history or political-science majors yet to take a science course.
Nearly 700 students wanted to enroll. By lottery, 300 got in. (Dr. Brenner noted to the students that the chance of getting into the class, about 43 percent, was still much better than the chance of getting a reservation at El Bulli.)
A ''Top Chef'' aesthetic has already made its way into the laboratory. Madison Shelton, a senior, cut her finished gelee into various shapes and attempted to stand them up on a rectangular white shape, just as on the television cooking shows. The soft gelees, however, did not stand up straight, but leaned to the side.
''If you have time, you ought to figure out the elasticity of your jellies,'' said Tom Dimiduk, a physics graduate student and one of the teaching assistants for the lab section.
Ms. Shelton took no heed of that suggestion. ''I need to make more shapes -- a star,'' she said, and she cut a star out of the gelee, then a heart, and added them to the plate.

HEADLINE: Shares End Sharply Lower on Wall Street

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply on Wall Street on Tuesday and the dollar rose after a surprise interest rate increase by China's central bank suggested that growth in the world's second largest economy after the United States could slow.
The effects of China's rate increase were also felt across global markets, where European stock markets fell and oil and other commodities declined. 
''The fundamental economic reason is, anytime China tries to tighten the reins on their economy, it will have a ripple-down effect on the rest of the globe,'' said Brad Sorensen, director for market and sector analysis at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 165.07 points, or 1.48 percent, at 10,978.62. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 18.81 points, or 1.59 percent, to 1,165.90, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 43.71 points, or 1.76 percent, to 2,436.95.
Mr. Sorensen said that the increase in China's benchmark rate was a modest 0.25 percentage point, and beyond its likely economic effects, it gave investors a reason to book profits after the market's recent gains.
''Really it was just time to sell, take some profits, and that was a good excuse to do it,'' he said. ''No one is overly concerned China is tightening the screws on the economy,'' he added. ''It is more of an overbought condition that is being corrected here.''
China is expected to announce several economic indicators on Wednesday, including third-quarter gross domestic product, which is expected to post an annualized 10.5 percent gain, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
The dollar rose sharply on Tuesday, rebounding from several weeks of losses amid speculation that the Federal Reserve would ease credit conditions further. Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist for Forex.com, said the currency had begun to look attractive as a safe haven. ''Right now the risk is that global growth is going to slow down,'' he said.
Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman, said the dollar's gains came mostly on profit-taking. ''The dollar has sold against everything,'' he said. ''And now it is being bought.''
The euro fell to $1.3744 against the dollar on Tuesday, from $1.3998 on Monday.
Commodity prices declines reflected fears that any slowdown in China could mean less demand for oil and metals like copper, said George C. Kopp, senior analyst and broker at International Futures Group. Bond market yields declined as investors fled equities. ''You are seeing a possible flight to quality,'' he added.
Tuesday's stock declines also took place against the backdrop of corporate earnings reports. Apple released its quarterly results after the market closed on Monday, saying it had record revenue and profit from strong sales of iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, but it warned of further declines in its gross margins in the current quarter. Apple shares closed down $8.51, or 2.7 percent, at $309.49.
I.B.M., which also reported earnings late Monday, fell $4.80, or 3.4 percent, at $138.03. The company's earnings topped estimates, but part of the improvement came from lower taxes, while a decline in signed service contracts suggested a weakening in revenue. Technology stocks were down nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, while materials and energy shares were down more than 2 percent.
Financials reversed Monday's gains. Bank of America reported an operating profit of $3.1 billion, or 27 cents a share, which was above estimates, but its shares fell 4.4 percent to close at $11.80.
Goldman Sachs bucked the market trend, closing 2 percent higher at $156.72 after reporting a 40 percent drop in third-quarter profit that was still ahead of market estimates.
Despite the sharp market declines, analysts said that expectations that the Fed will announce additional steps to ease monetary policy at its next policy-setting meeting could still support stock prices.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech Tuesday that the Fed could buy financial assets to pump more money into the system and push inflation temporarily higher.
''I think this could be helpful, I think we should talk about it,'' he said.
Online Correction: October 19, 2010, Tuesday
A previous version of this article misstated China's rank among the world's economies. It is the second-largest after the United States, not the world's largest.

HEADLINE: Lazio Is Left to Wonder About What He Would've Said in an Outlandish Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
It was tempting to examine the cast of characters at the debate in the New York race for governor on Monday and think, ''Wow, they'll let just about anybody into this joint.'' One person who did not think that was Rick A. Lazio.
Mr. Lazio, of course, was once widely assumed to be the man who would be sitting in the Republican chair at stage right, next to the candidate from the Rent Is Too Damn High Party. But in the Republican primary last month, Mr. Lazio was swept aside by a Buffalo billionaire riding a wave of voter dissatisfaction, Carl P. Paladino. 
Lonely is the man who cannot win a spot under the same roof as Kristin Davis, former madam. Mr. Lazio was that lonely man on Monday, watching the debate after the fact on a computer screen.
He was at a dinner in Midtown Manhattan with his former dean at American University Law School and some 20 fellow alumni, he said, when the debate began. The restaurant -- he did not identify it -- did not show the debate. But it came up.
''It did, but not for a long discussion,'' Mr. Lazio said Tuesday by telephone from Rochester, where he was giving a speech.
Mr. Lazio remains in a contest far from Rochester; he is running for a state judgeship in the Bronx that he is seen as having no chance of winning, but his presence in the contest keeps the Conservative Party, which backed him for governor, on the ballot.
Nonetheless, his role as a judicial candidate prevented him from speaking candidly about specific candidates, he explained by way of ground rules. That said, he described watching most of the debate on his computer at home.
''I was thinking,'' he said, ''about how I'd answer the questions and what kind of rebuttal I would make.''
He said he could not criticize any particular performance, but he did raise his eyebrows at the overall scene. ''New York is facing serious problems,'' he said. ''I think the people of the state deserve to have a serious debate by serious people. There is an overemphasis on the outlandish, the colorful, the controversial, rather than a thoughtful comparison or debate on competing, credible plans. That's not what we seemed to see last night.''
One thing he could have brought to the proceedings was the rightful claim -- and perhaps, the accompanying gravitas -- of being the sole candidate who had been elected (four times) to Congress.
But Mr. Lazio would not have made it past security on Monday.
What would he have done on stage? ''I believe I would have been well prepared for the debate,'' Mr. Lazio said, his earnestness at odds with the spectacle in question. ''I would have sought to distinguish myself on the fundamental problems that are facing the state.''
A major platform of his campaign was his opposition to the planned Islamic center in Lower Manhattan. Was he surprised it did not even come up Monday? ''You know, I guess so,'' he said. ''It's an issue, but the bigger issue was obviously the economy.''
It was suggested to Mr. Lazio that it was understandable if, in his shoes, he felt a stab of wounded pride watching a debate he had wanted to shape. ''Not watching it alone, no,'' he said, and then added, ''I didn't feel any of that emotion.''

HEADLINE: For Attorney General, a Contest Over Who's Best at Fighting Corruption

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
He is a former Democrat, born and raised on Staten Island, the first Republican elected as district attorney there in a half century and then re-elected in 2007 with 67 percent of the vote.
He opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life, and he favors civil unions, not marriage, for same-sex couples. Nonetheless, he insists he would protect abortion rights (''the law is never going to change'') and would defend same-sex marriage (''once we have a marriage equality bill'').
He was a friend of Bernard B. Kerik, the former police commissioner who pleaded guilty to charges including tax fraud, and he made his political bones working in the seclusive borough president's office. But he was opposed by his former boss when he ran for re-election as district attorney because he had recruited an independent prosecutor to investigate the borough president's grandson. And he says his top priority as the state's chief prosecutor would be to snuff out the torrent of corruption in Albany.
This, in a nutshell, is Daniel M. Donovan Jr., 53, the Republican nominee for New York State attorney general. 
''He was an excellent assistant D.A.,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney for whom Mr. Donovan worked before being recruited by Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island. ''He was fair and on Staten Island; I think he did well and was well respected.''
Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, praises Mr. Donovan for his ''progressive'' vision of law enforcement, his managerial skills and, as president of a statewide prosecutors' group, for ''engaging the Legislature in a way that never happened before.'' (Both Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Hynes are Democrats.)
In contrast, Mr. Donovan's Democratic rival, State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, casts him as a member of an ''ethically challenged machine whose cronies engaged in numerous corrupt activities,'' and of failing to aggressively pursue corruption cases as district attorney.
Mr. Donovan counters that Mr. Schneiderman is a ''card-carrying member of the Albany cesspool, part of that system for the past 12 years.'' He adds: ''I have no ties to Albany. I'm not compromised by my relationships with the Legislature. I'm not compromised by my relationships with any special interest groups.''
He did, however, have personal and professional ties to Mr. Kerik (as did plenty of other public officials), who boasted in e-mails in 1999 that he had lobbied Mr. Donovan on behalf of friends who owned Interstate Industrial Corporation, which won a contract to cap the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island and was being investigated by the city on suspicion of paying bribes to organized crime.
''That never happened,'' Mr. Donovan said of Mr. Kerik's claim, which has been raised in the campaign. ''Bernie never spoke to me about them.'' (In 2003, Interstate, still the subject of city and federal investigations, donated $1,500 to Mr. Donovan's campaign. He returned it after Newsday wrote about the donation a year later.)
Mr. Donovan also denies another exchange that has come up in the campaign, this one with Marietta A. Canning, an anti-abortion advocate who endorsed Mr. Donovan for re-election in 2007.
''I interviewed him a couple of years ago, and he said he was opposed to abortion with no exceptions,'' she said recently. ''Now I read that he has exceptions. Evidently, he has changed his mind.''
Mr. Donovan was criticized for being slow to rebuke Carl P. Paladino, his party's candidate for governor, for forwarding e-mails with racist and pornographic images. Mr. Donovan cited a rule by the state District Attorneys Association, which he led until earlier this year, that bars its members from making endorsements.
''I would represent whoever is the governor,'' he said, adding that as leader of the district attorneys' group, he developed ''a professional relationship'' with Mr. Paladino's Democratic opponent, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo. Asked how he would differ from the two most recent attorneys general, Eliot Spitzer and Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Donovan replied: ''Eliot used the office to fight what he saw as corruption on Wall Street. Cuomo went after student loans. I'm going to use it to fight public corruption.'' (He will not go easy on Wall Street, he said, although it ranks 10th on his list of 12 priorities. Among his biggest individual contributors is Kenneth G. Langone, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange.)
As attorney general, would he cast himself as the ''Sheriff of Wall Street,'' the nickname given to Mr. Spitzer when he occupied the post?
''I don't need a self-proclaimed title,'' Mr. Donovan said, saying that Wall Street can be policed without undermining an industry that is vital to the state's economy.
Mr. Donovan said he planned to lobby to give the attorney general more power over public corruption cases, to require that legislators fully disclose their outside income and law clients, and to bar lawmakers from giving state funds to local organizations with which they are associated.
Mr. Donovan's father was a longshoreman; his mother worked in a factory. He graduated from the Staten Island campus of St. John's University and Fordham Law School and is single.
While campaigning, he often mentions his 84-year-old mother, telling Orthodox Jews in Cedarhurst, Long Island, that she didn't understand why he would take a $40,000 pay cut to become attorney general.
Mr. Donovan was a narcotics prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office before being recruited in 1996 as chief of staff to Mr. Molinari. He was deputy borough president under Mr. Molinari's successor, James P. Molinaro, and then was elected district attorney in 2003. During his tenure, he prosecuted the first hate-crimes case on Staten Island, his office advanced to first from fourth in felony conviction rates among the city's district attorneys and he made the staff more diverse.
After Mr. Donovan transferred a case involving Mr. Molinaro's grandson, who was accused with two friends in the schoolyard stabbing of another teenager, to a special prosecutor from Manhattan to avoid any conflict of interest, Mr. Molinaro endorsed Mr. Donovan's Democratic rival in 2007 and is not supporting him for attorney general.
Being the borough president's chief of staff, said Mr. Molinari, ''required a combination of assets, and Dan had them all -- he had to be able to work with people, he had to be smart enough to work with all the issues, be chief negotiator in closing the garbage dump. You needed someone honest and who people respected.''

HEADLINE: Video From Angle Event Reopens Subject of Race

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Louie Gong, a 36-year-old Seattle resident who is a mix of American Indian, white and Chinese, is often mistaken for Latino.
''Most people don't look at me and say 'Chinese,' '' he said. ''Then I tell them what my heritage is, and they argue with me, saying, 'No, you look Hispanic.' That's offensive on a whole other level -- it's like their sensibility of racial aesthetics trumps my 36 years of life experience, and the fact that my last name is Gong.''
Mr. Gong, like many other racial and ethnic minorities, was taken back to some of his own uncomfortable encounters with being assigned a heritage that was not his own when a video circulated widely on the Internet this week showing Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for the Senate in Nevada, telling a group of Latino students that she did not know if they were all Latino because ''some of you look a little more Asian to me.'' 
Ms. Angle, who is running with Tea Party support against the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, made the comments at Rancho High School in Las Vegas, to the Hispanic Students Union. Her sentiments, not the first unorthodox statements she has made, have thrust activists, experts and bloggers into a conversation about race in a campaign season that has been far more about mortgages than minorities.
''Race has not played much of a role,'' and is beginning to only now, said Andrew J. Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University. ''In past economic downturns, it was common for economically troubled whites to blame minority groups for their problems. In this great recession, everyone is blaming the government and Wall Street.''
This election season is also different from the past in another way: the racial themes that have run through the campaigns have focused on Latino issues rather than the black-white dichotomy that has been the defining racial axis of American politics. ''We're hearing more about Hispanics than African-Americans, which may reflect the growing status of Hispanics in the United States,'' Professor Cherlin said.
Further complicating the role of race is that a growing number of Americans are identifying themselves as racial mixtures that can be difficult to categorize based on looks alone. Beyond that, some members of minorities are pushing back against anyone who wants to tell them what race they are, then stereotype them, whether Asian or Latino or black or some combination.
''We are more complex than our phenotype,'' said Mr. Gong, the past president of Mavin, an advocacy group for mixed-race families, and the co-founder of the Mixed Race Heritage Center, an information clearinghouse. ''People have the right to self-identify in this country, on the census or in personal actions.''
He said Ms. Angle's comments to the students were ''a strong reflection of her sense of entitlement to identify them as she wants, not as they want.''
The comments, captured on video apparently taken by a student and posted by a Nevada journalist, Jon Ralston, were in response to students' questions about one of her television advertisements, in which several dark-complexioned people are shown to be crossing a fence.
The ad's message was clearly a statement on illegal immigration. But did it involve Latinos? It did not explicitly say. Ms. Angle sought to distance herself from making that association, hence the comment that the Latino students could as well be Asian.
''I'm not sure that those are Latinos in that commercial,'' she told the students.
But experts said otherwise.
''It is difficult for anyone who studies political advertisements to say that those images weren't chosen specifically to activate thoughts about Latinos,'' said Nicholas A. Valentino, associate professor of political science and communication studies at the University of Michigan. ''The visual reference is clearly sending information that is very potent.''
He also said that his research showed that people tended to react negatively on immigration issues when images of Latinos were involved. There is hardly any negative connotation for Asians, his research showed.
A spokesman for the Angle campaign did not return a call for comment.
Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a professor of sociology at Duke, said the ad and Ms. Angle's comments about it reflected the country's new ''racial terrain.''
''I think the new boogeyman is Latino,'' Professor Bonilla-Silva said.
Still, Ms. Angle ''managed to offend two communities at once: Asians and Latinos,'' he said. ''Her statements come across as patronizing, and hark back to an old racist tradition where we all look the same.''
Mr. Valentino said the statements could motivate Latinos to turn out and vote against Ms. Angle, who is in a tight, hard-fought race with Mr. Reid.
Mary Beltran, associate professor of communication arts and Latina and Chicana studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said: ''It seems like she's trying to say, 'I don't see race, so how could I be racist?' It's an interesting thing that's happening in politics today.''

HEADLINE: Construction of New Homes in the U.S. Rises Slightly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home construction rose slightly last month, driven by an increase in the building of single-family homes, the federal government announced on Tuesday, but the market was still too weak to propel growth in the battered industry. 
Construction of new homes and apartments rose 0.3 percent in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000, the Commerce Department said. August's figure was revised upward to an annual rate of 608,000 from an earlier estimate of 598,000.
There was a 4.4 percent monthly increase in construction of single-family homes, which are about 80 percent of the market. Construction of condominiums and apartments fell by nearly 10 percent.
The number of permits issued to build new homes, a sign of future activity, fell 5.6 percent from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 539,000. That drop, though, was attributable to a 20 percent decline in permits issued for condominiums and apartments. Permits for single-family homes rose 0.5 percent.
High unemployment, slow job growth and tight credit have kept people from buying homes. The housing market suffered its worst summer in more than 10 years, despite the lowest mortgage rates in five decades.
Housing starts are up 28 percent from their bottom in April 2009, but are down 73 percent from their peak in January 2006.
Weak sales mean fewer jobs in the construction industry, which normally helps power economic recoveries. Each new home built creates, on average, the equivalent of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the builders' trade group.
Builders remain pessimistic about the housing market, although their mood has improved slightly from this summer. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that its monthly index of builders' sentiment rose in October to 16 points, the first increase in five months. Still, a reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the market.
This fall's home sales may improve, but not by much. A huge backlog of foreclosed properties is dominating the market and providing competition for builders.
Construction activity rose 5 percent in the South and 3 percent in the Northeast. It was down by 8 percent in the Midwest and 4 percent in the West.

HEADLINE: A Foe of High Rent Is Vague About His Own

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
Jimmy McMillan, running for governor as the candidate of the one-man Rent Is Too Damn High Party, stole the show at the debate on Monday night with his repeated and crystal-clear message: The. Rent. Is. Too. Damn. High. 
But how high, exactly, is too damn high for Mr. McMillan? That is a little harder to say.
Mr. McMillan said in an interview on Tuesday that for at least the last decade, he had lived rent free.
''We're like family,'' Mr. McMillan said of his landlords. ''They don't want me to pay any money at all. I am basically living there rent free.''
Mr. McMillan said that he moved into his apartment, a one-bedroom on Nostrand Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, in the early 1980s but soon fell behind on rent when he left his job in the Postal Service on disability. The landlady, Mr. McMillan said, admired his Vietnam War service and forgave the back rent and, eventually, the future rent, too. In exchange, he did maintenance work, and after she died in 2003, her heirs continued the tradition.
Mr. McMillan declined to show the apartment, saying he feared for his neighbors' safety, and fielded questions from the driver's seat of his parked graphite-colored Honda CR-V, which is also his mobile office. When he travels, he sleeps in it, too; in the back were a sleeping bag, a bottle of Scope Original Mint mouthwash and a pair of nunchucks he keeps in a seat-back pocket. That weapon happens to be banned by the state he wants to run. ''My main object is to protect myself,'' he said. ''I will worry about the consequences later on.''
He said he did pay $900 monthly for a rent-stabilized apartment on St. Marks Place in the East Village where his unemployed 31-year-old son lives.
''Even though my rent is not too damn high,'' he said, ''if I'm fighting for the children who can't pay rent, who have no place to live, then my rent is too damn high.''
But Mr. McMillan gave The Wall Street Journal a somewhat different account of his living arrangements in an article published online on Tuesday, saying that he paid $800 a month for his own apartment. His landlord could not be reached. Mr. McMillan, asked about his comments to The Journal, said, ''I was probably just trying to brush them off.''
He restated that he personally lived rent free. A few moments later, however, he refused to confirm any of his previous statements.
''Don't look for anything I say about my living space to be true,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japan and America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Japan Goes From Dynamic to Disheartened'' (''The Great Deflation'' series, front page, Oct. 17), you say that I wrote about ''Japan's threat to the United States.'' Actually I wrote about how America was threatening itself by failing to meet the competitive challenges of Japan's export-led growth strategy. 
You say that in the 1980s '' 'Japan Inc.' seemed ready to obliterate whole American industries, from automakers to supercomputers.'' In fact, it did obliterate these two industries.
As you report, Japan now has its problems. But please note that Japanese cellphones don't drop calls, that Japan's Internet is about 10 times as fast as America's and that Japan has a huge trade surplus while America suffers huge trade deficits even in high-tech.
The real danger for America is not that it will follow in Japan's footsteps, but that it will continue its own decline by failing to meet China's export-led growth challenge just as it failed to meet Japan's. Clyde Prestowitz Potomac, Md., Oct. 18, 2010

HEADLINE: How Government Helps Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''For Tea Party, Sway Beyond Mere Numbers'' (front page, Oct. 15): 
The Tea Party positions are based on a blissful, or willful, ignorance of the key role that the federal government plays in everyone's life. Dramatic reductions in pollution, the incredible safety of our air transportation system, improvements in safety of the highways are all because of the federal government. Much of the technology we now enjoy was initially developed through federal research and development money.
Social Security and Medicare were introduced to deal with the poverty and lack of access to health care of senior citizens. The near collapse of the banking system and subsequent bailout, the source of much Tea Party angst, were due to the reduction of federal regulation, not too much regulation.
Without all the infrastructure established with and supported by federal taxes, there would be much fewer worthwhile jobs for Americans. The very wealthy, many of whom are Tea Party backers, would find that their wealth and that of their children was fleeting because without government investment new economic growth will mostly happen overseas.

HEADLINE: Italy by the Ounce

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS understand full-contact grocery shopping.
They brave the madness of Fairways on a weekend, of Zabars during a holiday rush, of Whole Foods and Trader Joes and neighborhood Greenmarkets. They jostle through Key Foods and Food Emporia alike. They prepare for these trips as if for a Himalayan trek, which in New York City is called a schlep.
And they return home triumphant if bruised, because this is how shopping here is done: Got that tilefish! Got that purple kale! (Honey, you forgot the milk.)
Now comes Eataly, an enormous and enormously crowded new Italian-food market and restaurant collection that opened recently off Madison Square Park: 50,000 square feet of restaurants and peninsular provisions, with a fishmonger and butcher (and vegetable butcher) and an espresso bar, a wine store, a cheese store, a cooking school, a kitchenware department and a great deal more. 
It is giant and amazing, on its face, a circus maximus. But what are we really to make of it? Is Eataly a menace (so big and corporate) or an answered prayer (OMG, they sell Barilla bucatini)? Does it represent a step forward for Italian food at the upper end of the economic spectrum of New York, or is it simply a mass-market retail play that capitalizes on the fame of its most visible partners, Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich and his mother, Lidia Bastianich?
Does Eataly strike a chord for those desirous of food made close to home, with its house-made bread and mozzarella, its fresh pasta and local bass? Or does it display carbon footprints to rival those of an airline, with its dry pastas shipped in from Naples, its prosciutto from Friuli, its October-grown organic strawberries from Central and Southern California, from Florida, Central Mexico or Baja? Is Eataly good for us? Or is it the opposite?
The short answer is: yes. Yes to all those questions in different ways, to different degrees.
The Eataly experience is reminiscent of the one Dean & DeLuca introduced to Manhattan in 1988, when its small corner store in SoHo was expanded into a huge operation on the corner of Broadway and Prince Street. (Its proprietors hope it will not be reminiscent of the one Dino De Laurentiis introduced to Manhattan in 1982, when he opened DDL Foodshow. A kind of proto-Eataly on the Upper West Side, it closed two years later.) Dean & DeLuca then was cool and vaguely exciting, a seemingly one-stop shop for an enormous amount of expensive grub and a fast shot of espresso. But it was also uncool and vaguely menacing, a seemingly one-stop shop for an enormous amount of expensive grub and a fast shot of espresso. You could hate the place, even as you shopped there twice a month.
Eataly opened in New York on Aug. 31, the first American branch of a Turin-based chain founded in 2003 by Oscar Farinetti. The crowds have been insane ever since. This has in turn brought more crowds. And it has, alternately, repelled them. As any New Yorker will tell you, there is no point in waiting in a sidewalk line for 30 minutes on a weekend day simply to enter a store. It's not water from the fountain of youth they're selling in there. It's groceries.
To be fair, though: those groceries are pretty good.
There is a restaurant at Eataly that serves fish. It's called Il Pesce, and it is hard to get a table there because no reservations are taken and the chef is Dave Pasternack, who is also the chef and a partner with Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich in the excellent Esca in the theater district. Il Pesce is worth visiting: Mr. Pasternack's plates of crudo and cured sardines and delicately fried seafood are as good as at his flagship, and cheaper, too.
There is a restaurant called Le Verdure, at which it is somewhat easier to get a table even though no reservations are taken, because it serves only vegetables. It is bruschetta city there.
There is a pasta area (La Pasta, which takes no reservations) that abuts a pizza one (La Pizza, and likewise), in which silken, expertly prepared Batali-style pastas are served, as well as Neapolitan pies cooked by actual Neapolitans, in a gold-tiled oven brought in, presumably in parts, from Naples.
You can go to these two at 11:30 a.m. for lunch and get a table, or at 5:30 p.m. for dinner. At other times, you could face a 90-minute wait, during which you are, of course, encouraged to buy things. The pastas are excellent, but in a city that is starting perhaps to out-Naples Naples for pie supremacy, Eataly's pizzas are not yet worth the time spent.
And there is a first-come-first-served bar area, La Piazza, where you can stand at a marble-top table and drink wine or eat salamis and cheese as if in Venice. These tables are very tall. It can be amusing to watch servers and customers reach up to a table to get at a plate. I pass on through.
Only one restaurant, Manzo, takes reservations. In keeping with its name, which means beef in Italian, Manzo serves a lot of meat. The chef is Michael Toscano, who was at Babbo, and the menu has a lot of that restaurant's macher flare: ridiculously crisp and pillowy sweetbreads; agnolotti to shame even the excellent version available for $6 less at La Pasta; an incredible, luscious veal chop smoked in hay, with gigante beans and speck; a beautiful rib-eye for two, with a tiny cup of beef broth as chaser, and cloudlike pommes soufflees just because.
The wine list is exceptional, the service divine over starched tablecloths that shine golden in the light of votive candles. But Manzo is at all hours in the center of a supermarket, across from the fishmonger and right outside the classroom where Ms. Bastianich teaches classes in Italian cooking. One table is pressed up against the door that leads into that room. Manzo is a feng shui nightmare. You might go once.
But pick up dinner instead and head home to cook it, or stop in for an excellent gelato, or a Lavazza espresso and a glass of Nardini, and you may find yourself returning. In these activities, anyway, Eataly's charms are apparent and building. Those lines for the restaurants will or won't dissipate over time. The point of the place is ultimately shopping.
There isn't much in the way of ice- or steam-table prepared food of the kind at Fairway or the local deli. But the collection of pastas -- fresh and dry, much of the latter from Gragnano, outside Naples -- is phenomenal, perhaps unparalleled in Manhattan. You can pick up surprisingly good prepared sauces from the marketing arm of Mr. Batali (these are available at other retail outlets, too), or sublime ingredients for making your own from the long library stacks of Eataly's canned San Marzano tomatoes, marinated artichokes and peperoncini, salted anchovies and other goodies from the Italian larder.
From the bakery behind the pizza ovens: good breads. From the chocolate station up front: dessert.
Packaged meats and poultry are available, too, mostly from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, whose name is becoming so ubiquitous in Manhattan restaurants that it would not be a surprise to hear that the company has started to market meat vodka, or special-blend breakfast cereal. The name is faddish and the products expensive.
A few sausages won't break the bank, though. On a night with a 120-minute wait for a table at La Pasta, I was able to secure the ingredients for what turned out to be an excellent family pasta-and-meats dinner, with bread, cheese and a flinty, excellent Ligurian vermentino, for about $7 a head, all in. Good value.
So, too, are some of the vegetables available in Eataly's narrow greengrocer area, particularly a wide and fabulous collection of fresh mushrooms and, at least for these last few moments of early fall, plump, soft tomatoes.
But airlifted vegetables put the lie to Eataly, too. The Union Square Greenmarket is only six blocks south of the complex. Last week, Mr. Pasternack of Il Pesce was down there showing a gaggle of visiting white-coated Italian chefs around, pointing out the bounty of our local farms. The crowds rivaled those at Eataly. In New York City, there is always somewhere else.
An Eatalian Tour
Want to take the measure of Eataly without waiting in too many lines? Enter on Fifth Avenue and stop immediately at the Lavazza booth. Have an espresso to focus the mind. (Is it after dark? Have a grappa, too, for courage.) Forget about putting your name in for a table at a restaurant -- get a baby-blue shopping basket and get to work. You'll want dry pasta from Gragnano, near Naples. The paccheri -- big tubes of durum wheat the color of gold -- hold sauce well. Also, maybe prosciutto bread from the bakery and a few packets of pork sausages.
Along the West 24th Street wall, you'll see the Market area: sauces and condiments and oils. Get something to cover the pasta and the meat. (The Batali-brand cherry-tomato sauce isn't bad.) Next: a ball of fresh mozzarella from the bar selling same on the far side of the room where everyone's standing at tables with sliced sausages and wine. (Ignore them!) Go south toward West 23rd Street, to the vegetable butcher's stand. Some basil will suffice, though you might see fruit for dessert if you haven't already succumbed to caramel pralines from the chocolate station.
Finally, cut across to the checkout, near housewares, for La Nostra Gazzosa lemon soda. Head home via the wine store next door: a nice dolcetto should match that pasta just fine.
The restaurant review will return next week.

HEADLINE: After Sweat Lodge Deaths, Fewer Spiritual Tourists

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
SEDONA, Ariz. -- There is negative energy in the air here, which the channelers, mystics, healers, psychics and other New Age practitioners of Sedona are grappling to identify and snuff out. It has to do with the recent dearth of visitors to this spiritual oasis in search of enlightenment.
Nobody is sure exactly what is keeping people away from Sedona's four vortexes, swirling energy sources emanating from the earth, but the effects are clear: far fewer crystals are being bought, spiritual tours taken and treatments ordered, from aura cleansings to chakra balancings.
That an earthly power -- the economy -- is a culprit is not in doubt. But some do not discount the effects of an awful incident from a year ago that put Sedona's New Age community in a bad light and that, to some degree, still lingers, despite efforts by metaphysical people to cast it away. 
Last October, a celebrated New Age practitioner held a sweat lodge ceremony that ran dangerously amok, shattering the tranquillity of a spiritual center hidden in a forested valley here.
Packed into a circular hut on the grounds of Angel Valley were red-hot rocks, seething steam and scores of followers of James A. Ray, a California self-help guru. He encouraged them to finish the final test in his ''Spiritual Warrior'' retreat, participants told law enforcement officials, even though they might feel as though they were going to die.
Three of them did. Numerous others were rushed to hospitals.
The Angel Valley spiritual center, a place designed to bring harmony into the lives of visitors, was soon visited by homicide detectives not interested in the retreat's vortex circle, angel connections or Chartres labyrinth. Their questions were about who did what to whom.
''It was a very unfortunate and sad situation that could have happened anywhere,'' said Janelle Sparkman, president of the Sedona Metaphysical Spiritual Association, who attributes the woes that New Age practitioners are experiencing to a lack of disposable income for spiritual needs and not what happened that awful afternoon. ''It was not indicative of Sedona or Sedona's practitioners at all.''
But sweat lodges are now far less common, with the authorities shutting some down to avoid further trouble. And the spiritual association is pushing the importance of ethics among spiritualists.
Still, the tragedy of what occurred, along with the barrage of lawsuits, has caused some outsiders to look elsewhere for fulfillment.
''Initially, I didn't think it was going to affect business and, a year later, I know I was wrong,'' said Deidre Madsen, who runs a New Age travel company in Sedona and a Web site devoted to inner growth. ''I'm shocked at the impact. My business is down 20 percent.''
She is optimistic though, as New Age people tend to be. ''It will come back, in its own time,'' Ms. Madsen said. Sedona's Chamber of Commerce said that tourism over all was bouncing back, but that spiritual business still lagged.
Some, though, are leaving nothing to chance. Two weeks ago, after months of spiritual cleansings, prayer and channeling sessions, the retreat where the sweat lodge victims died held a memorial intended to turn the page.
About 50 people joined hands at the site of the lodge, which was torn down soon after the deaths. Rocks were laid out in the shape of a heart, and three large crystals representing the victims were placed in the center.
''We do not want an energy that we're sitting on a graveyard,'' said Amayra Hamilton, co-founder of Angel Valley. ''This is about learning and appreciating life. That means expanding our understanding of life and death.''
One of those who participated in the memorial was in the lodge that day as a volunteer for Mr. Ray, and he shared why returning to the scene was such a challenge.
''It's been a long process of coming back here,'' said the volunteer, Mark Rock, who has since broken ties with Mr. Ray. ''It was a step-by-step thing. I didn't want to come back at first. This is a powerful place for me. Having three good people transition from here is a lot to take in.''
Despite the memorial, local practitioners say there is still much wrangling that is keeping the incident from fading away.
Mr. Ray faces three manslaughter charges for the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, N.Y.; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minn. He pleaded not guilty and faces trial in February.
Meanwhile, civil lawsuits abound. A Native American group has accused Mr. Ray and Angel Valley of damaging the sacred Indian tradition of sweat lodges.
Some of Mr. Ray's followers filed suit, saying he canceled his inner growth sessions without refunding their money.
Ten people who were either in the sweat lodge or were relatives of those who died sued Mr. Ray and eventually settled. Angel Valley, however, remains a defendant, with its owners rejecting any monetary settlement.
Mrs. Hamilton and her husband, Michael, also sued Mr. Ray, accusing him of damaging their struggling retreat's business of helping people find inner peace. After the sweat lodge deaths, the suit says, many spiritualists began keeping a distance from Angel Valley, and it began losing as much as $35,000 a month.
Several months back, the Hamiltons made a spiritual appeal to end the lawsuits, e-mailing those who were suing them and asking them to consider the implications of what they were doing. ''Let's come together,'' the e-mail said. ''Let's find a new way to do this.''
Their effort drew no takers, although it did rile the plaintiffs' lawyers.
The Hamiltons also came up with the idea of holding a large grieving ceremony this month for sweat lodge participants and survivors at the one-year anniversary of the deaths, and planned to use their insurance money to pay for it. They insisted, however, that all attendees agree to drop their suits. Nobody agreed, so the smaller ceremony was held.
''We were waiting for a miracle to happen,'' Mrs. Hamilton said, ''but it didn't happen.''
She and her husband speak of how everything happens for a reason. And of how this awful event might serve as a lesson to other spiritualists that following gurus should be done with caution. They said they expected to be called to the witness stand in Mr. Ray's case and, if asked, would lay out their belief in communicating with angels and other nonphysical beings.
''That event happened,'' said Mr. Hamilton, who added that he was speaking to a reporter only after consulting the archangel Michael, his spiritual muse. ''The real question is what have we learned from it.''

(PHOTOGRAPH BY YAVAPAI COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS) GRAPHIC: Of Crystals and Vortexes: Many claims are made for Sedona, which has become a spiritual oasis for New Age practitioners. Sedona is said to have vortexes or swirling energy centers that resonate inside those who are open to them. Juniper trees, which have twists in their branches, are said to respond to the vortex energy. Psychics, healers and massage therapists offer a wide variety of services, including chakra balancing using crystals. A blocked chakra can result in imbalance in one's life, spiritualists say. * Topics of New Age seminars in Sedona include ''Finding the Shaman Within'' and ''Get Your Aura Cleansed and Your Chakras Aligned.'' * A special camera that believers say can take photographs of a person's aura picks up energy fields around the body and displays them as swirling colors that reflect the person's physical and emotional state.

HEADLINE: 3 Midtown Projects and How They Grew (or Didn't)

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
One of Manhattan's newest skyscrapers is rising on a nondescript corner of the Avenue of the Americas and 32nd Street. In coming months, the building, once called Tower 111 and now tentatively renamed the Continental, will begin marketing its 338 rental units. Its developer is hoping that sweeping views of the Empire State Building, nine-foot ceilings and amenities that include an indoor swimming pool will draw renters to this mostly commercial stretch of the Garment District.
The Continental isn't the only new development in the area. There are three large projects on this stretch of Avenue of the Americas, from 32nd Street to 29th Street. Each has met a different fate, and their stories tell a tale of real estate's slow, jagged recovery from the recession.
The 53-story Continental, at 885 Avenue of the Americas, was nearly undone by the slumping economy, and only a cost-savings agreement with the construction trade unions saved the tower. The owners of a site one block to the south, at 855 Avenue of the Americas, were not as fortunate: a vacant lot attests to a residential development that never got off the ground. Another developer recently bought the mortgage on the land, and is now angling to take control. 
Just to the south of that site, at 835 Avenue of the Americas, is the Beatrice, a limestone-and-glass rental and hotel building that recently opened. The tower was far enough along when the market crashed that it emerged from the downturn relatively unscathed.
''This neighborhood doesn't really have a name or a clear identity, but it continues to grow,'' said Richard V. Hamilton, a senior vice president of Halstead Property who specializes in the neighborhood. ''It's appealing to some because it is so central, with Broadway plays just 10 blocks to the north, Chelsea to the south, nightlife and shopping relatively accessible, and then there is great transportation.''
The Continental, at the southern tip of Herald Square, is the newest addition. It is still under scaffolding, and the builder, Atlantic Realty Development of New Jersey, has yet to complete many details, including the building's name and its rent roll. The first tenants will most likely move into the building this spring, said Clifford Finn, the director of new development marketing at Citi Habitats, the brokerage that is representing the rentals. The mix of studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, which start on the 10th floor, will have a starting rent of about $2,500 a month.
In addition to the rental part of the development, there is a three-floor, 38,000-square-foot retail space. With its location across from the Manhattan Mall, the developers are hoping for a big-box tenant. The outdoor gear retailer REI was close to signing a lease when it chose instead to move to the Puck Building in SoHo, said Benjamin Fox, the president of the Winick Realty Group, which is representing the space. A gym is now considering the space, while TD Bank and Duane Reade have also looked. The asking rents range from $125 a square foot to more than $300 a square foot. Retail rents on nearby West 34th Street command an average of $500 a square foot, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.
The Continental was almost never built. When the market downturn hit, said Alan Schall, a senior executive at Atlantic Realty and the project manager of the Continental, ''we slowed construction, and there was definitely some contemplation about stopping.''
The construction trade unions saw the difficulty that builders like Atlantic Realty Development were experiencing. ''When we realized that many projects were being put on hold, that everything was coming to a stop, we called an emergency meeting,'' said Louis J. Coletti, president and chief executive of the Building Trades Employers' Association, which represents some 1,700 construction managers, general contractors and subcontractors in New York City.
In 2008 the group, along with the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, began negotiations among the unions, culminating in what it calls the Economic Recovery Project Labor Agreement. The agreement, which was instituted last year and comes up for renewal in March, requires that members lower their profit margins, work more efficiently and take other austerity measures to help make development projects more economical in the downturn. Developers must fill out an application showing their financial duress, and the level of savings is need-based.
The Continental was one of the first projects to take advantage of the agreement. ''We had a big role in getting that agreement done,'' said Mr. Schall, who declined to detail how much savings the project received. ''The savings were significant, and it's safe to say we wouldn't have built without it.''
The owners of the land directly to the south of the Continental were not so fortunate. The Chetrit Group and Tessler Developments acquired the parcel, between 30th and 31st Streets, in 2007, taking out a $105.3 million mortgage. The plan called for a 37-story tower that would include retail space, more than 10 floors of offices, a parking garage and residential condominiums. Like the Continental, it would be designed by the architect Costas Kondylis. But with the real estate market crashing around them, the developers never broke ground.
This year, Durst Fetner, a partnership of the Durst Organization and Sidney Fetner Associates, acquired the mortgage for an undisclosed sum from the troubled lender iStar Financial, which took over the loan when it acquired Fremont Investment & Loan in 2007. IStar is now struggling with nearly $9 billion in debt.
City records do not show any foreclosure proceedings, so experts in real estate turnarounds say it is likely that Durst Fetner is negotiating to take control of the land through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or some other private deal. Both parties declined to comment.
''The timing of this project is good,'' said Mark S. Edelstein, a partner in the real estate workout group at the law firm Morrison & Foerster. ''Even if Durst Fetner spends the next 10 to 15 months foreclosing, they will still take title towards the bottom of the market, in an area that is ripe for future development.''
In stark contrast to the vacant lot is the recently opened Beatrice. The mixed-use project is typical of developments that were popular during the market boom -- complex to build, with many features and amenities.
At the base is a retail space featuring FoodParc, a food court by the restaurateurs Jeffrey Chodorow and Ed Schoenfeld. The first 24 floors make up the 292-room Eventi Hotel, which opened in May. Above the Eventi are 301 rental apartments.
The rental component, known as the Beatrice, has a separate entrance on 29th Street, a fitness center and private sky lounge, floor-to-ceiling windows and washers and dryers. It is 40 percent rented, said Mr. Finn of Citi Habitats, which is also the leasing agent.
The rentals start at $2,775 for studios, $3,875 for one-bedrooms and $6,150 for two-bedrooms.
The timing of the project was such that ''by the time we began feeling the pinch we were already far along in the building process,'' said Evan Stein, the president of JD Carlisle Development Corporation. The company bought the land, once a two-story parking garage, in early 2005 and broke ground in 2007.
In 2008, the company did reach out to the unions to partake in the same project labor agreement that the Continental benefited from, but because the project's fate was not so dire, savings were minimal, Mr. Stein said.
The Beatrice is clearly a product of the real estate boom, said James P. Stuckey, a divisional dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. ''If done today,'' he said, ''it would have a substantially harder time getting financing because of its complexities.''

HEADLINE: RESIDENCES: It's Searchlight, And the Ritz

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
If there was a political attack that could have been predicted, it has to be this one: national Republicans are hitting Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader from Nevada, for living at the Ritz-Carlton. 
When he is in Washington, Mr. Reid lives in an apartment at the posh hotel. The optics of that would be bad for a politician at almost any time. But it's especially unfortunate at a moment when Mr. Reid's home state is ground zero for the housing and foreclosure crisis.
The ad, paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, describes the failing economy in Nevada and shows a clip of Mr. Reid saying that he has nothing to do with the unemployment figures.
''To him, it's a figure,'' the announcer says, ''maybe because Harry lives at the Ritz-Carlton while thousands are losing their homes.''
Mr. Reid's opponent, Sharron Angle, opened the door to the attack during their last debate, suggesting - without providing any proof - that Mr. Reid has somehow mysteriously enriched himself while serving as a senator.
''You came from Searchlight to the Senate with very little,'' Ms. Angle said. ''Now you're one of the richest men in the U.S. Senate. On behalf of Nevada taxpayers, I'd like to know, we'd like to know, why did you become so wealthy on a government payroll?''
Ms. Angle's campaign also released her own version of the Ritz-Carlton ad, which contrasts Mr. Reid ''living large in the D.C. Ritz-Carlton'' with Nevada voters ''living in the state with the highest unemployment rate.''
Mr. Reid said in a statement released Tuesday morning: ''Harry Reid was born, raised and still lives in Searchlight today. Period. Everyone in Nevada knows that and no matter how hard Angle may try, she can't take that away from him.''
And national Democrats released their own attack ad aimed at Ms. Angle this morning. The spot by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee acknowledges voter anger, but suggests that voting for Ms. Angle will lead to Social Security and Medicare being ''phased out.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Michigan's Dingell Counting on a 30th Victory

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Representative John D. Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House, remembers his first campaign, in 1955, when his political ears were damp and a host of popular candidates unnerved him.
Mr. Dingell can recall in stinging detail the primary battle of 1964, when he faced off with an opponent who did not support the Civil Rights Act as he did. And then there was 2002, when redistricting forced him into a contest with a sitting congresswoman. He even recalls the election fights waged by his father, who held the same seat from 1933 until 1955. About this year he is unequivocal.
''This is probably the nastiest climate I've ever seen,'' said Mr. Dingell, 84, taking a short break between campaign stops on Monday. ''It's worse than the fights during civil rights, it's worse than the troubles during the Depression.''
He now faces a wealthy cardiologist with Tea Party leanings, and confrontations with detractors, some of whom take to bellowing. Like the man who confronted him at a meeting last summer, saying the health care bill would mortally harm his son, or the candidate for the Statehouse who snarled and pointed his finger at him during a candidate forum last week. 
On Monday, a fellow even briefly shouted down the news conference here where Mr. Dingell was announcing the sort of thing that long-serving congressmen can bring home -- $13.9 million in federal money to fix much-trod bridges -- because traffic had been snarled to accommodate ''your dog-and-pony show.''
There is the inevitable question of why he bothers.
Time seems to have taken its toll on every visible inch of him. He leans his mouth gingerly to give a tiny kiss to his wife, Debbie, who marches briskly through his campaign headquarters as her husband leans heavily on a wooden cane.
The question seems to offend him.
''You've seen my wonderful people,'' he countered, poking at the air. ''I've got a lot of friends and a lot of things to do.''
There is little doubt that Mr. Dingell, whose 28 victories in this heavily unionized Democratic stronghold outside of Detroit have almost always topped 60 percent, will prevail again. Neither national party nor outside groups have taken much interest in the race.
But for Republicans eyeing even the most unlikely of seats this year for a possible pickup, Mr. Dingell is an irresistible target at least for the kinds of gamesmanship engaged in by both parties in the closing stages of a campaign, probing to see if a candidate is perhaps more politically fragile than he appears.
His opponent, Rob Steele, as well as bloggers and the political press have seized on a recent poll of few voters with questionable methodology showing Dr. Steele a few points up in the 15th Congressional District -- in contrast to other, larger polls that show Mr. Dingell winning -- as a flicker of light.
''I think it will be a lot closer than he is used to,'' said Bill Ballenger, a former state representative who now edits the newsletter Inside Michigan Politics.
''Dingell has not had a tough general election race in decades, or maybe really ever,'' Mr. Ballenger said. ''The question is what you consider tough? A close margin? One in which he works very hard? Spending a lot of money as opposed to not spending money?''
In an anti-incumbent year, nothing says incumbency more than a man who has held his seat for more than 50 years. Michigan's unemployment rate is second-highest in the nation. Mr. Dingell is closely associated with the health care overhaul. Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, the Democratic candidate for governor, is widely viewed as an anvil on the bottom of the ticket.
All of this gave Dr. Steele, whose campaign centers on ''spending accountability,'' his opening. ''For months I have been having people tell me how unhappy they are,'' said Dr. Steele, 52, who says he has voted for Mr. Dingell in the past. ''More people want him retired than re-elected.''
Dr. Steele, who says he is not sure he would label himself a Republican, said that his total lack of political experience is the right antidote to a lifetime of it. ''I've never been involved,'' he said. ''I am not trying to turn Democrats into Republicans. I just went to a county convention for the first time in my life.''
Mr. Dingell has hit back hard, using a larger advertising budget than in 2008 in part to attack Dr. Steele on his plans to alter the way Social Security is managed. Mr. Dingell has raised over $1 million in this cycle; in 2008 when he raised $2.5 million he distributed $747,150 to other Democratic candidates, but so far in this cycle has held on to most of his war chest for his own re-election, distributing $6,320 to other candidates, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
And there are plenty of trips to events like a firefighters' dinner in Dearborn, where Mr. Dingell sat to chat while the keyboardist trilled ''Moondance.''
Mr. Dingell will not speak of his opponent, and he and his entourage greet the Republican challenge with a collective pooh-pooh.
''We're not doing anything we haven't done,'' insisted Mrs. Dingell, herself an activist in Michigan party politics.
What really galls her, she said, are suggestions from detractors that her husband is never in the district. ''We are here every weekend,'' she said of Dearborn. ''It's where we go during break, it's where to go to church, it's where I get my hair colored!''
Mr. Dingell finds a receptive audience among voters like teachers' union members, whose meeting he attended Monday in Monroe to speak of the health care law, the stimulus package and the auto industry rescue.
''John Dingell is a pillar here,'' said Dena Voukides, who owns a diner in Monroe that has been hit hard by the downturn. ''Unless he decides he doesn't want to be in politics, he's not going anywhere.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the amount of federal money brought to the state by Mr. Dingell to fix bridges.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article and a chart on Wednesday about Representative John Dingell's campaign for re-election to Congress misstated the number of times that the Michigan Democrat has been elected to the House. And because of that error, the headline referred incorrectly to his expectations for a victory in November. Starting with the 1955 special election to complete his father's term, Mr. Dingell has won 28 times -- not 29, as the article and chart said. Therefore he is ''counting on his 29th victory'' -- not his 30th, as the headline said.

HEADLINE: White House Economist Puts Message on the Web

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even by this city's not-so-glamorous standards, Austan D. Goolsbee would seem to be an unlikely candidate for Web video star.
But Mr. Goolsbee, the earnest young economist and occasional stand-up comic who was named last month to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has gamely stepped into the spotlight.
Armed with a felt-tip marker and a white board, Mr. Goolsbee is the earnest pitchman in a series of Web videos the White House is using to convey the president's message on economic policy in plainspoken terms. 
The videos, which have a made-at-home quality, have been the subject of some Internet buzz, especially after the first one -- about the debate over extending the Bush-era tax cuts -- was highlighted last week on ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central.
In the second video, a four-minute segment posted on the White House blog on Tuesday, Mr. Goolsbee stands before a hand-made bar graph showing private sector job losses and gains since September 2007. He uses the V-shaped chart to point out that the economic free fall has been turned into a recovery, even if the results are still unsatisfying.
''Obviously times are tough, and obviously we need to do more, but it has been quite a hole that we've had to crawl out of, the worst since 1929,'' Mr. Goolsbee says. (Unemployment, now 9.6 percent, actually reached a higher point, 10.8 percent, in 1982, but the recent recession was the longest since the Depression.)
The videos were the idea of Macon Phillips and Jesse Lee, two young White House aides who work on online media. Mr. Goolsbee, who frequently appeared on President Obama's behalf during his 2008 campaign, said he went along because of his high regard for them.
In the first video, Mr. Goolsbee promises to ''break it down, real simple,'' as he lapses into a bit of a folksy twang; he was born in Waco, Tex., and often visited family there and in Abilene, Tex., as a child.
A professor on leave from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, Mr. Goolsbee, 41, has advised Mr. Obama since his 2004 race for the United States Senate. In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Goolsbee said that working on the Web videos -- and taking part in online chats with the public, as he did Tuesday for the Web site CNNMoney.com -- was easier than teaching his M.B.A. students in Chicago.
''Business students ask lots of questions and have a healthy skepticism, so I think you learn to produce evidence and get to the point,'' he said.
The video series is titled ''White House White Board,'' but Mr. Goolsbee is not shown doing much with the board, as the charts were drawn in advance. ''I have terrible penmanship,'' he said.
The videos were not scripted; Mr. Goolsbee spoke extemporaneously, doing several takes for each segment.
Mr. Obama liked the first video, Reggie Love, Mr. Obama's personal assistant, and Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, told Mr. Goolsbee.
''After the first one, Rahm said, 'We should do more things like that,''' Mr. Goolsbee recalled.
A reaction on The Atlantic's Web site noted praise for Mr. Goolsbee's performance from journalists at Politico, The Wall Street Journal, The Economist and other outlets. But the videos have yet to go viral.
The first one, in which Mr. Goolsbee argued against extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, as Republicans want, attracted about 75,000 views on the White House Web site and about 47,000 on YouTube -- very modest numbers by Web standards.

HEADLINE: Britain Announces Severe Military Cutbacks

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a bid to streamline its armed forces and help reduce its daunting levels of national debt, the British government on Tuesday announced plans to cut its military personnel by 10 percent, scrap 40 percent of the army's artillery and tanks, withdraw all of its troops from Germany within 10 years, and cut 25,000 civilian jobs in its Defense Ministry.
In unveiling his Strategic Defense and Security Review, the first since the 9/11 attacks, Prime Minister David Cameron said the cuts were part of an effort to reconfigure a military that he called ''overstretched, underequipped and ill-prepared'' to meet the unconventional warfare challenges of the future. He added that Britain intended to remain a significant military power, with a military budget that would still be the fourth highest in the world, after those of the United States, China and Russia.
''Britain has punched above its weight in the world, and we should have no less ambition for our country in the decades to come,'' he said. 
The new defense posture also calls for the immediate scrapping of the Ark Royal, Britain's only aircraft carrier capable of launching fixed-wing jets, along with the entire fleet of Harrier jump jets operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force since the 1970s. The demise of the Ark Royal means that Britain will have a 10-year hiatus without a carrier-borne strike force until one of two new aircraft carriers is equipped with a new generation of Joint Strike Fighters in 2020.
The government said that it would go ahead with plans to build both carriers at a cost of about $9.5 billion only because it would be even more costly to cancel one of them, with both already under construction. But after three years in service, one of the vessels will be either mothballed or sold off.
The decision to forgo a carrier-borne strike force caused consternation among naval veterans, military analysts and others who have joined the opposition Labour Party in accusing the Cameron government of hastening the defense review to meet the needs of its overall austerity program.
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, told Mr. Cameron in the House of Commons that the revised defense policy was ''driven by short-term considerations'' and that it was ''simply not credible as a blueprint for our future defense needs.''
Mr. Cameron came under even more pointed criticism earlier in the day at a military command center in northwest London. There he was confronted by a pilot from the navy's Harrier force, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Ward, who said he had flown 140 combat missions over Afghanistan and now found himself facing unemployment.
Mr. Cameron also announced that the government would delay construction of a new fleet of Trident nuclear missile submarines, which now constitute Britain's nuclear deterrent, for about five years. The first of a new class of vessels is not expected to go into service until 2028. By putting back the final decision on the new submarines until 2016, Mr. Cameron conveniently averted a clash within his coalition government over whether Britain should retain a nuclear strike force at all.
Over all, the government plan will involve a staged, four-year cut of about 8 percent in real terms in Britain's annual defense budget of about $59 billion. That was significantly less than the 10 to 20 percent cuts that were under discussion as recently as last month, when the defense minister, Liam Fox, wrote a confidential letter to Mr. Cameron -- quickly leaked to Britain's newspapers -- that carried a hint that Mr. Fox might resign if the cuts were not scaled back.
The more modest scale of the military cutbacks placed extra strain on the government's overall effort to save more than $130 billion through spending cutbacks by 2015, a commitment that will require other government departments to make cutbacks averaging 25 percent.
The details of those cuts -- the most severe austerity program adopted by any British government since World War II -- will be announced by George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, in a House of Commons statement on Wednesday. They are expected to bring months, and perhaps years, of political controversy and possible labor unrest.
Mr. Fox's pushback over the defense cuts appeared to have been helped by the concerns voiced, sometimes publicly, by senior Obama administration officials, including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The American officials, together with senior American military commanders, including Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, were worried that the cuts could hamper Britain's ability to help American forces in conflicts around the globe.
For Mr. Cameron, 44, who leads a potentially volatile coalition between his Conservatives and a minority bloc of Liberal Democrats, coming down on Mr. Fox's side of the cabinet tensions over the cuts proved a bruising experience. He has said in recent days that the military cuts were ''the hardest thing'' he has had to do since taking office.
The Cameron government's program to bring down Britain's deficit more rapidly than that of almost any other Western country has conflicted with the Obama administration's appeals to its allies not to risk the sluggish economic recovery of the past 18 months by cutting government spending too fast.
Perhaps because of that, as well as the American concerns about Britain's military strength, Mr. Cameron telephoned President Obama on Tuesday, shortly before announcing the defense cuts. A Downing Street spokesman said the British leader had promised Mr. Obama that Britain would ''remain a first-rate military power and a robust ally of the United States.''
The prime minister also offered assurances about Britain's commitment in Afghanistan, where it has 10,000 troops, second only to the 100,000 troops committed by the United States. In his Commons statement, Mr. Cameron said that there would be ''no cut whatsoever'' in financing for the Afghan effort, and that he had ''heeded'' Britain's defense chiefs every time they had warned him that a proposed reduction might hinder the war effort. He also pledged more money for new armored personnel carriers and helicopters, and a major commitment to strengthen and re-equip Britain's special forces, which have played a major, if little-publicized combat role in Afghanistan and Iraq.
All three arms of Britain's forces will endure major personnel losses in the cuts. With an overall level of about 175,000 -- roughly the size of the United States Marine Corps -- the army will lose 7,000 soldiers, with the navy and the air force each losing 5,000. But Mr. Cameron said that the army would still be able to put at least 7,000 troops into combat abroad, down from the current ceiling of 10,000, with a ''one-off'' capability to field 30,000 troops for a ''major operation'' should the need arise.

HEADLINE: 3 Schools of Thought Among Advisers, for 3 Types of Investors

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
AS portfolios tick up after the vast losses of two years ago, many investors remain wary. The latest whiz-bang product is more likely to inspire skepticism than desire. Promises of steady returns do not inspire confidence, either.
While in boom times it seemed easy to make money, investors have learned that it is even easier to lose money.
In this climate, advisers face a challenge, and, once again, they have had to develop new ways of presenting their services. Speaking broadly, three approaches seem to have emerged: the caring, the technical and the retirement-focused.
The emergence of different approaches also shows the resilience of the wealth-management industry -- and this is not the first time the industry has changed how it describes itself. 
''They said 'trust us,' but they leave off the rest of the sentence: 'to get you out of the hole we dug for you,' '' said Mark Stevens, chief executive of MSCO, a marketing firm that has done work for wealth-management companies. ''Why are they able to resurrect themselves? People want them to. What's your other option?''
Understanding the differences among the three approaches and choosing the right adviser may at least help investors sleep better at night.
THE CARING APPROACH Advisers in this camp say they manage money as if it were their own. Their approach is less flashy by design than others, and they go beyond the issue of fiduciary responsibility of registered investment advisers, they say.
One large firm using this approach is Stephens Inc., a privately held bank run by Warren Stephens, founded by his uncle in 1933 and later run by his father. The firm's claim to fame is having brought Wal-Mart public in 1970; it added the wealth-management division in 2001.
In the last three years, Mr. Stephens says, he has added 25 advisers, for a total of 107, and with them clients who fit the Stephens ethos: people who want stability with steady growth. ''We're not immune to our clients' portfolios being down somewhat,'' Mr. Stephens said. ''We've benefited from the real and perceived stability of our firm.''
The wealth management division now manages $7 billion, the same amount it managed before the recession.
The relatively small number of advisers, given how much money they manage, has created a culture that prides itself on continually checking where it has invested its clients' money.
In one instance, Mr. Stephens said, the firm found that a money market account it had used for years added more securities beyond ultrasafe Treasury bonds. Stephens contacted its clients and sought their permission to move that money to a money market account more focused on Treasuries.
''We had several clients say, 'You're looking out for my money; that's a really good call,' '' Mr. Stephens said, noting one client deposited an additional $5 million in his account.
In a different approach to caring, Ben Marks, president and chief investment officer of Marks Group Wealth Management in Minnetonka, Minn., is investing clients' money more locally than globally, bucking the trend to look abroad.
''The proximity is important to investors,'' Mr. Marks said. ''They like the proximity of who is making the investment decisions -- that's us -- and secondly the proximity of the actual investments themselves.''
In this strategy, Mr. Marks said, the qualitative side of investing is winning out over the quantitative approach. This was not so important in 2006 when portfolios were all rising, he said, but has become so, and having a connection to the companies is one such driver.
''There is a sense of patriotism in investing in your local community,'' Mr. Marks said. ''When people are investing overseas, it's almost conceptual -- I should invest in Brazil or China -- but they don't have the level of detail of what they should know.''
At the Harbor Lights Financial Group, which manages $250 million from its base on the New Jersey shore, the notion of a small, caring firm goes a step further to include ''lifestyle concierge services'' for clients with $1 million or more. This includes help negotiating the price of a new car or securing hard-to-get theater tickets or restaurant reservations.
This may seem labor-intensive for a small firm, but Doug Lockwood, a partner, said the good will that accrues more than offsets the labor, particularly because clients do not use the services frequently.
''We could only control so much of the performance with the markets, so we decided to create this program,'' he said. ''Our top clients are referring us all these people, so we try to overimpress them.''
He says his firm recently saved a client $5,000 on a luxury car, something he believes clients are more likely to talk about at a dinner party than their rate of return.
''Some of the largest wealth management firms have been doing this for years,'' he said. ''Our referrals have gone up at least 25 percent in 2009 and 2010.''
THE TECHNICAL APPROACH Advisers in this category say it is a way to talk about returns and expectations without dwelling on the numbers themselves. Doing that requires them to ask different questions.
Mitch Cox, head of global investments and research at Barclays Wealth, said the first question to ask clients should be ''how much am I financially and mentally prepared to lose?'' While talking about potential losses, Mr. Cox said his firm speaks to clients about opportunities across nine asset classes that span the globe.
The reasoning is that moving into cash and bonds may allow investors to sleep at night, but it may also let them fall behind the rate of inflation. In direct contrast to Mr. Marks's invest-local focus, Mr. Cox suggested: ''Think of the global economy as an air mattress. If you're pushing down on one part, chances are there is going to be a positive effect someplace else.''
Finding the right mix of investments depends on a person's emotional makeup, he said, but one thing is consistent: ''They want returns that are unsurprising and sustainable.''
The other distinctive element of the technical approach is an emphasis on lower costs and fees, which translates to a higher return.
That high costs eat up returns is something investors in index funds have been pointing out for decades. HighTower Advisors of Chicago says it has a fresh approach.
Started two years ago with backing from a group led by Philip J. Purcell, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, HighTower raised $165 million that it is using for two goals: to build a technology and infrastructure platform that aims to lower the costs on everything, including bonds and fees paid to third-party custodian firms, and to hire top teams from other firms.
''The fundamental difference is we've converted financial advisers from being the last node of a manufacturing and distribution business into becoming a buyer of Wall Street products, and that makes Wall Street compete for the business,'' said Elliot S. Weissbluth, chief executive of HighTower.
The firm now manages $16 billion. Beyond performance numbers, it emphasizes to clients that it has more freedom and can lower their costs -- something all registered investment advisers tell their clients, of course.
But HighTower goes a step further. When it wants to buy a bond on behalf of a client, for example, HighTower solicits bids from up to 50 firms to get the best price. The same holds true with the custodians who actually hold the money the firm's advisers are managing: HighTower works with seven, as opposed to one or two, so the client benefits from shopping around.
''If nothing else, you're paying less,'' Mr. Weissbluth said. ''And driving down the costs helps performance.''
RETIREMENT-FOCUSED This approach educates clients about their portfolios and tries to persuade them to keep the long term in mind. By extension, this means trying to ignore the short-term peaks and valleys in their portfolios.
A cynical view of this is that firms need clients to forget the losses of the last three years, as Mr. Stevens of MSCO pointed out, and think decades down the road. This can work, unless a client had planned to retire next year.
The more generous view is that people should have been thinking long-term all along and that being concerned with short-term market gyrations at this point is not going to help them.
''We've been very visible in the public with educational seminars,'' said Lyle LaMothe, head of wealth management in the United States for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. ''They all have something to do with retirement or income protection.''
Last year, ''there was a clear need that was percolating,'' he said. Merrill Lynch has added 15,000 accounts with more than $250,000 in each so far in 2010. Claire Huang, head of marketing for Bank of America Global Wealth Management and Investment Management, which includes Merrill, said their campaigns were emphasizing retirement goals and steering people away from thinking about the absolute amount of money they have.
''People who talk about the number are missing the point,'' she said. ''People want help based on their needs. They want little steps, and over time they'll hit that number.''
David B. Armstrong, a managing director of Monument Wealth Management, outside of Washington, employs a similar approach on a smaller level. Advocating ''personal pension planning,'' he tells clients to look at retirement as any other liability.
''If I want to live off of $150,000 a year when I retire, that's a liability,'' he said. ''What we do is a simple net present value calculation -- what does an asset have to be worth today to be worth what they need it to be worth in the future?''
Retirement may still be the goal, but for many people the timeline for it has changed, and that has altered the planning process, said Renee Brown, director of wealth, brokerage and retirement for Wells Fargo.
''They're less concerned about getting to retirement; they think it's going to happen later,'' Ms. Brown said. ''Their concern now is, will their money last through retirement?''
It's essential to remember that the three schools of thought are not broken down by wealth levels but by personality traits. A person with $30 million could be happy fishing and golfing his days away in retirement, while someone with $5 million would rather take the caring approach while he sat on boards or consulted.
Most important in choosing an adviser is for people to ask: what kind of investor am I?

HEADLINE: Growing in Size, Soaring in Price And in Demand

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
JUST based on the new luxury jets that were the hottest items at the National Business Aviation Association annual convention in Atlanta this week, it would be easy to overlook that the private jet business has been mired in a depression for two years.
But at the very highest niche, where customers can easily pay well over $40 million for a jet and more than $8 million to outfit the cabin, the business appears to be surviving the economic downturn. On the eve of the convention, for example, the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier stunned its high-end competitors by introducing with great fanfare two top-of-the-line, formerly hush-hush, large jets -- the Global 7000 and Global 8000 -- at an eye-popping price of about $65 million apiece.
Brad Nolen, Bombardier's director of product strategy, said that the new ultralong-range planes, which will be able to fly nonstop on routes like Beijing to Washington and New York to Mumbai, are aimed at multinational corporations and high-net-worth individuals who want to travel great distances nonstop in airplanes whose cabins ''emulate the comfort of the home environment.'' 
Bombardier's announcement was made at a lavish party at the DeKalb Peachtree executive airport in Atlanta, where private jet makers and sellers had flown in about 100 jets for display.
Gulfstream also displayed the lavish interior of a previously announced new top-shelf model, the $60 million Gulfstream G650, whose most remarkable feature is that it can fly nearly at the speed of sound. Gulfstream already has about 100 firm orders for the jet.
Meanwhile, at the DeKalb airport display, sales representatives from the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer were showing prospective customers through the interior of its new Lineage 1000 jet, which is as big as an airliner. Price: about $50 million.
It's certainly true that the business aviation industry, which includes all types of private planes, from single-engine props to the mightiest intercontinental jets, has been reeling. That's especially so with jets. A Honeywell Aerospace forecast says that deliveries of new jets will be down about 17 percent this year, after plunging 34 percent in 2009 -- when 849 jets were delivered compared with 1,313 in 2008. The 2008 deliveries, a record, had capped a dizzying five-year span of surging industry growth.
Over the last two years, companies in the Unites States shut down flight departments and sold corporate jets of all sizes -- partly because of the economy but also in part because of bad public (and shareholder) reaction against perceived excess. That the market has held its own or even grown for the most expensive jets is an indication of expanding international wealth and the ability of some wealthy customers to fly beneath the radar, so to speak, because they do not report to shareholders or a corporate board that is anxious about perceptions.
Data on private jet shipments from the General Aircraft Manufacturers Association bears this out. While jet shipments are off sharply in general, the so-called heavy-metal niche, where luxury and long-haul range are cherished, is doing fine.
Bombardier, for example, will deliver 51 of its $40 million Global Express jets this year, the same number as last year, and up from 46 in 2008. In 2009, Gulfstream delivered 88 of its G300 through G550 models, which cost $33 million to $50 million -- up from 79 in 2008. And Dassault is expected to deliver 32 of its $50 million Falcon 7X models this year, up from 21 last year.
Meanwhile, worldwide demand is growing for even bigger planes, converted from commercial airliners. The two major commercial airliner makers, Boeing and Airbus, already sell private versions of their 737 and A320 commercial planes, respectively. And as airlines have retired a large number of 50-seat regional jets in recent years, some of those used planes are being scooped up and converted.
''There are definitely people who have the wealth to do this,'' said Sean Gillespie, director of sales and marketing at Flying Colours Corporation, which installs cabin interiors and equipment on new high-end business jets and converts new and used regional jets.
Business has been so good, especially from China and India, that the company is undertaking a major expansion of its plant in Peterborough, Ontario, where Mr. Gillespie said he expected to accommodate more work on even bigger commercial aircraft. ''We've had requests from people who might now own a Global XRS or a Gulfstream G5, who get to where they want the next thing in an airplane,'' he said.
Assuming you have enough money, it is a good time to buy a used commercial regional jet, like a Bombardier CRJ, for your personal or business flying. ''You can buy one at a very good price for the size of the airplane you'll get,'' Mr. Gillespie said. Flying Colours typically equips converted CRJs with fuel tanks that increase flying range up to about 3,000 miles, he said.
''We work with a range of floor plans and designs for things like exotic veneers and leathers,'' he added. ''And the top-end in-flight entertainment systems are the rage these days, including high-speed Internet systems, which are almost a standard option now.''
Which could be useful for the wealthy customer who may eventually tire of being confined to a converted regional jet or 737. While flying across the Continental Divide, say, that customer might easily surf to lots of information about turning ever-larger airliners to private use, perhaps emulating John Travolta, who pilots his own converted Boeing 707, along with four other private jets in his personal fleet.
For years, even bigger airliners like 767 and 747 jumbo jets have been in private use by wealthy individuals and some companies. And the biggest commercial airplane of them all, the Airbus double-decker A380, is also now in demand.
Major companies that do airliner maintenance and conversions like Lufthansa Technik have shown detailed designs for so-called V.I.P. models of the A380. Some designs feature multiple bedrooms, lounges, a dining room and even a movie theater. The retail price of the A380, by the way, is about $320 million. Add about $100 million more for a top-quality converted cabin.
''Obviously you can go as big as you want, even as big as the A380, and there are high-net-worth individuals who are looking to do just that,'' Mr. Gillespie said.

HEADLINE: Treading Carefully In the Currency Bazaar

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK

 BODY:
WHILE the long-term outlook for the dollar seems to be dismal these days, what about other currencies? And if you are interested in investing in currencies, how best to go about it?
It's possible not only to invest in a basket of foreign currencies. but to make one-way bets on individual currencies. Animated by the Australian dollar? Riveted by India's rupee? More than 40 ways are available to wager on the direction of currencies in the $4 trillion global currency market, which is roughly four times as large as the United States bond market.
Always remember that the currency markets are notoriously volatile, so timing the market is difficult and risky. Despite all of the cable TV ads promoting software that can produce foreign-exchange trading profits, even the largest financial institutions get burned trading currencies. 
You need to consider carefully which, if any, investment vehicle is suitable for you. The choices include at least 14 mutual funds, 19 exchange-traded funds and 10 exchange-traded notes issued by banks that are all based on currency strategies.
If you want exposure to foreign currencies to blunt the impact of a portfolio largely dominated in dollars, a large basket of currencies managed by a mutual fund might be suitable. Experts say it depends on the portfolio you are trying to hedge.
''I don't like currency baskets,'' said Michael Dubis, a certified financial planner based in Madison, Wis. He said such investments were often ''expensive, unnecessary and will already overallocate currency, which is already embedded in your international stock exposure. And thinking one knows the direction of currency shifts is insanely delusional.''
Or do you have a strong hunch about where the dollar is headed? For bears, the Rydex Weakening Dollar 2x Strategy A (RYWBX) fund uses leverage to double your returns on a falling dollar. The company has another fund (RYSJX) that bets on the dollar strengthening. The Merk Hard Currency fund (MERKX) invests in gold (which rises in price when the dollar falls) and a group of major currencies to wager against the dollar.
What if you have a time-sensitive transaction or heavy exposure to another currency and want to ensure that you don't lose money if it appreciates relative to the dollar? A more complex instrument called a currency forward might be suitable. It's a contract that locks in a price to buy or sell a specific quantity of the currency at a future date.
Or maybe you're just plain skittish about the prospects of the dollar as Congress continues to sell Treasury securities in a weakened economy to finance the more than $13 trillion national debt. That's a reasonable concern, and if most of your investments are in dollars, you may be able to realize some gains in stocks and bonds denominated in other currencies.
Alec Young, international equity strategist for Standard & Poor's, said that for investors in the United States, ''currency diversification is a key benefit of international investing; you can make a case for the dollar being in a secular decline.''
As with the stock market, though, currencies don't follow a script. The Greek debt crisis brought on a 15 percent decline in the euro against the dollar earlier this year, although the euro has recovered more than 10 percent since then.
From a financial planning perspective, rather than placing your bets on a particular currency or strategy, you'd be better off focusing on growth from foreign stocks. If you happen to benefit from currency movements, it's an added benefit -- though it carries the risk, of course, that the currency will move the other way. And don't forget that many American multinationals have a large foreign presence that could promise capital appreciation from overseas.
Focusing on currency strategies can also be expensive. The Merk fund, for example, charges 1.3 percent annually in expenses to manage a handful of currencies. Compare that with 0.27 percent for the Vanguard Total International Stock Index fund, which holds more than 1,800 stocks in developed and emerging markets.
A more pressing concern for American investors -- and one that may be clouded by the foreign exchange investing frenzy -- is domestic inflation and interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall and you lose purchasing power. While that doesn't appear to be a problem now, it may be when the United States economy heats up.
Rick Miller, a financial planner with Sensible Financial in Waltham, Mass., recommended that investors protect against purchasing power erosion with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. They are also sold through the Treasury in the form of I-Bonds. Unlike most bonds, TIPS keep pace with the Consumer Price Index and increase in value when inflation climbs. The securities are available in mutual funds like the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund (VIPSX) and the iShares Barclays TIPS fund (TIP).
''TIPS are boring,'' Mr. Miller said, ''but they are better than stocks or commodities, which could go down with inflation.''
A tunnel-vision focus on whether the dollar will continue to slide may distract you from globally diversifying your portfolio in foreign stocks and bonds. Only about 42 percent of the world's free-floating stock market value is in American stocks. Broad-based international stock and bond funds include the iShares All Country World Index exchange-traded fund (ACWI) and the Pimco Foreign Bond fund (PFUIX).
So if you're ignoring Europe, South America and developing countries, you could be missing out on growth. It's far more likely that you'll make money in a passive portfolio covering dozens of countries than making one bet on a single currency.

HEADLINE: A Philanthropy Coach Talks About Wise Giving

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
''IT'S easy to give money away, but it's hard to do it well,'' says Lisa Philp, who says she often serves as a philanthropy coach. Formally, her title is global head of philanthropic services at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, where she heads a 10-member team that works with individuals and families, other advisers in the bank's worldwide operations and with nonprofit organizations, all in an effort to treat charitable giving with the same care given investments.
Although many private banks, wealth advisory firms and law and accounting practices have people well versed in tax and other relevant areas, who can discuss charitable giving with clients as part of their overall financial plan, J. P. Morgan is unusual in having a 50-year tradition of advisers devoted specifically to personal, as well as legal, aspects of philanthropy. 
Ms. Philp, who holds a B.A. from the University of Michigan and an M.B.A. from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, worked with several large charitable organizations before joining the bank. She offered advice and insights to people hoping to achieve as much as possible through wise giving in a recent conversation with Jan M. Rosen. Excerpts from that conversation follow:
Q.With both the economy and financial markets recovering from the 2008 crash, are you seeing a greater willingness to make charitable gifts?
A. Yes, we definitely are. We are seeing more and more people wanting to give. There are emerging philanthropists, especially women, as well as people who are stepping up their giving. Over all, the increase is about 25 percent.
Q.How would you describe an emerging philanthropist?
A. Most have been charitably inclined, giving at a modest level throughout their lives, but now they want to be more involved personally and financially. Many want to get their families involved as well. For example, one 60-something client sold her business and set up a family foundation. We worked with her on setting up a strategy, developing a mission statement and getting the family engaged.
Q.What is involved in being a philanthropy coach?
A. Our work is very individualized for each client, but many people want to be more strategic, more proactive. We serve as a sounding board, as well as provide information. With the client I mentioned, we spoke and teased out what she was interested in -- helping people, especially artists, make their dreams come true. She had been an actor when she was young and wanted to help artists with their careers. She was familiar with several theater and dance companies, and we introduced her to organizations that provide targeted grant money, professional development and industry connections to help individuals develop as artists.
Q.Is she a typical example?
A. Yes, in that she is on a journey with her philanthropy, but we work with donors across just about every issue. Someone who cares about education might initially think of funding scholarships, but with our tailored coaching might decide to explore early childhood or school reform. Others care about health care, the environment, international development or social entrepreneurship.
The coaching role comes into play more when someone wants to go down a distinctive path, developing a strategy with measurable impact. Donors typically start with specific gifts to organizations they know firsthand, but the transformative part often comes when they work with us to reflect on what they want to accomplish and seek out new relationships to get them there.
One client asked me to meet with her 18-year-old daughter. She was starting to give her daughter money to use for philanthropy and wanted to set her on a path with practical advice on how to review organizations in order to make wise decisions.
Another family foundation wanted coaching for the younger generation in assessing nonprofit organizations' financial statements. We helped them realize that a family foundation considering a substantial gift can act like a staffed foundation -- asking for a proposal with benchmarks, the organization's operating budget, the budget for a specific project and its most recent audit.
My group helps build bridges between wealthy individual donors and institutional philanthropy around areas of mutual interest. It's very rewarding to us to help folks learn from each other and enhance their investments.
Q.Their own investments or their investments in people they are helping?
A. Both. We work with bankers and investment specialists throughout J. P. Morgan to make sure clients' philanthropic activities complement their overall financial plans.
Q.Tax law plays a big role, doesn't it, because a donor can afford to give more if the gift is deductible or made through a trust with tax advantages?
A. My wealth adviser colleagues are trust and estate attorneys who understand tax-efficient giving. Taxes are part of the equation, but often are secondary. The primary driver is invariably the desire to help, to give back.
Q.Your work is primarily with individuals or families, then? Do you ever find that your clients want to collaborate on their giving?
A. Yes. A new aspect of our coaching role includes creating opportunities for like-minded donors to join forces in giving circles to increase their impact. For example, we recently created an education collaboration fund to help a group of major philanthropists vet the most innovative educational programs around the country.
This giving circle leveraged their private-sector investment five times over with public funds, and they will spend time together learning about replicable and scalable models to improve outcomes for kids. But giving circles aren't just for the wealthy. There are hundreds of examples of people of all means pooling their funds and expertise to support charitable programs in a philanthropic book club approach.
Q.Do you have any caveats for charitably inclined people -- any pitfalls they should avoid?
A. Don't simply react to direct mail or the causes of friends. Once you get serious about philanthropy, word spreads quickly. You'll get appeals, invitations to join boards. Take a step back and learn that it's O.K. to say no. Do your homework, your research. Learn from the experience of other donors and nonprofit organizations to determine your strategy. For philanthropy to be rewarding and have an impact, it should speak to your heart and your mind. Whether you are over 60 or under 18, home in on what really concerns you, talk to people in the know in your fields of interest and focus your attention to fulfill your goals.

HEADLINE: Skepticism on Climate Change Is Article of Faith for Tea Party

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
JASPER, Ind. -- At a candidate forum here last week, Representative Baron P. Hill, a threatened Democratic incumbent in a largely conservative southern Indiana district, was endeavoring to explain his unpopular vote for the House cap-and-trade energy bill.
It will create jobs in Indiana, reduce foreign oil imports and address global warming, Mr. Hill said at a debate with Todd Young, a novice Republican candidate who is supported by an array of Indiana Tea Party groups and is a climate change skeptic.
''Climate change is real, and man is causing it,'' Mr. Hill said, echoing most climate scientists. ''That is indisputable. And we have to do something about it.''
A rain of boos showered Mr. Hill, including a hearty growl from Norman Dennison, a 50-year-old electrician and founder of the Corydon Tea Party. 
''It's a flat-out lie,'' Mr. Dennison said in an interview after the debate, adding that he had based his view on the preaching of Rush Limbaugh and the teaching of Scripture. ''I read my Bible,'' Mr. Dennison said. ''He made this earth for us to utilize.''
Skepticism and outright denial of global warming are among the articles of faith of the Tea Party movement, here in Indiana and across the country. For some, it is a matter of religious conviction; for others, it is driven by distrust of those they call the elites. And for others still, efforts to address climate change are seen as a conspiracy to impose world government and a sweeping redistribution of wealth. But all are wary of the Obama administration's plans to regulate carbon dioxide, a ubiquitous gas, which will require the expansion of government authority into nearly every corner of the economy.
''This so-called climate science is just ridiculous,'' said Kelly Khuri, founder of the Clark County Tea Party Patriots. ''I think it's all cyclical.''
''Carbon regulation, cap and trade, it's all just a money-control avenue,'' Ms. Khuri added. ''Some people say I'm extreme, but they said the John Birch Society was extreme, too.''
Whatever the party composition of the next Congress, cap and trade is likely dead for the foreseeable future. If dozens of new Republican climate skeptics are swept into Congress, the prospects for assertive federal action to control global warming gases, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, will grow dimmer than they already are.
Those who support the Tea Party movement are considerably more dubious about the existence and effects of global warming than the American public at large, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted this month. The survey found that only 14 percent of Tea Party supporters said that global warming is an environmental problem that is having an effect now, while 49 percent of the rest of the public believes that it is. More than half of Tea Party supporters said that global warming would have no serious effect at any time in the future, while only 15 percent of other Americans share that view, the poll found.
And 8 percent of Tea Party adherents volunteered that they did not believe global warming exists at all, while only 1 percent of other respondents agreed.
Those views in general align with those of the fossil fuel industries, which have for decades waged a concerted campaign to raise doubts about the science of global warming and to undermine policies devised to address it.
They have created and lavishly financed institutes to produce anti-global-warming studies, paid for rallies and Web sites to question the science, and generated scores of economic analyses that purport to show that policies to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases will have a devastating effect on jobs and the overall economy.
Their views are spread by a number of widely followed conservative opinion leaders, including Mr. Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, George Will and Sarah Palin, who oppose government programs to address climate change and who question the credibility and motives of the scientists who have raised alarms about it.
Groups that help support Tea Party candidates include climate change skepticism in their core message. Americans for Prosperity, a group founded and largely financed by oil industry interests, has sponsored what it calls a Regulation Reality Tour to stir up opposition to climate change legislation and federal regulation of carbon emissions. Its Tea Party talking points describe a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions as ''the largest excise tax in history.''
FreedomWorks, another group supported by the oil industry, helps organize Tea Party rallies and distributes fliers urging opposition to federal climate policy, which it calls a ''power grab.''
''Any effort to make electricity and fuel more expensive or to cap or regulate CO2 will only exacerbate an already critical situation and cause tremendous economic damage,'' FreedomWorks says on its Web site.
The oil, coal and utility industries have collectively spent $500 million just since the beginning of 2009 to lobby against legislation to address climate change and to defeat candidates, like Mr. Hill, who support it, according to a new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a left-leaning advocacy group in Washington.
Their message appears to have fallen on receptive ears. Of the 20 Republican Senate candidates in contested races, 19 question the science of global warming and oppose any comprehensive legislation to deal with it, according to a National Journal survey.
The only exception is Mark Steven Kirk, the Republican Senate nominee in Illinois, who was one of only eight Republicans to vote for the House cap-and-trade bill sponsored by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats. (One of the other Republican ''yes'' votes was cast by Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, who blames that vote in part for his primary election defeat by Christine O'Donnell, the Tea Party candidate and a global warming skeptic.)
A large majority of Tea Party-supported House candidates also doubt global warming science and oppose energy legislation designed to address it.
Mr. Young, the Indiana Republican nominee trying to unseat Mr. Hill for the Ninth Congressional District seat, strongly opposes cap and trade and other unilateral measures to combat global warming. He says he is uncertain what is causing the observed heating of the planet, adding that it could be caused by sunspots or the normal cycles of nature.
''The science is not settled,'' he said in an interview in his headquarters in Bloomington, Ind. And he said that given the scientific uncertainty, it was not wise to make major changes in the nation's energy economy to reduce carbon emissions.
A third candidate in the Indiana Congressional race, Greg Knott, a libertarian, said he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change but opposed a nationwide cap-and-trade system as the answer.
Lisa Deaton, a small-business owner in Columbus, Ind., who started We the People Indiana, a Tea Party affiliate, is supporting Mr. Young in part because of his stand against climate change legislation.
''They're trying to use global warming against the people,'' Ms. Deaton said. ''It takes way our liberty.''
''Being a strong Christian,'' she added, ''I cannot help but believe the Lord placed a lot of minerals in our country and it's not there to destroy us.''

HEADLINE: The Fury Failure

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Rage is not working out.
In Delaware, the Republican voters were so angry that they rejected a popular congressman and gave their Senate nomination to an apparently unemployed 41-year-old woman whose major life success had been an ongoing performance as Wacko Conservative Girl on late-night talk shows. In Alaska, they were so mad that they tossed out their incumbent senator for Joe Miller, a lawyer who believes unemployment compensation is unconstitutional, except when his wife is receiving it.
So now in Delaware the unangry Democrat candidate is way ahead. In Alaska, Miller keeps dropping in the polls, which made him so mad that he had his private security guards take an inquiring reporter into custody. 
That did not go over very well even in Alaska, an extremely angry state that hateshateshates all forms of government, despite the fact that 40 percent of its economy comes from government aid, and the state's oil-revenue-sharing program gives families thousands of dollars in payments every year. ''Unemployment has never been lower; there is no housing crisis; banks are solvent. We just got Permanent Fund Checks -- and, boy, are we pissed off!'' said Michael Carey, an Anchorage Daily News columnist.
Really, people, rage never gets you anything but overturned garbage cans and broken windows. If you want to do rage, go to France.
We are talking here about undifferentiated anger, which creates nothing but a feeling of moral superiority on the part of the irate. It's natural to get furious at specific things: a tax increase or an unfaithful spouse or a blown tire. Or, in the case of the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Kentucky, Rand Paul, a debate opponent who asks: ''When is it ever appropriate to tie up a woman and have her kneel before a false idol that you refer to as Aqua Buddha?''
This involved a college prank that Paul told reporters he doesn't remember. You can see why he was angry, although it does sound hard to forget.
It's the difference between Joe Manchin, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, who has ads showing him metaphorically shooting a bullet into the heart of the cap-and-trade bill, and the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in Arizona, who had herself filmed spraying machine-gun fire all over the place while an announcer said: ''Pamela Gorman -- conservative Christian and a pretty fair shot.'' Even if you don't agree with Manchin's position, you have to admit that Gorman would probably be more difficult to work with.
In New York, Republicans were so full of free-floating rage that they nominated Carl Paladino, a hotheaded developer from Buffalo, for governor. For a while this summer, upstate New York was littered with ''I'm Mad As Hell, Too, Carl!'' lawn signs.
Paladino quickly developed a gender gap the size of the Grand Canyon. A recent Siena College poll showed that 71 percent of female voters preferred his opponent, Andrew Cuomo, while 21 percent supported him, demonstrating yet again that women will not vote for a guy who yells.
The Republican nominee got into fights, promised to ''take out'' one reporter and insulted gays. He trotted out his poor wife, who gave interviews recounting how she had forgiven Carl for fathering a 10-year-old daughter after he broke the news while she was getting ready for their son's funeral.
Cuomo, meanwhile, has not only refrained from yelling, he's barely had to leave his office.
On the rage-o-meter, this week's gubernatorial debate in New York was not quite as stirring as Kentucky's, possibly because it involved seven people, some in alarming get-ups, sitting on uncomfortable chairs in a line. Actually, it looked less like a debate than a tryout for some particularly embarrassing reality show.
Several third-party candidates, including a former Black Panther in a Nehru jacket, were more experienced in the politics of unproductive rage than Paladino. In a late-breaking attempt to change the tone, Paladino announced that he was not actually angry but simply ''passionate.'' Unfortunately, the world will remember his performance only for the part in which he had to run off to go to the bathroom before his concluding remarks.
The person who got the most postdebate attention was Jimmy McMillan of the Rent Is Too Damn High Party. McMillan wore black gloves and had a moustache that wound around his head like a ribbon, and a goatee that looked like two little fuzzy gerbils hanging from his chin. He was very, very, very angry. Particularly about the rents, which he pointed out were too damn high.
Afterward, Sarah Maslin Nir of The Times tracked him down in Brooklyn and discovered that McMillan's own personal rent is, he said, zero. His landlords, he added, are ''like family. They don't want me to pay any money at all. I am basically living rent free.''
Which doesn't mean he can't be ticked off about it.

HEADLINE: Big Legal Clash On Foreclosure Is Taking Shape

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
About a month after Washington Mutual Bank made a multimillion-dollar mortgage loan on a mountain home near Santa Barbara, Calif., a crucial piece of paperwork disappeared.
But bank officials were unperturbed. After conducting a ''due and diligent search,'' an assistant vice president simply drew up an affidavit stating that the paperwork -- a promissory note committing the borrower to repay the mortgage -- could not be found, according to court documents.
The handling of that lost note in 2006 was hardly unusual. Mortgage documents of all sorts were treated in an almost lackadaisical way during the dizzying mortgage lending spree from 2005 through 2007, according to court documents, analysts and interviews.
Now those missing and possibly fraudulent documents are at the center of a potentially seismic legal clash that pits big lenders against homeowners and their advocates concerned that the lenders' rush to foreclose flouts private property rights. 
That clash -- expected to be played out in courtrooms across the country and scrutinized by law enforcement officials investigating possible wrongdoing by big lenders -- leaped to the forefront of the mortgage crisis this week as big lenders began lifting their freezes on foreclosures and insisted the worst was behind them.
Federal officials meeting in Washington on Wednesday indicated that a government review of the problems would not be complete until the end of the year.
In short, the legal disagreement amounts to whether banks can rely on flawed documentation to repossess homes.
While even critics of the big lenders acknowledge that the vast majority of foreclosures involve homeowners who have not paid their mortgages, they argue that the borrowers are entitled to due legal process.
Banks ''have essentially sidestepped 400 years of property law in the United States,'' said Rebel A. Cole, a professor of finance and real estate at DePaul University. ''There are so many questionable aspects to this thing it's scary.''
Others are more sanguine about the dispute.
Joseph R. Mason, a finance professor who holds the Louisiana Bankers Association chair at Louisiana State University, said that concerns about proper foreclosure documentation were overblown. At the end of the day, he said, even if the banks botched the paperwork, homeowners who didn't make their mortgage payments still needed to be held accountable.
''You borrowed money,'' he said. ''You are obligated to repay it.''
After freezing most foreclosures, Bank of America, the largest consumer bank in the country, said this week that it would soon resume foreclosures in about half of the country because it was confident that the cases had been properly documented. GMAC Mortgage said it was also proceeding with foreclosures, on a case-by-case basis.
While some other banks have also suggested they can wrap up faulty foreclosures in a matter of weeks, some judges, lawyers for homeowners and real estate experts like Mr. Cole expect the courts to be inundated with challenges to the banks' actions.
''This is ultimately going to have to be resolved by the 50 state supreme courts who have jurisdiction for property law,'' Professor Cole predicted.
Defaulting homeowners in states like Florida, among the hardest hit by foreclosures, are already showing up in bigger numbers this week to challenge repossessions. And judges in some states have halted or delayed foreclosures because of improper documentation. Court cases are likely to hinge on whether judges believe that banks properly fulfilled their legal obligations during the mortgage boom -- and in the subsequent rush to expedite foreclosures.
The country's mortgage lenders contend that any problems that might be identified are technical and will not change the fact that they have the right to foreclose en masse.
''We did a thorough review of the process, and we found the facts underlying the decision to foreclose have been accurate,'' Barbara J. Desoer, president of Bank of America Home Loans, said earlier this week. ''We paused while we were doing that, and now we're moving forward.''
Some analysts are not sure that banks can proceed so freely. Katherine M. Porter, a visiting law professor at Harvard University and an expert on consumer credit law, said that lenders were wrong to minimize problems with the legal documentation.
''The misbehavior is clear: they lied to the courts,'' she said. ''The fact that they are saying no one was harmed, they are missing the point. They did actual harm to the court system, to the rule of law. We don't say, 'You can perjure yourself on the stand because the jury will come to the right verdict anyway.' That's what they are saying.''
Robert Willens, a tax expert, said that documentation issues had created potentially severe tax problems for investors in mortgage securities and that ''there is enough of a question here that the courts might well have to resolve the issue.''
As the legal system begins sorting through the competing claims, one thing is not in dispute: the pell-mell origination of mortgage loans during the real estate boom and the patchwork of financial machinery and documentation that supported it were created with speed and profits in mind, and with little attention to detail.
Once the foreclosure wheels started turning, said analysts, practices became even shoddier.
For example, the foreclosure business often got so busy at the Plantation, Fla., law offices of David J. Stern -- and so many documents had to be signed so banks could evict people from their homes -- that a supervisor sometimes was too tired to write her own name.
When that happened, Cheryl Samons, the supervisor at the firm, who typically signed about 1,000 documents a day, just let someone else sign for her, court papers show.
''Cheryl would give certain paralegals rights to sign her name, because most of the time she was very tired, exhausted from signing her name numerous times per day,'' said Kelly Scott, a Stern employee, in a deposition that the Florida attorney general released on Monday. A lawyer representing the law firm said Ms. Samons would not comment.
Bill McCollum, Florida's attorney general, is investigating possible abuses at the Stern firm, a major foreclosure mill in the state, involving false or fabricated loan documents, calling into question the foreclosures the firm set in motion on behalf of banks.
That problem extends far beyond Florida.
As lenders and Wall Street firms bundled thousands of mortgage loans into securities so they could be sold quickly, efficiently and lucratively to legions of investors, slipshod practices took hold among lenders and their representatives, former employees of these operations say.
Banks routinely failed to record each link in the chain of documents that demonstrate ownership of a note and a property, according to court documents, analysts and interviews. When problems arose, executives and managers at lenders and loan servicers sometimes patched such holes by issuing affidavits meant to prove control of a mortgage.
In Broward County, Fla., alone, more than 1,700 affidavits were filed in the last two years attesting to lost notes, according to Legalprise, a legal services company that tracks foreclosure data.
When many mortgage loans went bad in the last few years, lenders outsourced crucial tasks like verifying the amount a borrower owed or determining which institution had a right to foreclose.
Now investors who bought mortgage trusts -- investment vehicles composed of mortgages -- are wondering if the loans inside them were recorded properly. If not, tax advantages of the trusts could be wiped out, leaving mortgage securities investors with significant tax bills.
For years, lenders bringing foreclosure cases commonly did not have to demonstrate proof of ownership of the note. Consumer advocates and consumer lawyers have complained about the practice, to little avail.
But a decision in October 2007 by Judge Christopher A. Boyko of the Federal District Court in northern Ohio to toss out 14 foreclosure cases put lenders on notice. Judge Boyko ruled that the entities trying to seize properties had not proved that they actually owned the notes, and he blasted the banks for worrying ''less about jurisdictional requirements and more about maximizing returns.''
He also said that lenders ''seem to adopt the attitude that since they have been doing this for so long, unchallenged, this practice equates with legal compliance.'' Now that their practices were ''put to the test, their weak legal arguments compel the court to stop them at the gate,'' the judge ruled.
Yet aside from the actions of a few random judges, little was done to force lenders to change their practices or slow things down. Since March 2009, more than 300,000 property owners a month have received foreclosure notices or lost their home in a foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosure listings.
What finally prompted a re-examination of the foreclosure wave was the disclosure in court documents over the last several months of so-called robo-signers, employees like Ms. Samons of the Stern law firm in Florida who signed affidavits so quickly that they could not possibly have verified the information in the document under review.
Lenders and their representatives have sought to minimize the significance of robo-signing and, while acknowledging legal lapses in how they documented loans, have argued that foreclosures should proceed anyway. After all, the lenders say, the homeowners owe the money.
People who have worked at loan servicers for many years, who requested anonymity to protect their jobs, said robo-signing and other questionable foreclosure practices emanated from one goal: to increase efficiency and therefore profits. That rush, they say, allowed for the shoddy documentation that is expected to become evidence for homeowners in the coming court battles.
For example, years ago when banks made loans, they typically stored promissory notes in their vaults.
But the advent of securitization, in which loans are bundled and sold to investors, required that loan documents move quickly from one purchaser to another. Big banks servicing these loans began in 2002 to automate their systems, according to a former executive for a top servicer who requested anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.
First to go was the use of actual people to determine who should be liable to a foreclosure action. They were replaced by computers that identified delinquent borrowers and automatically sent them letters saying they were in default. Inexperienced clerical workers often entered incorrect mortgage information into the computer programs, the former executive said, and borrowers rarely caught the errors.
Other record-keeping problems that are likely to become fodder for court battles involve endorsements, a process that occurs when notes are transferred and validated with a stamp to identify the institution that bought it. Eager to cut costs, most institutions left the notes blank, with no endorsements at all.
Problems are also likely to arise in court involving whether those who signed documents required in foreclosures actually had the authority to do so -- or if the documents themselves are even authentic.
For example, Frederick B. Tygart, a circuit court judge overseeing a foreclosure case in Duval County, Fla., recently ruled that agents representing Deutsche Bank relied on documents that ''must have been counterfeited.'' He stopped the foreclosure. Deutsche Bank had no comment on Wednesday.
Cynthia Veintemillas, the lawyer representing the borrower in the case, Patrick Jeffs, said the paperwork surrounding her client's foreclosure was riddled with problems.
''Everybody knows the banks screwed up and loaned out money to people who couldn't pay it back,'' she said. ''Why are people surprised that they don't know what they are doing here either?''
Meanwhile, another judge on Wednesday indicated that the courts would not simply sign off on the banks' documentation. Jonathan Lippman, the chief judge of New York's courts, ordered lawyers to verify the validity of all foreclosure paperwork.
''We cannot allow the courts in New York State to stand by idly and be party to what we now know is a deeply flawed process, especially when that process involves basic human needs -- such as a family home -- during this period of economic crisis,'' Judge Lippman said in a statement.

HEADLINE: As Dollar's Value Falls, Currency Conflicts Rise

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Is this a currency war or what?
Fast-growing nations like Thailand are trying to devalue their exchange rates to bolster their export-driven economies.
In Washington, where ''strong dollar'' has been the mantra for years, policy makers are taking steps that could make the already weak dollar weaker still.
European policy makers worry that a resurgent euro will threaten growth in their own backyard. And the entire world, it seems, is jawboning China to level the playing field and let its undervalued currency, the renminbi, appreciate. It is a step that Beijing, by all accounts, does not want to take.
With so many economies struggling, it suddenly seems as if it is every nation for itself in the currency markets. Policy makers the world over are worried that economic rivals are trying to turn exchange rates to their advantage, and considering how they should respond to preserve jobs and growth at home. 
Even as Washington chides Beijing over the renminbi, critics accuse the United States and other rich nations of waging an international currency war that harks to the protectionist policies of the 1930s, when nations looked out for themselves rather than working together.
''Today, there is a risk that the single chorus that tamed the financial crisis will dissolve into a cacophony of discordant voices, as countries increasingly go it alone,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said during a speech in Shanghai this week. ''This,'' he said, ''will surely make everybody worse off.''
The abrupt decline in the dollar -- by about 10 percent since early June against major currencies -- is upsetting the delicate balance of world economies still recovering from the shocks of the financial crisis.
Many other currencies, especially in Asia and in emerging markets like Brazil, are soaring as a result of the dollar's fall. Those nations' domestic economies are attracting floods of speculative capital seeking higher interest rates and are at risk of overheating.
The dollar's decline is being driven by what everyone in global markets is now expecting: another round of so-called quantitative easing by the United States. In the next few weeks, the Federal Reserve is expected to inject vast sums of money into the economy in another attempt to spur growth.
While such policies may benefit the convalescent United States economy, they are also drawing criticism that Washington is deliberately devaluing the dollar at others' expense.
The dollar had at least a brief uptick on Tuesday, as global investors sought the currency as a haven after China startled the markets by raising interest rates. But its fall resumed on Wednesday, to a 15-year low against the yen, and currencies like Brazil's real -- up more than 12 percent since July against the dollar -- were still lofty.
The tensions underline the startling fact that two years after the peak of the financial crisis, the world is on two tracks economically. Much of the developing world, including countries like China and Brazil, is growing fast, while the industrialized economies of the United States, Japan and much of Europe still struggle.
In Brazil, officials have been especially critical of United States policy. On Sept. 27, its finance minister, Guido Mantega, first described the currency tensions as practically an ''exchange war, a trade war.'' This week, Brazil's central bank governor said that Washington's expected monetary stimulus ''creates serious distortions.''
In deflecting criticism, the United States emphasizes the role of China, an ever-growing power in the global economy. Beijing continues to peg the value of its currency to the dollar, despite an immense accumulation of foreign reserves and a persistent surplus in China's account equal to about 10.5 percent of its annual economic output, a surplus that in standard monetary theory would prompt China to allow its currency to rise.
As a consequence of the link to the dollar, the Chinese renminbi has also declined -- which is one reason that despite the fall in the dollar, the United States trade deficit has continued to widen.
The weakness in the renminbi, just as much as the dollar's decline, has put pressure on economies across the developing world, where a weaker renminbi undercuts their exports, and hence their growth.
''We're in this currency conflict because central banks have had to be pushed into the position of being policy makers of last resort,'' said Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, at a recent I.M.F. forum.
Financial markets expect the Fed to announce at its meeting early next month that it will proceed with more quantitative easing, involving purchases of bonds, which reduces longer-term interest rates and puts further downward pressure on the dollar.
That worries other countries. A stronger United States economy is in everyone's interest, but they fear that investors will flee America's low interest rates and declining dollar and instead pour capital into their markets, overheating their economies and creating the types of asset bubbles in stocks and housing that burst with such devastating effects in the 1990s.
Already there is evidence of this: American investment in overseas stock funds, which was running at about $4 billion a month over the summer, has surged since Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested the possibility of another round of quantitative easing at the end of August. About $19 billion has flowed into these funds since Aug. 1, according to TrimTabs, a funds researcher.
In recent weeks, central banks around the globe, including those of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Israel, Taiwan, Brazil and Japan, have intervened furiously in foreign exchange markets in hopes of weakening their own currencies. But currency speculators, moving just as fast, so far seem to be largely undermining those efforts by selling their dollars and betting that the American currency will continue its decline.
In the Chicago futures markets, one of the principal arenas where traders can take positions against the currency, positions betting on a depreciation of the dollar totaled $32.6 billion in the latest week, close to a record, according to the investment firm Nomura.
Some countries have gone further than merely criticizing the United States, embracing forms of capital controls to reduce incoming short-term investment. Brazil is increasing the tax on money flooding into its bonds. South Korea cited the need to check speculative foreign capital inflows.
Some economists play down the fears of currency battles and see the dollar's movements as a natural readjustment to a weaker economic outlook in the United States. The dollar suffered periodic bouts of weakness before. It strengthened through 2008 but weakened in 2009. More generally, it has been on a longer-term decline since 2002. Some economists think it could recover again soon.
But others worry that that by letting the dollar weaken, Washington may be stoking dangerous inflationary pressures that will have repercussions around the world.
''The United States has an important role in the world economy to maintain stability and confidence in the dollar,'' said John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist and former under secretary for international affairs at Treasury. ''If you lose that, that could be detrimental.''

HEADLINE: A Basket Of Assets In One Investment

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK

 BODY:
AS investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds seem like a perfect fit for retirement portfolios.
The funds, known as E.T.F.'s, are generally relatively low cost and easy to understand. Listed and traded openly on exchanges, E.T.F.'s are baskets that invest in assets as various as global stocks and gold.
Yet picking the right E.T.F. is crucial. Far too many E.T.F.'s are overmarketed and some of the complex funds are loaded with nuances that most investors do not understand. E.T.F.'s can pose an almost irresistible, but risky, temptation to limit your bets to a single industry sector, country or commodity. 
This is a particularly good time to invest in E.T.F.'s because major fund managers and vendors are battling one another to win customers by lowering costs. Brokerage commissions and internal fund management ''expense ratios'' are the major costs of owning E.T.F.'s. By taking advantage of this commission war, investors can increase the net returns on retirement funds.
''If all you did was replicate your entire portfolio with E.T.F.'s, you'd save 1 percent annually on expenses,'' said Tom Lydon, publisher of ETFTrends.com. Most E.T.F.'s are bought and sold through brokers, and, as with other investments, deep discounters typically charge the lowest commissions. Three of the largest sellers of E.T.F.'s, Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard, offer commission-free E.T.F.'s on select groups of in-house funds. Fidelity also provides a break on some iShares funds.
Other funds, if not commission-free, are modestly priced. The Vanguard S.& P. 500 E.T.F. (VOO), for example, charges 0.06 percent annually for fund management -- a significant savings over the 0.10 percent for similar E.T.F.'s and 1.45 percent for a broker-sold index fund like the UBS S.& P. 500 Index (PWSPX) fund (C shares).
With more than 1,000 funds to choose from in a $1 trillion industry, which E.T.F.'s do you add to your portfolio? You can start with the simple principle of diversification. Do you have funds that cover the entire United States stock and bond markets? How about international stocks and bonds?
It is also prudent to consider which risks you want to insulate your retirement portfolio from: market downturns, inflation, currency fluctuation and losing out on opportunities abroad, for example.
An important principle of E.T.F. diversification is to stick with passive portfolios or index funds. The iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond fund (AGG), for example, invests in most of the United States investment-grade bond market for a 0.24 percent expense ratio annually.
The broadest baskets of securities will provide samplings of most markets. The Vanguard Total World Stock Market E.T.F. (VT), for example, invests in 2,900 holdings in 47 countries.
For insulation from the stock and bond markets, consider commodity and natural resource E.T.F.'s, which let investors choose a single-commodity fund, like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which holds gold bullion, or broad baskets like the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), which tracks the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index.
Do not ignore commercial real estate, which is best represented by a basket of real estate investment trusts. These are stocks that invest in properties like shopping malls and office buildings. The FTSE NAREIT Industrial/Office Capped Index Fund (FIO) tracks part of the commercial real estate sector and pays a yield of 4.8 percent.
A fully diversified retirement strategy would include emerging markets. The iShares MSCI Emerging Market fund (EEM), for example, can provide a sampling of markets from Brazil to Taiwan.
Be careful not to concentrate too much in any specialized fund. Piling into a gold or bond fund could be hazardous, especially if you're buying into a bubble.
More sophisticated investment strategies, like leveraged bets that multiply gains and losses or ''shorting'' an industry or basket of securities, also can be pursued using E.T.F.'s. But Michael Iachini, a director in the Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, suggested: ''If you're investing for the long term, keep it simple. A lot of new E.T.F. concepts are geared toward active traders.''
On the other hand, some passive E.T.F.'s do not accurately track daily index moves, a notable problem with commodity E.T.F.'s and inverse E.T.F.'s, which allow you to bet against a commodity -- if the price of oil falls, the value of an inverse E.T.F. would rise. These are not the best vehicles for aggressive day traders or market timers.
Beware, too, of advisers who say they can beat the market with portfolios of E.T.F.'s.
While you can always construct a portfolio on your own, it makes sense to consult a certified financial planner or registered investment adviser to see what your portfolio needs -- and does not need -- before you buy these vehicles. An investment policy statement outlining your objectives is essential. Duplicating what you already have makes no sense.

HEADLINE: Malpractice Methodology

BYLINE: By PETER ORSZAG. 
Peter Orszag, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to 2010 and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, is a contributing columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
The health care legislation that Congress enacted earlier this year, contrary to much of today's overheated rhetoric, does many things right. But it does almost nothing to reform medical malpractice laws. Lawmakers missed an important opportunity to shield from malpractice liability any doctors who followed evidence-based guidelines in treating their patients.
As President Obama noted in his speech to the American Medical Association in June 2009, too many doctors order unnecessary tests and treatments only because they believe it will protect them from a lawsuit. Instead, he said, ''We need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first, let doctors focus on practicing medicine and encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines.'' 
Why does this matter? Right now, health care is more evidence-free than you might think. And even where evidence-based clinical guidelines exist, research suggests that doctors follow them only about half of the time. One estimate suggests that it takes 17 years on average to incorporate new research findings into widespread practice. As a result, any clinical guidelines that exist often have limited impact.
How might we encourage doctors to adopt new evidence more quickly? Malpractice reform could help -- possibly a lot.
The academic literature tends to play down the role of medical liability laws in driving up health care costs. Doctors themselves, however, almost universally state that malpractice statutes lead to extraneous testing and treatment.
It is also conceivable that because such laws usually focus on ''customary practice'' -- that is, a doctor who has treated a patient the way most other doctors in the area would is considered safe from accusations of malpractice -- they create a strong contagion effect among doctors. The laws, no matter how weak or stringent, may therefore explain why doctors in some parts of the country generally adopt much more intensive approaches than those in other areas do.
The traditional way to reform medical malpractice law has been to impose caps on liability -- for example, by limiting punitive damages to something like $500,000. A far better strategy would be to provide safe harbor for doctors who follow evidence-based guidelines. Anyone who could demonstrate that he has followed the recommended course for treating a specific illness or condition could not be held liable.
The health care reform act that Congress passed earlier this year included a modest set of state pilot projects, including one in Oregon that is intended to experiment with this approach. But these pilots are small; the project in Oregon, for example, has only $300,000 in financing.
What's needed is a much more aggressive national effort to protect doctors who follow evidence-based guidelines. That's the only way that malpractice reform could broadly promote the adoption of best practices.
Congress has taken a step in this direction before. As Prof. James Blumstein of Vanderbilt University Law School has pointed out, a little-known provision in the Social Security Act amendments of 1972 provides immunity from malpractice liability to doctors who treat patients in conformity with the standards set forth by so-called quality improvement organizations -- nonprofits under contract with Medicare that work to improve care. The provision remains in force, though those organizations have yet to set such standards.
Organizations like the American Medical Association and the Institute of Medicine could also be called upon to issue the needed evidence-based standards for malpractice immunity. But no matter which body is put in charge of certification, this approach to reform will require larger investments in research into what works and what doesn't. Fortunately, both the health care reform act and the 2009 economic stimulus act provided additional financing for such comparative effectiveness medical research, and the health care act provides for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate the work. It's a good start.
Better technology would help, too. Your doctor's computer should be able to not only pull up your health records (after you have approved such access) but also quickly suggest best-practice methods of treatment. The doctor should then be able to click through to read the supporting research. Subsidies in the stimulus act help doctors pay for this kind of technology.
A final step toward improving standard medical practice will be to better align financial incentives for delivering higher-quality care. Hospitals now lose Medicare dollars, for example, if they succeed in reducing readmissions. Medical professionals should be given incentives for better care rather than more care.
The health care reform act already includes measures that enable policymakers to shift Medicare's payments toward ''fee for quality'' rather than ''fee for service.'' My next column will discuss these measures, which get far less credit than they should, in more detail.
Opponents of the act are generally off base in criticizing investments in improved care. In complaining about the missed opportunity to reform medical malpractice laws to promote evidence-based medical practice, on the other hand, the critics are entirely on target.

HEADLINE: Keynes Who? Europe Avoids His Approach

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British economist John Maynard Keynes may live on in popular legend as the world's most influential economist. But in much of Europe, and most acutely here in the land of his birth, his view that deficit spending by governments is crucial to avoiding a long recession has lately been willfully ignored.
In Britain, George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, delivered a speech on Wednesday that would have made Keynes -- who himself worked in the British Treasury -- blanch.
He argued forcefully that Britons, despite slowing growth and negligible bank lending, must accept a rise in the retirement age to 66 from 65 and $130 billion in spending cuts that would eliminate nearly 500,000 public sector jobs and hit pensioners, the poor, the military and the middle class because of what he insisted was the overwhelming need to reduce the country's huge budget deficit. 
In Ireland, where the economy is suffering through its third consecutive year of economic slump, Keynes is doing no better. Devastated by a historic property crash and banking bust, the Irish government is preparing another round of spending cuts and tax increases.
Combined with what Dublin has already imposed, the cuts could add up to as much as 14 percent of Ireland's gross domestic product, an extraordinary amount for a modern industrial country. Ireland's budget deficit reached 32 percent of total economic output this year.
Indeed, across Europe, where the threat of a double-dip recession remains palpable, governments from Germany to Greece are slashing public outlays. But even as students and workers in France clash with the police and block fuel shipments to protest a rise in the retirement age, the debate in Europe is more on how fast to cut government spending rather than whether such reductions are the right thing to do under the circumstances.
''Everything Keynes established about the primacy of maintaining demand at a steady pace is gone,'' Brad DeLong, a liberal economist and blogger at the University of California, Berkeley, said mournfully.
''Europe obviously thinks it can focus on sound finances while the U.S. manages world demand,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''but unfortunately we are not doing that.''
Joseph E. Stiglitz argued that the British government's plan was ''a gamble with almost no potential upside'' and that it would lead to lower growth, lower demand, lower tax revenues, a deterioration of skills among the unemployed and an even higher national debt.
''We cannot afford austerity,'' he wrote in The Guardian.
Mr. DeLong and others on the left have long argued for more stimulus spending in the United States and abroad to lift growth, even if deficits rise temporarily as a consequence.
While that notion may have its adherents in the White House and among many American and European academics, in Europe there is hardly a policy maker to be found who is making the argument that governments need to spend more, not less.
This is particularly true in Britain, where a combination of collapsing tax revenues and government spending to prop up banks and support the unemployed during the financial crisis has contributed to a budget deficit equal to 11 percent of gross domestic product, second highest in Europe after Ireland.
''Keynsians are regarded here as heterodox, not orthodox,'' said Andrew Lilico, an economist at the London-based research institute Policy Exchange, which has close intellectual ties to the Conservative Party. ''And it goes back to one thing: we have this internal fear of losing control of our deficits and having foreigners telling us what to do. There is also a sense that deficits of this scale are morally lax.''
The stiff upper lip with which Mr. Osborne delivered his call for sacrifice on Wednesday in the House of Commons reinforces that point. It is grounded in memory of Britain's economic collapse in the 1970s, when the International Monetary Fund had to come to the rescue just as it has done recently in Greece.
Even the previous Labour government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed substantial budget cuts before losing office in May, many of them incorporated by Mr. Osborne into his four-year spending plan.
''There is nothing fair in running huge deficits that we are not prepared to repay,'' Mr. Osborne said in his speech, responding to arguments that cuts would fall hardest on the country's poorest.
It is this institutional memory -- combined with the widely accepted view that bond market demands to follow through on promised austerity plans cannot be ignored -- that underpins not only Mr. Osborne's approach but also that of his European peers.
That contrasts sharply with the United States, where White House policy makers are urging caution in reducing deficits too quickly, fearing that ending stimulus efforts before the economy is clearly on the road to recovery risks making a mistake similar to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's budget cutting in the middle of the Great Depression, which extended the downturn.
''In the U.S., central bank memory is ingrained in the Depression, while in the U.K. it is being bailed out by the I.M.F.,'' said Michael Saunders, an economist with Citigroup in London. ''That gives policy makers different sets of priorities.''
To be sure, the prospect of the once munificent British state sharply cutting benefits for children of middle-class families, making students pay much more for their schooling and cutting jobs and the pay of public sector workers has led to a backlash from the country's labor unions.
''Today, the fight begins,'' David Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, the country's largest union, exhorted participants at a rally on Tuesday. ''Hands off our public services.''
Mr. Prentis, whose union represents public sector workers, received plenty of support from the conference hall where 2,000 union activists congregated.
But the number attending was small and the restrained action stands in contrast to the large protests and spasms of street unrest in Greece, Spain and, most recently, in France, where strikers have cut into train and subway service and truckers and others have blocked refineries and fuel depots in a bid to cripple the transportation network.
And outside the hall, the scattered calls by union stalwarts -- many bused in from cities like Bristol and Liverpool -- were relatively lackluster.
''Come on,'' shouted one union organizer to a silent gathering of placard bearers. ''What happened to your chanting?''
For the British public, of course, the austerity now being experienced in countries like Ireland, Greece and Lithuania has yet to hit home.
In Britain, and throughout the rest of Europe, policy makers hope that by the time it does, a private sector recovery will be well under way, helping to compensate for the tighter government budgets. If not, however, they may be tempted to call upon the spirit of Keynes after all.

HEADLINE: A Day After China's Jolt, Shares Bounce Back

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Susanne Craig and Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street regained ground on Wednesday as new earnings reports helped lift the mood of investors.
Major indexes in the United States closed sharply lower on Tuesday after a surprise announcement by China's central bank that it would raise interest rates for the first time in nearly three years. 
Adrian Cronje, chief investment officer of the firm Balentine, said investors had digested the move as something of a step in the right direction.
''I think initially markets misread what is going on in China as a potentially bearish sign for the global economy,'' he said. ''That was the opposite.''
Investors are turning their attention to whether the Federal Reserve will begin buying long-term assets like Treasury bonds to lower long-term interest rates. The Fed's policy-making arm next meets Nov. 2-3.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 129.35 points, or 1.18 percent, to 11,107.97, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 20.44 points, or 0.84 percent, to 2,457.39. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 12.27 points, or 1.05 percent, at 1,178.17.
On Wednesday, the Fed released its monthly survey known as the beige book, in which it said that national economic activity continued to rise in September and early October, but at a modest pace, and that some areas, including housing, construction and jobs, remained weak.
Economists said the report did not change expectations that the Fed would decide on further stimulus.
Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA, said that based on the survey, the argument for a new round of quantitative easing ''remains in place, as the economy is seen to be only modestly expanding.''
Several banks released third-quarter results on Wednesday. Wells Fargo said its earnings rose 7 percent, topping analyst estimates with a record $3.3 billion profit in the quarter, although revenue fell to $20.9 billion. Wells Fargo shares rose about 4 percent, to $25.60. Morgan Stanley reported profit from continuing operations of 5 cents a share, below expectations. Its shares fell 1 cent, to $25.38.
Delta Air Lines reported profits for the third quarter that beat analyst expectations, helped by rising fares. Its shares gained more than 10 percent, to $12.97.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1/32, to 101 8/32. The yield was unchanged at 2.48 percent.

HEADLINE: Careful Approach Works for Wells Fargo, as Earnings Rise 7%

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Within weeks of scooping up the failed banking operations of Washington Mutual in late 2008, JPMorgan Chase began phasing out the WaMu brand, replacing signs on retail branches. WaMu accounts became Chase accounts. Just over a year later, the conversion was done, turning the WaMu name into a relic of the financial crisis.
Wells Fargo agreed to buy the troubled Wachovia Corporation only two weeks after Chase-WaMu deal, and yet the bank's executives here seem content to move eastward at the pace of their trademark stagecoach. Only 488 of Wachovia's 3,300 branches have been converted so far, and not much more will change in big East Coast markets like Florida, New York and North Carolina until sometime next year. 
As Wells Fargo emerges as a national giant, its slow-go approach comes in stark contrast to its rivals. And it is not the only way the bank stands out.
On Wednesday, Wells Fargo topped analysts' estimates with earnings of $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 7 percent from the same period a year ago, largely on the strength of bread-and-butter deposit growth and mortgage refinancings instead of high-octane Wall Street trading.
Revenue fell 7 percent, to $20.9 billion. Despite a surge of refinancings because of ultralow interest rates, lending declined nearly 6 percent as fewer consumers sought credit.
Even though Wells Fargo is the nation's biggest lender to consumers, its losses on bad loans have been lower than the rest of the industry. Wells Fargo officials attribute that divide to prudent lending standards -- like requiring higher down payments -- and being quicker to restructure problem loans from the start.
And while it services mortgages for one in six Americans, Wells Fargo officials insist they have sidestepped many of the documentation problems that infected the industry. Wells Fargo is so confident in its practices and controls that it has said it does not need to halt foreclosures, as other banks have.
These distinctions have not been rewarded by the market, however. Wells Fargo's stock price has fallen more than 15 percent over the last year, while the KBW Bank index, a popular barometer of the sector, has essentially held steady.
At a time when its rivals are betting on faster-growing overseas markets, some investors question why they should bet on a company so firmly entrenched in the United States.
''Investors are concerned about the direction of the U.S. economy and that there is no growth in U.S. lending,'' said Frederick Cannon, the chief stock analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
In an interview at Wells Fargo's headquarters, the chief executive, John G. Stumpf, described the company's domestic focus as a strength. As an example, he pointed to the bank's emphasis on selling simple mortgages instead of the kinds of exotic, anything-goes products that got so many banks into trouble.
Selective lending might have cost Wells Fargo some growth during the housing boom, but now it seems to be paying off: Its combined foreclosure and delinquency rate is about 8.15 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for the rest of the industry, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.
''We let our numbers speak for themselves,'' Mr. Stumpf said. ''We are more of a Main Street bank than a Wall Street bank.''
As questions swirl over the industry's foreclosure practices, Wells Fargo officials dismiss concerns that the bank systematically engaged in so-called robo-signing, where a single employee would sign thousands of loan documents without verifying their contents, as the law requires.
But revelations in an obscure Florida lawsuit have raised concerns about whether that process was always followed. Under questioning, Xee Moua, a Wells Fargo manager, said she would sign off on as many as 500 foreclosure files a day without verifying the accuracy of their contents. ''We don't go into the details with these affidavits,'' she said in a deposition.
Oscar Suris, a Wells Fargo spokesman, called Ms. Moua's testimony ''one isolated case'' that is being disputed in the courts. ''When we find errors, we fix them,'' he added.
Perhaps more worrisome is that Wells Fargo may have to buy back bad loans from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors. Here, too, Wells Fargo may have more cover than its competitors.
Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, estimates that Wells Fargo may be forced to absorb about $2 billion in losses from loan repurchases. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, by his calculations, could each face close to $9 billion in such losses. The amount of money each bank has set aside for such expenses is roughly consistent with that variation.
Wells Fargo will need to deepen its relationships with its existing customers if the Wachovia deal is to succeed. With Wachovia, it nearly doubled its size, and it is now near the federal cap of 10 percent of the nation's deposits.
So it is investing in the branches it inherited from Wachovia, adding sales people at many of them. ''They simply didn't have as many sales people per market as we had,'' said Howard I. Atkins, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer.
The result is that in markets where staff was added, the sale of products to existing customers has climbed by about 4.5 percent.
Mr. Stumpf says he sees potential in encouraging the roughly 15,000 brokers in a greatly expanded wealth management unit to sell their clients checking accounts and mortgages, while urging its 30,000 branch workers to steer their customers to Wells brokers for investment advice. ''We have a lot of opportunity in the United States,'' Mr. Stumpf said.
Online Correction: October 20, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated Wells Fargo's profit for the third quarter. It is $3.3 billion, not $3.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Stoked for an Old-Style Soak

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
MARTY PICCO, a 51-year-old software developer in Santa Cruz, Calif., does not seem like a back-to-the-land type. He has an iPhone, an iPad, two MacBooks, two desktop computers, a digital single-lens reflex camera and a plasma television. But when he bought a hot tub, he went for the lowest-tech model around.
Mr. Picco and his wife, Liz, 56, bought a red cedar tub that relies on a wood-fired stove to heat its water, an unusually primitive apparatus in an age of electric fiberglass spas outfitted with hydrotherapy jets, air blowers and underwater lights. The cedar tub, six feet in diameter, seemed to fit better with their home, a mid-19th-century redwood farmhouse, especially when he placed the tub outside in a nest of beargrass and wild sweet peas. But there was more to his choice than that.
''It's fun, like a ritual that you plan hours in advance,'' Mr. Picco said about his simple tub, which he bought a few years ago. ''You chop the wood, get the firebox going and get really good at managing the fire to keep the water in a narrow range of 104 to 106 degrees. You have a real outdoor experience, as opposed to a Las Vegas experience.'' 
By all accounts, rustic wood-fired hot tubs constitute a tiny niche of the broad hot-tub market. Their most prominent manufacturer, Snorkel Hot Tubs in Seattle, estimates that it has sold a total of 15,000 tubs, a mere drop compared with the 6.3 million conventional hot tubs installed in the United States, according to the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals in Alexandria, Va.
But the recession sent sales of conventional hot tubs plummeting more than 60 percent from 2005 to 2009, according to P. K. Data, a market research firm. At the same time, wood-fired versions have begun to acquire a certain cachet, with people valuing them for reasons of thrift, environmentalism or, like Mr. Picco, a personal desire to slow down and commune with nature.
Precise sales figures are hard to find because sellers of wood-fired hot tubs operate independently of mainstream industry associations. But Tom Slater, the owner of Snorkel Hot Tubs, said that while the recession dampened his sales last year, they have ''picked up dramatically'' since then. ''There seems to be a lot of renewed interest,'' he said, citing the same ''earthy essence'' quality of the tubs that attracted Mr. Picco.
Similarly, Doug Brubaker, the owner of Forest Lumber and Cooperage, a business in Sooke, British Columbia, that sells various kinds of hot tubs, said orders for the wood-heated kinds have risen from 30 percent of sales to 50 percent since 2006. Dan Jung, who sells 1,000 hot tubs a year at Northern Lights Cedar Tubs in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said wood-burning tubs had risen from 5 percent to 10 percent of his sales. And there are new sellers, too: a Chinese venture called Richy (Foshan) Trading, which started making the tubs in 2008 and has already sold 100 this year, compared with 80 in 2009.
Attractive prices may be helping to propel these gains. The cost of wood-fired hot tubs hovers around $3,000; Mr. Slater's models, for example, range from $2,300 to $4,100. But electric tubs with jets and enough room for five to seven people typically cost $3,000 to $7,000 -- or much higher, depending on the features added. As for operating costs, the electric variety can typically reach around $350 a year, according to the pool and spa association, while wood-burning tubs cost little or even nothing for owners who use their own wood.
''Economics is certainly a reason why someone chooses them,'' Mr. Jung said. ''They have no operating costs other than wood, and a cord of wood, at around $150, could last years.''
THE modern wood-fired hot tub was developed in 1979. In the previous decade, regular hot tubs had become a wink-wink symbol of debauchery, but there was nothing lascivious about this woodsy new entry.
Roger Evans, 29, an engineering student at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, had a cabin in the Talkeetna Mountains where the only bathing option was to jump into a frigid stream. Eager for the occasional hot bath there, he tinkered in his university's welding room and developed an aluminum firebox that could be immersed directly into a vat of water. Its high heat-conduction properties efficiently fired up the water, and the metal resisted rusting and corrosion. Mr. Evans dubbed his invention the Snorkel stove and soon sold several hundred a year through advertisements in magazines like Mother Earth News and Popular Science.
Mr. Evans's company, Snorkel Hot Tubs, is now owned by Mr. Slater, and a handful of other firms also make tubs with submersible fireboxes. Other varieties of wood-fired hot tubs have arrived on the market as well. The Chofu heater from Japan, a wood-fired device that sits outside a tub and uses a ''thermosiphoning'' system to heat the water within, is rigged up to agricultural stock tanks for do-it-yourself hot tubs that cost less than $1,000, as well as to traditional handmade Japanese tubs.
And there is the Dutchtub, a portable soaking tub that looks like a giant cereal bowl with an attached heating coil for burning wood. Seventy of the distinctively modern Dutchtubs, which cost around $6,000, have been sold in the United States.
While some wood-fired hot tubs are installed in urban areas -- Dutchtubs, in particular, have landed in backyards in Brooklyn; Oakland, Calif.; Los Angeles; Austin; and Montreal -- they may be best suited to those with easy access to plentiful wood, like Frank Rudy Schaeffer, 58, a fifth-grade teacher from Cambridge, Mass.
The Schaeffer family's second home is set on 17 forested acres in Phillipston, Mass., 65 miles west of Boston, and he bought his first wood-fired hot tub for that property in 1987, based on a magazine ad.
''I got it sight unseen, just knowing it was going to be a great pleasure,'' he said. After years of steady use, he upgraded to the latest model of Snorkel hot tub last spring. Unlike conventional hot tubs, his has virtually no operating costs, he said. ''I have my own water and my own wood,'' said Mr. Schaeffer, whose tub sits on a fir deck overlooking a trout stream. Besides the low-to-no operating cost, he said, ''the power can go out and I don't care.''
Many owners of wood-fired tubs also point out that they do not burn fossil fuels or pour sanitizing chemicals in their water. Generally, they explain, the water in wood-burning tubs is used for a short time and then drained, while in conventional spas the water remains for months. Moreover, they say, the water in conventional tubs is usually kept continuously warm -- a practice they liken to keeping a car idling in the garage in case someone might want to go for a drive.
But others say wood-fired tubs are not all that green. Although wood is a renewable resource, its smoke does contribute to air pollution. And Kirstin Pires, a spokeswoman for the pool and spa association, noted that conventional tubs had become far more energy efficient because of consumer demand and new public standards, like those mandated by the California Energy Commission in 2006.
The owners of wood-fired hot tubs also concede that they are deprived of one of the chief pleasures of a conventional tub: spontaneity.
''Sometimes I come home from work and it's the kind of wet, bone cold you get here, and I want to take a hot tub, but by the time I get the fire going, it'll be too late and I'll want to go to bed,'' Mr. Picco admitted. ''In those situations, it would be nice if it was just hot.''
But others relish the ritual. Charles von Simson, 42, a lawyer who lives in Buffalo, bought a Dutchtub four years ago for his family's weekend home in the Finger Lakes region. He thoroughly enjoys what he calls his twice-yearly ''wood cut production'' -- chopping a couple of wheelbarrows' worth of logs, cutting them into six-inch discs with a chain saw, and splitting those chunks into smaller pieces with an ax.
''You have to be somebody who likes the process,'' Mr. von Simson said.
Bruce and Judy Tarin certainly fit that description. The couple had wanted a wood-burning hot tub for years, but did not buy one until they retired from their jobs -- he as a social worker and she as a casino worker -- and believed that they had time to enjoy it.
When the $3,000 Snorkel tub arrived at their home in Port Elizabeth, N.J., last December, they planted it in their yard facing the placid Manumuskin Creek and quickly incorporated it into their daily routine. Mr. Tarin, 60, would wake at dawn, light kindling and a log in the firebox, read the newspaper and go for a run. By the time he returned, the water in the cinnamon-colored cedar tub was toasty enough for a morning soak. The total cost for using it throughout last winter was $50, for one-third of a cord of wood.
On a bright Monday earlier this month with a trace of autumn chill in the air, the two prepared the hot tub for an early-season dip. Smoke curled out of the stovepipe and the air was suffused with a rich cedar perfume. Mr. Tarin shifted a log in the firebox and peered at the water thermometer.
''Ninety degrees,'' he announced. ''Almost there.''
''It just seems so natural,'' said Mrs. Tarin, 64. '' 'Hot tub' sounds like something electric with jets, so we tell people this is our 'Japanese soaking tub.' ''
Mr. Tarin stirred the tub with an orange kayak paddle to even the temperature throughout. ''This,'' he said, gesturing at the paddle, ''is the only jet we need.''

HEADLINE: A Club to Discuss Discreetly the Issues of Wealth

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
IN 2003, Mark Kress was having money troubles.
Not a lack of money. Mr. Kress had amassed an eight-figure fortune from products and programs he marketed through the television shopping network QVC and from Spencer Forrest Inc., a maker of treatments for thinning hair that he founded in 1981.
His problem, he said, was that ''I had issues surrounding wealth, many of which I couldn't discuss even with my best friends,'' adding: ''If I turned to a friend and said, 'I have X dollars but I don't feel like I have enough,' my friend might consider it bragging.'' In particular, Mr. Kress wanted ''to get a better understanding of the principles of investing and be exposed to investment opportunities.''
Then he read a news article about something called Tiger 21. 
Tiger 21 -- the acronym stands for The Investment Group for Enhanced Returns in the 21st Century -- is for the person who has everything except someone to discuss it with. At daylong meetings each month in six United States cities, about a dozen superwealthy people at each location ponder their money, how to manage it, how to give it away, how much to hand to their offspring and the personal problems their fortunes can create.
''We all learn from each other; that's the magic of this place,'' said Ronald Bruder, a member of one of the seven New York City groups and a serial entrepreneur who has started or revamped companies specializing in real estate, environmental engineering, oil drilling, medical devices and travel.
The organization was co-founded in 1999 by Michael Sonnenfeldt, a New York City entrepreneur who had sold his real estate business and wanted to invest the proceeds ''in a responsible and effective way,'' as he put it. He modeled his creation after a peer-to-peer learning group of chief executives to which he had belonged. Five more chapters are expected to start by next year, with three others on the drawing boards.
Membership is highly selective. Originally, people needed at least $10 million in investable assets. Mr. Sonnenfeldt said there was no longer an official minimum, but he pointed out that the 140 members collectively had $10 billion and they had to be able to afford the $30,000 annual fee.
Mere dollars are not enough, however. ''They have to have been a wealth creator or a good steward,'' said Harley Frank, the director of membership, one of eight full-time employees. If they inherited a fortune or won the lottery, they must have built on that base.
That was apparently the case with Gregory T. Rogers, who began his career in the 1980s at Rogerscasey, the investment consulting firm started by his father. The younger Mr. Rogers pointed out that he left Rogerscasey and founded or co-founded three asset management and consulting businesses before joining Tiger in 2005.
Nearly two-thirds of Tiger members are entrepreneurs. In rare cases, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, ''someone with deep experience in a field like politics or science or philanthropy'' might get in with a slightly skimpier cash cushion.
Prospects are screened by Mr. Frank and other staff members and by the leader of the local group they are most likely to join. Applicants then attend a meeting for a few hours, on a trial basis. Perhaps the toughest part, for these ambitious, successful strivers is that ''they have to check their ego at the door,'' as members repeatedly say.
While would-be Tigers need not be referred by current members, it helps. Only about 40 percent of the applicants are ultimately accepted. According to Mr. Sonnenfeldt, almost 10 percent are women and 5 to 10 percent are part of racial minorities. Ages range from the mid-30s to mid-80s, with an average in the mid-to-late 50s.
True to the full name, the meetings focus on finance. People bring up investment ideas, and money managers pitch their products. The highlight is the ''portfolio defense,'' a one-hour grilling during which a member analyzes his holdings almost to the penny.
For many people, that frankness is not easy. ''It's like going in front of a doctor and baring all,'' Mr. Bruder said. During his first time up, he was challenged about his conservative approach, including a heavy allocation to fixed income.
''I didn't feel attacked,'' he said. ''They're asking 'why,' but they're supportive.'' Anyway, he added, everyone will be in the hot seat at some point.
Although he did not drastically change his investment strategy, Mr. Bruder said he had picked up valuable advice from the discussions. Thanks to Tiger, he now has a ''serious'' portion of his assets (he will not say how much) in foreign currencies.
Similarly, Mr. Sonnenfeldt was inspired to start investing in gold, and Mr. Rogers increased his spending on marketing for one of his companies, Raylor Investments, which manages about $25 million of his own and outside money.
On the other hand, knowledgeable investors can sometimes have bad ideas. Mr. Kress recalled that at his inaugural portfolio defense, in 2003, when a large portion of his net worth was in his own privately held business, ''I got strong advice to sell all or part of the company. They said I could sell off and put the proceeds in the stock market.'' He declined to follow the suggestion, which turned out to be wise. Since then, he said, his own company has tripled in value, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after a slow climb and abrupt tumble, is only slightly above where it began.
''To them at the time, it wasn't bad advice,'' he said. ''It was interesting to hear.''
Finance encompasses only about two-thirds of the meetings. During the opening hour or two, when each member gets five minutes for a ''world update,'' personal issues are as likely to be updated as portfolios -- divorces, aging parents, health issues, home projects, vacations, philanthropy and most of all, the children.
The No. 1 subject: ''What's an appropriate amount to give? How do you enable your children to maintain the values you consider important and also let them live the lifestyle you're accustomed to?'' Mr. Bruder said.
In his case, he said, his Tiger group ''helped me make decisions about what to fund and not fund'' when his grown daughter wanted to start some business ventures.
Many participants are now putting into charitable ventures the energy, time and networking resources they once devoted to money-making. In 2004, Mr. Bruder started the Education for Employment Foundation, which works with local businesses and governments in the Middle East and North Africa to create training programs.
The outside speakers who come to every meeting have included hedge fund managers, the television celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz and the actor Robert Duvall, who was pitching a movie venture to the Los Angeles group, according to Mr. Kress.
The meetings are led by a professional facilitator who usually calls on people to speak. Typically, they sit around a table in the conference room of a four- or five-star hotel, continuing through breakfast and lunch.
Tigers have been known to cry. Even to hug. But, Mr. Bruder emphasized, ''It doesn't get all that emotional. The facilitator moves it along quickly.''
The bonds can grow into friendships. Members have traveled together and even bought homes next door to each other.
Not everyone fits in. ''We have counseled out two or three members for behavior inconsistent with the norms,'' like being disruptive or threatening to break the promise of confidentiality, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said.
The most serious -- but rare -- grumbling comes from those who ''have very unrealistic expectations,'' Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. ''They think they're going to earn twice as much money in the first six months.''
Complaints aside, the organization is growing. By next year it expects to have branches in four Canadian cities and in Washington. Further off are plans for Chicago and a second group each in Los Angeles and Texas.
That might seem like a sign that the economy is improving, but Mr. Sonnenfeldt said it was just the opposite.
During the economic downturn, ''high-net-worth individuals were exposed to risks that they found they didn't understand,'' he said. ''They're feeling adrift, and they're looking for research.''

HEADLINE: One-Note Tax Debate

 BODY:
Several tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of the year, which means that the lame-duck Congress will face several tough decisions come November. To hear campaigning lawmakers tell it, however, the only tax issue out there is whether to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich. The debate and the work can't end there. 
Voters need to hear more about where their representatives stand on extending far more equitable, and economically sound, Obama-era tax cuts. Those cuts -- part of the 2009 stimulus law so reviled by the Republican Party -- are targeted on low- and middle-income Americans, constituencies all politicians vow to defend until it actually comes to doing it.
Consider the ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit. It has cut taxes by as much as $800 a year for couples making up to $150,000 and $400 annually for single taxpayers making up to $75,000. The extra cash has been delivered through reduced withholdings in each paycheck. Its objective is to temporarily support incomes in a downturn so there is no reason to permanently extend it. With the economy still in tough shape, a one-year extension makes sense.
Other Obama tax cuts due to expire include expanded tax credits for millions of low-income working families. Under the 2009 law, a family with two children and a single parent working full time at the minimum wage qualifies for annual child tax credits of $1,725. If that credit expires, the family would receive $248.
Current law also ensures that low-income working couples who are married keep more of their earned income credits, which help to ensure that employed people do not fall below the poverty line. Both of these credits foster work and stability and should be permanently extended.
President Obama's budget calls for making the bolstered credits permanent along with the Bush middle-class tax cuts. The Republicans insist that all of the Bush tax cuts be extended permanently -- including those for taxpayers making more than $250,000 a year -- but don't mention keeping the improved low-income tax credits.
The 10-year cost of the expanded low-income credits would be roughly $90 billion; extending the Bush middle-class tax cuts would cost $2.9 trillion. Extending the high-end Bush tax cuts would add another $700 billion, an unaffordable and unnecessary giveaway in the face of deep deficits.
The country needs a full debate on all the pending tax decisions -- the benefits and costs of each. If the politicians keep talking solely about tax cuts for the rich, whether for or against, everyone will be shortchanged.

HEADLINE: Fear and Loathing in Nevada

 BODY:
Sharron Angle did not show up at the huge Tea Party Express rally in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. She rarely makes public appearances anymore. But the event was almost entirely in support of her and the divisive, anti-immigrant platform she has promoted in her accelerating drive to replace Senator Harry Reid.
There was a folk song praising Arizona for its immigrant crackdown, and the featured speaker was Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who marches illegal immigrants through the streets of Phoenix to tent jails in the broiling desert. 
Ms. Angle said last week that every state should have a sheriff like Mr. Arpaio, and he returned the compliment, in his own particular, chilling way. ''You guys have got a desert here,'' he told the cheering, foot-stomping crowd. ''Why don't you put up some tents?'' The laughter of his audience of about 2,000 people, most wearing free Angle T-shirts or buttons, practically shook the walls of Stoney's Rockin' Country nightclub, where hand-held signs proclaimed Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, a traitor, a socialist and garbage.
Mr. Reid's campaign had once looked forward to running against Ms. Angle, figuring that her extreme positions would quickly marginalize her in the minds of voters. But he somehow failed to recognize just how attractive those positions would be in a state with the nation's highest unemployment rate and highest rates of foreclosure and bankruptcy. And he was lifeless in last week's debate instead of making the forceful, animated challenge to Ms. Angle's radicalism that might have motivated his supporters.
Now she is favored in the year's most high-profile Senate race. Unless Mr. Reid can muster a huge turnout, there is a strong chance that Ms. Angle will become a United States senator, and she will have done so largely by exploiting fears of illegal Hispanic immigrants in an economically nervous state. One of her television ads, which calls Harry Reid ''the best friend illegals have ever had,'' shows dark-skinned characters sneaking along a border fence, juxtaposed with a Mexican flag.
In a particularly preposterous bit of spin, she told a group of Hispanic students a few days ago, when she did not realize she was being recorded, that those people were not necessarily Hispanic. They might have been coming through the Canadian border, she said, calling it ''the most porous border that we have'' and adding that that is ''where the terrorists came through.'' (The Canadian ambassador immediately protested this nonsense.) For a candidate who famously told Mr. Reid to ''man up'' at the debate, she should at least take responsibility for her own sneering innuendo.
She is, however, willing to persist in her illusion that Social Security can be fixed only by turning it over to private accounts, a toxic position with older voters that many of her fellow Tea Party candidates pretend they haven't considered. And she has gone much further than even Christine O'Donnell, the Republican candidate for United States Senate in Delaware, in repudiating the need for separation of church and state. That doctrine, Ms. Angle has said, is ''unconstitutional''; she prefers to give religion an expansive position in public life.
Mr. Reid, who is far more comfortable maneuvering compromises through the back rooms of the Senate than campaigning among actual voters, lost his best chance to skewer his opponent's positions in the debate. Those voters who did not know about his efforts to save jobs in Nevada, or his proposals for using tax incentives to create even more, still don't.
He might have laughed at her assertion that the nascent health care law is responsible for persistent joblessness, or demanded to know her alternative plan for covering the millions of uninsured. Instead of saying he would leave it to ''the experts'' to decide what to do about tax cuts for the wealthy, he should have clearly explained to voters how important it is to the nation's long-term future to raise taxes on families making more than $250,000.
Many Nevadans may not like their choices, but they have a clear one. They can show that they will not cave in to the politics of division and fear.

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Report Raises Concerns About Racism Within Tea Party Groups

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
The nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization released a report Wednesday declaring that the Tea Party is ''permeated with concerns about race,'' an assessment that is likely to reignite a feud between the two groups.
The report released by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People argues that Tea Party groups ''have given platform to anti-Semites, racists and bigots,'' and have attracted white nationalists looking for recruits. 
''The Tea Party movement has unleashed a still inchoate political movement who are in their numerical majority, angry middle-class white people who believe their country, their nation, has been taken from them,'' it says.
The study was written by Devin Burghart and Leonard Zeskind of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, which is dedicated to examining and mobilizing against racist, anti-Semitic and far-right social movements. It analyzed what it calls six nationwide Tea Party networks at the core of the movement, and concludes that leaders of all but one -- FreedomWorks, a libertarian group in Washington headed by Dick Armey, a former House Republican majority leader -- have raised questions about the validity of President Obama's birth certificate.
Most of the groups the report focuses on are better described as social media networks that predate the Tea Party movement but have become popular among Tea Party activists, among other conservatives. In fact, the movement is not centralized -- the core of it remains local Tea Party and 9/12 groups, which are harder to analyze because of their diffuse nature. The report explicitly notes that it did not make an effort to examine these groups.
And a foreword from the N.A.A.C.P. president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, notes that the vast majority of Tea Party supporters ''are sincere, principled people of good will.''
But the report also points to signs at Tea Party rallies with explicitly racist or racially charged language. It notes that several black congressmen accused Tea Party supporters of shouting racial epithets at them during a rally against health care legislation on Capitol Hill in March. Mr. Jealous called on Tea Party leaders to repudiate this kind of racism, as well as ties to white supremacist groups and ''birthers'' within the ranks of the movement.
When the N.A.A.C.P. passed a resolution at its convention in July calling on Tea Party leaders to condemn people who use blatantly racist language, several leaders reacted angrily, saying there was no proof that the incidents outside the Capitol had occurred. And they have long said that they do not harbor racists.
Still, the N.A.A.C.P. report notes that Tea Party leaders have expelled some people accused of making racist remarks -- a move it calls ''welcome first steps.''
In an interview, Mr. Jealous described the Tea Party as two groups coming together: one made up of people genuinely concerned with promoting smaller government and fiscal conservatism, the other made up of people with roots in militia and anti-immigrant groups that have existed since the 1990s.
''They have a real opportunity as the first major political formation of the 21st century to say, We embrace the 21st century and its diversity and complexity, and we're here to talk about the issues, not to fixate on old discredited biases,'' he said.
Several polls have shown that blacks and Hispanics are not represented in the Tea Party movement according to their proportion in the general population.
Adam Brandon, a spokesman for FreedomWorks, defended his organization's record on race, and said the N.A.A.C.P. was trying to ''change the subject'' as a hotly contested election draws near. ''My guess is what they're trying to do is fire up their base and get independents to say, 'A pox on both your houses, we're not going to vote,' '' he said.
''We're focused on these fiscal, economic issues -- all the rest of this is just noise. We're very proud of our record of representing all Americans.''

HEADLINE: As Murder Trial Rivets State, Death Penalty Becomes Campaign Issue

BYLINE: By PAUL BASS. 
Paul Bass edits the online New Haven Independent (www.newhavenindependent.org).

 BODY:
If Dannel P. Malloy's gubernatorial campaign had the authority to set Connecticut's court calendar, it probably would have scheduled the state's most sensational murder trial for some other time. Like after Election Day.
As it is, the trial of Steven J. Hayes , one of two men accused of rape and murder in a Cheshire home invasion, has been riveting the state all fall, increasing the majority of voters who tell pollsters they support the death penalty.
Mr. Malloy is one of two Democrats in this fall's two marquee races in Connecticut -- for governor and United States Senate -- who have called for the abolition of the death penalty. The other is Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd.
The two candidates have ended up in different places and have taken different approaches this campaign season, as the Hayes trial kicked up questions about the death penalty and its enforcement. 
In the 1980s, Mr. Blumenthal testified in the State Legislature in favor of abolishing Connecticut's death penalty statute. He did so after representing a Florida death row inmate named Joseph Green Brown, who was wrongly convicted. Mr. Blumenthal succeeded in staving off the man's execution just 15 hours before it was scheduled to take place.
That was then. At a news conference following a Senate campaign debate on Oct. 4. Mr. Blumenthal was asked about that position. He acknowledged it, then noted that as far back as 1990 his changed view had been on public record. ''When I started running for attorney general, I supported the death penalty,'' he said. ''I'm a strong supporter now.''
Mr. Blumenthal argues that DNA advances since the 1980s have reduced the chances of false convictions.
Case closed. He and his Republican opponent, Linda McMahon, went back to trashing each other -- she portrayed by Mr. Blumenthal as a heartless, outsourcing private employer hostile to the minimum wage, and he labeled by Ms. McMahon as a mendacious, clueless, job-killing career politician. No more talk about the death penalty.
In the governor's race, on the other hand, Mr. Malloy never stops hearing about his opposition to the death penalty in light of the shocking murder of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, and the beating of their father, Dr. William A. Petit. When he held a news conference on expanding Connecticut's ports, Mr. Malloy was asked about it. In debates and on the campaign trail, his Republican opponent, Thomas C. Foley, who supports the death penalty, makes sure to mention it and try to force him to reiterate his position.
Mr. Malloy has stuck by his opposition. He has promised to sign a bill to abolish the death penalty if elected. (One of his early supporters, State Representative Gary A. Holder-Winfield of New Haven, succeeded in getting such a bill passed in 2009, only to have Gov. M. Jodi Rell veto it.
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 65 percent of voters expressed support for the death penalty, up from 60 percent a year earlier. A mere 23 percent were opposed. More than three-quarters supported giving the Cheshire defendants the death penalty.
''It's uncomfortable,'' Mr. Malloy acknowledged in an interview Monday. ''In this environment, that does cause consternation.''
As he is asked and reasked his position almost daily on the trail, Mr. Malloy always responds the same way.
He begins by practically begging reporters to allow him to speak in more than a sound bite, to explain how he came to his position from both moral and practical perspectives.
Then he notes that he is a former prosecutor who tried four homicide cases.
He expresses his support for life imprisonment for certain crimes.
He speaks about how Connecticut's death penalty law ''doesn't work,'' how taxpayers spend decades and millions of dollars on death row cases that rarely end in execution.
He notes that it does not appear to be a deterrent. ''There is no data that indicates that it has anything to do with the homicide rate,'' he says. ''If it did, Texas would have one of the lowest homicide rates as opposed to one of the highest homicide rates.''
He brings up the string of cases of innocent people on death row exonerated by DNA evidence. ''You can't unring a bell,'' he says. ''You can't bring back somebody to life that you have mistakenly put to death.''
He says the death sentences disproportionately fall on African-Americans.
But he also says that if elected governor, he will not interfere should a jury decide that the death penalty is an appropriate sentence for the two Cheshire murder defendants.
Moral and practical arguments aside, Mr. Malloy takes solace in another result of the new Quinnipiac poll: Only 6 percent of respondents said a candidate's position on the death penalty would be a deciding factor in their vote.
There's no way to fact-check that finding -- at least not before Nov. 2.
Embracing Bush: Democrats haven't tired of demonizing George W. Bush, but the way they're doing so shows how successfully the former president redefined the tax debate in this country. Witness a pitch Mr. Blumenthal made in rallying his labor base earlier this month. ''We can't go back to the Bush administration's trickle-down economics,'' the candidate told union activists at a New Haven rally. Then he offered one example of what's at stake: ''We need a middle-class tax cut now.'' He was referring to Democrats' efforts to renew all the soon-to-expire Bush cuts except those on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Like their counterparts in Washington, Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. McMahon basically agree on 98 percent of the Bush cuts.
No News Here: After their third and final televised debate last week, Ms. McMahon broke with tradition and immediately left the premises without first answering questions from reporters. She had good reason: Her encounters with pack reporting have ended badly. In one case, she stumbled on her position on the minimum wage, as well as her knowledge of the law; at another, her campaign's intention to stay on message about positive poll results devolved into an effort to pin her down on the details of her positions on health care and taxes. With no more debates or formal news conferences scheduled, look for Ms. McMahon to avoid packs of reporters and exert better control of her news media encounters. She can also rely on paid media, including the continued broadcasting of a powerful commercial produced by Scott Howell & Company showing Mr. Blumenthal stumbling in a debate when asked, ''How do you create a job?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Regrets? Yes. And Money Was the Root Of Them All.

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Christine Haughney, who writes the weekly column The Appraisal, described efforts by developers to get back commissions they had paid to real estate agents for deals that later fell through. She asked readers to describe some financial decisions, or purchases, that they wish they could reverse. Some commenters took a very wide view of the question, to say the least. Here, only lightly edited, are our favorites: 
I'd not have bought so many young women drinks.- Spofford Torrington
I would have rented instead of buying in 2007. And what Spofford said.- Brendan
I would not have bought shares of Kellogg. I was tempted by the high dividends, but there were far better options.- Jingna
I regret not finishing the six months of college I had left to get my bachelor of science degree to marry a man who turned out to be gay, leaving me childless forever.- South Park Snooki
I regret the very expensive and fashionable eyeglasses. They looked great on me for about five minutes. Something about the shape of the lenses, however, made the progressive quality of the lens hard to adjust to. Even worse, the temple pieces were straight with no curve for the ear, so they would not stay on my head. The thick frames made them impossible to adjust for my slightly misaligned ears. After two months of compliments and constant adjusting, they slid off of my face and under the wheels of a car.- LBC
Naive in my 20s, I cashed out $12,000 in retirement savings to pay deposits and move-in fees for a new apartment. Had I left it there, it would have been worth about $200,000 at retirement. Oops!- Aaron
Dumping my best boyfriend, at 27, and graduate school debt. ... The split for those two events shows in the lines of my palms, forever. ...- m.honey
I would not have left my father's deathbed at the insistence of JPMorgan Chase that I complete their annual budget projections before taking any more family leave. Even if they hadn't laid me off a few months later. Some things are more important than money.- SKV
No joke. I would never have gotten a master's degree. What a waste.- Phil
Simple: I would never go to law school. What a complete waste of time and money. I'd have been MUCH better off learning an actual skill/trade that is actually in demand. Welding. Solar panel installation. Diesel mechanic. Whatever.- Andrew M.
I would have never refinanced on a brownstone that was paid off and I inherited from my grandparents. Now I cannot keep up on the payments and I am afraid that it will go into foreclosure. I regret it every day!- JB
Not spending enough, actually. Bought in Manhattan in the '90s when interest rates were 8 percent. It felt great to refinance, but if I'd known how low rates would go I would have done whatever it took to buy an entire building. Too late now. - Diana
I bought oregano once. In Washington Square.- Don
I regret every time I denied myself the smallest pleasure in order to put away money for retirement. Fortunately, I didn't do it very often.- rosalind

HEADLINE: In Illinois, a White Knight Is Shaken by a Dark Horse

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Less than two years ago, when Patrick J. Quinn, a Democrat and the lieutenant governor of Illinois, was elevated to governor after a corruption scandal swirling around Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, he was hailed as a welcome, desperately needed respite from what had come before.
But by Wednesday night, facing an extremely difficult challenge for a full term as governor, Mr. Quinn found himself in an utterly different position: he was repeatedly tied to Mr. Blagojevich by his Republican opponent, blamed for the state's economic misery and job losses, and attacked for the snarl in Democratic-controlled Springfield that has left the state facing a $13 billion deficit and record pension liabilities. 
''Governor Quinn has tried to run this state, but unfortunately he's run it into the ground,'' Mr. Quinn's opponent, Bill Brady, a Republican state senator from downstate who was little known statewide until he began running for governor, said Wednesday night at a tense debate here.
In a state where Democrats hold every statewide office, this is an unexpectedly tight race -- and a contest few here in either party might have anticipated two years ago.
Mr. Quinn has been a political figure here for years, but not in the stereotype of a Chicago politician. He made his name as a populist-style reformer who pushed to cut the size of the Legislature and to create a citizens' group to watch over utility companies. He was once seen as more of a well-meaning gadfly than a traditional political leader.
Economic concerns have been the main -- sometimes it seems the only -- issue in this race. Mr. Quinn has called for an income tax increase and spending cuts, but has repeatedly been pummeled for failing to solve the budget and jobs woes more rapidly.
''I inherited the worst recession in our lifetime from George Bush,'' he said during the debate.
Mr. Brady has pledged to cut spending from the state budget, but has been criticized by some for failing to offer enough details. ''You've left Illinois with record deficits and debt,'' Mr. Brady told Mr. Quinn.
The economy has so eclipsed everything else that it is sometimes hard to notice how far apart Mr. Quinn and Mr. Brady are on other issues. Some Republicans here have worried that Mr. Brady's views on social issues do not match the model of earlier successful statewide Republican candidates, like James Edgar and James R. Thompson, who were moderates.
Asked about his stances against abortion (including in cases of rape and incest) and in favor of gun rights, Mr. Brady promptly directed the conversation back to the economy. Mr. Quinn, meanwhile, proudly described his support of abortion rights and gun control measures.
Over and over, Mr. Brady reminded viewers of Mr. Quinn's link to Mr. Blagojevich, who was impeached and ousted from office. Mr. Brady referred to the ''Governor Blagojevich-Governor Quinn administration,'' and suggested that Governor Quinn had continued in a pattern of ''secrecy'' in office.
Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Quinn were not seen as personally close -- Mr. Quinn has said he had not spoken to Mr. Blagojevich for months before his 2008 arrest -- but they were elected as a team in two general elections. (In Illinois, candidates for lieutenant governor run as individuals in partisan primary elections, then as a ticket in general elections.)
Before the 2006 election, too, Mr. Quinn had defended Mr. Blagojevich, whose administration by then was already under federal investigation, saying Mr. Blagojevich was ''a person who's honest and one of integrity'' -- a comment that Mr. Brady made sure to remind viewers of during the debate.

HEADLINE: After Bust, Using '60s Law To Get Out of Condo Deals

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY; Alain Delaqueriere and Jack Styczynski contributed research.

 BODY:
In May 2008, a few months before the financial industry's meltdown, the shipping executive Vasilis Bacolitsas signed up to buy a $3.4 million apartment at the Brompton, a luxury condominium tower being built on the Upper East Side.
The building went up as the real estate market went down, and Mr. Bacolitsas and his wife sought a $600,000 reduction in the purchase price. When they did not get it, they decided they did not want the apartment anymore. Their contract, like virtually all real estate contracts, required that they surrender the $510,000 deposit.
But last month, a judge ruled that the couple could walk away with their money. It was one of a series of recent rulings in New York and other states that have enraged developers and given an escape hatch to buyers who signed contracts at the worst possible time, before one of the biggest real estate meltdowns in decades.
The buyers -- some wealthy, some not -- are successfully using a 1968 federal law intended to protect buyers of out-of-state land from unscrupulous developers or brokers. But in many of these cases, the properties have been built as advertised. 
Instead, lawyers for the buyers are finding fault in wording that technically violates the law in contracts or other paperwork -- language that few developers or lawyers paid much attention to during the long real estate boom. Lawyers have won back deposits for errors as simple as failing to give buyers a legal description of the property or to register the building with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a basic requirement that many companies nonetheless overlooked.
''The statute was never designed for purchasers of luxury condominiums in urban areas to get out of contracts because of changes in the economy,'' said Bruce H. Lederman, a lawyer defending developers in two such cases out of Long Island City, Queens. ''It was designed to protect unsophisticated out-of-state purchasers like Jackie Gleason in 'The Honeymooners' from Florida swampland schemes.''
But lawyers who represent buyers argue that this use of the law legitimately helps people who, because of changing conditions, conclude that buying such an apartment is no longer advisable.
''The crash of the market resulted in people losing their jobs, No. 1, and No. 2, the tightening of the credit market meant they couldn't get the loans they needed to buy the property,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, who represented Mr. Bacolitsas and a number of other buyers in cases involving the law, known as the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, or ILSA. ''We had to find some law to help these people, and that's what ILSA did. Desperation inspired creativity.''
In July, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by eight buyers who had deposited $25,000 to $80,000 on new homes in Falls Church, Va., ruling that the wording of the developer's contracts did not comply with the law. Two decisions over the summer in Florida -- including one allowing a New Jersey couple to win back a $50,000 deposit on a townhouse in Port St. Lucie -- favored buyers.
In August, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in favor of three buyers who had placed about $300,000, combined, in down payments for apartments at 111 Fulton Street, a building known as the District. Late last month, Judge Paul A. Crotty of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that two buyers of a condominium conversion at 20 Pine Street may get their deposits back if they can prove that they would have pulled out earlier had the developer informed them about their rights under ILSA, according to the buyers' lawyer, Lawrence Weiner.
In Mr. Bacolitsas's case, the court ruled that his contract violated the law because it stated that the contract could not be filed with the city register, where property transactions are recorded. The law requires contracts to be recordable in city or county registries.
Mark Walfish, a lawyer representing the developer in that case, the Related Companies, said it would appeal. The apartment in question sold in April for $2.8 million -- $600,000 less than the original price.
Lawyers on both sides said that if the ruling stood, it could open the floodgates to more buyer lawsuits because many contracts contained similar language. In New York, typically, only actual sales -- in the form of deeds or co-op stock transfers -- are recorded, not contracts.
''The phone is ringing off the hook,'' said Mr. Bailey, who represented Mr. Bacolitsas.
The ILSA law came about in response to the midcentury land boom in states like Florida and Arizona. Developers and brokers in boiler rooms not unlike the office depicted in the David Mamet play ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' would market properties, sight unseen, to Northern buyers. President Lyndon B. Johnson told Congress in 1967 that he hoped the legislation would ''give our investors better protection in their purchases of undeveloped land.''
Despite its name, the law applies to properties in the same state and city, too. It generally lets buyers cancel their contracts within two years and sue within three years if the contract does not include specific legal language. Developers can avoid the law's requirements if they complete their projects in two years and are building fewer than 100 units.
Robert M. Chasnow, a partner at Holland & Knight who has been advising developers on ILSA for 30 years, said that, at first, courts were not receptive to buyers' claims. Nationwide, until the last couple of years, roughly 10 to 20 ILSA court decisions came out per year, he said, but last year there were 69, and there have been 50 this year. ''There's been an explosion of ILSA cases,'' he said.
In December, an analysis by The Real Deal, a New York real estate publication, found that buyers of at least 131 New York City condominium apartments worth $132 million were seeking to use ILSA to back out of their deals. A couple of early decisions favored developers, but more recent rulings in New York have sided with buyers.
Some developers have settled out of court, often with a confidentiality clause preventing buyers from discussing the agreement. Rebecca Schlanger, 34, who had used her life savings for a down payment on a $515,000 two-bedroom apartment in Miami, is suing under the law to get her money back. She said she could not obtain a mortgage because the developer had not purchased flood insurance.
''I did everything right,'' Ms. Schlanger said. ''I saved my money. I did my due diligence.''
But like many buyers before the bust, she did not have a contingency clause in her contract that allowed her to back out if she could not obtain a mortgage.
Robert Cooper, who represents Ms. Schlanger and 17 other buyers in the Miami building, said that she had grounds to sue under ILSA because the developer did not include a legal description of the unit in the contract. Mr. Cooper said the developer also made misrepresentations about Ms. Schlanger's ability to resell the property.
Aslan Palachi, the developer of the Miami building, known as the 1800 Club, said he had no plans to settle Ms. Schlanger's case. He said her claims were ''unfounded.'' He added, ''We have met every requirement'' of ILSA.
''When the project was completed and the time came to close, they discovered it was not as good an investment,'' he said. ''They tried to find every possible way to get out of their contracts.''

HEADLINE: China G.D.P. Grew 9.6% Despite Cooling Efforts

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy continued to expand at a rapid clip during the third quarter, demonstrating that government measures aimed at reining in growth have not choked off expansion. 
China's gross domestic product grew 9.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was a slower pace than the 10.3 percent year-on-year expansion recorded for the second quarter, but just above analyst expectations for a 9.5 percent increase.
Analysts view the slowdown as a return toward more normal, sustainable growth, rather than the beginning of a worrying slump. Though the United States and much of Europe are still struggling to pick up the pace of their economies, China has for months faced the opposite challenge: tempering expansion, and the price rises that accompany excessively rapid growth.
Inflation data also released on Thursday showed consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in September, a slight acceleration from the increase recorded in August.
Reduced lending by state-owned banks and other measures have helped soaring property prices stabilize somewhat in recent months.
The Chinese authorities stepped up their growth-slowing efforts on Tuesday by staging their first interest rate increase since late 2007. The move caught most observers by surprise, but appeared to indicate that Beijing was confident that China's overall growth momentum was intact and able to withstand the more sweeping tool of rate increases.

HEADLINE: 'Rent Is Too Damn High,' Set to Music

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The synthesizer pulses with an urgency that fits the lyrics. The voice is at once smooth and aged, reminding the listener of Ted Hawkins playing for pocket change on Venice Beach, but shot through with a dash of Chuck D. The lyrics, meanwhile, are straight-up Woody Guthrie.
''Mothers with children send them off to school hungry,'' the man sings in a comfortable higher register. ''She's got no food. You can't learn when you're hungry, so they eat in school to pass the time away.'' 
Catchy! Say, who is this guy? Oh, wait. Here comes the chorus:
''Rent! It's too daaaaamn high.''
That's right: along with the mutton chops, the gloves, the nunchucks and the fact that his name appears on the ballot for governor, add to the growing list of interesting things about Jimmy McMillan, at left, his catchy handful of songs, available for download on his Web site,www.rentistoodamnhigh.com
Together, they form a concept album with an extremely singular message. The songs themselves sound different, but almost all contain Mr. McMillan's favorite phrase. He sings it, chants it, slows it down to sound like a robot and shouts it like a preacher, sometimes all in the same tune.
But he has fun, too. ''Everybody in the club, throw your hands in the air!'' he shouts in a song called ''Lets Party.'' ''It's time to party with Papa,'' he sings, pulling off the rare hip-hop shout-out to the leader of the Smurfs, to whom he has been compared.
Then back to business. ''Somebody's being evicted tonight,'' he sings in ''Give Us Some Light.'' ''Somebody needs some light. Somebody's looking for boxes. Somebody's getting kicked out tonight.'' MICHAEL WILSON
Just Where Is Upstate? There's No One Answer
The race for governor has been dominated by accusations of infidelity, outrage over racist and pornographic e-mails, and incendiary comments about gay pride parades. But along with economic worries and corruption in Albany, there is another unspoken issue lurking in the background, one that turns on geography.
The Democratic candidate, Andrew M. Cuomo, has roots in New York City, while the Republican nominee, Carl P. Paladino, at left, likes to refer to himself as a businessman from Buffalo.
For some this touches on the long-running divide between New York City and its suburbs and the rest of the state -- the familiar upstate-downstate division.
''It's an interesting thing, the geography of New York,'' said Elizabeth Moore, who works as an adviser to people seeking to buy art and who was sitting on a bench on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on a recent sunny afternoon. ''Upstate is like a different world that we don't know anything about, living in the city.''
That raises the question, where does upstate end and downstate begin, or vice versa?
''There is no official demarcation,'' said Jo Margaret Mano, an associate professor of geography at the State University of New York at New Paltz, ''but when you talk to people, the demarcation between upstate and downstate goes north,'' depending on how far from the city the observer lives.
Some people -- usually residents of the five boroughs, without cars and with little need for them -- think that the line is crossed the moment they set foot in Westchester County.
New Paltz, Ms. Mano said, is about 90 miles north of New York City, and city dwellers ''consider this the wilderness.''
So where does that leave Buffalo, which is far closer to Cleveland than it is to Manhattan? Some people seem to believe that Buffalo is a lonely and forgotten outpost tucked away in a corner of the state.
Mike Kugel, 49, a native of Westchester who has lived in Buffalo for 30 years, still refers to New York City as ''the city.''
''People feel New York is far removed from Buffalo,'' Mr. Kugel said. ''And it is.'' ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

HEADLINE: An Author Still Writing His Way Through Big Sky Country

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
McLEOD, Mont. -- Thomas McGuane, whose new novel, ''Driving on the Rim,'' comes out on Thursday, is the only member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters who is also in the National Cutting Horse Association Hall of Fame. Yet he claims not to be a real rancher. ''All the ranchers I know have had back surgery, operations on their rotator cuffs,'' he said recently. ''They all have new knees. I'd like to think I belong to that breed, but I don't.''
But neither is Mr. McGuane a hobbyist or a dude rancher. Together with his wife, Laurie, he raises black Angus cattle here on a 2000-acre spread in the foothills of the Absaroka mountains in south-central Montana, country where the sky really is big: a vast blue dome under which a sea of grass surges back and forth.
Mr. McGuane also breeds and raises cutting horses and, at 70, still competes in cutting competitions. Trained to cut, or separate, a cow from its herd, cutting horses are as quick at changing directions as basketball point guards, and at least one of Mr. McGuane's horses, a retired champion named King, is more intelligent than most newspaper reporters. 
Tall, raw-boned and authentically Western looking, Mr. McGuane is a New Englander by heritage but grew up outside Detroit. He discovered the West while working on a Wyoming ranch in high school and moved to Montana in the late '60s, buying a small ranch with money he made from his first novel, ''The Sporting Club.'' In the methodical way he does just about everything, he set about learning to ride, rope and herd cattle.
''My father found it hard to understand where his compass pointed; I don't think he ever knew where he was on the planet,'' Mr. McGuane said, explaining why it seemed important to find a place where he could settle down. Montana when he moved there was still the Wild West, he recalled; he lived through (and profited from) the '80s real-estate boom, when the state became a fashionable destination for wealthy people wanting to rough it, or pretending to; and now, he said, ''we seem to have come out on the other side, and the economy is turning ranchers into an endangered species.''
His new novel, his 10th (he has also published two collections of stories), is partly picaresque, about a Montanan named Irving Berlin Pickett, known as Berl, who, despite being a medical doctor, remains a kind of bumbling naif, not quite at home in the world. But like much of Mr. McGuane's recent writing, it's also partly about the collision of the Old West and the New. Dr. Pickett finds himself involved in a very contemporary malpractice prosecution but also spends a lot of time hunting and fishing and thinking about the old days.
Mr. McGuane himself sometimes appears torn about which West he belongs to. ''There's a view of Montana writing that seems stage-managed by the Chamber of Commerce -- it's all about writers like A. B. Guthrie and Ivan Doig,'' he said, referring to two authors of historical novels about a rugged, frontier Montana. ''It used to bother me that nobody had a scene where somebody was delivering a pizza.''
On the other hand, Mr. McGuane has occasionally voiced misgivings about what he views as the narrow-minded New York critical establishment, including The New York Times, where his novels have sometimes been skeptically reviewed over the years. ''Everybody in flyover country believes they've been screwed by the East,'' he said. ''I try not to bellyache about it.'' Recalling his induction into the American Academy last spring, he added, ''I could tell that a lot of the older members were worried that I was going to be a mad dog, or unmannerly or something.''
Perhaps those elderly members, and even some of the younger ones, were thinking back to the period when Mr. McGuane was known as Captain Berserko. This was in the '70s when, after a hugely promising start as a novelist, he went to Hollywood. He wrote one very good screenplay, ''Rancho Deluxe''; one that proved to be a legendary flop, ''Missouri Breaks,'' and also directed the movie version of his own novel ''92 in the Shade.'' He was married briefly to Margot Kidder and had a much-publicized affair with Elizabeth Ashley.
The novelist Jim Harrison, one of Mr. McGuane's oldest friends, was around in those days, and he recalled recently that their mutual exploits ''did not exclude actresses, waitresses, drugs, rock 'n' roll.'' But Mr. Harrison also pointed out that since the early '80s, when Mr. McGuane ''beat the family curse and quit drinking,'' he has become happier and happier.
''At our age you sort of accumulate a lot of scar tissue,'' he added, ''and the cold wind of the world just blows over your head.''
Mr. McGuane has been married to Laurie, the sister of his friend the singer Jimmy Buffett, since 1977. They live in a century-old homesteader's cabin by the West Boulder River. Between them he and his wife have four children and five grandchildren, all of whom live nearby. Captain Berserko has become a benign, Visa-card-waving paterfamilias. ''I guess the only reason I'm here is that the detonator failed,'' he said, laughing.
When he is Montana, Mr. McGuane rides almost every day. He also hunts and fly-fishes, frequently darting out of the remodeled bunkhouse where he writes to flick a few casts into the nearby river. But of all the things he does the one that still excites him most, he said, is writing, which he fits in around his ranching life, getting up early in the morning sometimes, working after dinner and in the winter months, when there are fewer chores. ''Literature is the ditch I'm going to die in,'' he said. ''It's still the thing I care most about.''
After a period of 10 years or so when he didn't write much fiction, and instead published well-regarded books about fishing and horses, he has returned to it with renewed enthusiasm. ''There's nothing like the burn you get when it's going well, when things feel incandescent in your writing,'' he said, adding that he has learned that a novel has only one obligation: to be entertaining.
''I wrote a lot of 'Driving on the Rim' by giving myself the gift of being just as eccentric as I felt like,'' he said, and the book, irrepressibly comic and optimistic even when it verges on the tragic, is full of oddballs and free spirits, including Berl's Aunt Silbie, who introduces him to sex when he is just 14. As one of the characters remarks, ''Giving freaks a pass is the oldest tradition in Montana.''
''Driving on the Rim'' also features, not surprisingly, some gorgeous wilderness landscapes and a hunting dog who is as lovingly described as any of the human characters. ''I guess I'm a lower-case romantic,'' Mr. McGuane said. ''Like everyone, I have that general sense that we've been cast adrift. It's almost banal to say it, it's so obvious. But at the same time, living out here I have sense that I'm living in a world that hasn't quite changed. I see it in some of the kids who work here -- they're still so in touch with natural world.''
One of those people is Nate Robinson -- the best ranch hand he ever hired, according to Mr. McGuane, even though he comes from Massachusetts and isn't much of a horseman.
''Tom and Laurie have a unique way of running a ranch,'' Mr. Robinson said one afternoon while mending some fence. ''Their priorities revolve more around their lifestyle and caring for the animals than making a profit. I think when he came out here, people thought he was a total hippie who didn't know what he was doing. But I think they respect him now and are sort of proud of him. Even just from reading his books you can tell he knows about ranching.''

HEADLINE: Court, for Now, Bars Openly Gay Recruits

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Washington, and John Schwartz from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court on Wednesday temporarily stalled the landmark court decision allowing openly gay recruits to be accepted into the military.
In response to an emergency request from the government, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, issued a one-page order late in the day allowing the Pentagon to continue enforcing the ''don't ask, don't tell'' law, which bars openly gay, lesbian and bisexual service members.
The decision, which returns the law to the status quo before a Federal District Court judge in California prohibited its enforcement, will be in effect while the appeals court considers whether to issue a longer stay, until February, when the Ninth Circuit will hear the full appeal. A decision about the longer stay could occur as early as next week; the Log Cabin Republicans, which brought the legal challenge to the law, were told to prepare briefs on the issues by Monday. 
The stay almost certainly means the government will go back to enforcing the law as it did before the lower court issued an injunction against it.
Dan Woods, the lawyer for the Log Cabin Republicans, called the stay a ''minor setback'' and predicted a victory on the question of the long-term stay. ''We didn't come this far to quit now,'' he said.
The stay was issued after military recruiting stations got a brief taste of what life might be like in a world without ''don't ask, don't tell.''
Many consider the decision by the military to begin accepting openly gay applicants before the stay as a landmark moment in American history. But for William Kelley, a young man thinking about enlisting, it was just an overdue act of common sense.
''It was a terrible rule,'' said Mr. Kelley, an unemployed 25-year-old who was leaving a recruiting office in Washington after getting results for an aptitude exam for the Navy. ''It's the type of thing we'll look back on and feel ashamed of.''
A dozen potential recruits interviewed in the capital on Wednesday echoed his comments. The issue, they said, was one of basic fairness. They said people should be allowed to be themselves no matter where they work. Society -- at least for many young Americans -- had moved on, and it was time for the military to follow suit.
Military officers have argued that if the change is made too quickly, it will place the military on a collision course with federal statutes. Families and spouses of soldiers have access to benefits like housing, health care and education through marriage, which the federal government does not recognize for same-sex couples.
''Will this make problems for the military?'' said William Brown, a student who had come to the recruiting office to get information about the Army Reserve, possibly as a way to earn money to finish college. ''Maybe. But they'll just have to adjust.''
Not everyone shared the opinion. A 21-year-old who declined to give his name said that he feared sexual advances by gay men in boot camp, and that he hoped to finish training before a repeal took effect. He said he knew no gay people and admitted that he had never been approached by one.
The recruiting office was having a slow day, and Mr. Kelley was part of a trickle of potential recruits. He is not gay, he said, but does know a gay fashion designer in Manhattan who served in the Marines and a gay actor who played a soldier in an Army advertisement on television.
Society is ready to respect their rights, he said.
A man in his 50s who did not give his name but identified himself as the janitor in the recruiting office shook his head.
''This would have happened a long time ago,'' he said, ''but we're dealing with politicians.''

HEADLINE: Trade Issues Are Driving A Wedge In the G-20

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representatives of the Group of 20 economic powers, who managed to cooperate during the financial crisis two years ago, will confront festering disputes over trade and currency this weekend, and try to reconcile diverging approaches for how to deal with them.
The frictions have strained the G-20, threatening to undermine what was supposed to be the most productive forum for international economic cooperation. 
As the United States and China battle over the artificially low value of China's currency and the American trade imbalance, officials from the big emerging economies of the G-20 seem frustrated at being caught in the crossfire.
Officials in India and South Africa said this week that they feared the outbreak of a damaging currency war. Brazil, which was early in warning that such a war was under way, announced it would not take part in two days of G-20 ministerial meetings in Gyeongju, South Korea, this weekend. And a top Turkish official expressed doubts Wednesday about the effectiveness of the G-20, which operates by consensus and has no legal force.
The administration, meanwhile, is trying to channel the frustration into a united front against China. Without naming China explicitly, a senior Treasury official warned that the economy was worse off ''when large economies with undervalued exchange rates act to keep their currencies from appreciating.''
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by Treasury, added: ''It's bad for the system and it's bad for all of us. It imposes an unfair burden of adjustment on other emerging markets that are running more flexible exchange-rate regimes.''
The official avoided criticizing Brazil, noting that Brazil had resisted political pressure to keep its currency, the real, from rising. ''The Brazilians have really framed the debate that we need to have at the G-20,'' the official said. Brazil and India, the official said, are ''among these countries that have the greatest to gain'' from the G-20 process because a surge of foreign capital has threatened the stability of their fast-growing economies.
The United States is also seeking support from the other wealthy countries, but Europe and Japan have their own problems and have been reluctant to confront Beijing.
South Korea, which is playing host to this weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers and to a G-20 leaders' summit meeting in Seoul, in November, has an interest in serving as a mediator. But South Korea is among the countries that have taken or considered steps to prevent their currencies from rising in value to bolster exports.
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, recently warned of a cycle of ''competitive nonappreciation,'' in which countries try to outdo one another in holding down their currencies to cheapen their exports and gain an advantage in trade. Mr. Geithner and Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, are attending the meetings on Friday and Saturday, along with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
But some foreign officials believe the United States is contributing to the same problem. The Fed is expected next month to resume an unconventional program that involves buying large amounts of government bonds to further lower long-term interest rates and spur growth.
To do so, the Fed will have to print new money -- possibly hundreds of billions of dollars -- and that is likely to lower the dollar's value.
G-20 leaders agreed in Pittsburgh in September 2009 to promote ''strong, sustainable and balanced growth.'' In essence, that mantra means that deficit countries -- like the United States and Britain -- should save and export more while borrowing and importing less. Surplus countries -- like China and Germany -- should stimulate domestic demand by their consumers.
But as Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said in a speech on Tuesday, ''there is a clear difference between the path of adjustment desired by the surplus countries, which are faced with the need for a longer-term structural shift away from reliance on exports, and the path of adjustment preferred by the deficit countries, which are under greater near-term pressure to reduce the burden of debt in both private and public sectors.''
American officials have called on the International Monetary Fund to play a stronger role in mediating exchange-rate disputes and in evaluating the G-20 members' compliance with their commitments.
''Meaningful reform of I.M.F. surveillance is a core challenge for the institution, and the G-20 must give the fund greater ability to fulfill its original role of providing oversight of the international monetary system through stronger and more frank evaluations of exchange-rate policies and reserve-accumulation practices,'' the Treasury official said.
The United States is pushing Europe to give up some seats on the 24-member board that governs the I.M.F., hoping that greater representation for the fast-growing emerging economies will encourage them to share in the costs of cooperation.
The Treasury official suggested that at the least, the United States did have one tool of leverage with other countries: its size. ''The health and strength of the U.S. recovery is extremely important to their own economic growth,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: How Money Influences Elections

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Don't Follow the Money'' (column, Oct. 19), David Brooks argues that because big-spending candidates often lose to lesser-funded challengers, there's no reason to be concerned about the flood of large donations, many of them secret, flowing into Congressional contests this fall. His analysis fails on two levels.
First, it's clear that money counts in our elections. Since 2000, the average winner in contests for open House seats has outspent the average loser by at least $310,000, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. In races for open Senate seats, winners outspent losers, on average, in every year except 2002. 
Far more important than who wins -- and not mentioned by Mr. Brooks -- is the difference that big contributions make after the election. The individuals, corporations, trade groups and unions writing record-sized checks this fall will want a return on their investments; winning candidates, outspent or not, will have a powerful incentive to provide it. These are building blocks for scandal.
Bob Edgar President, Common Cause Washington, Oct. 19, 2010
To the Editor:
Campaign spending can still have a critical influence on legislative outcomes, even if it doesn't actually have an outsize impact on election outcomes. As long as candidates believe that spending gets them re-elected, this spending will influence how they vote in legislative battles once in Congress.
I hope that candidates of all stripes pay close attention to David Brooks's eye-opening analysis, especially when pondering issues in which corporate interests are clearly at odds with the public and individual good.
Mary L. Kukowski West Conshohocken, Pa., Oct. 19, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that independent expenditures in campaigns are not very important because they're a modest percentage of all spending and favored candidates can lose.
But it's a very big deal when anonymous special interests drop several hundred thousand dollars in targeted competitive House races or several million in swing states, as Representative Peter deFazio, an Oregon Democrat, and Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, have discovered to their consternation.
Mr. Brooks selectively argues that well-financed candidates like Phil Gramm and John Connally did poorly in their presidential races. That's true, though one wonders whether he also thinks that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's money was irrelevant (only asking).
While independent or candidate spending is not the only or even the most important variable -- message, economy, scandal can count for more -- only someone who's never run for office can theorize that money doesn't matter.
Since Meg Whitman and Linda McMahon have invested a combined $160 million of their own fortunes in their campaigns -- and candidates spend half to two-thirds of their time ''dialing for dollars'' -- one wonders why they all waste so much money and time. Mr. Brooks suggests that candidates are foolish to seek and spend such large sums.
Really?
Mark Green New York, Oct. 19, 2010
The writer was the Democratic candidate for mayor against Michael R. Bloomberg in 2001 and the former public advocate for New York City. He is the author of ''Selling Out: How Big Corporate Money Buys Elections, Rams Through Legislation and Betrays Our Democracy.''
To the Editor:
''Don't Follow the Money'' doesn't follow the unlimited influence of campaign spending on governing. These big corporations are not stuffing the pockets of the candidates because they ''get to hang out at exclusive parties.''
This government runs on green energy -- the more green you put in the coffers, the more energy your candidate has to make sure your goals become his or hers.
David Brooks says money ''makes people feel good because they think it has magical properties.'' Well, Mr. Brooks, it does. It can change an election, and it certainly can change the course of our destiny. Not bad for a little piece of paper.
Robert S. Nussbaum Fort Lee, N.J., Oct. 19, 2010
To the Editor:
The role that money plays and the influence it buys in American politics are an unfortunate reality.
A quote from the Republican politician Mark Hanna (1837-1904) is as true today as it was then: ''There are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I can't remember what the second is.''

HEADLINE: Economic Activity Is Expanding Modestly, the Federal Reserve Says

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Economic activity in the United States has continued to expand at a modest pace, although some areas, including housing, construction and the labor market, remain weak, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
The Fed's description of the economy was part of its latest regional survey by the 12 district banks, covering the period from the beginning of September through early this month.
Speculation is increasing that in an effort to stimulate the sluggish economy, the central bank will soon announce additional quantitative easing, the strategy of buying long-term assets like Treasury bonds to lower long-term interest rates. 
Many economists were examining the latest Fed survey, known as the beige book, for any further hints into whether the central bank would make a decision about new quantitative easing at its next policy meeting Nov. 2-3.
Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA, said that, based on the survey, the argument for a new round of quantitative easing ''remains in place, as the economy is seen to be only modestly expanding.''
David Semmens, the United States economist for Standard Chartered, said, ''There is nothing in this report to rule out further quantitative easing.''
The Fed pursued a round of quantitative easing in 2009. By April this year, it had bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related debt and Treasury securities to put downward pressure on long-term rates.
Since August, Fed officials have been signaling that their confidence in the recovery has dimmed. That month, they announced another, modest round of quantitative easing, saying they would use the proceeds from the central bank's huge mortgage bond portfolio to buy long-term government debt.
In addition, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the central bank was determined to prevent the economy from slipping into a cycle of falling wages and prices, and that he expected modest growth in the second half of 2010 to expand in 2011.
John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, said Wednesday's report suggests there could be a ''modest approach'' to further quantitative easing.
He described the report as ''not a complete disaster,'' saying there were some ''mini-upgrades'' in several sectors compared with the survey of the previous period, including a firming of housing prices and a stabilization of bank lending, which means that any quantitative easing will have more impact.
The report appeared in some respects to suggest that the economy had moved on from mid-July through the end of August, when the previous beige book said the economy showed ''widespread signs of deceleration.''
In the survey, which is based on information supplied by business contacts in the different regions, manufacturing activity continued to expand, with production and new orders rising across most of those regions. The manufacturing sector has been one of the economy's bright spots in terms of new employment.
In addition, consumer spending was ''steady to up slightly,'' although consumers remained sensitive to prices and limited their purchases mostly to necessities. Consumer spending is a crucial indicator, both because it dominates the overall economy and because of its implications for the job market.
The beige book's description of consumer spending was similar to the one in last month's survey, in which the Fed also said that consumer spending rose even though there was an emphasis on essential and lower-priced goods with limited spending on big-ticket items.
With consumers paying off debt, saving more and facing problems like a weak housing and job market, it is unlikely there will be anything more than very modest improvements, at least until the second half of 2011, Mr. Semmens said.
''It is hard to get excited about this recovery,'' he said.
Housing markets remained weak, with most districts reporting sales below their levels in the previous year even though there were some reports that prices had stabilized, the survey said. Future capital spending was limited, conditions in the commercial real estate were ''subdued,'' and construction was expected to remain weak, it said.
Prices were stable and wage pressures were minimal, the survey said.
Overall, the outlook for the job market was little improved, as hiring remained limited, with many firms reluctant to add to permanent payrolls given the softness in the economy, the survey said.
''There is just not much movement in the economy,'' Mr. Canally said.

HEADLINE: Obama Tries to Shore Up the Party Base With a Western Campaign Swing

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- President Obama began his four-day campaign swing on Wednesday to fortify a Democratic firewall on the West Coast, telling a crowded rally here to ''defy the conventional wisdom just like you did in 2008,'' when Oregon overwhelmingly backed him for president.
With two weeks to go until the midterm elections, Mr. Obama is trying desperately to shore up the Democratic base, appealing to voters in Oregon, Washington and California -- traditionally blue states where Republicans have been running competitive campaigns. 
Mr. Obama arrived here, the first stop on his West Coast itinerary, to stump for John A. Kitzhaber, the former governor who is trying to get his old job back.
It has been almost 24 years since a Republican was governor in Oregon, but Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat who was governor from 1995 to 2003, is in a tight race with Chris Dudley, a Republican and former basketball player who has never held office.
A cheering crowd of about 8,400 Democratic stalwarts -- they even cheered for themselves after reciting the pledge of allegiance -- greeted Mr. Obama, whose stump speech is now directed at making sure that faithful Democrats go to the polls.
''There's no doubt that we're getting to a point in the campaign where it's important that the campaigns that have identified their voters make sure we get them out on Election Day,'' the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Wednesday.
The fact that Mr. Obama is campaigning so feverishly on relatively friendly turf shows how steep the climb is for the White House, and how much the electoral climate has changed in two years, since he took his presidential campaign into Republican territory, trying to turn traditionally Republican states toward the Democratic camp.
Indeed, in another sign of just how grim the electoral map now looks for Democrats, White House officials were telling reporters on Wednesday that Massachusetts is not really a reliably Democratic state. (In an upset last year, the Democrats lost the Senate seat held for decades by Edward M. Kennedy.)
Both Mr. Gibbs and David Axelrod, the White House senior adviser, pointed out that Massachusetts has often had Republican governors, so it should surprise no one that the Democratic incumbent there -- Deval Patrick, Mr. Obama's close friend and political ally -- is fighting for his political life against Charles D. Baker Jr., a Republican former health insurance executive and state budget official.
''I think he's a spectacular person and a great governor,'' Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Patrick on the ''Larry King Live'' program on CNN Tuesday night. ''Massachusetts, though, had elected Republican governors for 16 years before he arrived, so it's a competitive race.''
After Oregon, Mr. Obama is to visit Seattle to campaign for Senator Patty Murray, who is in a close race for re-election against Dino Rossi, a perennial Republican candidate who was defeated twice in races for governor. The polls show this race is close, and Democrats are clearly worried; Democrats have arranged for Michelle Obama and former President Bill Clinton to campaign for Ms. Murray as well.
In a Seattle backyard, Mr. Obama will hold an event to discuss women and the economy, part of the White House effort to try to win back female voters.
Then Mr. Obama is scheduled to attend fund-raisers in San Francisco and a rally in Los Angeles for Senator Barbara Boxer and for Jerry Brown, who is trying return to the Statehouse in a lively race for governor against Meg Whitman, the billionaire former chief executive of eBay.
Mr. Obama will wind up his campaign swing with stops in Nevada, where the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is facing a stiff challenge from the Tea Party-backed candidate, Sharron Angle, and finally in Minnesota, where Democrats would like to regain the governorship.

HEADLINE: Britain Plans Deepest Cuts To Spending in 60 Years

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL and ALAN COWELL; Sarah Lyall reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday unveiled the country's steepest public spending cuts in more than 60 years, reducing costs in government departments by an average of 19 percent, sharply curtailing welfare benefits, raising the retirement age to 66 by 2020 and eliminating hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs in an effort to bring down the bloated budget deficit.
''Today is the day when Britain steps back from the brink,'' a confident George Osborne, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is Britain's top finance minister, told the House of Commons. ''To back down now and abandon our plans would be the road to economic ruin.'' 
Wednesday's announcement of $:83 billion, about $130 billion, in cuts by 2015 represents a big political gamble for Britain's fledgling Conservative-led coalition government.
Britain's public deficit is one of the highest among developed economies, running at 11.5 percent of total economic output, compared with 10.7 percent for the United States and 5.4 percent for Germany. Though the Conservatives have so far made a persuasive case for the deep cuts, outmaneuvering a weakened Labour opposition, the country has yet to feel anything like the pain that is to come as the retrenchment begins to take hold.
''There's a growing acceptance and public awareness that this is necessary, that these measures are needed,'' Helen Cleary, deputy political director for the Ipsos Mori polltakers, said in an interview. ''But I don't think people will really understand what it all means until the cuts start to bite.''
The coalition government is also gambling that the reductions in public outlays will stimulate the private sector and restart growth, rather than send the economy back into a tailspin, as liberal economists have warned.
Britain has been bracing for the cuts for months, after Mr. Osborne announced in June the details of the so-called spending review, but Wednesday was the first time the government had set out its plans, department by department.
Mr. Osborne said that 490,000 public sector jobs would be lost over the next four years, some to attrition. At the same time, payments to the long-term unemployed who fail to seek jobs will be cut, he said, saving $11 billion a year. Additionally, he said, a new 12-month limit will be imposed on long-term jobless benefits, and measures will be taken to curb benefit fraud.
Mr. Osborne said an increase in the official retirement age to 66 from 65 would start in 2020 -- four years sooner than planned -- saving $8 billion a year. Britain has already said it will stop paying child benefit payments to people earning more than around $70,000 a year.
But while the government has sought to rein in welfare costs, Mr. Osborne announced that several politically sacred benefits for the elderly, including free eye tests, prescription drugs and bus passes, would remain.
Britain has about six million public sector jobs, about one fifth of all jobs in the economy, according to the Office for National Statistics. But it was not clear what the impact of shedding 490,000 of them -- about 8 percent of the total -- would have on unemployment. Mr. Osborne has continually said that the private sector will take up the slack, employing more people as the economy emerges from the doldrums.
Mr. Osborne promised annual savings of 7.1 percent in the budgets of local government councils and said there would be a freeze followed by a 14 percent cut in tax money allocated to maintaining Queen Elizabeth II's household. Public housing tenants, he said, will face higher rents closer to the market rates for private housing. Military spending will be cut by 8 percent by 2014, he said, but he promised not to reduce spending on British forces in the Afghanistan war.
But, he said, the National Health Service -- one of the most politically delicate institutions in Britain -- will be allocated more money, rather than less. He also said the ''resource money'' for schools would increase ''in real terms'' every year.
Spending on the police will be cut by 4 percent a year, he said, but spending on intelligence and security agencies will be strengthened to guard against terrorism and protect London during the 2012 Olympic Games. He also promised to spend about $1.4 billion on measures to curb tax fraud, which cost the tax service about $11 billion a year.
Mr. Osborne said Britain's diplomatic corps -- the Foreign Office -- would lose 24 percent of its financing and cut the number of workers at the headquarters in London. Additionally, the BBC will take over financing the BBC World Service and several other responsibilities, saving the government about $539 million a year, while the BBC's own mandatory license fee levied on owners of television sets will be frozen for six years.
People in the arts had been bracing themselves for deep cuts in government subsidies. But, while Mr. Osborne said that administrative costs in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and in quasigovernmental arts organizations would be reduced by 41 percent, money for ''core programs'' like museums would be cut by just 15 percent.
''We have had to make choices, choices in the things we support,'' Mr. Osborne said. ''We have taken our country back from the brink of bankruptcy.''
The average cut in the budgets of government departments, he said, will be 19 percent, not the 25 percent he had initially threatened.
He said a temporary tax on bank balance sheets would be made permanent. Many Britons, like Americans, are angry with big banks for their role in the world financial crisis. Mr. Osborne said the government would seek to extract ''the maximum sustainable taxes'' from financial institutions.
In June, Mr. Osborne also said that the value-added tax -- a tax paid on most consumer goods in Britain -- would increase in January, to 20 percent from 17.5 percent.

HEADLINE: A Battered Landscape For a 2-Term Democrat

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
MANTECA, Calif. -- When Jerry McNerney, a Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 2006, it was both an upset and, it seemed, a harbinger.
Mr. McNerney, after all, was a soft-spoken mathematician and wind energy executive who beat the odds to defeat Richard Pombo, a brash conservative Republican who had long represented California's 11th Congressional District, a sprawling, four-county splotch in the once-rural areas to the east of San Francisco.
But as Bay Area commuters populated -- and liberalized -- the district's new suburbs, Mr. McNerney appeared to be a symbol of its new complexion: moderate, mild-mannered and more concerned with local issues than national battles. 
That, however, was then. Today, many of those new suburbs sit in a region with some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Since 2006, the district has lost more than 30,000 residents. And while unemployment statewide is more than 12 percent, the rate is more than twice that in several towns in the 11th.
All of which is obvious to Mr. McNerney. ''People are worried,'' he said. ''And they don't know exactly who to blame.''
The answer may be him. He is facing a strong challenge from David Harmer, a lawyer and businessman who is running on a platform of restoring freedom, cutting spending and promoting ''American exceptionalism.''
''I believe that America is an exceptional nation, founded by exceptional statesmen, who drafted an exceptional declaration, which is universal in its application, but which was exceptional in its use as the definition of nationhood and as a starting point for the formation of a government,'' Mr. Harmer said.
Such high-minded constitutional talk is red meat to local Tea Party groups, who have volunteered for Mr. Harmer's campaign in droves. And while his campaign headquarters are dotted with photographs of Ronald Reagan -- who said Republicans should never speak ill of their own -- he has taken a more critical view of the party. ''I'm an American first, I'm a conservative second,'' Mr. Harmer said. ''And I happen to be a Republican because I perceive the Republican Party is marginally more hospitable to my point of view.''
Despite his ambivalence, Republican leaders have named Mr. Harmer, 48, one of their ''young guns,'' meaning an attractive and seemingly electable candidate. This month, the Republican National Committee chairman, Michael Steele, stumped for Mr. Harmer aboard his ''Fire Pelosi'' bus.
The son of a former California lieutenant governor, Mr. Harmer has run for Congress as a Republican twice before, including a loss in Utah in 1996 and a loss last November to the Democrat John Garamendi in the neighboring 10th District. (Mr. Harmer admits to not living in the 11th; his home is in the affluent suburb of San Ramon to the north.)
As a candidate, Mr. Harmer -- a married father of four and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- is a smiling, cheery presence, peppering his banter with ''darns'' and ''gollys.'' But much of his campaign language has a harder edge, with accusations of ''intergenerational theft'' and ''fiscal child abuse'' in regard to government spending.
But he is more circumspect when it comes to specific cuts. ''What we need to do first is figure out what do we have to spend, and devise a budget globally that stays within it,'' he said. ''So don't hold me responsible for saying what to cut. Hold the government responsible for not even passing a budget this year.''
A former fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Harmer found himself on the defensive this month after Mother Jones magazine dug up a 2000 San Francisco Chronicle article by Mr. Harmer in which he proposed abolishing public schools.
''Government ownership and operation of the schools is a counterproductive anachronism,'' Mr. Harmer wrote.
But Melissa Subbotin, a Harmer spokeswoman, said Mr. Harmer was merely arguing for ''greater accountability,'' adding that all four of Mr. Harmer's children attend public schools.
Still, Mr. McNerney's campaign seized on the article as an example of Mr. Harmer's ''radical'' and ''extreme'' ideas. Such political combat seems somewhat out of character for Mr. McNerney, a quiet figure who often answers questions simply and briefly. At a recent event at a car dealership here in Manteca, for example, an agricultural hub in the Central Valley, Mr. McNerney was asked if the federal government could help with California's chronic budget gap.
''I wouldn't bank on it,'' he said.
In an interview later at a local doughnut shop, Mr. McNerney said he understood why people were upset in the once-thriving district, which he said had undergone a ''180-degree change'' since his election in 2006.
''They're saying, 'Where are our jobs?' '' he said.
Like Mr. Harmer, Mr. McNerney is not thrilled with his party's performance. ''I don't believe that the Democratic leadership spent enough attention on the economy, on creating jobs,'' he said. ''I think that was a failure.''
As for his impressions of Mr. Harmer, Mr. McNerney joked -- ''He's taller than me'' -- before offering a more serious assessment. ''I'm an engineer, basically; I just want to make things better,'' he said. ''I see my opponent as an ideologue.'' Mr. Harmer's campaign responded by calling Mr. McNerney ''out of touch.''
While Mr. McNerney spoke at the doughnut shop, a constituent hovered near his table. Jim Rider, 76, a retired machinist who wore a belt buckle with his initials, said that he would vote for Mr. Harmer. ''They don't know what they're doing,'' Mr. Rider said of the current Congress. ''They're not creating jobs with all that money that they spend.'' Mr. McNerney nodded quietly, with a half-smile on his face.
But before Mr. Rider left, he did offer his embattled congressman one compliment. ''You're better,'' he said, ''than Pombo.''

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley's Painful Setback

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and IAN CAMPBELL

 BODY:
James Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, took one on the nose in the third quarter. While his peers have largely beat analysts' estimates, Mr. Gorman presided over results that not only missed the target but included an unexpected $91 million loss. In fact, the company had to rely on one-time items to avoid an even worse showing. After a decent first half of the year, it's a setback.
A surprising write-down on an Atlantic City casino project pushed Morgan Stanley into the red. The company already had taken what appeared to be a full hit on the investment when it decided to get rid of its stake early this year. But it has yet to find a buyer at the price initially marked on the books. 
Fixed-income trading revenue also slumped. And the twisted accounting rule that forces firms to mark their own debt to market made the drop from the second quarter, 64 percent, look even worse.
But even after stripping out the new rules, the top line still fell 24 percent, worse than any of Morgan Stanley's rivals. JPMorgan Chase's bond, currency and commodities revenue rose slightly, while Bank of America's equivalent business generated 50 percent more cash than the previous quarter.
Morgan Stanley's loss would have been worse but for some nonrecurring items. There was $800 million of revenue from gains on investments housed in the institutional securities and asset management units. Another $176 million accrued thanks to a tax benefit from bringing foreign earnings back to the United States.
That the bank's fixed-income traders had the most dismal quarter of the top banks was not so surprising. After multiple changes of strategy, the division is still rebuilding, a task that Mr. Gorman has repeatedly cautioned investors will take several quarters.
And revamps elsewhere are still running smoothly, if slowly. Wealth management pretax income rose by about a third, though its pretax margin reached only 9 percent. And even after stripping out gains on real estate investments, asset management made a rare profit from continuing operations. That suggests underlying strength. That should give investors some comfort that, the latest noise and disappointments aside, Mr. Gorman is still largely on the right track.
British Penance
It is living up to its billing as a bloodbath. Britain's coalition government is slashing public spending by $128 billion over five years, about 19 percent when adjusted for inflation.
The plan is billed as a painful necessity to secure the country's financial future, but it is also ideological. The aim is to move from unaffordable levels of public employment and welfare to private employment and a balanced budget. The risk, however, is that the economy could stall.
The cuts to the civil service are drastic and will cause distress, even though most departments' budgets have been reduced by less than a quarter, as had been threatened. The BBC, the foreign office, the police, even the royal family: none have been spared. The government wants services to be delivered more cheaply, which means by fewer people.
Britons know the public sector has excesses and that some cuts will not be the end of the world. Nevertheless, losing half a million public sector jobs is a heavy toll. If the private sector cannot absorb these workers, total unemployment in Britain may rise to three million, or more than 9 percent.
Cutting many departments has allowed the government to lift health spending and maintain the schools budget. With welfare, however, the changes risk looking harsh. Most, though not all, of the overall $11 billion drop in welfare spending hits the poorest. The intention is to encourage people to swap welfare for work, but the danger is greater social division.
The big macroeconomic risk is that the cuts cause a return to recession, thereby wrecking the government's fiscal calculations. That risk is real: house prices are still falling, and consumers are still deleveraging.
The Bank of England is likely to make money as cheap as possible. Nevertheless, tough years lie ahead. A country that was living far beyond its means now faces simultaneous big spending cuts and tax increases.
The government hopes its decision will bring clarity and a swift climb in private investment. A happy outcome is not assured. But at least it's a resolute start.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Sell Jet Fighters and Helicopters to Saudis

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration notified Congress on Wednesday that it planned to sell up to $60 billion in advanced weaponry to Saudi Arabia, a deal intended to counter the rising influence of Iran. 
The sale of advanced jet fighters and helicopters could become the largest arms deal in American history and one significant enough to shift the region's balance of power over the course of a decade.
State Department and Pentagon officials told lawmakers that the sales would include 84 new F-15 fighter jets, upgrades to 70 existing Saudi F-15s, 190 helicopters and a wide array of missiles, bombs and delivery systems, as well as accessories like night-vision goggles and radar warning systems.
The sale, first disclosed in September, has been in the works for months and is intended to strengthen the defense forces of Saudi Arabia, which has long been a United States ally and a leading purchaser of these kinds of weapons.
''This proposed sale has tremendous significance from a strategic regional perspective,'' said Andrew Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, who announced the deal.
''It will send a strong message to countries in the region that we are committed to support the security of our key partners and allies in the Arabian Gulf and broader Middle East,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''And it will enhance Saudi Arabia's ability to deter and defend against threats to its borders and to its oil infrastructure, which is critical to our economic interests.''
Congress has 30 days to block the deal, but the officials said they did not expect significant opposition despite some lawmakers' concerns about the potential impact of the sales on Israel's security.
Mr. Shapiro and Alexander Vershbow, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said that the sales would not affect Israel's qualitative military edge in the Middle East and that Israel was not expected to object.
Israeli officials said previously that they were not pleased with the proposed sales but would not try to prevent them.
Mr. Vershbow said the new and upgraded F-15s would be crucial to accelerating military cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia, standardizing the fleet of the Saudi Air Force and making it more compatible with that of the United States and other gulf allies.
The helicopters, including Apaches, Black Hawks and Little Bird attack choppers, will give the Saudis greater ability to protect borders along with military installations and oil facilities.

HEADLINE: The Fashion Conservatives

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
A WOMAN seeking political office in 2010 faces a fashion quandary. The choice, in simplest terms, comes down to this: to follow the lead of Sarah Palin or cast a style vote with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
At a glance, Ms. Palin -- she of the designer jackets, rump-hugging skirts and knee-high boots -- would seem to have been a game changer, loosening up a restrictive, if unwritten, campaign dress code with one that expresses a more conventionally feminine look. Her bright, curve-enhancing garments and loose, shoulder-grazing hair -- even her rimless glasses -- have been taken up by a handful of candidates on the climb. This is especially true of fellow Republicans like Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Christine O'Donnell of Delaware and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who appear to be following Ms. Palin's style cues with striking fidelity.
Lisa A. Kline, the image consultant behind Ms. Palin's controversial $150,000-plus fashion makeover during the 2008 campaign, views her client's embrace of an overtly female archetype as a signal of rebellion. ''Women want to change their image.'' Ms. Kline said in an interview. ''They had been in the mimicking-men phase for so long. Now they are going for femininity.'' 
Well, look again, Ms. Kline. For all the ridicule that Mrs. Clinton's boxy pantsuits have generated over the years -- she seems to own one in every color, from turquoise to fuchsia -- her mannishly functional wardrobe remains the go-to choice for women on the path to power.
On their own steam -- or perhaps at the suggestion of a battery of campaign advisers -- the majority of candidates are retreating, as they have for decades, to the relative safety of an anodyne uniform. Understated to a fault, its chief components are a formless suit, flat or low-heeled shoes and a noncommittal hairstyle. It's a brusquely masculine image tempered occasionally by a strand of pearls and dainty, never dangly, earrings (the latter deemed too distracting for television cameras).
''A Palin effect? Show it to me,'' said Christine K. Jahnke, a media trainer who advised Mrs. Clinton during her presidential campaign. ''Women aren't trying to look like Sarah Palin. That would be a mistake.''
They are for the most part ''still walking a tightrope,'' said Ms. Jahnke, who advises female candidates to adopt a high-quality, low-key wardrobe befitting a corporate chief executive. ''You have to look approachable and, at the same time, look like you can handle the job,'' she said.
Siobhan Bennett, president of the Women's Campaign Forum, a bipartisan group that seeks to get women elected, sees plenty of Americans adopting Ms. Palin's glasses and ''bedhead'' coif. ''But that's in the general populace,'' Ms. Bennett stressed, ''not on the campaign trail.''
Indeed, there is much to suggest that women who aspire to office continue to dress defensively. Frightened, even terrified, of committing a wardrobe gaffe on national airwaves, most adhere to a rigid, patently dated style that has all the allure of a milk carton.
The prevailing look, modeled on corporate executives, with an occasional nod to the astringent style of female news anchors, is anathema to professional style-watchers. When, during her presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton declined an invitation to appear in Vogue magazine for fear, her handlers said, of appearing ''too feminine,'' Anna Wintour fired off a scathing editor's letter.
''The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously is frankly dismaying,'' Ms. Wintour chided. ''I do think Americans have moved on from the power suit mentality. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment.''
But even a cursory rummage through news clips and Web sites indicates that women courting power still adopt a strategic style of dress conceived to keep their curves -- and their characters -- neatly under wraps.
Among those candidates, including Palin acolytes, sophistication is in short supply, said Sharon Graubard, a senior executive with Stylesight, a trend-forecasting firm in New York. ''These women have yet to figure out a way to project a confident femininity,'' Ms. Graubard said. They have yet to work out ''an elegant look that doesn't rely on ill-fitting suits and bad colors.''
The $2,500 Valentino suit that Ms. Palin wore at the Republican convention is cited by Ms. Graubard as an example. ''The quality was an improvement over typical campaign wear, but the styling certainly didn't push any envelope,'' she said. Despite her pricey fashion face-lift, Ms. Palin, she said, ''looked like a mall mom.''
Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, has attempted to temper such arguments with a dose of common sense. Writing last week in Slate, he argued that flamboyance and politics are mutually exclusive. ''Leave the Cavalli jumpsuits and Balmain new-punk to we constituents,'' Mr. Doonan pleaded.
While common sense would seem to dictate that an essentially conservative formula is being adopted chiefly by women over 45, that is not necessarily the case. In matters of wardrobe there is no discernible generational divide, according to Ms. Jahnke. The tendency among women of varying ages is to adopt a style that is ''office appropriate,'' she said, ''and that by definition is conservative.''
There is a generational divide in the way these women approach their appearance. ''Younger women almost instinctively know they have to pay attention to how they look,'' Ms. Jahnke said. ''They'll say: 'Help me fix my hair. What makeup do I need for high-definition television?' '' Older women, she said, tend to be less focused on appearance. ''You need to convince or cajole them to update their hairstyle, their eyeglasses, their suits.''
Didi Barrett, a Democratic candidate for the State Senate in New York, favors a wardrobe of all-occasion shirt-jackets custom-tailored by a seamstress in Rhinebeck, N.Y. At a Democratic rally in Hyde Park last week, she wore a plain-Jane teal jacket and windowpane shawl. ''When you are courting voters,'' she said, ''you need to accommodate their expectations.''
Barbara Jeter-Jackson, who represents Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in the Dutchess County legislature, was turned out at the rally in a chalk-stripe pantsuit that echoed the garb of her constituents, who, regardless of age, for the most part wore unlined jackets or cardigans and loose pants. Ms. Jeter-Jackson made sure her suit would violate no unofficial taboos. After all, as she said, a woman in office ''can't be too provocative.''
OR too careful, it would seem. In an age of punctilious correctness, commenting on a candidate's attire is perceived more than ever as trivializing, if not sexist or downright demeaning. Yet women seeking office continue to attract the kind of physical scrutiny that is rarely directed at a man.
In a 2008 article, ''Cutting Women Out: The Media's Bias Against Female Candidates,'' Erika Falk, who studied eight races in the 2008 elections, concluded that ''coverage of how women candidates look -- while ignoring such observations about men candidates -- has been an ongoing problem.''
Ms. Falk, who runs the master's degree program in communication at Johns Hopkins University, found that each of eight female candidates that year received about ''four physical descriptions for every one that described a man.'' At the time, she added, about 29 percent of articles about Hillary Clinton contained a physical description.''
''Historically, we've associated masculinity with leadership,'' Ms. Falk said in an interview. ''If you're a woman politician, it makes pretty good sense to come off in a stereotypically masculine way.''
To ignore that assessment is to invite the pointed and often distracting comments that continue to pepper mainstream media coverage. A July profile of Ms. Haley in Newsweek began by observing that the candidate wore ''a snug, saffron-colored suit and stilettos you could impale a small animal with.''
In September the Daily News coyly observed that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who is seeking re-election in New York, has become ''a leaner, meaner campaign machine ... showing a slimmer silhouette as a tough election battle looms.''
Only last week the Daily News took a swipe at Mrs. Clinton, observing that she ''has had more hairstyles than a beauty-school dummy.''
Senator Gillibrand, who, with Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, is often singled out as a smartly tailored fashion role model, likes to deflect that sort of commentary. ''You would never write about Chuck Schumer's shoes,'' she told a reporter for New York magazine in response to a question about her flats.
Yet she submitted to a fashion makeover in the November issue of Vogue, shedding her earnest navy or gray tailored suits for a form-fitting Michael Kors sheath and a reefer coat. Was Vogue's sartorial endorsement a boost or bane for her campaign? Senator Gillibrand's office declined to comment.
Which underscores the quandary. Ignore current fashion and you risk seeming out of touch. Embrace it too warmly and you undermine your credibility. Ms. Bachmann, it might be argued, is a case in point. Her expensive-looking wardrobe, Ms. Jahnke maintained, ''puts her out of step with her district,'' which has a high unemployment rate.
A successful politician, Mr. Doonan wrote in Slate, must appear Prada-oblivious: ''Any hint of dandyism or vanity would indicate a superficial, self-indulgent character.''
Politicians, he added, ''dress as to be unremarkable.''
He might have been describing Ms. Barrett, the State Senate candidate, who has tried to distance herself from flashier peers by giving up the biker boots and folkloric scarves she wore in her pre-stump days. Appearance is a concern, she acknowledged. ''But in the pecking order of campaign priorities, I don't think it's a significant one.''
Still, she said, after a beat, ''When I see myself on television, I think, 'Ah, image.' ''

HEADLINE: EBay's 3rd-Quarter Income Rose 23%

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- EBay's efforts to revive its auction and retail operations showed limited success in the third quarter while its PayPal online payments service continued to flourish. 
EBay reported Wednesday that net income in the quarter rose 23 percent, to $431.9 million, or 33 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter.
The company said on Wednesday that revenue remained flat at $2.2 billion. Excluding Skype, which eBay sold last year, revenue increased 10 percent.
EBay's adjusted profit of 40 cents was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 37 cents a share and revenue of $2.18 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.
''We delivered strong third-quarter results, with great performance at PayPal and stable results at eBay,'' John J. Donahoe, eBay's chief executive, said in a statement.
The company, based in San Jose, Calif., said that revenue for its marketplace grew only 3 percent, to $1.41 billion, while revenue from its payment unit grew 22 percent, to $838 million.
EBay issued a better than expected prediction for the current quarter, which propelled its shares up nearly 7 percent to $26.23 in after-hours trading Wednesday. EBay forecast revenue of $2.39 to $2.49 billion and adjusted income of45 cents to 48 cents per share, above the analyst expectation of 44 cents a share.
EBay's shares rose 13 cents, to $25.66, in regular trading Wednesday.
Mr. Donahoe is trying to reinvigorate eBay's marketplace in the face of a slump in buying and selling on the site.
Users had grown increasingly disenchanted with eBay's creaky technology and mounting fees. A stiff challenge from Amazon.com and other online retailers has also eroded business.
Mr. Donahoe's strategy is to overhaul the marketplace through a series of technology upgrades while reducing the fees users pay up front to list items for sale.
The one undisputable bright spot at eBay is its PayPal online payments business, which has grown rapidly despite the gloomy economy. EBay is enticing an increasing number of companies and consumers to use the service for transactions outside of eBay's marketplace, including airlines and online retailers.
Last month, eBay removed much of the uncertainty about its third-quarter results by updating its financial guidance to the higher end of its original projection.

HEADLINE: Charities Gain Traction in Marathons

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
When Max Lieberman saw a break in the line, he ran. Officers leading the Auschwitz death march shot him, but he kept sprinting through the woods until he collapsed in a field. Farmers nursed him to health, and he never wanted to run again.
More than 65 years later, Izzy Lieberman will traverse the five boroughs of the New York City Marathon to honor his father's escape in Poland and to help others whose post-Holocaust journeys have become increasingly difficult to bear.
''I think of him every morning when I'm running,'' Lieberman said of his father, Max, who died of pancreatic cancer a decade ago, ''and I'm just pushing it and pushing it.''
Lieberman, 51, guaranteed his entry into the Nov. 7 marathon by raising money for the Blue Card, a fund that assists destitute Holocaust survivors in the United States. In the field of 43,000, 7,400 will be running for charity, an increasingly viable way to get into the coveted race for those who do not beat the long lottery odds, qualify by time or live near enough to participate in 10 required races in New York. 
Running for charity has been a common way to enter other major marathons for decades -- especially in London, where nearly 80 percent of the field of 36,550 ran for charities in 2010, raising $81 million. It is a fairly new phenomenon, however, in New York.
The Blue Card is among 86 charity teams, up from 14 in 2006, when New York started its program. In addition, 104 community charity teams from the New York area will each have 5 to 10 entries. The New York Road Runners, the nonprofit organization that operates the race, estimated that $26.2 million would be raised, about $2 million more than last year's total and $15 million more than in 2006.
''It's so compelling,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the Road Runners' chief executive. ''The potential we have to have a huge, positive impact on these charities encourages us to be really creative and persistent to increase that impact.''
Yet race officials are trying to balance the rapid growth of the program -- which not only benefits the charities, but the Road Runners, too -- with its possible pitfalls. New York's symbiotic financial model reveals the delicate dance of business and philanthropy.
The Road Runners' minimum fund-raising requirement is $2,500 per runner, which individual charities can set higher. Some may pay the money out of their own pockets just for the privilege of running in the race. In exchange for a high-profile fund-raising platform, the charities pay nonrefundable upfront fees that range from $525 to $950 per entry, depending on perks like advertising, and tents and buses on race day. Such an arrangement brings more than $3.8 million to the Road Runners. Wittenberg said that pays for administration costs, transportation, insurance, medical staff and other race-day items for the marathon runners, in addition to supporting the 58 races and fitness initiatives the organization offers year-round.
Charities like the American Cancer Society, with 300 entries, or Livestrong, with 185, have no trouble generating interest and high-level donations, and by the Oct. 5 deadline, 96 percent of the teams sold out, said Richard Hulnick, the Road Runners charity director.
The New York-based Team Continuum, which is raising money to support families of cancer patients and whose founder, Paul Nicholls, persuaded the Road Runners in 2004 to develop its program, struggled this year. Although partnering with Donna Karan, who designed its race T-shirts, the team will be stuck with 50 unused entries out of the nearly 300 it requested.
''It's a big loss for us, through nobody's fault but the economy,'' Letty Simon, Team Continuum's chief operating officer, said.
The charities apply for entry, then negotiate with the Road Runners for the number of slots.
''We want charities to sell out and we work really hard to manage the numbers,'' Wittenberg said. ''In the future we'll go to smaller allocations.''
The Blue Card shows that modest direction -- for now. The team grew to 55 runners, from 35 last year, and repeatedly appealed to the Road Runners for more entries, even buying some from another charity that could not fill its slots.
''This marathon brought a lot of visibility to the organization and to the cause,'' said Elie Rubinstein, the executive director of the Blue Card. ''The elderly is not so much a sexy cause.''
Founded in 1934 in Germany to aid Jews in financial distress, the Blue Card now works with Jewish social service agencies in communities in the United States. It provides additional support to Holocaust survivors, like meals and clothing, and sends $100 birthday checks to as many as 2,000 of the estimated 25,000 impoverished survivors in this country.
In New York, the team expects to raise $140,000, all for Holocaust survivors, Rubinstein said, because philanthropic support covers the Blue Card's administration costs.
Few members knew the charity existed before they joined. The team's founder, Michelle Hersh of Camas, Wash., learned about it from her teenage daughter, who was completing a service project.
''I just felt this incredible drawing to this charity because there are people who went through this absolute hell,'' said Hersh, who lobbied the Road Runners for a year to include the Blue Card. ''They are in this state of destitution where they don't know whether they eat or get vitamins, and they have no one. We have to help.''
Because of the success of the program in New York, the Blue Card now fields teams for the Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta marathons. Its participation in New York demonstrates how the charity movement there has come full circle.
Fred Lebow, the founder of the race, opposed the concept of paying to run and believed charities would drain resources from the club. Yet when he was treated for brain cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, he saw the benefit of fund-raising for children's cancer research. Fred's Team, formed in 1991, became the first official charity of the race.
For Lebow, who died in 1994, the Blue Card's mission would have also had personal significance. Born Fishl Lebowitz in Arad, Romania, he survived the Holocaust as a teenager, hiding first in his native Romania and then in Bulgaria, and living as a refugee in England and Ireland before coming to the United States.
''I didn't think of it as what Fred would approve of,'' Hulnick said. ''I thought it was something we had no representation for -- there was nothing else like it. For example, we don't want 10 autism charities; we want a broad spectrum.''
Not all of the Blue Card members are Jewish. Jesse Dean, 39, of Hoboken, N.J., grew up as a Jehovah's Witness in rural Montana, where he learned that members of his faith were sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust.
''For me, it's an opportunity to express the history of hatred toward people who are perceived as different, and to encourage openness,'' said Dean, who works with elderly volunteers in New York.
He is halfway to his goal, directing friends and colleagues to the Web site Imathlete.com, which facilitates fund-raising. (Imathlete charges a lower percentage for administration fees than Crowdrise.com, with which the Road Runners partners.)
''People have been generous,'' Dean said. ''The first question I usually get is, 'There are still Holocaust survivors?' ''
Aviva Gat, 22, from Manhattan Beach, Calif., does not need to ask. She is running again this year because her grandmother Rachel is a Holocaust survivor living in Israel.
''She's very frail,'' Gat said, ''and I know if she is like that because of the war, so many others are, too.''
Lieberman, an orthopedic surgeon from Plano, Tex., has raised $5,000 from friends, many of whom were also children of survivors. At first he wanted to enter his own charity, the Uganda Spine Mission, but missed the application deadline in June. He then saw the Blue Card on the marathon's Web site and knew it was the right avenue for his first marathon.
''My father,'' Lieberman said, ''will be with me every step of the way.''

HEADLINE: New Cast Enters Fight In Accounting

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As the great accounting fight of the past decade moves near to a conclusion that seems likely to satisfy no one, the cast of characters is suddenly changing. The two most important accounting bodies in the world will be under new leadership as they try to move on from bruising battles that have pitted them against banks, bank regulators and politicians.
The changes are coming before it is clear just how far the two boards -- the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules in the United States, and the International Accounting Standards Board, whose rules are followed in a growing number of countries -- will have to back down in their efforts to force banks to report the current value of their assets.
Both boards have made concessions that alarmed some believers in the use of market values, but neither has fully satisfied powerful critics in the banks, who have gathered support from bank regulators and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Robert H. Herz, the chairman of the American group since 2002, stepped down at the beginning of this month. His decision, announced in late August, came as a surprise to many accountants. A replacement for David Tweedie, the chairman of the international group since 2001, was picked last week, although Mr. Tweedie's term will not end until mid-2011.
The new leaders will play a major role in shaping accounting rules around the world. It will become clear how successful the two boards are being at producing ''convergence'' of their rules, and decisions will be made by the Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to allow international rules to be used by American companies instead of the traditional generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which are set by the American board.
Differing views of the proper role of accounting rule makers around the world are at stake. In the United States, there is general support for the concept that rules should be set by independent experts, although that has not kept politicians from intervening at times, as they have in the fair-value debate. That idea of using market values is generally supported in Britain but has much less support in continental Europe, particularly in France.
Some American supporters of independent rule-making fear that a decision to move to the international rules may mean making unwelcome compromises. Some in Europe fear -- and others hope -- that American involvement will restrain European politicians from exercising the influence they desire.
The arguments over the use of market value -- or fair value, as the accounting rules characterize the numbers -- have polarized accounting debates. Banks complained bitterly that the limited rules forcing the use of market value for some assets contributed to the financial crisis, first by exaggerating their wealth as prices rose and then by making them appear worse than they really were when market prices plunged to unreasonably low levels.
That argument was exaggerated. The securities on which the banks lost the most money -- largely mortgage-backed bonds -- had not soared in price, and so had not made the banks look better. But banks had been so confident that the securities could not lose value that they borrowed heavily to own more and more of them, leaving them vulnerable to the collapse. When that came, however, there were no buyers. Many of the few trades that were made did take place at distressed prices.
The first assault by banks on fair value was aimed at preventing them from having to recognize such distressed prices as being fair, and they largely succeeded in that as both boards hurriedly put out advice under political pressure. The American board acted after Mr. Herz was called to a Congressional hearing and was berated by legislators from both parties.
After that, under heavy pressure to act quickly, the two boards chose differing courses. The international board adopted a new rule in record time concerning which assets had to be carried at market value. It generally allowed banks to ignore market values of loans, as they wished. But the board put off some other issues.
The American board put forth a stronger and more comprehensive proposal. That proposed rule would allow banks to keep losses from falling loan values off their income statements, but the banks would be forced to show market-value numbers prominently. Banks, and their regulators, complained loudly.
Mr. Herz told me this week that his decision to step down was not forced, but it appeared to have cleared the way for the board to soften its proposal. His temporary successor, Leslie F. Seidman, had opposed issuing the proposed rule. The board recently said that its consultations with investors and analysts -- known as users of financial statements -- had shown splits on the issue, with bank analysts more likely to go along with the companies they covered.
Some who question fair value worry that determining the figures will be difficult and ultimately subjective, at least for assets that are not readily traded. At the same time, there is little doubt that the actual value of an asset, not what was paid for it, is usually more relevant in evaluating the financial health of a company. ''It is better to be vaguely right than to be precisely wrong,'' Roman Weil, an accounting professor at New York University, said at an N.Y.U. conference this week.
Banks and bank regulators have frequently complained that market-value accounting is ''pro-cyclical,'' meaning it makes banks seem richer, and therefore more willing to lend, during booms, when restraint might be appropriate, and less willing to lend during busts, when the economy may need more lending.
Mr. Herz has repeatedly argued that such decisions are properly made by bank regulators, but that accounting should reveal the actual facts, not sugar-coated ones. At the same N.Y.U. conference, he said the account statements he received from Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis were also pro-cyclical, since they made him and his wife feel poorer and less willing to spend. Perhaps, he said, Merrill should have been told to send out more palatable numbers.
It now seems likely that the American board will back off at least part of the way from its proposal, although it is not clear how far it will go. The foundation that appoints members of the American board has decided to expand it to seven members, raising the possibility that new members might be more amenable to compromises. Ms. Seidman wants to stay as head of the board, but no decision on that will be made until early next year.
Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the S.E.C., said in an interview this week that he feared ''independent standard setting is in greater jeopardy than at any time since the F.A.S.B. was formed.'' He added, ''I don't see any power at all on the side of fair value. Because of the power of the banks and the actions of the Congress, the battle is well on its way to being decided.''
Mr. Levitt knows about political pressure. In the 1990s, when he was chairman of the S.E.C., Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut threatened to legislate against F.A.S.B. if it did not back down on efforts to force companies to show the value of stock options granted to employees as an expense. Mr. Levitt quietly advised the board to retreat, which it did, and that rule was not adopted for another decade. He later said that was the worst decision he had made as chairman.
The new chairman of the international board will be Hans Hoogervorst, a Dutch regulator and a former government minister. He has also been chairman of a group that monitored the international board on behalf of governments, but he is not an accountant and not an expert on technical rules. An Australian accountant, Ian Mackintosh, who is currently chairman of the British accounting standards board, was chosen as vice chairman.
The international board under Mr. Tweedie was at times very controversial, particularly in France, where bankers were angry over earlier efforts to increase the use of fair value.
In 2003, Claude Bebear, then the chairman of AXA, the French insurer and perhaps the most influential business leader in the country, called Mr. Tweedie ''a super-super-ayatollah'' who ''has a fascination with market value.''
European politicians expressed horror that the board was not answerable to democratic bodies. The European Commission asserted the right to approve any new accounting rule before it took effect in Europe, and it ruled that companies could ignore part of a rule accounting for derivative securities, something French banks have done. The commission also appointed a group, known as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, to advise on whether new rules were warranted.
The chairwoman of that group, Francoise Flores, a French accountant, said after Mr. Hoogervorst was named that ''this appointment will help strike a good balance between the accountability and the independence of the international standard setter.''
Such comments bothered some Americans. ''It is a strange balance,'' said Stephen Zeff, an accounting professor at Rice University who has written extensively on international accounting rule-making. The board, he said, should be accountable to the users of financial statements, and for that independence was crucial.
In an interview, Mr. Hoogervorst tried to stake out a middle ground. He said it was ''very clear that fair-value accounting has done a lot of good things. It has brought a lot of transparency. It forces financial institutions to recognize problems as soon as possible.'' Had Japanese banks done that after the country's asset bubble burst two decades ago, he said, they would have been better off.
''At the same time,'' he added, he approved of ''the pragmatic approach the I.A.S.B. ultimately took.''
Mr. Hoogervorst served as co-chairman of a body that advised the two accounting boards on the financial crisis, and concluded that a large part of the problem was that the banks had been allowed by regulators to take on too much leverage during the good time.
''Essentially, the banking industry is a welfare state within the market economy,'' he said in a speech this year. ''The main difference with the normal welfare state is that the benefits are very high and that they are usually determined by the recipients themselves.''

HEADLINE: British Fashion Victims

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In the spring of 2010, fiscal austerity became fashionable. I use the term advisedly: the sudden consensus among Very Serious People that everyone must balance budgets now now now wasn't based on any kind of careful analysis. It was more like a fad, something everyone professed to believe because that was what the in-crowd was saying.
And it's a fad that has been fading lately, as evidence has accumulated that the lessons of the past remain relevant, that trying to balance budgets in the face of high unemployment and falling inflation is still a really bad idea. Most notably, the confidence fairy has been exposed as a myth. There have been widespread claims that deficit-cutting actually reduces unemployment because it reassures consumers and businesses; but multiple studies of historical record, including one by the International Monetary Fund, have shown that this claim has no basis in reality. 
No widespread fad ever passes, however, without leaving some fashion victims in its wake. In this case, the victims are the people of Britain, who have the misfortune to be ruled by a government that took office at the height of the austerity fad and won't admit that it was wrong.
Britain, like America, is suffering from the aftermath of a housing and debt bubble. Its problems are compounded by London's role as an international financial center: Britain came to rely too much on profits from wheeling and dealing to drive its economy -- and on financial-industry tax payments to pay for government programs.
Over-reliance on the financial industry largely explains why Britain, which came into the crisis with relatively low public debt, has seen its budget deficit soar to 11 percent of G.D.P. -- slightly worse than the U.S. deficit. And there's no question that Britain will eventually need to balance its books with spending cuts and tax increases.
The operative word here should, however, be ''eventually.'' Fiscal austerity will depress the economy further unless it can be offset by a fall in interest rates. Right now, interest rates in Britain, as in America, are already very low, with little room to fall further. The sensible thing, then, is to devise a plan for putting the nation's fiscal house in order, while waiting until a solid economic recovery is under way before wielding the ax.
But trendy fashion, almost by definition, isn't sensible -- and the British government seems determined to ignore the lessons of history.
Both the new British budget announced on Wednesday and the rhetoric that accompanied the announcement might have come straight from the desk of Andrew Mellon, the Treasury secretary who told President Herbert Hoover to fight the Depression by liquidating the farmers, liquidating the workers, and driving down wages. Or if you prefer more British precedents, it echoes the Snowden budget of 1931, which tried to restore confidence but ended up deepening the economic crisis.
The British government's plan is bold, say the pundits -- and so it is. But it boldly goes in exactly the wrong direction. It would cut government employment by 490,000 workers -- the equivalent of almost three million layoffs in the United States -- at a time when the private sector is in no position to provide alternative employment. It would slash spending at a time when private demand isn't at all ready to take up the slack.
Why is the British government doing this? The real reason has a lot to do with ideology: the Tories are using the deficit as an excuse to downsize the welfare state. But the official rationale is that there is no alternative.
Indeed, there has been a noticeable change in the rhetoric of the government of Prime Minister David Cameron over the past few weeks -- a shift from hope to fear. In his speech announcing the budget plan, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, seemed to have given up on the confidence fairy -- that is, on claims that the plan would have positive effects on employment and growth.
Instead, it was all about the apocalypse looming if Britain failed to go down this route. Never mind that British debt as a percentage of national income is actually below its historical average; never mind that British interest rates stayed low even as the nation's budget deficit soared, reflecting the belief of investors that the country can and will get its finances under control. Britain, declared Mr. Osborne, was on the ''brink of bankruptcy.''
What happens now? Maybe Britain will get lucky, and something will come along to rescue the economy. But the best guess is that Britain in 2011 will look like Britain in 1931, or the United States in 1937, or Japan in 1997. That is, premature fiscal austerity will lead to a renewed economic slump. As always, those who refuse to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.

HEADLINE: Big Loads on a 2-Lane Byway

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; Rajah Bose contributed reporting from Lewiston, Idaho.

 BODY:
KOOSKIA, Idaho -- As U.S. Highway 12 hugs the serpentine banks of the Clearwater and Lochsa Rivers here, road signs bear the silhouettes of the 19th-century explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, with Mr. Lewis pointing off into the distance.
He is not pointing the way for big oil companies, says Lin Laughy, whose gravel driveway abuts the road.
But to Mr. Laughy's dismay, international oil companies see this meandering, backcountry route as a road to riches. They are angling to use U.S. 12 to ship gargantuan loads of equipment from Vancouver, Wash., to Montana and the tar sands of Alberta in Canada. The companies say the route would save time and money and provide a vital economic boost to Montana and Idaho.
The problem, said Mr. Laughy, is that the proposed loads are so large -- and would travel so slowly -- that they would literally block the highway as they rolled through. According to plans submitted to state regulators, some of the shipments would weigh more than 600,000 pounds, stand as tall as a three-story building, stretch nearly two-thirds the length of a football field and occupy 24 feet side-to-side -- the full width of U.S. 12's two lanes for much of its course through Idaho. 
Mr. Laughy and his wife, Borg Hendrickson, have sued the state to stop the shipments by Imperial Oil and ConocoPhillips, arguing that the loads would threaten the integrity of Idaho's historic portion of U.S. 12, as well as the safety of communities that depend on it as the main road in and out of the area.
National environmental groups and climate change activists are supporting their efforts, seeing a broader opportunity to stall development of Canada's oil sands, which they denounce as a dirty source of energy.
''If you'd asked us six months ago whether we'd be in the middle of all this, we'd have laughed,'' said Mr. Laughy, 68, who has the carriage and countenance of a Santa Claus and conducts heritage tours of the area. ''But we're resigned now to the fact that there's going to be a major war.''
The companies' plans call for the oil field equipment, manufactured in Asia, to be delivered to the port of Vancouver, then floated on barges for some 300 miles up the Columbia and Snake Rivers to Lewiston in western Idaho. From there, the equipment would inch its way along Idaho's stretch of U.S. 12, through the Clearwater National Forest, into Montana and points beyond.
Imperial Oil, the Canadian unit of ExxonMobil, hopes to move 207 separate ''modules'' from a manufacturer in South Korea to its $7.1 billion Kearl Lake oil sands project near Fort McMurray in Alberta. ConocoPhillips wants to transport two gigantic coke drums, manufactured in Asia and delivered to Lewiston in May, down much of the same route to a refinery in Billings, Mont.
The proposed route could shave thousands of miles of transportation costs for such shipments, which might otherwise be forced to travel through the Panama Canal to overland routes accessed through Houston or New Orleans. Interstates and other wide highways are typically not an option, in part because overpasses are too low.
Transportation officials in Idaho and Montana say that their roads -- with some modifications made and paid for by the companies, including additional pullouts along the route and raised or buried power lines -- could handle the shipments. The plan calls for the loads to move only at night and in start-and-stop fashion, going down the road for a short time, then pulling over to let other traffic pass. For Imperial Oil's trips, it would take the trucks nine nights to cover the 510-mile route through Idaho and Montana.
''We have done our level best to ensure, if given approval, that we can move these modules safely,'' said Pius Rolheiser, an Imperial spokesman.
Eighteen-wheelers already traverse U.S. 12 here, which serves as a gateway to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness area, one of the largest tracts of virgin wildland in the contiguous United States. The road is also part of two national trails tracing routes followed by the Nez Perce tribe and Lewis and Clark.
But Mr. Laughy, whose home sits on a ridge above U.S. 12, about 75 miles east of Lewiston, says the oil equipment is different. He points to thin margins of error along U.S. 12, where the road slices a tight path between rising rock walls on one side and a quick drop-off to the river on the other. He also fears that sooner or later, an emergency vehicle rushing toward a fire or delivering someone to a hospital will be slowed by the meandering shipments, potentially costing lives.
''The companies say they have no plans to make this a permanent corridor,'' he said. ''But once the first shipment is allowed, what's to stop the next one, and then the next one?''
Supporters of the shipments say they would inject millions of dollars into struggling rural economies along the route. ''This wouldn't be just an economic benefit for Lewiston,'' said David Doeringsfeld, manager of the Port of Lewiston, ''but for all of north-central Idaho.''
Mr. Doeringsfeld said he had been approached by several other companies interested in using the corridor.
In May, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson started a Web site called Fighting Goliath, which serves as a clearinghouse of information related to the megaloads, as the shipments are called. The site has since drawn the attention of regional and national environmental activists, and a movement has mobilized around the goal of stopping the loads.
''I have never really seen so many people have such a unified voice against a project,'' said Nick Stocks, a co-founder of Northern Rockies Rising Tide, a climate change advocacy group in Missoula, Mont., which is also on the proposed route.
Environmentalists abhor Canada's oil sands -- a gooey mixture of sand, clay and bitumen that can be refined into crude oil -- as an energy-intensive and highly polluting energy source that generates large amounts of greenhouse gases.
But the oil sands are also one of the largest sources of foreign oil for the United States, and they are poised for further development. A proposed pipeline awaiting approval by American officials would add 1.1 million barrels of Canadian oil to the roughly two million already imported to the United States each day -- much of it from the tar sands.
No permits have been issued yet in Montana. But when the Idaho Transportation Department granted a permit to ConocoPhillips in August, Mr. Laughy and Ms. Hendrickson, joined by a neighbor down the road and represented by the environmental law firm Advocates for the West, promptly sued the department, arguing that it had failed to adequately consider the safety and convenience of the public, as its own rules stipulate.
A lower court agreed. The case now rests with the Idaho State Supreme Court, which heard arguments on Oct. 1. and is expected to render a decision any day.
Meanwhile, both sides seem confident that they will prevail. Imperial has already floated the first of its 207 modules up the river to Lewiston, and it plans to move 40 of them there by early December.
Mr. Laughy, meanwhile, said that even if the court ruled against him, other obstacles -- legal and physical -- would probably emerge to stop the shipments.
''We're really very nice people,'' Mr. Laughy said. ''Unless you're a big oil company.''

 BODY:
School cafeterias are much criticized for offering the kind of snack foods and desserts that contribute to childhood obesity. But banning junk food from cafeterias, as some schools have tried, or serving only escarole or tofu, can backfire. Students then skip lunch, bring in their own snacks or head out for fast food. We've even seen some pizzas delivered to a side door. 
Children and teenagers resist heavy-handed nutritional policies -- and the food that is associated with the heavy hand. No food is nutritious, after all, until it is actually eaten.
A smarter lunchroom wouldn't be draconian. Rather, it would nudge students toward making better choices on their own by changing the way their options are presented. One school we have observed in upstate New York, for instance, tripled the number of salads students bought simply by moving the salad bar away from the wall and placing it in front of the cash registers.
Experiments that we and other researchers have done in cafeterias at high schools, middle schools and summer camp programs, as well as in laboratories, have revealed many ways to use behavioral psychology to coax children to eat better. Here are a dozen such strategies that work without requiring drastic or expensive changes in school menus.

HEADLINE: Fannie and Freddie: 3 Bailout Forecasts

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be winding down with relatively little additional cost to taxpayers so long as the economy continues to recover. But if the economy tips back into recession, the bailout could nearly double in size, according to new government projections announced on Thursday.
The troubled mortgage companies are likely to require about $19 billion in additional federal aid over the next three years, according to a projection by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
If the economy recovers more quickly than expected, the projections show that the companies could need as little as $6 billion in new aid. By contrast, if the economy falls into recession, the companies could need another $124 billion.
The Treasury Department has spent $135 billion on Fannie and Freddie since they were seized by the government in 2008, to cover their losses on soured mortgage loans. The government is propping up the two companies to make sure that money remains available for mortgage loans. Even under the worst case detailed on Thursday by the housing finance agency, the pace of new cash infusions would decline sharply.
The agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, said that it was publishing the numbers to inform public debate about the future of the two companies. The Obama administration plans to propose changes to the government's role in housing finance early next year.
''These projections are intended to give policy makers and the public useful snapshots of potential outcomes for the taxpayer support of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' said Edward J. DeMarco, the agency's acting director.
Other estimates of the cost of cleaning up the two companies have ranged widely, with some financial industry analysts quoting numbers as high as $1 trillion.
Fannie and Freddie could face additional losses as a growing number of homeowners challenge the legality of foreclosures, citing evidence that some mortgage service firms have not complied with the legal requirements to seize a home. Delays in the foreclosure process cost the companies money; more serious disruptions, like court orders preventing home seizures, would be even more expensive. The companies have said they will seek compensation from servicers to cover any such losses.
The Obama administration welcomed the latest government projections, which it said underscored that the companies had largely ended the practices that led to the losses, so that loans they bought in recent years were not causing new problems.
''In the most likely economic scenario, nearly 90 percent of the losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are already behind us,'' Jeffrey A. Goldstein, the Treasury Department's under secretary for domestic finance, said in a statement.
He added, however, that success in stabilizing the companies ''should not distract us from the pressing need for reform so that taxpayers aren't put on the hook in the future.''
The new projections could vindicate the initial estimates of the Bush administration that saving the two companies would require no more than $200 billion. The Obama administration said it would provide as much as $400 billion in aid, and then removed the limit entirely, promising to provide all necessary funds.
So far, Treasury has pumped $148 billion into the two companies. In return, the companies have paid dividends to the federal government totaling $13 billion, meaning that the net cost to taxpayers stands at $135 billion. Because the companies are losing money, the dividend payments come directly from the money provided by Treasury, basically refinancing a portion of the government's aid.
In coming up with the latest aid projections, the housing finance agency performed three sets of stress tests on the companies, each reflecting a different set of assumptions about the economy.
In the bleakest case, the economy would return to recession and housing prices would tumble again, falling 45 percent in total from the peak levels of 2006. The companies might then require another $215 billion from Treasury, of which they would return $91 billion in the form of dividend payments. The total cost to taxpayers: $259 billion, including the $135 billion already spent, or new assistance of $124 billion.
In the most optimistic case, housing prices would hit bottom this fall, about 31 percent below the 2006 peak, and then begin to recover as the economy continues to grow. The companies might then require another $73 billion in aid, of which they would return $67 billion in dividend payments. The total cost to taxpayers: $141 billion, only slightly more than the $135 billion that has already been spent.
The agency says that it considers the third, intermediate case to be the most likely. Housing prices would continue to decline until next fall, bottoming out 34 percent below 2006 prices, and then begin a slow recovery. Fannie and Freddie might then require about $90 billion in aid, of which they would return $71 billion in dividend payments. The total cost to taxpayers would be $19 billion on top of the $135 billion already provided, or a total of $154 billion.
Under both of the more moderate assumptions, the agency projects that Freddie Mac would return to profitability and begin to make dividend payments from those profits rather than simply refinancing its federal aid.
