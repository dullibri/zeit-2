HEADLINE: House Rejects a Proposal to Shift Military Money to Social Programs

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The House today decisively rejected a Democratic budget plan that would have shifted more than $6 billion in military savings to social programs next year by breaking the 1990 budget agreement between Congress and the White House.
The defeat had been expected by the Democratic leadership, which had delayed floor action on the bill for three weeks in a futile attempt to attract support from conservative and moderate Democrats. 
 But the margin of the defeat was wider than expected, underscoring the weakening of the leaders, who have come under heavy criticism for their handling of the scandals surrounding the House bank and the House post office. The plan was rejected by a vote of 238 to 187, with 76 Democrats joining 162 Republicans in opposing it. .
 
Paying Off the Deficit
 The debate that preceded the vote was highly partisan. Republicans said fiscal responsibility demanded that any savings from military cutbacks be applied to reducing the size of the Federal deficit, as the 1990 budget agreement provided. But Democrats who backed the proposal contended that they represented the interests of working-class and middle-class people trying to survive the recession.
"We must decide whether we stay on a cold-war footing or recognize that defense savings can be invested here at home for the first time in a half-century," said Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee.
The House action today followed the March 6 passage of the $1.26 trillion Democratic budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. That budget resolution would cut Pentagon spending by $15 billion more than the $10 billion that the White House has proposed, and it offered two alternatives for $9 billion of the savings.
Under one of those alternatives, 70 percent of that money would have been reallocated to education, housing and other social programs. With that proposal defeated today, all the savings would now go toward deficit reduction.
The Senate has yet to pass a budget bill.

HEADLINE: Sanctions on Libya Likely To Fuel Qaddafi's Chaos

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 31

 BODY:
The United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya today appear likely to worsen the indecision and disorganization that are already hallmarks of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's 23-year rule.
But even though the stepped-up pressure may embolden competing factions within the Libyan Government in pursuing their divergent agendas, it is unclear whether the sanctions will bring about the kind of internal collision that the West appears to hope for as a prelude to the fall of Colonel Qaddafi. 
 Arab diplomats pointed out that Colonel Qaddafi has long proven adept at exploiting the seemingly chaotic divisions beneath him in the Libyan leadership.
"There are now pressures in Libya to change policies, but the larger truth is that Qaddafi holds all the strings, playing one group against the other," said Mansour Kikhia, a former Libyan Foreign Minister and now a member of the Libyan opposition living in exile here. "If there is one thing Qaddafi truly believes, it is that if you plant more confusion you defer problems."
 
Competing Tribal Clans
 The diplomatic negotiations of recent weeks, in which Libya sought a way out of the crisis brought on by the West's demand that it hand over two agents accused of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, have already illustrated Libya's rising internal struggle, in which competing clans of tribal allies and army officers are vying to dominate Government policies.
The most powerful of the clans is a group led by Maj. Abusallam Jalloud, who is widely viewed as the Government's second-ranking official after Colonel Qaddafi. Major Jalloud -- thought to be Colonel Qaddafi's closest friend until just a few years ago, when the two apparently began to differ on policy -- has supported Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria at the same time Colonel Qaddafi urged their suppression.
A few days ago, even as Libyan Ambassadors were saying that they were willing to cooperate with the United Nations, Major Jalloud said Libya would burn its oilfields rather than yield to Western pressure.
Major Jalloud's influence rests on about 25,000 youthful armed members of so-called revolutionary committees, many of whom hail from the major's Al Majarhah tribe. His claim on power is considerable enough for Colonel Qaddafi to tolerate his public dissent.
 
Tolerable Hardships
 Another group ascendent in Libya politics is closely allied with neighboring Egypt and led by Ahmad Kaddafeddem, the Egyptian-born cousin of colonel Qaddafi. A third faction is led by the Colonel's brother-in-law, Addallah Senousi, who is one of his closest aides.
Mr. Kaddafeddema, man in his early 40's, is "general coordinator" of Egyptian-Libyan relations and until recently strongly advocated drawing closer to Cairo as a way to benefit from Egypt's close relationship with the United States and the West. Mr. Senousi also advocates closer ties with the West, but away from the tutelage of Egypt.
Libya has endured economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Britain for some time. Today's action by the United Nations widens the burden on Libya to include a ban on flights to or from the country, on bans on arms and aircraft sales, and a significant reduction in the number of Libyan diplomats in United Nations member countries. Those represent a tolerable increase in hardships for Libya, in the view of several Arab diplomats.
What really frightens Libyans is the prospect of a far more comprehensive international ban on trade with Libya, resembling the one observed now by the United States alone. If European countries, particularly Italy and Germany, were to stop the import of Libyan crude oil, such a ban would hurt the Libyan economy deeply.
Equally alarming to Tripoli is the prospect of seeing the country's considerable assets in Western Europe frozen or seized, much as Iraq's are. Those assets include oil refineries, a group of gasoline stations as well as a recently acquired share in a British hotel chain.
But Italy and Germany rely heavily on Libyan oil, partly because of the short shipping distance across the Mediterranean and partly because light Libyan crude is considered of high quality for refining. It would be more difficult for Italy and Germany to replace the one million barrels of oil a day they import from Libya than it would for Libya to find new customers.
Over the last few months, Libya has moved several billion dollars in deposits from Western Europe to banks in the Middle East and Asia. That may have protected the money, but it will severely hamper Libya's foreign transactions. Libya's awkward attempt today to block foreigners from leaving the country, which Arab diplomats say will certainly be rescinded, will frighten many of those who are still willing to travel to Libya to run its oil industry for high wages.
And the fear of a coup has led the Libyan leader to strip large segments of the Libyan armed forces of their weapons.
 
Crisis Might Aid Qaddafi
 "There is only one word I can use to describe the situation inside Libya today," said a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official in Tunis who has recently returned from Tripoli. "Panic."
Although there is little if any affection for Colonel Qaddafi within the Arab world and among Libya's population, the crisis may play to his favor at this delicate moment in the Middle East.
"We are opposed to the regime but not to our own country," Mr. Kikhia said. "We worry about sanctions or military actions that can only hurt the Libyan people. The issue in Libya is that people in this case think the West is out to get Libya, not Muammar Qaddafi and his clique."

HEADLINE: 'Free' Macedonia Faces Hostile World

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SKOPJE, Macedonia

 BODY:
In the tumult that has destroyed Yugoslavia, Macedonia has defied its bitter history of conflict by remaining at peace.
For 1,400 years, the Slavic people who live here in one of the most jealously eyed stretches of territory in the Balkans have had a host of distant conquerors. A strategic crossroads on the land routes that connect the Adriatic to the Black Sea, and Europe to the Middle East, Macedonia was a dominion of the Serbs, of the Ottoman Turks, and of the Nazis in World War II, among others, before it became a republic of Communist Yugoslavia in 1944. 
 Now, without the warfare that has killed as many as 10,000 people elsewhere in Yugoslavia, Macedonia stands on the brink of independence, as one of four republics that have voted to secede. Each day, trucks make the 310-mile journey from the Macedonian capital, Skopje, to Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital, withdrawing men and equipment from the 40,000-member Yugoslav Army garrison.
 
Not Without Regret
 In many new nations, it would be a time for flags and anthems. But here, the mood is subdued, as though many of Macedonia's 2.3 million people feel that independence is coming at too high a price, and in a way that could yet generate problems more burdensome than half a century of Communism. At best, many of the government leaders responsible for establishing the new state appear to be going about their tasks reluctantly, with one eye on what the republic has lost.
"In the past, when I heard people talking about independence, I used to say, 'Quiet, quiet, we are not much bigger than a suburb of London or New York," said Jane Miljovski, a 44-year-old economics professor, who is also Minister for Privatization.
Ljubomir Frckovski, the Interior Minister, a constitutional law professor who is 34 years old, said, "We all feel some regrets."
So far, even the first steps toward creating a new country have been frustrated by the opposition of Macedonia's neighbors. On every side -- in Serbia, the core republic of what is left of Yugoslavia, in Albania, in Bulgaria and in Greece -- hostile forces are challenging Macedonia's right to independence directly or obliquely. The challenges come in ways that have reminded some pessimists in Skopje of the prelude to World War I, when the weakening grip of the Ottoman Turks made Macedonia the chief battleground in two Balkan wars.
 
A Challenge From Greece
 Bulgaria is one of four countries that have recognized Macedonia so far, but nationalists there, as in Albania and Serbia, have raised an argument traditionally wielded by rival claimants to Macedonian territory. They maintain that its peoples are not properly a distinct nation but belong, by language and culture, to one or another, or perhaps all three, of the neighboring Slavic states.
But the most direct challenge has come from Greece, which has said that it will never accept a new country on its northern border as long as it insists on calling itself Macedonia, which is also the name of the northernmost province of Greece. A Greek blockade has delayed or halted cargoes of food, oil, medicine and other imports bound for Skopje. Serbia, resentful at Macedonia's refusal to take part in a truncated Yugoslav federation, has imposed its own food blockade.
In Skopje, the atmosphere is rife with rumors of conspiracy and maneuver, much as it was a century ago, when nationalists mounted their first serious challenges to 500 years of Turkish rule. While the government has committed itself to creating a parliamentary democracy, including broader cultural and linguistic rights for 650,000 ethnic Albanians, more militant groups have pressed for narrower policies that opponents fear could turn into a settling of old scores, against pro-Yugoslav Serbs, Albanian nationalists, and former Communists.
Over cups of thick Turkish coffee that are a legacy of Ottoman rule, stubble-bearded men with high-buttoned, tieless shirts debate late into the night, and spend days writing polemics for an array of new newspapers and journals. Some fear that the manuevering will turn violent, as it did in the 1890's and early 1900's.
"It would take only one incident, and you could have a war between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Albania, as happened twice in this century," said Saso Ordanoski, the 27-year-old assistant editor of Puls, a Skopje newsweekly. "Our only hope lies in creating an equilibrium, and for that we need independence and international recognition."
Since declaring independence in November, the Skopje government has remained in a diplomatic void. Through its membership in the European Community, Greece has so far prevented any of the leading European nations from recognizing Macedonia's independence.
The United States, which delayed recognizing the independence of any of the former Yugoslav republics as long as there was a chance of Yugoslavia's being rebuilt, said recently that it would relent in the case of Croatia and Slovenia, but that recognition of Macedonia would be "coordinated" with the European countries, implying that it must first settle its problems with Greece.
It is not only politicians in Skopje who seem ambivalent. In the city's old Turkish quarter, many of the cobblers, tinsmiths and jewelers who work in the wood-latticed storefronts of the old bazaar still display large framed photographs of Marshal Tito, the Communist leader whose death in 1980 began the unraveling of the Yugoslav federation.
 
No Choice, Leaders Say
 The Skopje leaders say the decision of the other Yugoslav republics to break away left them with no choice but to follow suit, but to have any chance of making their independence stand they will somehow have to assuage the grievances of Greece. To many Greeks, the only territory that has the right to the name Macedonia is the northern tier of Greece itself, from which the most fabled of all Macedonians, Alexander the Great and his father, Philip of Macedon, hailed.
Publicly, Greece has shown no sign of relenting, but a Greek diplomat in Belgrade said a compromise might be worked out if the Skopje government agreed to something it has so far refused, a change of its territory's name to the Slavic Republic of Macedonia, to distinguish it from the Greek province, which is inhabited predominantly by ethnic Greeks.
The diplomat suggested that a little knee-bending by Skopje might also help. "This pseudo little republic must stop irritating us," he said.

HEADLINE: It Was Libya, U.S. Insists. Syria? Iran? Probably Not.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
United States investigators insist that the evidence in the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 points so far to Libya, and only Libya.
But they acknowledge that a telling string of coincidence and circumstance continues to suggest that Iran and perhaps Syria may have played central roles. And they strongly deny that Iran or Syria have been excluded from their inquiry for political or diplomatic reasons.
 
The Detonator
 Libya was first tied to the Pan Am bombing in 1990, when investigators in Scotland found a fragment of the detonator that triggered the plastic explosive that destroyed the Pan Am 747 jet, killing 270. That fragment was identical to 10 detonators that had been seized from Libyan agents in Senegal in early 1988, 10 months before the Pan Am bombing. 
 When two senior Libyan intelligence officials were indicted for the bombing last November, the Justice Department also disclosed that it had obtained a diary showing that one agent had stolen luggage tags from Air Malta, enabling them to place the suitcase on a Malta flight that connected with Flight 103 in Frankfurt, Germany.
Those findings have convinced investigators that Libyans carried out the deed with the approval of their leader, Col. Moammar el-Qaddafi. One theory is that Colonel Qaddafi sought revenge for American air strikes against Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986.
Investigators concede, however, that they cannot rule out the participation of their original suspects -- Iran and Syria. For there is ample evidence that Iran sought to bomb an American passenger jet in the fall of 1988, and that Syrian terrorists were at work on a bomb plot similar to the one now linked to Libya.
 
The Other Suspects
 Iran was a prime suspect because it had an obvious motive: revenge for the accidental downing of an Iranian passenger jet carrying 290 persons in July 1988 by a United States Navy warship.
Investigators first concluded that Iran had contracted that summer with a Syria-based terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, to pay $10 million for a series of bombings.
That autumn, three months before the bombing, a West German cell of the Popular Front group constructed five plastic bombs that were concealed in radios, stereo equipment and other devices. But the plot was broken up by West German police in October and many members were jailed.
Investigators do not exclude the possibility that Iran then turned to Libya, but they say that they have no firm evidence.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll;
Clinton Dogged By Voter Doubt, Poll of U.S. Says

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
With only one Democratic opponent remaining on the field, Gov. Bill Clinton has gained the support of a bare majority of Democrats nationwide and his campaign continues to confront a cloud of doubts and reservations, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
In a month of fierce campaigning that knocked three of his opponents out of the race for the nomination, Mr. Clinton's support jumped to 51 percent from 28 percent among Democratic primary voters, the national poll found. But half said they worried that "allegations about Bill Clinton's character" could cost him the election this November. 
 Republicans have worries of their own. President Bush's approval rating remains stuck at 41 percent and fewer than one adult in five approves of his economic stewardship. Moreover, enthusiasm seems strained even among his Republican supporters, with only a third categorizing themselves as "strongly favorable" toward the President.
 
Hungry for Options
 The poll, a national survey that is not predictive of the primary in New York, showed an electorate that after months of campaigning remained uneasy with all of their Presidential candidates and hungry for more options. Most people said that Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California had not offered clear visions of what they hoped to accomplish over the next four years.
Sixty-seven percent of the Democratic primary voters said they would like to see someone else enter the race for the nomination, up from 52 percent who felt that way in late February. And when offered a trial heat that included H. Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is considering entering the race, 44 percent of all registered voters chose Mr. Bush, 31 percent chose Mr. Clinton and 16 percent Mr. Perot. Mr. Perot drew slightly more support away from Mr. Clinton than from Mr. Bush.
The survey, conducted by telephone with 1,638 adults, reflects the unsettled state of the Democratic race as it heads into next Tuesday's primaries in New York, Wisconsin and Kansas. Still, the poll measures national trends, and its findings are not directly transferrable to the upcoming contests in those three states. The poll, conducted Thursday though Sunday, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Clinton has clearly broken from the pack in the public's mind since his sweep of Southern primaries on March 10, followed by his big victories in Michigan and Illinois that drove former Senator Paul E. Tsongas from the race. Mr. Clinton is now the choice of 51 percent of the Democratic primary voters, compared to 30 percent who preferred Mr. Brown.
But even as favorable opinion about Mr. Clinton grew in his party, so did the unfavorable: 33 percent of the Democratic primary voters nationally said they viewed him positively, while 28 percent held negative views.
Among all registered voters, only 24 percent said they viewed the Arkansas Governor favorably, while 41 said they held negative views, a worrisome ratio for any politician. The view of Mr. Bush is evenly divided: 42 percent favorable, 41 percent unfavorable.
Mr. Clinton is considered to be more caring than Mr. Bush "about the needs and problems" of average people, the poll found. But Mr. Clinton has clearly suffered from the months of controversy over accusations that he manipulated his draft status, had extramarital affairs and was involved in a conflict of interest because of his wife's partnership in a law firm that does business with the State of Arkansas.
Only 26 percent of registered voters said they thought Mr. Clinton had more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, while 54 percent said he did not. These are the kind of attitudes that trouble many political professionals in the Democratic Party, although Mr. Clinton asserts it is the inevitable result of months of bad press, and can be turned around.
When offered a head-to-head match with Mr. Bush, 49 percent of registered voters chose Mr. Bush and 40 percent chose Mr. Clinton, about the same result as last month.
While Mr. Clinton is clearly worried about the outcome in New York, this poll shows him with a substantial edge over Mr. Brown among Democrats nationwide. The former California Governor, despite his new status as the sole Clinton alternative, still has more critics than friends in his own party. Twenty-one percent of the Democrats expressed favorable opinions of Mr. Brown, while 27 percent expressed unfavorable.
More than half of the Democrats also felt that Mr. Brown spent his time "attacking" Mr. Clinton rather than "explaining" what he would do as President. But the poll suggested that Mr. Brown was seen as a useful vehicle for protest -- not unlike the way Patrick J. Buchanan was viewed among Republicans in other polls.
For example, 64 percent of the Democratic primary voters agreed that "Jerry Brown is saying some things that Bill Clinton needs to hear." And 67 percent of those voters said they agreed with Mr. Brown that the political system was corrupt.
Mr. Brown's pet proposal, replacing the progressive income tax system with a 13 percent flat tax, drew a mixed response. Six out of 10 adults nationwide said they thought the present system was unfair, but only 26 percent said they thought Mr. Brown's solution would be more equitable. Thirty-three percent said they though it would be less fair. Forty-nine percent said they thought Mr. Brown's system would most benefit the rich.
People also offered mixed views about the effect of Mr. Clinton's character issues. Only 11 percent of the Democratic primary voters said such accusations would make them choose someone else. But a much greater group said they worried about the effect of this political baggage on other people.
And there was also evidence of a backlash: 59 percent of Democratic primary voters said too much time and attention had been spent on accusations about Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Bush got some unwelcome news in this poll: 43 percent of the registered voters said they trusted Congress to best deal with domestic problems, compared to 38 percent who most trusted the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Measure of Approval to Romania

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Romania, the former Communist country most regarded with suspicion by the United States, is receiving a measure of approval from Washington for recent steps it has taken toward a more democratic government.
"Progress has occurred in Romania," said an Administration official who specializes in Balkan affairs. "The situation is by no means perfect, but they have made progress." 
 On the strength of such an assessment, the Bush Administration announced earlier this month that it is prepared to sign a new trade agreement with Romania and to accord Bucharest "most favored nation" treatment, the normal tariff advantages extended to the United States' best trading partners.
Romania received those benefits from 1975 to 1988, when they were renounced by President Nicolae Ceausescu in defiance of United States demands that he improve Bucharest's human rights record. The preferences had fostered $1 billion in trade annually in the 1980's.
After the overthrow and execution of Mr. Ceausescu in December 1989, the group that seized power in Bucharest, the National Salvation Front, included a number of prominent former Communists. Front candidates won overwhelming endorsement in national elections in May 1990 that were marred by intimidation of other parties. Subsequent clashes in which opponents of the National Salvation Front were beaten and jailed drew sharp criticism from the United States.
But local elections in February, according to a State Department spokesman, met "generally accepted international standards." The spokesman went on to commend Prime Minister Theodor Stolojan for his role in guiding Romania "toward a market economy and democratic pluralism."
The local elections, the first free voting on this level since before World War II, gave the opposition Democratic Convention alliance 24 percent of the vote while the National Salvation Front won 33 percent nationwide.
Romania now appears to be set on a path toward greater political diversity and possibly a change of power emerging from national elections, which are tentatively scheduled for June.
Already the Salvation Front, whose ranks are filled with former Communists, has split into factions. One is headed by President Ion Iliescu, the other by former Prime Minister Petre Roman, who was ousted last fall after a miners' strike. At the Front's recent convention, Mr. Roman was named chairman while Mr. Iliescu, who had sought to be the party's candidate for president, was rebuffed.
Administration officials said that they were still concerned about the Government monopoly on television broadcasting, the absence of parliamentary control over the intelligence service and abuses of human rights.
The officials acknowledged that there were now enough independent newspapers in Romania to establish a free press, although there are still shortages of newsprint and insufficient means of distribution.
As for the Romanian Intelligence Service, formed in 1990 after the dreaded Securitate of the Ceausescu regime was abolished, an Administration official said there were "quite credible complaints that they are still involved in political surveillance." The intelligence service reports directly to President Iliescu, although Parliament passed a law in February asserting legislative control over it.
In the area of human rights, the Administration has voiced concerns to the Bucharest Government about expressions of anti-Semitism.
Administration officials said they expected the White House would send the new trade agreement to Congress soon for its approval, but that no legislative action could be expected until after Romania's national elections.
In another mark of acceptance, the Administration has sent John R. Davis, a Foreign Service officer with East European experience, as the new United States Ambassador to Bucharest. In turn, Bucharest is dispatching Aurel Dragos Munteanu, a writer who opposed the Ceausescu regime, as Romania's Ambassador to Washington.

 BODY:
The latest statistics indicate that the economic recovery in the United States is taking hold. The Government's chief forecasting gauge rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, its second straight rise.
But in Japan, worries about sluggish growth prompted the nation's central bank to lower an important lending rate and the Government to announce a package of measures to revitalize the economy.

HEADLINE: Security Council Votes to Prohibit Arms Exports and Flights to Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 31

 BODY:
The Security Council voted today to impose a ban on air travel and arms sales against Libya in two weeks and other sanctions unless it surrenders agents implicated in the bombings of a Pan Am flight over Scotland in 1988 and a French airliner over West Africa the next year.
The vote in the 15-nation Council was 10 in favor with five abstentions. Abstaining were China, which as a permanent member of the Council could have vetoed today's decision; Morocco, the Council's only Arab member, and three other third-world countries: India, Cape Verde and Zimbabwe. The five said they favored delaying an ultimatum to Libya to allow more time for a negotiated settlement. 
 Voting in favor were the Council's other four permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- along with Austria, Belgium, Ecuador, Hungary, Japan and Venezuela.
Today's resolution passed by just one vote more than the minimum of nine required for approval -- a show of support smaller than the margins mustered for any of the resolutions dealing with Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis. [Text of resolution, page A12.]
Unlike the sanctions against Iraq, the measures approved today would not affect the export of oil, Libya's main economic resource.
The Council acted despite pleas for a delay from the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic States and the Maghreb Union of North African countries. They warned that the sanctions would risk arousing politically destabilizing passions throughout the Arab world.
 
Demand for Suspects
 But Council members emphasized that under the resolution, Libya still had until April 15 to comply with their demands. The Council has demanded that Libya hand over to the United States or Britain two Libyans accused in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. In addition, it wants Tripoli to turn over four other Libyans to the French authorities investigating the 1989 downing of U.T.A. flight 772 over the Sahara. A total of 440 people from some 30 countries died in the two disasters.
The resolution also would require Libya not only to "commit itself definitively" to renouncing terrorism but also to demonstrate its "renunciation of terrorism" by unspecified "concrete actions."
If Tripoli fails to meet the April 15 deadline, all member countries of the United Nations would be required under the resolution to sever air links with Libya, close Libyan airline offices on their territory, stop servicing Libyan aircraft and halt sales of planes and spare parts to Libya. The sale of arms to Libya would also be banned. And governments would be required to expel many Libyan diplomats and restrict the movement of those allowed to remain.
Wearing black for mourning, relatives of some of the 270 victims of the Pan Am bombing watched from the visitors' gallery as the Council voted.
Bruce Smith, a former Pan Am pilot whose wife, Ingrid, died aboard Flight 103, said he felt the resolution was a "significant milestone."
"It is satisfying on both a personal and professional level," he said. "It's a good step for the aviation industry that something like this is being done to counter international terrorism and I feel we are doing something about formulating the solution."
He was one of 10 former Pan Am employees at the United Nations to "remember the passengers and the crew" of Pan Am 103.
But other relatives said the Council did not go far enough. Some said they would like to see the United Nations "get tough" not only on Libya but Syria and Iran.
"We'd like to see a total economic embargo against Libya -- an oil embargo would be just the beginning of what would be necessary," said William Hochswender, whose nephew, Julian Benello, 25 years old, was on the Pan Am jet.
Hours before the vote, Western diplomats said Libya was preventing some foreigners from leaving the country, raising concerns that they could be held as hostages. Libya denied it was interfering with departures.
The State Department said none of the 500 to 1,000 Americans in the country was encountering such trouble.
 
Land Borders Closed
 The ban on flights to and from Libya means that people who want to leave would have to take boats; there is regular ferry service between Tripoli and Malta.
Late last year the Libyan Government said it was closing its land borders to foreigners wishing to leave the country, though it was not clear whether travelers could still enter Libya by land. Cairo is more than 1,200 miles from Tripoli; Tunis is at least 400 miles away.
The airlines chiefly affected by the air-travel sanctions would be Swissair, Lufthansa, KLM and Alitalia, which fly regularly to and from Libya, as well as Libyan Arab Airlines, the country's national carrier.
The resolution provides for the sanctions to be reviewed by the Council at least every four months. It says that countries suffering economic hardship as a result of them, like neighboring Egypt and Tunisia, which fear Libya might expel their nationals working there, may appeal to the Council for compensation.
 
Campaign Against Terrorism
 The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said the issue the Council faced was whether "the international community is prepared to back up its own words with actions and demonstrate that it will protect itself against a state that engages in terrorism."
France's representative, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said that by affecting Libya's armaments, aviation and diplomatic personnel, the sanctions would directly hurt three of the instruments it uses to support international terrorism. But he indicated that the Council would relax the air-traffic ban against Tripoli to allow Libyan pilgrims to make the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, stressed "the very great importance" London attaches to Libya providing concrete evidence that it has renounced terrorism. Although he did not say what evidence Britain wanted, he listed several Libyan arm shipments intercepted on their way to the militant Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army as well as the fatal shooting of a police officer, Yvonne Fletcher, in 1984 by a gunman inside the Libyan Embassy in London.
The requirement that Libya demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism by "concrete actions" has aroused speculation that the United States, Britain and France might demand names of terrorists trained and armed by Libya as well as details of past terrorist operations it was involved in as a condition for lifting sanctions.
 
Fate of Qaddafi
 Since Libya would presumably be reluctant to provide such information, some diplomats argue that the sanctions are likely to prove more difficult to lift than to impose, and could become bound up with the personal fate of Col. Muammer el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, as those imposed on Iraq are becoming wound up with the fate of President Saddam Hussein.
Libya's representative, Ali Ahmed el-Houderi, as well as the representatives of many of the Arab and Islamic groups that took the floor in Libya's defense today, argued that the dispute over the airline bombings has become a legal one over whether Libya should try those accused of terrorist attacks instead of extraditing them, which it contends it has a right to do.
Since Libya has already asked the International Court of Justice at the Hague to rule on that issue, they said the Security Council should at least delay a decision on sanctions until the Court has given its verdict, although that could take months.
But the United States, France and Britain said the Security Council had a duty to deal with actions threatening peace and security in the world and argued that a country accused of such behavior cannot prevent the Council taking action against it simply by appealing to the World Court.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Urban Problems;
Democratic Foes Harmonize On Need to Give Aid to Cities

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Facing mayors for a dialogue on urban problems, and then each other in a debate on the same topic in the Bronx, the Democratic Presidential contenders expressed broad agreement yesterday that cities needed more help from Washington, which, each said, he would deliver as President.
But each candidate cast the issue in the image of his own campaign, Bill Clinton insisting that urban problems were really American problems and Edmund G. Brown Jr. arguing that cities were just another casualty of politics as usual.
 
Differing on Welfare
 Summoned to a 75-minute exchange at Gracie Mansion, led by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, the candidates were peppered with questions on topics like housing and crime by a dozen other mayors from Cincinnati to Puerto Rico. They responded with answers so generally similar that Mayor Dave Karp of San Leandro, Calif., described them afterwards as "the Bobbsey twins." 
 Mr. Clinton's strategists, fearful that they have lost control of the dynamic of the campaign as the primary approaches, are seeking to use these appearances with Mr. Brown to cast him as a candidate whose outrage, appealing to many voters, cloaks dangerous policy ideas. They also hope these appearances will allow them to climb above the uproar of the New York press. [News analysis, page A21.]
Hours after leaving Gracie Mansion, in the debate at Lehman College in the Bronx, the two candidates drew some sharper distinctions on welfare, gun control and other issues.
Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, said he would probably grant New Jersey's application for a waiver from Federal welfare rules that would allow it to refuse making additional payments to women who have children while on welfare. But Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, said he would not. Mr. Brown said a five-year moratorium on the manufacture of handguns was "Not a bad idea; let's try it," but Mr. Clinton said that was not the answer.
Both candidates made it clear that they would propose substantial changes in the way the Federal Government treats cities if they won the Presidency after 12 years of Republican rule. And their exchanges were staid by the standards of some of their recent skirmishes.
Yesterday, Mr. Brown repeatedly said the answer to the nation's urban ills was a restructuring of what he described as a corrupt political system ruled by the "governing elite." Mr. Clinton ticked off specific programs that he said he would enact to help the cities, like a national health service corps to set up clinics to help the poor.
At both events, Mr. Clinton made a point of saying that Mr. Brown's proposal to discard the tax code and impose a flat 13 percent income tax would be a disaster for New York and other places with high state and local taxes.
Mr. Brown tended to answer the mayors' queries on whether he would support new Government spending programs with quick assents like "Sure," and "Of course," while Mr. Clinton was more measured, reciting laundry lists of specific programs for job training, tax credits and private investments.
 
'I Don't Buy It'
 After the mayors' forum, Mr. Flynn, the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, who has been seeking more discussion of urban problems in the campaign, said the exchange was fruitful. "They understand the agonies and they feel the pain," he said.
But other questioners were nonplussed.
"It can't be as simple as get those guys out and put me in and everyone will have steak and potatoes and two cars in the garage," said Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, one of six black mayors on the panel, who asked the candidates what they would do about growing racial divisions and crime. "I don't buy it. The code word is tax breaks to the middle class, and that won't do it."
The mix of Mr. Clinton's vaguely specific proposals and Mr. Brown's specifically vague exhortations left Mayor Dwight Tillery of Cincinnati undecided and unimpressed.
"What I find is that it's very difficult to get the specificity from these guys," he said. "I don't walk away with the sense that Clinton really understands that American cities are falling. He doesn't seem willing to alienate what he calls the middle class. Maybe he's done his research, and found that city people don't turn out to vote in great numbers. But a great politician would reach out and galvanize people who have dropped out of the political process. Jerry Brown has more fire in the belly. At this point, I don't feel I have much of a choice."
 
Jackson Watches Quietly
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who passed up the chance to run for mayor of Washington and for President but remains a powerful presence courted by both candidates, sat on the sidelines as a silent observer yesterday at the forum. But he praised the candidates for forsaking personal attacks and addressing urban needs.
There were disagreements, of course. Mr. Brown said he would redirect 50 percent of the military budget to domestic needs over the next five years, while Mr. Clinton said he would cut it by 36 percent. Mr. Brown expressed unequivocal support for bills pending in Congress that would direct some $15 billion in aid to cities to counter the effects of the recession, while Mr. Clinton said he supported the notion but would have to see how specific appropriations would affect the rest of the Federal budget first.
The candidates' biggest policy difference remains over Mr. Brown's call for scrapping the Federal tax code and replacing it with a 13 percent flat tax on income and what would amount to a 13 percent value added tax on sales. Mr. Clinton said that would be a disaster for high-tax cities like New York by eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes, a position Mr. Dinkins has previously seconded.
If the candidates seemed to be trying to be all things to all mayors, it may have been at least partly because the profile of their questioners' cities varied from Mr. Dinkins's eight million stories in New York City to Mayor Shawn Hogan's 9,877 souls in Hornell in upstate Steuben County.
Mayor Karp of San Leandro leads a city of 70,000 just south of Oakland in the San Francisco Bay area.
He said afterward: "One thing that caught me is there's a major difference between urban problems and rural problems. But not, it seems, in the eyes of Clinton."
Asked in the debate by Roz Abrams of WABC-TV what he would do to bring industry back to the cities, Mr. Brown hesitated, saying, "That's a pretty big order here."
"But you want to be President," Ms. Abrams responded.
Mr. Brown then said, "It's going to take a kind of commitment that we don't have."

Chart: "The Democratic Candidates' Views on Urban Issues"
 Urban issues took center stage yesterday for the first time in the Presidential campaign, forcing the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination to present their positions on a variety of issues of concern to cities. From position papers and statements, this is a synopsis of their views.
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON:
 
Employment
Calls for expansion of job training and mentoring programs, tax credits to make entry-level jobs more attractive. Has made a major issue of welfare reform, with able-bodied recipients receiving education and job training and then being required to take jobs, with the government as employer of last resort.
Analysis: He has not taken a position on plans backed by many mayors to provide municipalities with $15 billion or in recession aid.
 
Housing
Would give 10 percent of federally owned housing stock as well as housing on closed military bases to community groups to house the homeless. Would encourage resident ownership of low-income housing, insure adequate funding financing for maintenance of subsidized housing, hold a "housing and homelessness summit" with goal of creating "a new consensus for poverty programs, funding levels, and Federal assistance for innovative housing crisis solutions."
Analysis: Mr. Clinton says it would take years to restore funds for subsidized housing, deemed vital for the cities, to their pre-Reagan Administration levels.
 
Crime and Drugs
 Favors Federal matching grants for cities with "comprehensive crime control plans" that include "a significant increase in the size of the police force," as well as concepts such as like community policing, with a particular emphasis on school safety. Supports death penalty, the use of which he has authorized in Arkansas; the Brady Bill, which requires a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun.
 Analysis: His police proposals would reward many Dinkins Administration initiatives. He last declined to intervene in the use of the death penalty last January against in the case of a man who shot himself in the head after he killed a police officer.
 
AIDS
 Said of AIDS, "It would become part of my obsession as President." Says he favors expanding clinical definition of AIDS in a way that would include more women and intravenous drug users, institution of several programs proposed by two government AIDS panels.
 Analysis: Despite a highly publicized confrontation with an AIDS activist last week, Mr. Clinton would no doubt win overwhelming gay support if nominated.
 
EDMUND G. BROWN Jr.
 
Employment
 Supports a roughly $30 billion package proposed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors that includes direct aid to cities, public works and transportation financing, and low-interest small business loans. Pushes idea of urban enterprise zones in which businesses would be given incentives to invest, and massive energy conservation program through which, he says, large numbers of jobs would be created.
 Analysis: Who pays for this?
 
Housing
 Supports community-based housing initiatives for homeless, but specific ideas unclear. More generally, endorses heavy cuts in defense funding and transfer of funds to domestic programs. "Our crisis is not the dead Soviet empire," he said two days ago in Manhattan. "It's the turbulence, bitterness, despair, and alienation in every city in America."
 Analysis: New York, above all American cities, has coveted Federal housing money and welcomed subsidized housing; the national program, severely cut during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, was born here more than 50 years ago. Mr. Borwn's positions lack precision.
 
Crime and Drugs
 Opposes death penalty and supports Brady Bill. While pointing to numerous tough crime bills he signed as California Governor, which he says led to longer sentences and thousands more imprisoned convicts, he maintains that fundamental answer to crime and drugs is income support and jobs. "You can't have one out of five kids born in poverty and not expect to see drugs sold," he has said. "I put drugs in the larger context."
 Analysis: Larger context is huge and expensive. What's his opinion of community policing and other initiatives that have received great play since he was Governor?
 
AIDS
 Even before the Academy Awards wore the red ribbon of concern over AIDS crisis. Calls for more research and a national health care system that will cover the costs of the ill.
 Analysis: Again, specifics of what he would do are a question, but many AIDS activists believe they can work with him and Clinton alike. (pg. A21)

HEADLINE: I.M.F. ENDORSES RUSSIAN PLAN FOR ECONOMY, CLEARING WAY FOR AID AND FOR MEMBERSHIP

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it had endorsed Russia's economic reform plan, paving the way for Moscow to receive up to $4 billion in I.M.F. aid over the next year.
I.M.F. officials say Russia could begin receiving loans from the fund as early as May, a move that will place the Russian economy to some extent under the stewardship of the I.M.F. It will still require Moscow to meet certain conditions to qualify for the aid, including stringent targets to control the inflation rate and budget deficit. 
 The decisions bring Moscow to the verge of membership in the I.M.F., a major step toward eventual integration of the Russian economy with the West, continuing a process begun five years ago by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union.
 
Joining in Late April
 The relationship could lead to future strains between Russia and the I.M.F. as Moscow struggles to stabilize its economy and maintain control over its own affairs and the Fund is likely to link continued assistance on further belt tightening.
I.M.F. officials say they expect Russia and most of the other 14 former Soviet republics to join the fund in late April, with I.M.F. aid to the new members beginning soon afterward. Aid to the other former republics aside from Russia could total about $2.3 billion over the next year.
All together Russia and the other former republics could qualify for as much as $18 billion in I.M.F. aid over the next three years. But this sum is contingent on an increase in international support for the Fund, including a $12 billion contribution from the United States. The White House and Congress have hesitated to push for the money in an election year when foreign aid of any kind is considered unpopular.
 
Aid Package Announcement
 President Bush is expected to announce on Wednesday a large-scale aid package to help Russia and the other republics. Administration officials say the President will urge Congress to authorize about $600 million in technical and humanitarian assistance, an American contribution toward a multibillion dollar international fund to stabilize the ruble and the additional $12 billion contribution to the I.M.F.
So far, Germany is the leading financial contributor to the former Soviet Union, having provided about $35 billion, but much of that is earmarked to help Soviet troops leave what was formerly East Germany. The German contribution represents about half of the Western aid given to the former Soviet Union.
Discussion of American aid to Russia has been muted so far in this year's Presidential election campaign, but the Administration and the Democrats are giving signs that they will soon begin paying more attention to it. The issue was raised earlier this month when former President Richard M. Nixon circulated a memorandum in which he criticized the United States for not seizing the opportunity to offer more help to President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Russia's move toward a market economy has involved removing most price controls, privatizing many small businesses, giving enterprises more freedom and slashing the republic's budget deficit.
As a result of the reforms, many factories have laid off workers, prices for bread and meat have soared, and pensions of the elderly have fallen far behind inflation.
The meeting today was the first between the I.M.F.'s executive board and representatives of the Russian Government. The fund's members praised Russia's reform program, but criticized it for having an inadequate safety net for pensioners and for not reducing its budget deficit and expanding money supply fast enough.
Once Russia joins the I.M.F., fund officials will ask Moscow to refine its reform program further. Then the I.M.F. board will vote once more on the program before releasing money.
I.M.F. executives also called on Russia today to move faster to raise its energy prices to world levels and to reduce trade barriers with other republics of the former Soviet Union.
"These are the alarm bells people are still talking about," said one senior I.M.F. official. "But they're doing a good job. We know it's tough. They can't backtrack. They have to stick with it."
 
Russia Offered a Stake
 In another important decision that was the subject of weeks of debate, the I.M.F. executive board agreed to offer Russia a 3 percent ownership stake in the fund, which is like a cooperative bank in which each member country contributes a share of the capital. This would give Russia a larger quota than China and the largest quota in the fund after the Group of Seven industrial nations and Saudi Arabia.
To join the fund, Russia will be called on to contribute just under $4 billion. Under I.M.F. rules, Russia can contribute about $3.1 billion of this in its own currency and the rest, about $900 million, in hard currency. I.M.F. officials say Russia will borrow or receive as grants most of this $900 million.
I.M.F. officials said they were confident that Russia would accept the membership terms. But they said specific membership quotas still had to be determined for the other 14 former Soviet republics, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. I.M.F. officials said all 15 republics would be offered a membership stake totalling about 4.75 percent. This would mean they would be called on to make a $6.3 billion contribution to the fund.
Since countries are allowed to borrow amounts equal to their membership contribution during their first year of membership, the 14 republics other than Russia might be able to borrow up to $2.3 billion from the fund over the next year.
The I.M.F. usually makes loans for what it calls "emergency balance-of-payment support." This means that the money usually goes to finance imports of machinery, fuel or fertilizer needed to increase production.
In return, however, countries that receive I.M.F. loans agree to meet certain economic targets. I.M.F. officials said the agreement with Moscow would include targets on reducing the republic's inflation rate, budget deficit, money supply growth, and balance-of-payments deficit.
If a nation fails to satisfy its targets, then the I.M.F. often will suspends its aid program. Normally, a year's worth of aid is disbursed quarter-by-quarter.
According to fund officials, there is much flexibility in whether they suspend aid. One official said that if world oil prices were to plummet, causing Russia's trade deficit to miss its target, the I.M.F. would not necessarily suspend aid.
I.M.F. officials praised the Russian government for making major progress in all of these areas, but emphasized the importance of restraining the budget deficits and monetary growth in order to prevent hyperinflation.
"The I.M.F. commends the Government of the Russian Federation for launching a bold and comprehensive economic reform program," Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said today in a statement. "If fully implemented, it will lay the foundation for an economic program that the I.M.F. could support with its financial resources once Russia becomes a member of the institution."
 
Endorsement Not Essential
 I.M.F. officials said that receiving the fund's endorsement of a country's economic program is not essential for that country to become a member, but is essential to receive aid.
"They can join even if they don't have their program endorsed, but it certainly makes everyone feel better about it," said one I.M.F. executive board member who insisted that his name not be used.
In 1990, the United States backed a plan to increase the I.M.F.'s funding by $60 billion, but the Government has not yet approved its $12 billion share in that funding increase. I.M.F. officials say the additional funding is needed to help them finance the huge aid being demanded by the former Soviet republics, Eastern Europe and the nations of the third world.
The I.M.F. estimates that Russia needs $12 billion in balance-of-payments support this year, and another $6 billion to finance a fund to stabilize the ruble.
American official say their $600 million humanitarian and technical assistance will help reduce Russia's balance-of-payments needs. For example, by providing Russia with some medicine as part of its humanitarian aid program, Washington would reduce Russia's need to use hard currerncy to buy medicine.
 
Can Reschedule Debts
 I.M.F. officials said their endorsement of Russia's program was important because Western creditor nations saw that endorsement as a condition for a new rescheduling of Russia more than $60 billion in foreign debt. Russian officials say postponing their interest payments on this debt could save them $3.5 billion a year.
I.M.F. officials said that over the next 10 days the fund's executive board will seek to determine the membership quotas for the 14 other republics. The quotas are usually determined according to a nation's economic output, but fund officials said it would be hard to calculate quotas for the republics because of a lack of solid economic data.
Fund executives said the dispute over what Russia's membership share should be threatened to delay its joining the fund. China, with a 2.5 percent share, was said to be reluctant to concede Russia a larger share, but Russian officials said that as a matter of pride, they deserved at least 3 percent. The Netherlands, for example, has a 2.37 percent share.

Cuomo's Freudian Slips: Desire, or Just Fatigue?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Mario Cuomo's Freudian slip has been showing again.
New York's militantly unpresidential Governor addressed a group of Puerto Rican and Hispanic leaders in Albany this week. He began with a few words about his life in politics. 
 "When I got elected Presid -- " he said, before catching himself. "I mean Governor. Sorry," the flushed and embarrassed leader of New York quickly shouted as his audience drowned him in applause.
"That was God saying, 'Mario, it's time to rest,' " Mr. Cuomo quickly added.
Earlier in March, Mr. Cuomo spoke at a breakfast of labor leaders. He described his plans for New York's economic recovery this way: "As I said in my State of the Union speech this year -- " Again he stopped, corrected himself and forged ahead.
On Monday, Mr. Cuomo announced that he would travel to California next week to speak at the state Democratic convention, and the political world once again plunged into the unusual contours of Mr. Cuomo's mind.
Yesterday, however, responding to what he called unfounded speculation that he might be trying to revive the never-quite-dead Mario scenario for a brokered Democratic National Convention, Mr. Cuomo canceled his trip.
 
Expecting Applause, Drawing a Gasp
 Brooklyn and Bill Clinton just don't seem to mix.
The Arkansas Governor passed a rare, heckle-free afternoon there last weekend. But then he got an eerie lesson in the Byzantine complexity of New York politics.
He had just finished entertaining 100 local community leaders at the Prospect Park West home of Representative Charles E. Schumer. Clearly pleased with his reception and the day so far, he mentioned casually that he was on to the next event, an award dinner where the guest of honor would be Mr. Schumer's Congressional colleague, Representative Steven J. Solarz.
The crowd grew silent and then let out a collective gasp.
Mr. Clinton looked puzzled, clearly unaware that despite their political similarities, their Brooklyn and Jewish backgrounds, and their many identical stances, the two Congressmen would have long ago dueled at dawn if elected leaders permitted themselves to express animosity in such a traditional fashion.
 
Wait Till Fall, Say Perot Backers
 H. Ross Perot has the hottest "800" number in the business, truckloads of money and, in the "Year of the Outsider," he is the last legitimate link to Bat Masterson.
But Mr. Perot, who has started to run an independent race for the White House, has never come up against the arcane and antedeluvian intricacies of New York State election law.
To appear on the ballot here in the fall, Mr. Perot will have to accumulate at least 20,000 signatures from registered voters who do not vote in the April 7 primary. He can't start trying until July, and he has to be finished by August.
"What we will have to do is gather every signature we can and then sort it out afterward to find those that are legal," said Thomas Barr, one of New York's most prominent corporate lawyers, who has often represented Mr. Perot.
 
Musical Chairs But No Harmony
 So you thought it was tough assigning seats for the Paris peace talks?
Try a Presidential debate. Bill Clinton's advance men assaulted Gracie Mansion yesterday like a S.W.A.T. team on the trail of Abu Nidal.
The mayoral residence looked like an armed camp, as more than 100 police officers, equipped with a mobile headquarters and satellite-transmission capability, surrounded the mansion where the debate took place.
Initially, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and Mr. Clinton were seated between Mayor David N. Dinkins and his counterpart from Boston, Raymond L. Flynn.
Then the Clinton team went to work. First they took over chairs reserved for the press, writing "Clinton Staff" over the tags that were already attached. Then they turned tothe horseshoe-shaped dais. They did not want Mr. Brown sitting next to their candidate, so they decided to have each candidate flank Mayor Dinkins. Mr. Flynn was moved to Mr. Clinton's left.
"This is like a bar mitzvah," said an exasperated Jackie Friedman of the Mayor's office of special events. Mrs. Friedman, who is married to the former Bronx political boss Stanley Friedman, ought to know. She's been around bar mitzvahs and politics for a long time.

Pleas Amid a Vote by N.H.L. Players As New Strike Deadline Approaches

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
With hockey players voting on a collective bargaining agreement, and a strike scheduled for 3 P.M. today, the leaders of both union and management appealed to the fans and the work force yesterday afternoon in an emotional display of public passion and persuasion.
Sounding like candidates for public office, the president of the league and the executive director of the Players Association held separate news conferences in Toronto that were televised nationally in Canada. 
 The National Hockey League president, John Ziegler, and the Players Association director, Bob Goodenow, also spoke privately yesterday morning and said they planned to do the same last night. Meanwhile, player representatives of the 22 teams oversaw secret balloting on an offer from the owners that has been unanimously rejected by the players' bargaining committee.

 
 
Willing to Keep Talking
 Goodenow said none of the votes would be announced until late this afternoon, but word began to trickle out Tuesday night from at least two teams that the owners' last offer would be turned down by the players. One Canadian-based team rejected the contract by 22-0. A United States-based team turned it down by 19-2. "If the owners thought the union was weakening, they were badly mistaken," said one union activist.
Asked if a strike could be avoided if the players rejected the proposal, Goodenow answered: "I don't think so." Ziegler vowed to do his best to avoid the first leaguewide work stoppage in the N.H.L.'s 75-year history.
"I'll talk right up until the walk," said Ziegler, who added that the owners can't afford to give much more than they have offered.
"There's always room for talks," he said. "There isn't much room economically. You're asking people who back this game to lose substantial personal fortunes. This isn't a bluff. They may have to lock up the shop."
Goodenow, somewhat more subdued in tone, said the union was puzzled when the owners rebuffed a players' counterproposal made early Sunday morning and instead told the players to take or leave an offer the owners had made several hours before. He said the players strongly want changes in the free-agent procedures to increase player mobility and want to keep the estimated $10 million they get each year for allowing their pictures to be used on trading cards. The owners want a share of that money.
"The free-agency issue is really one where the players want some movement," Goodenow said. Of the trading-card issue, he said, "The owners are asking us to negotiate something we already have."
 
Losses Anticipated
 Ziegler restated the league's position that its teams would lose a combined $9 million this season after making $125 million for the previous three seasons. Ziegler blamed increasing salaries for the deficit. Goodenow said the increase in pay was "a massive catchup" to what is a fair wage.
The day of debate became possible on Monday when the union postponed its original strike deadline by 51 hours. Goodenow denied that the delay was a sign of weakness and explained it by saying that the union wanted to give its members all the details of the final management offer.
Yesterday morning, player representatives of the 22 teams began to receive documents and videotaped messages from Goodenow. The leverage in the players' favor is the timing. The regular season ends on Sunday. Players get their paychecks during the regular season and earn only bonus payments in the playoffs. Many owners make much of their profit during the post-season.
 
Practice Rinks Off Limits
 If the strike begins this afternoon, tonight's three games will be canceled and players on the road will travel back to their home cities at the expense of the union. Practice rinks and team equipment will be off limits to players. The teams have finished most of the regular season schedule, with only two or three games remaining.

 The Stanley Cup playoffs are scheduled to begin on April 8, next Wednesday, a four-round tournament of as many as 105 games that could end as late as early June. Thus far, players have announced no plans to picket and owners have announced no plans to use replacement players, although both options have been discussed.
If the strike is short, the games could be made up quickly because the league has scheduled two off days, next Monday and Tuesday. But if the strike drags on for a few days, the league would have problems with booking arenas already committed to basketball and other activities.
The two foes were a study in similarity and contrast. Both Ziegler and Goodenow are lawyers from suburban Detroit. Ziegler, who learned the hockey business in the front office of the Detroit Red Wings, is in his 15th year on the job. Goodenow, a former player agent, is in his first year on his job.
In his presentation, Ziegler used charts and graphs and seemed more forecful. "Are not owners entitled to make a profit?" Ziegler asked. His news conference began two hours before Goodenow's and the timing put the labor leader on the defensive.
Goodenow said Ziegler's remarks were "pretty strong and a blatant attempt" to influence the voting of the players and the opinions of the fans.

 Negotiations of this sort in sports often become tests of wills and personalities between the bargainers. Neither Ziegler nor Goodenow expressed harsh words toward the other. Neither side has requested mediation to replace a previous agreement that expired last Sept. 15. Both Ziegler and Goodenow spoke of cooperation and shared revenues when and if the regular-season schedule expands from 80 to 84 games as both sides have tentatively agreed.
But Ziegler said the spirit of trust could deteriorate if there is a strike. "If you study strike situtions, what you see is that once that trigger is pulled, the parties separate and hunker down and there is hostility," Ziegler said.

 Goodenow said rising salaries were a natural condition of the job market.
"These are smart businessmen," he said of the owners. "Nobody's holding anybody up." He said the players' free-agent proposals represent "modest change" and that he doubted the owners' projection of increasing losses in the near future.

The Last Days of 'Edge' on PBS

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
If you haven't yet caught "Edge," public television's monthly pop-culture magazine, try doing it tonight at 9 on Channel 13. There's not much time left. A co-production of WNET and the BBC, "Edge" will have only one more show to go, on May 13, and then it's electronic-graveyard time. Life on public television, never easy, seems to be getting almost impossible these days.
Any broadcaster will admit all too readily that television news magazines demand considerable time to develop a personality and an audience. CBS's "60 Minutes" was several years old before it struck top-10 pay dirt. More recently, ABC's "Prime Time Live" was nearly hooted off the air before settling into its current comfortable niche. NBC has just announced a 52-week commitment to its latest magazine effort, "Dateline NBC," starring Jane Pauley. Overnight successes just don't happen in this genre. 
 So, PBS has pulled the "viewers like you" financing rug out from under "Edge" after only eight programs (the decision was made when only six had been broadcast). That's barely enough time to catch your breath, never mind sit back and think about what might work more effectively. "Edge" has its problems, but not of a magnitude requiring nearly instant dismissal.
In the beginning, "Edge" seemed eager to become the electronic equivalent of Vanity Fair magazine. Welcome to the kingdom of celebrity, in which celebrities can be found interviewing other celebrities. Just what does Norman Mailer think of Oliver Stone, anyway? The problem with "Edge," given its monthly format, is that too often it wound up looking as if it had arrived late for the party, getting to supposedly hot subjects just as they had begun to cool off from overexposure. One notable instance involved a labored mini-drama designed to illuminate a new novel by, yes, the ubiquitous Mr. Mailer.
But gradually, even if almost imperceptibly, "Edge" began to show signs of having become more assured, more focused. Robert Krulwich, series host, looks more comfortable with a camera now, forgetting the course in Basic Communications that advised him -- this above all -- to keep moving. Program No. 4 adroitly grouped its essays around the theme of "identities in America" and the ways we reinvent ourselves constantly, using everything from political ads to sports highlights. Not overwhelming, perhaps, but moving in an encouraging direction.
Tonight's mix is just that, a disjointed collection of pieces looking at a broad range of contemporary Americana. Merrill Markoe, the comic writer and performer, considers television dating games, especially "Studs," and dubs them, quite accurately, "humiliation entertainment." What kind of people go on these shows? Actors, unemployed actors, says Ms. Markoe, and on "Studs" they sign waivers absolving the producers if a participant should contract a sexually transmitted disease. Some entertainment, it seems, has no limits.
In another segment, the director Robert Altman discusses his new movie, "The Player," which has Hollywood abuzz with its plot about a studio executive involved in the murder of a screenwriter. Mr. Altman describes it as "a bad movie about making bad films." Unfair to the movie community? The producer David Brown observes that "Hollywood is the only place I know where the reality exceeds the legend."
Also on tap: Studs Terkel recalling his favorite stories; Ryan Weideman, a New York cab driver and photographer, talking about the thousands of pictures he has taken of his passengers over the past 10 years; the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art's provocative "Helter Skelter" exhibition, exploring the underside of the city; and a visit to Elko, Nev., and the eighth annual Cowboy Festival Gathering, with its rancher poets writing about topics like "A Thousand Little Ponies."
All in all, an ambitiously broad lineup of stories, handled skillfully. "Edge" might have evolved into a series of substance, had there been more development time. But that, apparently, is what public television cannot afford these days. A thought: Is time running out on public television itself?

Race
How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession
By Studs Terkel
403 pages. The New Press. $24.95.
By tackling the toughest issue in the United States and the hardest subject of his career, Studs Terkel has written his most challenging book. "Race" is the kind of book that happens along once in a long while -- "The Other America," by Michael Harrington, quickly comes to mind -- and demands: Here's the real testimony, now what are you going to do about it? The question is directed at Presidents and Presidential hopefuls and public servants all down the line; to people in early-education classrooms, in health clinics, in hiring halls and on the job; to neighbors and non-neighbors in the cities and countryside who seldom cross the racial divide in their daily lives. 
 In 1944, Gunnar Myrdal, later a Nobel laureate in economic science, called race "an American dilemma." In 1968, after America's streets erupted in hatred, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (which issued the Kerner Report) found that blacks and whites inhabited two different societies, "separate and unequal." The same idea of racial division is analyzed by Prof. Andrew Hacker of Queens College in his thoughtful new book, "Two Nations." Now Mr. Terkel, America's pioneering oral historian, calls race "the American obsession."
Mr. Terkel, whose previous books include storytelling about the Depression ("Hard Times"), how people feel about their jobs ("Working") and World War II ("The Good War"), has always been optimistic about people, even if not about their elected leaders. In his latest work, Chicago's living testament to American literature -- he does for fact what Saul Bellow does for fiction: breaks illusions -- looks backward as well as forward.
He writes that as bad as the riots were in 1968, "there was hope, among whites as well as blacks, that things would get better. Despite the assassination of King, the Great Society was still in full swing. But since the mid-70's, public investments have disappeared and the commitment to civil rights has completely gone." He says that since the Kerner Report the situation has worsened because there is greater acceptance of racism.
In one of the scores of authentic voices in "Race" -- voices that speak for a deliberate range of tolerant, intolerant and indifferent people -- a fireman's wife says that the white middle class is getting a bum rap and ought not to be expected to carry all the burdens of the blacks on its shoulders.
Mr. Terkel writes that the woman was prepared for "someone to calm her condition, to assuage her hurts; someone with simple answers." Then, he observes, along came President Ronald Reagan in 1980 "with anecdotes of welfare queens and Cadillacs. In winning the Presidency, the Gipper reversed the field and made the 80's the decade unashamed." He is even more outspoken about President Bush and his attitude toward blacks: "After all, George Bush, in effect, employed Willie Horton as his campaign manager and was rewarded with the Presidency."
"Race" includes Mamie Mobley, whose 14-year-old son, Emmett Till, was slain in Mississippi in 1955 by white racists who were acquitted by an all-white jury. Mr. Terkel asks her if she harbors bitterness toward the two accused and toward whites in general. A woman sustained by religion, she replies: "I haven't spent one night hating those people. I have not looked at a white person and saw an enemy. I look at people and I see people."
In a conversation that began in North Carolina with C. P. Ellis, who had once been "Exalted Cyclops of the Durham chapter of the Ku Klux Klan," Mr. Terkel relates how the ex-Klansman's attitudes changed after direct contacts with blacks in his union, where they found common ground. Now Mr. Ellis takes it as a compliment when people tell him, "You sound like Martin Luther King."
Between the interviews in the book -- most centered around Chicago as a representative city that serves as a magnet for blacks from all over the country -- there are several "Overviews" by authorities. Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, offers a probing analysis of the racial divide. Professor Massey emphasizes one reason why it has worsened in the last 10 years:
"Black English has drifted farther than ever from standard American English. Increasingly, blacks isolated in ghetto poverty are speaking a different language, with its own own rules of grammar, its own structure, its own choice of words, its own pronunciations. It's not inferior, but if speaking standard English is the minimum requirement for a good job in this country, an increasingly large share of our population is frozen out immediately."
If some of what "Race" reports is familiar, it is no less compelling to hear once again about the two separate and unequal societies. The problems of race have been around at least since the first slave ship landed in Colonial America. Even before slavery was abolished, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in "Democracy in America" that "the most formidable evil threatening the future of the United States is the presence of the blacks on their soil. From whatever angle one sets out to inquire into the present embarrassments or future dangers facing the United States, one is almost always brought up against this basic fact."
And yet, until there is an affirmative turnaround, there's a historical and moral obligation to keep the subject alive, to try to make Ralph Ellison's fictional "Invisible Man" visible. Studs Terkel does so with reporting style and enormous goodwill through the voices of real people in "Race."

HEADLINE: Informality Reigns, And Good Manners Get a Bad Name

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
THE pleasure of your company is requested in a new age of informality. Do not bother to R.S.V.P. Do not get done up in black tie. The mood just now is one of casualness in dress, in manners, on all fronts.
This is the time of the artfully unmade bed (rise, take up your downy duvet and toss it); the carry-out dinner; the telephone solicitor who calls at all hours and addresses you by your first name. 
 A date for the movies and Chinese food nowadays does not necessarily mean two distinct activities. Not in the age of informality. And not in New York, where any number of moviegoers are capable of eating Sichuan from a carton while following the action on the screen. The pros use chopsticks.
Q. Is the informality of the 1990's anything like the informality of the 60's?
A. No. Women wore T-shirts and no bras in the 60's. Today it's bras and no shirts.
In keeping with the new informality, affluent urbanites who once drove around town in BMW's have switched to Jeep Cherokees and Ford Explorers. "It feels right now," said Steven Meier, a Manhattan lawyer who travels to meetings in his trusty Explorer dressed in a sports jacket and khakis.
A blue suit with a Giorgio Armani label hangs in his office closet "in case I have to impress a client." But he rarely reaches for it. "In today's economy you don't want to wow 'em with your elegant shoes, your gold ring, your fancy car," Mr. Meier said. "That's not the style anymore."
Along Park Avenue, social couples who once did time on the charity circuit now look upon opulent parties as boring or embarrassing. Let's have some of that new informality, they say. Which may explain the number of informal charity parties on the calendar this season.
Take, for example, the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association's Bingo and Barbecue Benefit in June. The association used to hold black-tie auctions and sales of antiques and artworks. A couple of years ago, it sponsored a benefit sale of watercolors from the collections of Louis XIV, the Empress Josephine, Napoleon and members of the French court.
Let them eat barbecue.
"There is a wish for greater informality in these gatherings," said George Trescher, the marketing consultant who runs most of New York's big charity events. "Particularly if you're trying to mix groups of young and older guests."
Mr. Trescher, who was tieless at the time, said the dress code has been unraveling for years now. But jeans at the theater? The ballet? The opera? "Yes, yes," he said. "What's new is that nobody looks askance at it. It's laissez-faire."
Heads did not turn unduly when Kevin Walz took an aisle seat in the orchestra at the Metropolitan Opera the other night. He was wearing wool pants, no jacket and a plaid shirt unbuttoned at the neck to reveal his undershirt.
"What a bum, huh?" he said, stroking his chin. "I didn't even shave."
Mr. Walz, a furniture designer, was dressed for a rock concert he planned to attend after "The Marriage of Figaro." He said a trend toward piggybacking cultural events might have something to do with the new informality.
"Last month I went to the ballet in jeans for an evening of Stravinsky and then down to the Ritz," he said. "I snuck out five minutes early so I wouldn't miss the Pixies."
To observe the new informality on the move, hang around in an airport terminal. Count the sneakers, the shorts, the sweatsuits, even in business class.
"We were talking about that the other day, coming back from Barbados," said Sisi Cahan of Manhattan, a frequent flier long before they had clubs. "People used to look terrific traveling, and now they look ghastly. I haven't seen anyone attractive in an airport in years."
On a flight from New York to Paris, the etiquette authority Letitia Baldrige found herself seated next to a nearly nude dude from California.
"Bared to the waist, he was," she said. "The flight attendants didn't say one thing. He was a surfer, very suntanned, and I must say he had a great body."
Contributing to the decline in decorum, in Ms. Baldrige's view, is a growing folksiness in the corporate culture. "Companies are telling employees to first-name everyone, to forget about deference to age and rank," she said. "All of a sudden, it's not only the C.E.O., but the clergyman and the schoolteacher who are being called Joe. It's spreading like wildfire."
Ms. Baldrige, who lives in Washington and lectures around the country, went on to say that "down here the diplomats try to hold onto some formality in entertaining, but it's getting worse and worse."
"Some people don't even bother to R.S.V.P.," she said. "Other people accept for seated black-tie dinners and don't show up. Or they show up with small children. 'Oh, I couldn't get a baby sitter -- knew you wouldn't mind.' "
For an academic look at the reasons behind the new informality, put in a call to Michael T. Marsden, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
A secretary answered the phone, informally. ("This is Sylvia.")
The caller asked for Professor Marsden. ("Hi, this is Mike.")
Professor Marsden cautioned against comparing the informality of the 1960's, which was real and deep and wide, to the informality of the 90's. It could be one of those behavioral blips on the East and West Coasts that never go anywhere.
"In the 60's, wearing blue jeans was identifying with the working-class culture," he said. "In today's world the up-and-coming executive is supposed to aspire to the leisure life. What better way to show this than to wear a sweatsuit? It's costuming."
Nonetheless, Professor Marsden went on, society has thrown off some formal trappings taken on in the 80's. "But not all," he said. "Look at weddings. Formal weddings are on the rise. As for funerals, when people are laid out at wakes, they're generally dressed formally. It's not likely you'll find somebody being buried in their sweatsuit."
In any case, elaborate entertaining is out in New York. No more putting on the dog for company. Caterers who used to gussie up trays of hors d'oeuvres with foie gras medallions say they are making meatloaf, mashed potatoes and beans. "But beans don't have to be beige or boring," said Susan Simon, whose catering company on the Lower East Side has always been known for its stylish and informal food.
And guests like Mr. Walz, the jeans-at-the-ballet man, find the down-home feeling refreshing. "You even see Pyrex on the table now," he said. "People are much more casual about entertaining. They're acknowledging that life is tough in New York. What's important is that we're all together, having dinner. So what if there are a dozen kids underfoot and the centerpiece is daisies?"
When not dining at home, some busy New Yorkers are dining out, informally, while doing something else or waiting to do something else. In coin laundries, in bank lines, in doctors' offices, everywhere there is the crinkle of foil unfolding, the snap of aluminum cans opening.
Subways, always informal, have become more so with commuters breakfasting on bagels and coffee and applying major makeup and nail polish. On the F train the other day, Lucinda McBride blotted her lips with a tissue, smiled and said, "My mother said never put on lipstick in public." She went on to apply eye shadow and mascara as the train rumbled from Brooklyn toward Manhattan.
"This is how I get ready for the office," Ms. McBride said, studying her face in a mirror. "I've got two kids under 6."
That's nothing, according to Phyllis Hall, who works for a trade magazine in Manhattan and commutes on a No. 68 N.J. Transit bus with a man who manages to change from sports clothes to a business suit on the turnpike.
"By the time we come out of the Lincoln Tunnel, he's in full business attire," she said. "He even does cuff links."
Here is the new informality personified. Except for the cuff links. They must go.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Forecasts a Loss of 200,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
In their annual economic forecast released yesterday, officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said they expected the region to lose another 200,000 jobs in 1992 before a mild recovery settled in in 1993. That bleak forecast comes on top of the 495,000 jobs that have already been lost in the region over the last two years.
"No major turnaround is expected in the next few months," said Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority's executive director.
Of those additional job losses, about half, or 110,000, are expected to come from New York City, said Rosemary Scanlon, the Port Authority's chief economist, with the rest from northern New Jersey, Long Island and the suburbs north of the city. 
 With that prediction, Ms. Scanlon places herself at the pessimistic end of the forecasting spectrum. The New York City Office of the Comptroller has estimated that 100,000 more jobs will be lost in the city in 1992, while the Dinkins administration's latest financial plan assumes that 72,200 jobs will be lost this year.
 
Gloomier Regional OutlooklXx
 The Port Authority report came as the Federal Government's chief forecasting statistic, the index of leading economic indicators, showed a marked improvement, advancing eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. [Page D1.] It was the index's second straight monthly rise, causing widespread belief that some kind of national recovery was in progress. Other economic data published yesterday also suggested that a nationwide recovery was underway.
But the Port Authority's regional survey was gloomier.
Ms. Scanlon bases her regional forecast on the assumption that though some industries will begin to recover in 1992, those gains will be offset by job losses in government, retail sales, local services and manufacturing. Most of the losses will come in the first half of this year, she said.
Among the reasons she cited for her outlook were the slow pace of the national recovery and the fact that employment tends to be what economists call a lagging indicator, with companies waiting until they see sure signs of recovery before they begin to expand their work forces again.
Also contributing to the region's uncertain economic outlook is the spread of the recession overseas. The economic slowdown in continental Europe and Japan is most likely to reduce demand for goods made in the New York area and to depress foreign investment in the region, Ms. Scanlon said. "To some degree our futures will be dependent on that in 1992," Ms. Scanlon said.
On the favorable side, Ms. Scanlon said she expected the rebound on Wall Street to help spur the local recovery. She said investment bankers were once again earning handsome bonuses and brokers were seeing their commissions rise again, and this should begin to translate into stronger housing sales, restaurant revenues and retail sales.
The latest regional forecast is darker than the predictions made by some two years ago, after effects of the 1987 stock market crash had already become apparent. In early 1990 the Regional Plan Association, a Manhattan-based research group, projected that New York City and the 26 surrounding counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would add about 100,000 jobs a year in the next few decades. That figure was less than half the growth during the 1980's, when two million jobs were added to the region.

HEADLINE: By Slim Margin, Hoboken Rejects Waterfront Plan

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., March 31

 BODY:
After two referendums and weeks of fierce debate, residents here today rejected a waterfront redevelopment plan with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that supporters called a financial boon and opponents described as a monstrosity.
Now the future of the historic waterfront, which docked the world's first steamboat and once teemed with 10,000 jobs, is again an open question. 
 Preliminary results from the City Clerk's office had the plan defeated by 231 votes, 5,547 to 5,316. Officials later said the margin was 341 votes, but said they did not have the total number available. The office said that about 60 percent of Hoboken's 19,145 registered voters cast ballots.
The first plan to go to a referendum, a larger plan to redevelop Hoboken's crumbling waterfront, was defeated in July 1990 by 12 votes.
 
'The Message Is Clear'
 Jubilant members of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, a citizens group that had proposed an alternative plan, said tonight that the results meant that it was time for the city to listen to the citizens.
"What a great day," said Ron Hine, a leader of the coalition. "The people have spoken twice now and the message is clear." But, he added, "We really want to extend an olive branch now and work for an alternative like the one we proposed."
Under the plan that was defeated today, the city would have leased four parcels of waterfront property, including a 5.5-acre pier next to the PATH transportation terminal, to the Port Authority for 55 years. The authority would have prepared the site and sought a developer to build a 20-story office tower and 9-story hotel on the pier, as well as two residential buildings just west of it.
The opponents offered a plan covering the entire length of the waterfront. They called for a mile-long walkway, 19 blocks of mixed residential and commercial development and more than 20 acres of new parks.
 
Residents Bitterly Divided
 The city's plan had bitterly divided residents of this old Hudson River port city, which has a population of 33,400. Business and civic groups endorsed the plan as a means for new jobs and new revenues to stabilize high property taxes. Opponents said it would give too much of the city's valuable waterfront to the Port Authority, break environmental laws and overwhelm the three- and four-story buildings that give Hoboken a small-town character.
City Councilman Tom Newman, a major spokesman for the plan, said that an opportunity had been missed to help the struggling city. He said it would probably take at least two years for the city to develop a new plan to be put before the voters.
Meanwhile, he said, the Port Authority could go elsewhere with the $100 million it had earmarked for the project. "It's been 10 years, three administrations and two referendums," Mr. Newman said. "How likely is it that the P.A. is going to sit around and wait for Hoboken?"
The Port Authority was to give the city $3.25 million in advance as part of $20 million in lease payments. It also was to build a park and expand the city's Little League field. Once a developer had leased the property, the authority was to have given the city 20 percent of gross revenues for the first 35 years and 60 percent for the remaining 20 years.
Opponents said the deal, which gave the authority first option and rights of first refusal on the rest of the city-owned waterfront as well as a $10.25 million lien, gave too much away.
The authority, which entered a 40-year lease with the Federal Government for the use of the piers in 1952, has been interested in developing them for more than a decade. The city bought the piers in 1984, and legislation that year allowed the agency to develop both commercial and residential properties. But it has since been thwarted in Hoboken by public opposition.

Learning Hard Lessons at the Mall

SERIES: Modern Mecca: Second of a series of occasional visits to a regional shopping mall

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
Janice V. Matte does not complain, except to mention that if her husband still had his management job, she would probably be at home tending her garden on their two acres in Redding.
Instead, at 54 years old, she is out on J. C. Penney's sales floor at the Danbury Fair Mall from Saturday to Wednesday every week, selling draperies for other people's windows. It is her husband, Larry, who hints at their disappointment since he was caught in the first wave of layoffs at the United Technologies Corporation. 
 "I felt it was wrong she would have to do that," he said. "She had served her time. She had raised her children. I didn't like the idea of her having to work." At Christmas time in 1988, Larry J. Matte received his layoff notice, and Janice Matte went to the mall to get a full-time job for the first time in 30 years and an education in the ways of the working world.
 
Gleaming Storefronts
 At the mall, the recession is the great invisible presence. Even in what the Census Bureau lists as the wealthiest state in the country, there are people, like Janice Matte, whose lives have been changed in big and little ways by hard times. But almost in defiance, the mall's storefronts are always gleaming, its showcases always overflowing, as if any whisper of the reality beyond the glass doors will break the mall's spell.
Handwritten window signs, like those used by city store owners who are too worn down to hire sign painters, are strictly forbidden by the mall's managers. And when a mall business falters, it usually does so in such a dash of discretion that only the most observant shoppers would notice that it had ever existed.
One day this winter, the jewelry chain store on the second level, Bailey, Banks & Biddle, was doing "inventory." The next day, the metal gate was shut for good.
Behind the counters and back in the storerooms, young men and women who would otherwise be on college campuses talk about trying to save enough to get off "the floor" and back to school. In the shoe department at Macy's, a clerk offers the prediction -- mostly a hope -- that the big chain's bankruptcy will not be such a bad thing after all.
And people like Janice Matte, who might otherwise be tending their gardens, describe a life that is different from the one they had imagined.
In a little more than three years at the mall, Mrs. Matte said, she has learned that work days are mostly "just work." Her husband said she has adapted to the fact that, between her income and his earnings from his new job as an employment counselor, they now make just about what he once earned alone. But unexpectedly, the job has also given her a chance to prove that she can succeed in a world that, she said, seemed far away during all the years she spent ferrying her girl and two boys, now in their 20's, to soccer practices and wrestling matches.
As it turns out, she is good at selling draperies. Very good. Better than 7,000 or more J. C. Penney window-covering salespeople at 1,300 Penney stores across the country. Last month, in what has become something of a regular event that is giving her a name around the Danbury store, she made "the list."
Not the best dressed. Or the most eligible. She made Penney's list of top 10 drapery sales people nationwide. Last year, she sold $410,472 worth of window coverings, making her eighth on the list. An average salesperson might sell half that much and earn about $10,000, said her supervisor, Bob Pelletier, the department's merchandising manager. Last year, Mrs. Matte said she made about $30,000.
"I have a place here, and I am confident in what I do," Mrs. Matte said one day sitting at the table in the drapery department where they keep the glossy magazines so people can select window treatments to match their images of themselves.
 
Attentiveness and Expertise
 Some of her customers say her success results from a combination of attentiveness and expertise that is hard to find behind counters anywhere anymore. "She didn't look up at you with eyes opened, chewing gum and say, 'Yeah?' " said Gethin Dalton, a Ridgefield resident who relied on Mrs. Matte to get him through the ordeal of selecting draperies and matching bed linens with his teen-age daughter.
It was not always so comfortable for Mrs. Matte. "At first," she said, "I thought it was a big disaster. When I was out of high school, women weren't into careers. Maybe I wasn't qualified. Or maybe I didn't have the training."
For a while when her children were teen-agers, she worked a few days a week at Emily's Cheese Shop in Bethel. But this was different. This was not just standing around and being pleasant. This was a big company with procedures and paperwork. She had to master the ins and outs of valances and mini-blinds. She had to be able to explain why the Taj Antique Satin was worth the money or how to save with Jeweltex.
At the Danbury Penney's, even the most experienced "floaters," the people whose job is to move from department to department, shy away from the window coverings department because of all the possibilities for mistakes.
Mrs. Matte saw all those possibilities, too. She started to bring her paperwork home to make sure she did it properly, and there were plenty of times, she said, when she would wake up in the middle of the night in a sweat about an order, wondering whether she had measured correctly or filled out the proper forms.
 
Catching a Customer's Eye
 The only way to earn more than $5 an hour in the department is through commissions. So Mrs. Matte had to compete with the other sales clerks, catching customers' eyes as they walked in, looking as if she knew the answers to their questions. At Danbury Fair, and retail businesses everywhere, people say commission-sales stores can be "dog-eat-dog" places filled with "barracudas," dominant salespeople who master the art of elbowing out co-workers.
Mrs. Matte was, she now sees, intimidated by the competition that is sometimes hidden behind the friendly atmosphere and the first names that define retail businesses. At least twice, Mr. Pelletier remembered, she told him she wanted out of the department. "She was insecure," he said, "There's too much information here,' " he remembers her pleading. "I'll never be able the learn this.' "
He thought she could do it. And besides, he recalled recently, she had a look that was right for the department. With her professional skirts and blouses, the bifocals and hair that always looks as though she has just come from the beauty shop, she looked to him, he said, like "someone you, as a customer, would feel comfortable asking about colors or styles."
The big problem for Mrs. Matte was that there was someone else in the department who had the look and already knew how to use it. In those days, Ethel Abdella, also in her 50's, was the drapery heavy-hitter in the Danbury Penney's. She was on the list then.
The two women had been acquaintances through a bowling league in Ridgefield, and it had been Ethel, called "Essy" by friends in the league, who had said Janice should put in an application when she heard Larry Matte was out looking for a job.
 
Some Hard Lessons
 One of the hard lessons Mrs. Matte now says she learned about work in those days was how competitive it can be out on the sales floor. Ms. Abdella, who is now working as a waitress at a Danbury diner, says she did not try to freeze out the newcomer. "I didn't compete for sales," she said. "I didn't have to." But she acknowledges there was not enough room for the two of them in the department. "One of the reasons I left was because of her," she said.
People who know both of them say their styles clashed, with Ms. Abdella more "hard sell" and Mrs. Matte favoring a more subtle style. But fundamentally, some of them said, as Mrs. Matte gained confidence, Ms. Abdella grew increasingly irritable.
"If she liked you, she loved you, and if she didn't, you'd know that too," said Jean Sundlot, a neighbor of the Mattes in Redding who worked for years with Ms. Abdella as a waitress before her days at Penney. "Janice felt that, too," Mrs. Sundlot said. "She'd say, 'I did so well this week, and I think Essy's annoyed.' "
After Ms. Abdella left and Mrs. Matte got the merchandiser's assistant title that had belonged to Ms. Abdella, Mr. Pelletier said things quieted down in the department. The title means that Mrs. Matte is in charge out on the floor, and if she sells the minimum "draw" of $75 for every hour she works, she is entitled to $3 an hour extra, plus a 7 percent commission on sales over $75.
Of course, as Mrs. Matte has learned, work always presents new challenges.
There is a new woman in the department, Ida Lounds, whose sales are climbing fast. Last year she sold $320,000 of window coverings, about $90,000 less than Mrs. Matte, which qualified her for a sort of junior "all stars" list in the Penney region that includes the Danbury store.
 
'Competitive Environment'
 Everyone says Ms. Lounds gets along better with Mrs. Matte than Ms. Abdella did. But it is no secret to anyone that when one gets a sale, the other doesn't. Every time Mrs. Matte gets some special recognition, her boss said, that can be useful. "It's manipulation, a little bit," he admitted. "You mention it to Ida. It causes a healthy competitive environment."
When someone comes in, Ms. Lounds said recently, "You try to get to 'em first."
For Mrs. Matte, the search for sales begins again every Saturday morning. After three years, she said, she is used to the routine. Saturdays have begun to have that grim Monday morning feeling she remembered from when she worked as a clerk before she was married.
When he is home alone, Mr. Matte said, Saturday mornings still feel as though someone has taken something away. "When you are used to having your wife around," he said, "it's not the same thing. But we're coping."
Once she is out on the sales floor, Mrs. Matte said, there is always that next sale to think about. She is proud, she said, that the list shows how far she has come, but the honor brings with it a certain burden.
"Sometimes," she said, "I wish it would go away so the pressure wouldn't be there."
 
The Series So Far
The first article in this series about the Danbury Fair Mall appeared on March 27. It described the mall, in Danbury, Conn., as one of the region's new "town squares," a place that draws people not only to buy, but to stroll and to meet friends, a place where some succeed and others fail.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Opens Plant, Makes a Point

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 31

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation officially opened its Jefferson Avenue North plant today in the heart of this depressed city, bucking the conventional wisdom of the auto industry.
While Japanese auto makers were settling in the rural mid-South during the 1980's, hoping to avoid unions, urban problems and the costs associated with an older work force, Chrysler embraced all of them. It forged ahead with a 1.75-million-square-foot building on the east side of Detroit that will employ up to 2,100 workers when it reaches full production of Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicles. The total cost of developing the new car and constructing the assembly plant is $1.2 billion. 
 In return for its against-the-grain decision, local, state and Federal governments agreed to spend about $280 million on improvements and tax abatements.
 
 
Was a Plant Even Needed?
 Some experts and Wall Street analysts have questioned whether the auto maker needed the factory at all, noting that Chrysler has shut down American assembly plants in recent years and may have to close more.
But Chrysler maintains that it will prove its detractors wrong. It views the project partly as fulfillment of a moral obligation to politicians, trade unions and workers for supporting it during its financial crisis and federally backed bailout in the early 1980's. The new plant is situated across the street from the site of its 85-year-old predecessor, which was demolished last year.
Moreover, Chrysler hopes the Jefferson Avenue North plant and its workers will dramatize the domestic character of its new Jeep model.
"We're going to show the world that an American-owned company, smack in the middle of urban America, building an American product with American components -- and, most importantly, using American workers -- can build the best sport-utility vehicle in the world," Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, said at the dedication ceremony.
 
 
Half as Many Workers
 Though American and urban, the new plant will mimic Japanese efficiency in the number of workers it needs to build vehicles. Compared with the old factory, which employed up to 5,000 workers, the new plant needs less than half as many to assemble roughly the same number of cars. Like their Japanese counterparts, Jefferson Avenue workers are organized in self-directed teams that will rely far less on supervision than previous workers had.
Chrysler said Jefferson Avenue workers were trained for more than a million hours, or about 500 hours each, to prepare for their jobs. Chrysler also argues that its work force is more experienced, allowing production to increase at a faster rate.
The average age of workers in the plant is 51 years, and the average seniority is about 26 years. By contrast, the workers' average age at Japanese "transplant" operations in Kentucky and Tennessee is in the 30's, and they are not union members.
 "To the extent that Jefferson Avenue North helps to improve relations between the company and the union it was the right thing to do," said John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company. "Building a new plant in Detroit certainly was not the obvious choice."
 
 
Red, White and Blue
 Chrysler has long urged protectionist measures as a means to reduce the number of Japanese vehicles sold in the United States. Chrysler executives have also criticized the location of Japanese transplants, accusing them of dodging unions and urban black workers by locating "in cornfields."
Lest anyone miss the point, Mr. Iacocca was surrounded on the dais by Owen F. Bieber, head of the United Automobile Workers union; Benjamin L. Hooks Jr., executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; prominent elected officials, and acres of red, white and blue bunting.
Mayor Coleman A. Young of Detroit drew lusty cheers from plant workers when he ridiculed -- without referring to the Japanese explicitly -- remarks in which a Japanese politician said American workers were lazy and uneducated.
Early reviews by enthusiast magazines of the Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicle compare it favorably with the Ford Motor Company's highly successful Explorer.
With the Grand Cherokee aimed at the Explorer and similar models built by the General Motors Corporation, Chrysler must find customers for its eight-year-old Jeep Cherokee model. Chrysler is lowering the Cherokee's price in an effort to make it more appealing to lower-income buyers. But if the strategy fails, analysts speculate, the auto maker may close its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant and consolidate production at Jefferson Avenue.

HEADLINE: Indicators Up Again, By 0.8%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The Government's chief forecasting gauge advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, a second straight rise that left little doubt that economic recovery, although probably not robust, was taking hold.
The increase in the index of leading indicators was broadly based and was accompanied by the first meaningful rise since last spring of a related index that measures current economic activity. 
 "A recovery does seem in place after 18 months of recession and 11 quarters of distinctly subpar economic growth," Allen Sinai of the Boston Company Economic Advisors said in response to the Commerce Department report.
 
Further Recovery Evidence
 Other data published today tended to support this conclusion. the Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence made its biggest gain in a year. [Page D8]. In addition, an index compiled by corporate purchasing managers in Chicago climbed to 51.1 in March from 48 in February. Anything over 50 on the index implies economic expansion.
The advance in the Government's predictive index, although no greater than had been expected, was regarded, nonetheless, as further evidence of the stepped-up economic activity that first showed up in housing and has recently spread to industrial production and retail sales.
"I think the recovery is on the way," Michael J. Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, told a luncheon meeting of the National Economists Club. "I think it's likely the economy will continue to improve."
But Mr. Boskin and many other analysts remained somewhat cautious about the outlook, noting variously that the labor market had yet to show much improvement and that some of the other statistical gains early this year seemed to have reflected unusually mild weather.
"We're moving ahead, grudgingly," said Laurence H. Meyer, head of a St. Louis consulting firm that bears his name. "There are still hurdles. We shouldn't get carried away with one month's very good data."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, took the occasion of today's figures to release findings of a Harvard University economist, James L. Medoff, that the Senator said showed "bleaker" job prospects than implied by the current unemployment rate of 7.3 percent.
Mr. Bentsen said there were far fewer jobs available to unemployed Americans than in previous comparable periods, with the Conference Board's help-wanted index currently as low as when the jobless rate was 9.6 percent in 1983. In addition, he said, "The study finds that new jobs pay less and offer fewer benefits than at the beginning of the 80's."
The unemployment rate, a figure that tends to keep rising even after recoveries start, is to be published this Friday for March.
The eight-tenths of 1 percent climb in the index of leading indicators followed a revised 1 percent advance for January. That was one-tenth of a point more than initially reported.
For the second straight month, seven of the 11 index components contributed to the increase, but the balance was even greater than in January, when it included a huge jump in stock prices.
The biggest positive factor in February was a lengthening of the average workweek followed by a higher money supply, a rise in building permits, higher prices for sensitive materials, improved consumer expectations, increased factory orders and a rise in the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers.
 
1991 Gains Recalled
 The negative factors were a decline in unfilled orders for durable goods, lower stock prices as gauged by the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, lower contracts and orders for plant and equipment and a slight rise in first-time claims for unemployment benefits.
While analysts said they were encouraged by the two straight monthly gains, they noted that the predictive index posted six straight gains of the same magnitude through July 1991 and that little revival ensued. Most do not expect the economy to stall out again this year, however, in part because of substantially lower interest rates.
There also appears to be greater current business momentum, reflected in a seven-tenths of 1 percent February rise in the index of coincident indicators. This gain, which followed a six-tenths of 1 percent January decline, was the biggest in two years.
Still, many analysts continue to worry about continued high household debt and the likelihood that much of the early-year improvement in retail sales was attributable to post-Christmas price cuts. Some also expect some spring setbacks as the statistical effects of unseasonably warm winter weather wear off.
"There's a little less here than meets the eye," commented Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist for Fidelity Management and Research in Boston. "We'll see some fits and starts."
 
Private Surveys Rise
 Two privately constructed predictive indexes also posted gains for February. The composite index of Safian Investment Research climbed 1.7 percent -- the second straight gain and the biggest in five years -- as 16 of its 23 components advanced. The macroeconomic index compiled by David B. Bostian Jr. of Herzog, Heine, Geduld rose to 126 last month from 106 in January.
"There's no question in my mind that we're headed for 4 percent real growth in gross domestic product this year," said Mr. Bostian, one of the most optimistic of American economists.
Still another Commerce Department gauge, an index of indicators that lag behind current activity, fell five-tenths of 1 percent in February, its 13th straight decline.
But the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index -- an alternative forecaster -- moved up smartly for the second straight month.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Figuring Out the Russian Consumer

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Though Russia resembles a consumer society about as much as Moscow resembles Muskogee, Western marketers are focusing on demographics, seeking to penetrate the psyche of a country that Winston Churchill called a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles has published "The Russian Consumer: A New Perspective and a Marketing Approach." The agency, which has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg, serves Western clients in Russia including Mars Inc., the Procter & Gamble Company and Finnair. 
 At the agency's headquarters in Manhattan yesterday, executives shared the study's insights into how Russians behave as consumers.
For example, a segment of Russians characterized by the study as "Cossacks," for their ambition and nationalism, prefers German cars and English cigarettes, while another segment with a merchant-like mentality prefers American cigarettes and domestic vodka.
Perhaps "might prefer" is a better phrase, given current conditions in Russia that make any exercise in assessing consumer attitudes academic, at best. Brand imagery is of little interest to shoppers who must chase scarce goods at steep prices.
The agency's executives recognize that Russian consumers do not represent a significant market yet, but they say that will not always be the case.
"Within the next two years, it will start turning around," Arnold Selkowitz, the international executive vice president for D. M. B. & B., said of the Russian economy.
But in the boundlessly cheerful world of advertising, it is never too soon to start studying an estimated 200 million people with an eye toward converting them into consumers.
The survey, written by Nigel Clarke, the strategic planning director at D. M. B. & B. Europe in London, and Sergey Koptev, the managing director of D. M. B. & B. Moscow, sorts Russians into five groups, each with its own fanciful appelation, based on psychological and demographic factors.
That is patterned after a familiar, and popular, practice in marketing research known as psychographics. For instance, the Claritas Corporation's Prizm data -- for Potential Rating Index by ZIP Markets -- divides Americans into 40 to 48 lifestyles with colorful names like "Norman Rae-ville" and "Blue Blood Estates."
Members of each of the five Russian groups in D. M. B. & B.'s study differ in their outlook, behavior and openness to Western products.
"Kuptsi," a word that Mr. Clarke said translates loosely as "merchants," in an old-fashioned sense, prefer Russian products in theory, he said, but disdain "shtampovka," stamped-out, mass-produced goods. This group, the largest among the five, admires some Western products, he added, particularly well-engineered German and Scandinavian goods like automobiles and stereo equipment.
The group that Mr. Clarke labeled "Cossacks," while aggressively nationalistic, pursues "the most recherche Western products" as status symbols, he said, from premium cigarette brands like Dunhill to expensive cognacs like Remy Martin.
Such Russians display the Western products they buy "literally and symbolically," he said. In their apartments "you are likely to find empty cans and wrappers stacked up as testimony to consumption," he said, adding, "Empty cans of Pepsi and wrappers from Western confectionery are next to the hi-fi and the Western television."
Another group, "Business Executives," which resembles so-called yuppies in this country, is "Western-conscious, but not Western-dependent," Mr. Clarke said. These entrepreneurs prize functionality as well as imagery, he added, and might be as likely to want to drive a Russian Lada automobile as a Western Mercedes-Benz or Honda.
A crucial point to deciphering an emerging Russian market is that "Russia is not desperate just to be like the West," he asserted.
While "Hungary wants to be similar to Austria," he added, "Russia wants to be a nicer Russia."
In advising marketers to divide Russians into groups in order to conquer them, the study is a blueprint for Western-style segmented, or targeted, marketing, rather than the kind of broad-based, mass marketing one might expect would be more efficacious in a consumer society, like Russia's, in its infancy.
"If you're dealing with a market as different as Russia is," Mr. Clarke explained, "even if you want to go 'broad,' it's best to think: 'Which group would go most for my brand? Where is my natural center of gravity?' "
Those who dote on aphorisms about Russia should be aware that, besides Churchill, Bergen Evans's "Dictionary of Quotations" cites these cautionary words from the Marquis de Custine's "Russia in 1839": "Anyone who has come to understand that country well will find himself content to live anywhere else."
And Churchill himself preceded his famous description with this sentence: "I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in light trading and interest rates were little changed yesterday, as most market participants waited for the start of the second quarter to take new positions.
Reaction was fairly muted to a healthy eight-tenths of a percent rise in the Government's index of leading economic indicators and a survey by the Conference Board showing consumer confidence increased in March. 
 And surveys of purchasing managers in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee showed that conditions among Midwest manufacturers improved last month.
"For the most part, the numbers were about in line with what the market expected," said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. "They suggest the economy is inching and clawing its way forward, but do not portend a particularly robust recovery going forward."
Prices of long-term notes and bonds dipped slightly after the figures were released, and remained below levels a day earlier. But prices of shorter-term notes inched higher.
"You can't read much about the market from what is going on right now," one trader said. "The market is still thin, and with the end of the quarter, a lot of people's hands are tied. Starting Wednesday, we should get a truer read of what is really going on."
Figures on unemployment are due out on Friday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 1/2, down 5/32 , to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 7.93 percent late Monday.
 
Outstanding Treasury Issues
 Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 27/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 7.52 percent. But prices of the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32 , to 10010/32 , to yield 5.58 percent.
Interest rates fell on short-term Treasury bills.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 4.03 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.15 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Province of Nova Scotia offered $300 million worth of 30-year noncallable debentures through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 8 3/4 percent securities were priced at $98.30, to yield 8.913 percent, 94 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A negotiated sale of $300 million worth of securities from the Metropolitan District of Columbia Aiport Authority highlighted activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
The issue consists of serial bonds with yields ranging from 5.10 percent on securities maturing in 1995 to 6.70 percent on bonds maturing in 2007.
A term bond maturing in 2019 was priced to yield 6.82 percent.
Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities, which are subject to alternative minimum tax provisions, are insured by MBIA Inc.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
Municipal bond traders also reported little movement in prices of widely quoted issues in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Still Mixed

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit continued to show a mixed pattern for the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
"Doubt is forming as to whether we have seen the end of a three-year downslide in interest rates," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "On the one hand, there have been upticks in the leading economic indicators as well as in consumer confidence. On the other, economists are urging the Federal Reserve to ease rates further. 
 "The pressure is on," he added, "to head off a repeat of the situation last spring when some indicators turned upward but the economic recovery predicted for June did not materialize. Hence, we are at a very critical point in terms of where rates will be two or three months down the road."
New York-area commercial banks offered an average yield of 3.38 percent, off 2 basis points from the previous week, on their money market accounts. Among the savings institutions in this area, money market accounts averaged 3.90 percent, down 6 basis points from the previous week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Among the banks in the New York-area showing the largest changes in yields, the Emigrant Savings Bank cut its money market account by 50 basis points and its three-month certificates of deposit by 10 basis points. The largest change in the yield on a six-month certificate was made by the Republic National Bank, which dropped its yield by 26 basis points.
The Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York-area had remained unchanged at 3.57 percent, while the yields on six-month certificates had averaged 3.92 percent, up a a basis point, an indication of the mixed movement in yields.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rates were 4.08 percent and 4.19 percent, respectively.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, April 1,1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Consumers Gain Back Some Confidence

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumers turned markedly more optimistic in March. The Conference Board said yesterday that its consumer confidence index jumped to 54, from 47.3 in February, its biggest gain in a year.
The rebound in the closely watched Conference Board measure matches a sharp rise, reported two weeks ago, in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for the first half of the month. Nonetheless, the new polling results cheered stock investors early in the day, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average more than 20 points before other factors prompted prices to slip back. 
 After the United States victory in the Persian Gulf, in March 1991, the Conference Board index shot up 21.7 points, to 81.1, only to languish and finally collapse again last fall as the nascent recovery failed to generate lots of new jobs or prevent another round of layoffs.
The entire gain in the Conference Board poll this month, which reaches 5,000 households with a mail questionnaire, was attributed to brightening expectations about economic conditions six months from now.
 
Worry on Jobs
 By contrast, consumers' assessment of current conditions remains fairly downbeat, largely out of concern that the job market is firming only slowly. Almost half of consumers reported that jobs are "hard to get" and less than 5 percent said they were plentiful.
 As it turns out, a surge in hope in advance of an improvement in job prospects is pretty typical at the start of a recovery.
"It's an almost classic configuration," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Sector. "The substantial improvement in the consumers' expectations is encouraging." Expectations surged while consumers' attitudes about their current circumstances failed to budge for several months at the start of the 1980 recovery and the 1983 recovery, for example.
Nonetheless, Mr. Linden warned against reading too much into one month's results. "While the latest message from the public is better than it has been since last October," he said, "it must be assessed with considerable caution. A single month's figure is still too fragile to be a convincing sign of recovery."
 To underscore that caution, Mr. Linden pointed to somewhat softer buying plans. Just 5.9 percent of respondents, compared with 7 percent in February, say they are planning to buy a new car. Home-buying fever has cooled, too, with 3.3 percent of consumers, down from 4.2 percent in February, saying that they intend to buy a house in the next six months.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed, With No Lift From Good Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in moderate trading yesterday, with analysts saying the latest batch of economic data was not enough to propel it to new highs.
The dollar's soft performance came despite a round of positive news on the United States economy. The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators, a key measure of the economy's performance, rose eight-tenths of a percent in February. 
 Later, the Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, reported that its survey of consumer sentiment increased sharply. The group's consumer confidence index rose to 54 in March, up from 47.3 in February.
Robert Ryan, senior trader at the Bank of New York, said the reports were not enough, however, to jolt the dollar out of its narrow trading pattern.
"The market is looking for a catalyst here and we haven't seen it," he said.
Traders generally believe that market participants actively bought dollars several weeks ago in anticipation of healthy economic reports that would increase the currency's value. But Mr. Ryan said the investors apparently got too far ahead in their trading positions.
Earl Johnson, vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said, "It's kind of a situation where the market recognizes the recovery is under way, but it needs some sign that it will get stronger before the dollar will go up."
The dollar rose yesterday against the Japanese yen in New York, trading in the face of market rumors that the Japanese central bank may cut the discount rate.
At closing in New York, the dollar was quoted at 133.85 yen, up from 132.75 late Monday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.12 yen, to a closing 133.05 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.20 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7365, from $1.7320 late Monday. At closing in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7355, less expensive than Monday's closing of $1.7375.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6450 German marks, up from 1.6445; 1.4995 Swiss francs, down from 1.5000; 5.5760 French francs, down from 5.5775; 1,240.25 Italian lire, down from 1,241.50, and 1.18925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19105.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Great Search: A Perfect Tax

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ARE Americans ready for another sweeping overhaul of taxes -- something, perhaps, like Jerry Brown's flat tax? The answer may not matter much to candidate Brown, who needs recognition as a champion of change far more than he needs a practical plan for cutting the Gordian tax knot. Indeed, Mr. Brown's campaign staff has conceded as much: "The nuts and bolts" of the flat tax, said a Brown campaign spokesman, "are still to be determined."
But the answer matters a lot to economists who thirst for a tax fix that is both simple and politically palatable, yet able to collect enormous sums without grinding down the poor or hopelessly distorting incentives to work, save and invest. For Mr. Brown's tax bears at least a fleeting resemblance to their Holy Grail -- what specialists call a "direct consumption" tax. 
 The not-so-plain old income tax, the one Washington struggled mightily to reform in 1986, does have virtues. It can be made as progressive as one dares, and it is certainly a proven revenue raiser. But the tax is inherently complicated to calculate and administer because income is inherently difficult to define. Moreover, progressive income taxes are likely to distort incentives by putting a fat wedge between what successful people earn and what they keep. Most damning, the tax seems a lightning rod for discontent, perhaps because it is so easily riddled with exceptions and preferences.
Sales taxes, particularly European-style "value added" taxes collected at each stage of production rather than at the point of sale, attract less enmity. Indeed, some conservatives despise the V.A.T. precisely because it is invisible -- and thus an easy ticket to bigger government. But a uniform-rate V.A.T. has one giant drawback in almost everyone's view: It is bound to be regressive because the rich spend less of their income.
Western Europe has fixed this problem by exempting food and shelter, and by charging higher rates on luxuries. But the fixes made a shambles of rational pricing, undermining the free market principle that, say, a car costing nine times as much to build as a refrigerator should cost consumers nine times as much.
Taxes on gasoline -- better still, taxes on the carbon content of fuels -- have been known to set economists' pulses racing. They are a snap to collect, generate oodles of cash and, contrary to the popular impression, are progressive.
Carbon taxes may even serve the cause of economic efficiency by forcing consumers to reckon with the damage caused by traffic congestion, local air pollution and greenhouse warming. But they are political non-starters in the land of the free(way), pure poison at the American ballot box.
Contrast any of the above to the clever direct consumption taxes devised in the mid-1980's by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and by David Bradford of Princeton.
Direct consumption taxes have two complementary components: a levy on business revenues that resembles a value-added tax, and a single bracket payroll tax that together amount to a progressive levy on consumption.
The business tax is a flat percentage of business receipts after subtracting the cost of all purchased inputs, including labor and new capital equipment. Thus, it is really just a tax on the return to management skills and to capital already in place when the tax is first imposed. Since the cost of new assets would be deducted from taxable business receipts, the tax should not deter new investment.
If the flat tax rate on wages is set equal to the rate on business receipts, the combination would amount to a uniform value-added tax that exempted only the return to new capital. For the economy as a whole, after all, wages and business receipts, less the value of investment, equal total consumption. But here is the beauty part: by breaking out the wage component and taxing it separately, it is possible to make the combined tax progressive without distorting consumer prices.
Mr. Hall and Mr. Rabushka would give each family a basic exemption, and then tax wages exceeding the exemption at the flat rate. They calculated that a 19 percent rate, combined with a $16,000 family exemption, would generate the same amount of revenue as the current Federal income tax.
A direct consumption tax would be easier to collect and would demand far less paperwork than the current system. The broad base, combined with the low marginal rate, would minimize economic distortions. The wage allowance would exempt the working poor. And the exemption of investment would stimulate growth. But would it sell?
Jerry Brown's lookalike flat tax plus V.A.T. suggest that Mr. Brown thinks it would. And however one judges his other qualifications for office, it is hard to deny that the former governor of California has a better eye than most for what voters will buy.

HEADLINE: High Salaries for Public Health

 BODY:
New York City lacks a president for its beleaguered public hospital system and New York State lacks a health commissioner. One big reason is reluctance to pay the high salaries needed to attract top candidates. That's dangerously penny-wise and pound-foolish.
A city commission appointed to find a replacement for Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo, who resigned as head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation last fall, says it can't come up with a qualified list. The commission blames low pay -- only $129,000 per year to supervise 16 hospitals. Chief executives of single private hospitals may earn two or three times that much. 
 State legislators, meanwhile, have yet to confirm Dr. Mark Chassin, whom Gov. Mario Cuomo nominated as state health commissioner last summer. The job has been open for more than a year. Dr. Chassin, a former Federal Medicare administrator and a Rand Corporation researcher, agreed to come to Albany only if the state would augment the official $98,399 salary with $61,000 for serving as head of a research institute. Republicans of the State Senate balked at the supplement. State officials now hope to negotiate Dr. Chassin's confirmation as part of the budget package.
New York City officials have in mind some candidates who might serve as hospitals chief if offered additional pay -- say $50,000 a year -- for a part-time teaching appointment. But they are wary of seeming too generous at a time of fiscal meltdown.
That's false economy. The Hospitals Corporation depends heavily on reimbursements from Federal, state and private health insurance funds, and skilled administrators know how to maximize those revenues -- that's one reason private hospitals pay so much to attract them. The right person could save taxpayers tens of millions.
The fiscal crisis makes it all the more imperative to find skilled health administrators; salary supplements are a sensible price to pay.

HEADLINE: Borrow More? Yes, to Grow

 BODY:
How's this for spit-in-your-eye logic? Two weeks ago the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the already dismaying Federal deficit would rise this year by an alarming amount. Yet in the face of that, a group of 100 economists, including six Nobel laureates, calls on Congress to borrow billions more.
It may sound screwy, but in fact the call makes compelling economic sense. Yes, the stratospheric deficit needs to be controlled. But there are some things more important than reducing it quickly. What matters is less the size of the deficit than what the borrowed money is used to pay for. That's why the economists call for investing in infrastructure and education. 
 More public investments make sense in the short run, because they would help stimulate the economy out of recession. And they make even more sense in the long run, by raising productivity and growth.
In an open letter to President Bush, Congress and the Federal Reserve Board, the economists call on Congress to pump $50 billion into assistance for state and local governments. The money would be used to better educate workers and to build highways, mass transit, technology centers. The open letter also calls for tax credits to stimulate private investment.
The economists acknowledge that these proposals would raise the deficit. But they make a convincing case for doing so. After all, the main reason for worrying about large deficits is that, by sucking money out of private capital markets, they drive down private investment. But if Congress turns around and uses the borrowed money to pump up private and public investment, the economy comes out ahead.
Besides, the alarming new $400 billion deficit figure is somewhat deceptive. It includes huge transfers for the savings and loan bailout and for interest. These expenditures do little more than swap dollars from one set of taxpayer pockets to another. That affects the distribution of income for particular people but doesn't much affect the overall economy.
All that said, however, Congress has no warrant for turning cavalier about borrowing. The deficit is projected to balloon later in the decade for rock-solid reasons -- like skyrocketing Medicare and Medicaid expenditures.
Unlike bank bailouts and interest payments on the national debt, money spent on health care will represent a real drain on the economy. The trick is to get out of the current recession -- and then tend to the immense deficit with a careful mix of tax hikes and spending cuts targeted to cut consumption rather than investment.
The economists' letter rings with an unassailable logic. Deficit reduction is important, but not at any cost. Short term and long, starving valuable public investment for the sake of lowering the deficit does more harm than good.

HEADLINE: Penny-Pinching Submarine Warfare to Death;
Recipe for Victory

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 24 lead editorial summarily dismisses the importance of the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics and of submarines to our nation's defense.
Rather than your simplistic suggestion to create a supermarket for ships in one, all-purpose production facility, the better approach is to maintain the country's pre-eminent submarine builder and concentrate surface ship work at other shipyards, including Newport News. 
 We were victorious in Operation Desert Storm because we had advanced technology combined with the heroism of our fighting forces. That's the real key to our long-term security, and the Seawolf submarine moves this technology forward.
Finally, it may be easy for you to regard the issue of workers as being of no consequence, but as a member of Congress representing thousands of Electric Boat employees and others dependent on that revenue, I think it is abhorrent that the President would give them their notice of the end of the cold war in the form of a pink slip with no plan for the future. But then what would you expect from a President whose economic advice is to do nothing?

President, Co-Founder Of Abaxis Resigns Post

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Abaxis Inc., a medical devices company trying to develop a portable blood analyzer to give doctors data in minutes instead of days, said yesterday that its president and chief executive, Richard K. Leute, had resigned and been replaced by the company's chairman, Gary H. Stroy.
 Mr. Leute, who helped to found the company, resigned last Friday as an officer and director because of "personal reasons," Mr. Stroy said. Mr. Leute, 54 years old, remains a consultant to the company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. Mr. Stroy, 49, remains chairman. 
Kenneth E. Rubenstein, 51, previously a consultant in product development to Abaxis and other companies, was also named Abaxis's vice president of development.
 Abaxis was founded in 1989 by Mr. Stroy, Mr. Leute, and Vladimir E. Ostoich, who remains Abaxis's senior vice president of research and development. The name Abaxis is Latin for "away from the axis," referring to the centrifugal force used in many devices to separate elements in blood.
 The company, which has 50 employees but no revenue as yet, has spent about $10 million developing a device that would allow physicians to analyze the blood of patients immediately. Currently, hospitals can only analyze blood economically by batching together a large number of blood samples from patients and have them tested by a huge device the size of an automobile. The process can take hours or even days.
 "Let's say a doctor in the morning wants to discharge a patient, but needs a blood workup," said Mr. Stroy in an interview. "He may have to wait for the results in the evening or even the next morning. That's $1,000 for an extra day's hospital stay."
 Abaxis expects to introduce a commercial device later this year, Mr. Stroy said. He said he did not expect any sharp change in policies because of the management shifts. He said he had participated in the running of Abaxis from its beginning.

HEADLINE: AID TO RUSSIA;
BUSH AND KOHL UNVEIL PLAN FOR 7 NATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE $24 BILLION IN AID FOR RUSSIA

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The leaders of seven major industrial nations announced a $24 billion, one-year program today to help propel Russia toward democracy, including a contribution from the United States of nearly $4.5 billion.
In announcements in Washington and Bonn, President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl presented the program as a way for the United States and its allies to prevent economic collapse in Russia and stop a new authoritarianism from rising from the rubble of the former Soviet Union. 
 The two leaders stressed that Russia must follow an approved economic reform program to get the aid, and so must any other former Soviet republics that get similar assistance in the future.
 
Billions for Peace, Bush Says
 Mr. Bush also said he was going to ask Congress to authorize him to funnel as much as $15 billion to international lending institutions for interest-bearing loans to the former republics in coming years.
Trying to sell the program to a recession-weary nation, he said he was not asking for new tax dollars this year, and his top aides initially tried to avoid saying precisely how much money the United States was spending. No country other than the United States said today how much it would contribute.
Mr. Bush said Americans stood at a moment as important to 20th century history as the end of the two World Wars, and had the chance to turn political chaos into lasting peace by adding a few billion dollars to the trillions it cost to wage the cold war.
"The stakes are as high for us now as any that we have faced in this century," Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference this morning. "Our adversary for 45 years, the one nation that posed a worldwide threat to freedom and peace, is now seeking to join the community of free nations."
He continued: "If this democratic revolution is defeated, it could plunge us into a world more dangerous in some respects than the dark years of the cold war." [Excerpts, page A11.]
 
One Step Behind, Critics Say
 In Bonn, Mr. Kohl said, "We have agreed to send a decisive signal of political and economic support to President Yeltsin and the forces of reform in Russia" and the other republics. "The offer is also an incentive to successfully implement this brave reform program, especially in Russia."
A senior German Finance Ministry official, Horst Kohler, said at a news conference that American support for the aid program was "late, but welcome."
But Mr. Bush sought to make the case that he had been working for months toward this package, which goes substantially beyond existing United States programs, and he heatedly denied that his announcement was motivated by election politics.
Despite his soaring oratory today, however, Mr. Bush has consistently lagged behind the European allies in responding to the upheaval in Eastern Europe: Just two weeks ago, he dismissed criticism along these lines from former President Richard M. Nixon by saying he could not write a "blank check" for Russia.
 
Response by Clinton
 The timing of his announcement today was clearly intended to create maximum political benefit. The White House delayed a Presidential address on governmental reform to make room in Mr. Bush's schedule for the aid announcement. And he spoke just moments before Gov. Bill Clinton, campaigning for the Democratic Presidential nomination, delivered a major speech on foreign policy in New York.
Like Democratic leaders in Congress, Mr. Clinton applauded Mr. Bush's announcement. But he renewed criticism of Mr. Bush's hesitancy, first to embrace the opposition forces in the Soviet Union and then to put the full power of the United States and its Treasury behind President Boris N. Yeltsin.
"The President has kept America largely on the sidelines in the democratic revolutions that toppled the Soviet empire and are transforming the face of world politics," Mr. Clinton said. "Time and again, this Administration has sided with stability over democratic change."
The political aspects were also evident in the care that Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other top officials took to argue that taxpayers would not have to spend more money to finance the aid for the Russians in this election year.
Mr. Bush himself went so far as to refuse to include any specific amounts in his presentation, and Mr. Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady also avoided specifics. But the Treasury said the United States would contribute $4.35 billion, all of it from "existing," "previously authorized" or "already committed" funds.
Of the American share, $1 billion is in loan guarantees that do not involve cash outlays. But the rest came originally from taxes, some of it last year, some in previous decades.
Asked how he would explain the aid to Americans worried about their jobs, their schools, their crumbling cities and their deteriorating roads and bridges, Mr. Bush replied: "Simply make the case that to do nothing would be irresponsible, that the United States must continue to lead and that we have an enormous stake, a personal stake for every American, in the success of these democracies.
"And to risk their failure by doing nothing is very short-sighted, and so that's the case I'm going to make, and I will also be saying, 'We have a lot of blessings in this country, and one of them today is peace.' "
 
Where the Money Is Going
 The $24 billion program represented the first step toward a comprehensive approach to the republics long sought by Russia and some other countries, especially Germany, the current chairman of the Group of Seven industrial nations, which besides the Germans and the Americans includes Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan.
The program establishes a $6 billion fund to maintain the value of the ruble while it becomes a convertible currency.
This money gives Governments the ability to intervene in currency markets when the ruble has dropped below a certain value. Central banks or treasury ministries in major world capitals could use that money to buy rubles -- increasing demand for them in world markets and raising the price on free markets. A version of this protection now exists for the Polish zloty, and at times the United States dollar has benefited from a variation on that strategy: When it dropped against the mark or the yen, Germany and Japan bought dollars in an attempt to stabilize the dollar exchange rate.
The program provides $11 billion in aid from members of the group and other wealthy countries, $4.5 billion in loans from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and $2.5 billion in deferral of Russian debts.
Except for that $2.5 billion, the money would be provided through the I.M.F., the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The $6 billion stabilization fund will come from a pool collected by the I.M.F. in previous decades for such emergencies; the $4.5 billion will come from other funds controlled by the three organizations.
Apart from the United States participation in the international organizations' loans and the ruble fund, Mr. Bush's proposal relies primarily on expanding existing programs, like loan guarantees for purchases of farm products. In some cases, it simply incorporates current programs like medical shipments and humanitarian food assistance under the new heading of "comprehensive aid."
The American share amounts to $1.5 billion of the money being used for the ruble fund, $850 million of the other loans and about $2 billion of the $11 billion in aid. None of the money Russia owes the United States is covered by the debt-deferral plan.
Administration figures showed that all of the $2 billion in direct aid would come either from existing programs or as guarantees on loans -- money that would not have to be spent unless a loan was not repaid.
Although Congress does not have to act on those programs, its approval is needed for Mr. Bush's request for the $15 billion more in lending authority to help the other republics, as well as his proposals to lift cold-war restrictions on other kinds of credit.
Mr. Bush is also seeking Congressional backing for other proposals in the aid package. These include expansion of programs like the Peace Corps, the Citizens Democracy Corps and other "people to people" groups, promotion of free markets in Eastern Europe to cover the former Soviet Union and use of a $500 million fund to dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons to cover as well the conversion of military industries to civilian use.
 
Nonpartisan but Still Political
 Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle pledged to set aside partisan politics and move Mr. Bush's proposals to the floor of both houses quickly. The President asked for passage by the end of the month.
Declaring that there is "no higher priority" than this bill, Mr. Baker said, "I'm ready to go up there tomorrow and start fighting for this legislation."
But the Democrats did not abandon their criticism of the President.
Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Mr. Bush at a White House meeting with Congressional leaders this morning that the package was very similar to a program for Eastern Europe that he had been pushing for a year without any support from the Administration.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Majority Leader, called the plan a "good start" but "long overdue."
Mr. Gephardt added, "Now the President must use his bully pulpit to rally the American people to his cause, something he has resisted doing on major foreign policy issues throughout his Presidency, to justify the cost of and the need for a comprehensive plan to insure the consolidation of economic and democratic reforms."

HEADLINE: AID TO RUSSIA;
Buying Time for Yeltsin

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The $24 billion in aid that President Bush and other leaders have promised Russia is not going to turn it into a prosperous nation overnight. But it does give President Boris N. Yeltsin something Mikhail S. Gorbachev never received: a major vote of confidence on his economic reforms.
For Russia, the aid package may make the crucial difference between unbearable misery and hard, but tolerable times, and this, economists say, could give President Yeltsin the margin of maneuver to push ahead with his tough free-market program. 
 It is no coincidence, Soviet experts say, that President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany unveiled the aid package just five days before Mr. Yeltsin must seek to persuade a hostile Russian Parliament to swallow some more free-market medicine.
 
One Up on Gorbachev
 "This aid gives Yeltsin's economic program a lot of respectability," said Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard's Russian Studies Center. "Gorbachev never brought back a package like this."
The $24 billion in assistance includes a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble, $2.5 in debt rescheduling, $4.5 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations, and some $11 billion in direct help from Washington and the other industrialized democracies that will include food, medicine, export credits and other aid. President Bush said the United States would provide about one-fifth of the package.
The announcement today by Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl, who is chairman of the Group of Seven industrial democracies this year, was in sharp contrast to the lukewarm embrace that Group of Seven leaders gave Mr. Gorbachev at the Economic Summit in London last July. Mr. Gorbachev implored the industrial nations for extensive aid, but they turned him down, saying his reforms were too half-hearted.
Many Sovietologists said the West's failure to give Mr. Gorbachev billions in aid that he could proudly take back to Moscow was an important factor behind his downfall.
Experts on Russia also say that if economic conditions turn disastrous in the republic of 150 million and if there is a coup that puts a hostile dictator in power, the aid package will enable President Bush and other leaders to say that they did their best to insure the republic's transition to a free-market democracy.
"I think Bush is trying to get out of the whole question of who lost Russia," said Judy Shelton, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution. "He'll say, 'Look how much money we're providing.' "
 
A Steadier Ruble
 In the view of American officials and many economists, the package should go far to steady one of the key factors causing Russia's economy to teeter -- a currency that has no respect. The multilateral fund being planned to stabilize the ruble aims not only make it easier for the Russians to do day-to-day business, but is intended also to create a solid currency that will help restore faith in the republic's economy.
American officials say that a stabilization fund could begin as soon as this summer and that they hope it will firm up the ruble as successfully as a multilateral fund stabilized the Polish zloty in early 1990. If the fund restores confidence in the ruble, the currency could obtain a limited convertibility later this year. The big hope is that Russian exporters will have the confidence to bring their hard-earned profits back to Russia rather than stash them abroad.
But some economists say the Russian economy is in such a shambles that a stabilization fund may not work and that the currency will not become convertible for at least a year or two.
While Mr. Yeltsin has many supporters, many other Russians are seething about his reforms. It has allowed prices to soar, pensioners complain that they cannot afford basic foods, and widespread layoffs have begun as tight credit squeezes many enterprises.
Although they admit an I.M.F. program will cause pain, American officials say they hope it will revive Russia's economy by slashing budget deficits and helping control inflation.
Once it becomes an I.M.F. member and receives loans from the fund, Russia must agree to meet certain stringent conditions that the I.M.F. recommends to cut its deficit and money supply growth. In this way, Russia will be integrating itself into the world economy while also ceding some economic sovereignty to the West.
Although the package announced today is aimed primarily at Russia, some economists say the other republics are in more desperate need of aid. In their view, Russia might earn lots of hard currency once it raises energy prices to world levels. While this would cause hardship for many Russian citizens by reducing energy consumption at home, it would enable Russia to export far more oil, helping to fill its depleted hard-currency coffers.
But most of the other republics import energy from Russian and could face bitter times if oil prices soar to world levels.
"We may have a situation where the Ukraine, the Baltic republics, the Central Asian republics are in a worse condition because they will be starved of funds," said Jan Vanous, director of Planecon, a Washington-based consulting group. "They don't have as many goods as Russia to export."
Because of its economic and political might and because it is sprinting ahead with reform, Russia has been the first beneficiary of other countries' largesse. Experts on the Commonwealth of Independent States say they hope the Group of Seven will not forget the other republics just because they do not have the nuclear arsenal Russia has. The $24 billion package announced today includes $500 million in agricultural credits to the other republics.
The aid should shore up Mr. Yeltsin's position as he comes under fire for removing price controls and keeping credit tight. The package, along with the I.M.F.'s announcement Tuesday that it backed Mr. Yeltsin's reforms, were certainly designed to strengthen his hand, many Russia experts say.

HEADLINE: Aid to Russia;
Thankful Russia Still Wary Of Daunting Tasks Ahead

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 1

 BODY:
For months, the reigning young economists of Russia have been campaigning for Western economic aid, both to stabilize an economy lurching through one of the greatest transitions of this century and to provide political support for President Boris N. Yeltsin.
In a coordinated fashion today, perhaps timed to help Mr. Yeltsin mute sharp criticism of his economic reforms when the full Russian Parliament convenes on Monday, President Bush and the German Government announced plans for considerable Western aid to Russia and other former Soviet states. 
 The announcement of a multinational $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble and make it freely convertible to Western currencies will be particularly welcome. A convertible ruble is an essential part of a free-market future for Russia, a safety net to help preserve a realistic exchange rate.
 
What Russia Says It Needs
 Yegor T. Gaidar, 35 years old, the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the reform, has been calling for such help for a long time now. He wrote an op-ed page article that appeared in The Financial Times on March 4, arguing that "if the West wants to help us, now is the time." Then he called for a $5 billion stabilization fund to peg the ruble at about 50 to the dollar; today, with a dollar buying about 110 rubles, he was promised $6 billion.
Mr. Gaidar also asked for support to allow the import of needed commodities in this transitional period, when many Russian factories cannot obtain parts and supplies. Today, according to the German Finance Minister, Horst Kohler, the seven major industrialized nations agreed to finance a balance-of-payments gap of up to $18 billion.
Given the time difference -- Moscow is 9 hours ahead of Washington -- immediate reaction here was muted; official responses are likely to come Thursday.
 
'This Just Came In . . .'
 On the main television news show, at 9 P.M., Mr. Bush's announcement was not among the main headlines. The program began with a report on negotiations over a new treaty between Russia and Czechoslovakia, then several lesser items, then "news just in from the United States" -- the Bush announcement.
The report stressed the need for Congressional approval of the proposed aid, and spoke of the Administration's willingness to remove many of the "more than 260 laws enacted during the cold war that hindered the development of cooperation and business deals."
The 11 P.M. news added a few details and provided some analysis, suggesting that Mr. Bush had been inactive on aid to the former Soviet Union because of criticism during his re-election campaign that he focused too much on foreign policy.
When telephoned by news agencies, some officials were quick to express their appreciation. The chairman of the central bank, Georgi Matyukin, a regular critic of Mr. Yeltsin's program, told Reuters: "This is very substantial. I would be very happy if the United States just fulfilled their plans to assist us in the way declared by Mr. Bush."
Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Ignatyev said, "Western support is very necessary but everything depends on what we are able to do ourselves."
Both said the imprimatur of the West and the International Monetary Fund would change the psychological climate.
Both the balance-of-payments support and the stabilization fund are subject to a further agreement between Russia and the I.M.F. on a detailed economic program, with specific budgetary and financial targets. That program has not yet been agreed to, Russian and American officials said today.
 
The Unanswered Questions
 With Russia now expected to join the I.M.F. at a meeting on April 27, Mr. Bush's announcement is likely to force the negotiations along so that the formal program is ready by then and loans can start to flow as early as May.
But much remains to be done before a ruble-stabilization fund can be established, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said in Moscow on Sunday. "Before we are in that position, we have to have finance lined up, a full stabilization program must be in place and you must know what kind of currency is going to function," he said.
The Russian reforms, begun with a price liberalization on many commodities on Jan. 2, has proven moderately successful. While prices for food and other goods have risen sharply, necessities remain subsidized and there is more to buy. Predictions of starvation this winter did not come to pass, and more Russians are finding ways to make money through private trading and labor.
 
Moving Forward, Slowly
 But privatization of major state industries has been very slow and private investment minimal, and Mr. Gaidar has had to ease both monetary and fiscal policy to maintain political stability. He also recently announced that liberalization of energy prices, scheduled for April, would not take place until May or June.
Many Western economists have criticized the reforms as too quick and radical, or too slow and piecemeal. Some think the International Monetary Fund itself is too inflexible an instrument, although they recognize that it is the easiest way to obtain multinational support.
But as a Western diplomat said today, "No one has ever tried to transform a socialist command economy of this size into a free-market one, and no one knows how it's supposed to happen, even if they pretend to.
"It's like the old Maine joke: If you wanted to get there, you wouldn't start from here."

Excerpts From Bush's Remarks on Aid Plan: 'Today We Must Win the Peace'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference today on aid commitments to the former Soviet republics:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 I have a statement that is a little longer than the normal, but let me just say that I have just met with the Congressional leadership to request their bipartisan backing for a new, comprehensive and integrated program to support the struggle of freedom under way in Russia, Ukraine, and the other new states that have replaced the Soviet Union.
 The revolution in these states is a defining moment in history, with profound consequences for America's own national interest. The stakes are as high for us now as any that we have faced in this century, and our adversary for 45 years, the one nation that posed a worldwide threat to freedom and peace, is now seeking to join the community of democratic nations. A victory for democracy and freedom in the former U.S.S.R. creates the possibility of a new world of peace for our children and grandchildren. 
 But if this democratic revolution is defeated, it could plunge us into a world more dangerous in some respects than the dark years of the cold war. America must meet this challenge, joining with those who stood beside us in the battle against imperial Communism: Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Canada, Italy, and other allies. Together, we won the cold war, and today we must win the peace.
 This effort will require new resources from the industrial democracies, but nothing like the price we would pay if democracy and reform failed in Russia and Ukraine and Belarus and Armenia, and the states of Central Asia. It will require the commitment of a united America strengthened by a consensus that transcends even the heated partisanship of a Presidential election campaign.
 And today I call upon Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, and the American people, to stand behind this united effort.
 
 
. . .
 To this end, I would like to announce today a plan to support democracy in the states of the former Soviet Union. This is a complex set of issues which took months to sort out, working within the Administration, working with our major allies and with the leaders of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. A number of things had to come together to make sure we got it right.
 
 
. . .
 After weeks of intensive consultations in the G-7, Chancellor Kohl, currently serving as chairman of the G-7, has announced today G-7 support for an I.M.F. program for Russia. The program that I'm announcing today builds on this progress and includes three major components.
 First, the United States has been working with its Western allies and the international financial institutions on an unprecedented multilateral program to support reform in the newly independent states. The success of this program will depend upon their commitment to reform and their willingness to work with the international community.
 Russia is exhibiting that commitment, and I'm announcing today that the U.S. is prepared to join in a substantial multilateral financial assistance package in support of Russia's reforms. We're working to develop, with our allies and the I.M.F., a $6 billion currency stabilization fund, to help maintain confidence in the Russian ruble.
The U.S. will also join in a multilateral effort to marshal roughly $18 billion in financial support in 1992 to assist Russian efforts to stabilize and restructure their economy. We've been working with the Russian Government for three months to help it develop an economic reform plan to permit the major industrialized countries to provide support.
 We will work to complete action on this approximately $24 billion package by the end of April, and I pledge the full cooperation of the United States in this effort.
 Secondly, the United States will also act to broaden its own capacity to extend assistance to the new states. I am transmitting to Congress a comprehensive bill, the Freedom Support Act, to mobilize the executive branch, the Congress, and indeed, our private sector, around a comprehensive and integrated package of support for the new states.
 Now, this package will authorize a U.S. quota increase of $12 billion for the I.M.F., which is critical to supporting Russia and the other new states. The I.M.F. and World Bank will be the primary source of funding for the major financial assistance needs of the new governments.
 
Congress's Authorization
 The U.S. quota increase for the I.M.F. was specifically assumed in the budget agreement and does not require a budget outlay. The package will support my existing authority to work with the G-7 and the I.M.F. to put together this stabilization program for Russia, and support possible subsequent programs for other states of the former Soviet Union, as they embark on landmark reforms, including up to $3 billion for stabilization funds.
 It would also repeal restrictive cold-war legislation so that American business can compete on an even footing in these new markets. And I'm determined that American business be given the chance to invest in trade with the new states, and to that end, I've also directed that the United States negotiate trade and bilateral investment in tax treaties with these countries just as soon as possible.
 Significant new trade relationships can create jobs right here in this country. The package will broaden the use of $500 million appropriated by Congress last year to encompass not only the safe dismantling and destruction of nuclear weapons, but also, the broader goals of nuclear plant safety, demilitarization, and defense conversion.
 It will also establish a major people-to-people program between the United States and the states of the former Soviet Union to create the type of lasting personal bonds among our peoples, and Russian understanding of democratic institutions so critical to long-term peace . . .
In sending this authorization legislation to Congress, I call upon the Congress to act concurrently to provide the appropriations necessary to make these authorizations a reality.
 Third, in the addition to the $3.75 billion already extended by the U.S. since January 1991, I am announcing today $1.1 billion in new Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantees for the purchase of American agricultural products. Six hundred million dollars of that will go for U.S. sales to Russia, and an additional $500 million for U.S. sales to Ukraine and other states.
 
 
. . .
 I know there are those who say we should pull back, concentrate our energies, our interest, and our resources on our pressing domestic problems, and they are -- they are very important. But I ask them to think of the consequences here at home of peace in the world. We've got to act now.
 
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, you mentioned several figures in your statement. Overall, what's the cost of this to taxpayers? And where is the money going to come from?
A. Well, most of it will come from the I.F.I.'s, from the international financial institutions. About a fifth of the total is assigned to the -- about a fifth of it, 20 percent of it, is our share, and there's not a lot of new money. It's our feeling and the feeling of the partners that we ought to go use these international financial organizations who were set up to do this very job.
 
 
. . .

 
Bush's Timing
 Q. Mr. President, if the risks are so great, the stakes so high, why did you wait until two months into an election year to outline the program and begin to push for it, especially when as you say, there's little new money involved?
A. Because -- we haven't waited. If you listened to what I said earlier, we spelled out a determination to do this in December. We have been working with our allies constructively to bring about agreement on this international financial institution approach. That was hammered out this weekend by Secretary Brady's people overseas. . . .
A lot of work has been going into it, and rather than kind of posturing out there, we wanted to have a sound program that will have strong international support, and that is exactly, thanks to the cooperation of the allies, what we have.
So this isn't any "Johnny come lately" thing and this isn't driven by election-year pressures. It's what's right for the United States and I must say, without committing anybody to anything, that the reception from the joint leadership seemed quite positive. . . . Q. But sir, whether you were posturing or not, have you not waited a while before beginning this sales pitch?
A. I said something about it in January. Jim Baker mentioned it in December. I've been talking about it. The question, though, is not a lot of political rhetoric. The question is getting something done that's positive.
 
. . .

 
Reason for Skepticism
 Q. Sir, the reason there is this skepticism is, back when Pat Buchanan was beating you about the head in New Hampshire, you weren't out there in New Hampshire, going to New Hampshire and saying, we've got to help Boris Yeltsin; we've got to help Kravchuk. You weren't talking about that at all. You weren't preparing American public opinion.
Today, Bill Clinton is out there talking about his plan for Russia and the republics. That's why it looks a little weird.
A. Well, but I've explained to you, John, that there's a great deal of diplomacy. I remember when one of your, one of the people who used to sit proudly in this room, accused me of not being emotional about Germany, about trying to get a reunited Germany when the wall came down.
I said -- what I was saying to myself, much less interested in emotion, much more interested in getting something positively done. Use the power of the Presidency of the United States to see if you can't have that be accomplished in a very peaceful way.
 
 
. . .

 
Persuading the Public
 Q. Our recent poll shows that 55 percent of the public thinks that foreign aid in fact should be cut, and another 40 percent thinks that it shouldn't be increased at all. How are you going to persuade the public that this in fact is worthwhile when they look around and see roads deteriorating and schools in trouble?
A. Simply make the case that to do nothing would be irresponsible -- that the United States must continue to lead, and that we have an enormous stake, personal stake, for every American in the success of these democracies. And to risk their failure by doing nothing is very shortsighted.And so that is the case I'm going to make.
And I will also be saying, we have a lot of blessings in this country, and one of them today is peace. Your kids and mine don't go to sleep at night as worried about nuclear weapons as some of the preceding generations here. And I want to be sure that I can certify to the American people I've done everything I can as President to see that that continues, that democracies are strengthened, that freedom is on the march, and continues to stay on the march.
And this approach we're taking is the way to do what we can to guarantee that.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Policies Under Clinton Are a Boon to Industry

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Under Gov. Bill Clinton, Arkansas has grown to be a business-friendly state. The Governor entices corporations with tax breaks, low wages and a warm, cooperative attitude. All this has helped add jobs, increase income tax revenue and provide much of the money spent on efforts to improve public schools.
But in some cases industry has used state government concessions while eliminating jobs. 
 The International Paper Company is one believer in Mr. Clinton's Arkansas. In 1985, at the Governor's urging, the state created a special investment tax credit act at the company's request. Both the state government and the company said the act led to thousands of construction jobs; the company said it helped save at least 1,000 jobs at one International Paper mill and increased jobs at another mill -- to 1,401 jobs today from 1,058 in 1985.
 
Modernization Pays Off
 Charlie Ventress Jr. of Moscow, Ark., is being paid $18.56 an hour to coat magazine paper manufactured at the company's modernized complex in Pine Bluff. The plant was modernized as a direct result of the 1985 act, which gives manufacturers a tax credit for new investments.
"I'm glad that Arkansas got the plant," he said. "Before they put the plant in, I got a demotion and a lot of people were laid off. It made me feel secure about making a living for my family."
Mr. Ventress is just one of several thousand people in Arkansas who benefited from Governor Clinton's industrial policies, which have brought a job creation rate that is far higher than the national average, especially in the state's large industries like poultry processing and paper.
But Howard Goggans, a retired plant controller for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, another large paper company in Arkansas that also took advantage of the investment credits, considers them corporate welfare subsidies. Unlike nearby states, Mr. Goggans says, Arkansas loosely structures and enforces the tax credits, enabling companies not only to pay less in taxes, but also to eliminate jobs.
When his own company asked for state approval of a multimillion-dollar tax credit several years ago, Mr. Goggans said, "it was rubber-stamped; no one ever looked at whether we did what we said we would do." In the end, he said, the investment was for "modernization that actually lost jobs."
A spokeswoman for Georgia Pacific acknowledged that the tax credits had led to a decrease in the number of jobs, from 146 employees to 123 at one Arkansas mill modernized under the act. But she also said the opposite had been true at another mill.
The investment credit law does not require companies to create jobs to be eligible for the benefit. Mr. Goggans, who was a member of Mr. Clinton's tax reform commission, said he had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Governor to change that.
To attract business, Arkansas, with Mr. Clinton's support, introduced the investment tax credit and other special tax breaks, like exemptions from sales taxes for a wide range of business activities. In part, Arkansas has had to do this to compete with other states that are also aggressively competing for jobs. As a result of the tax breaks, overall job growth in Arkansas in the last decade has been robust. But there is a price, which Mr. Clinton has said he is willing to pay.
 
Growth of Sales Taxes
 State data show that business tax preferences, especially sales tax exemptions, cost the state at least $400 million a year -- almost 20 percent of the state's total revenue. As an apparent result of that and some other factors, in the last decade Arkansas has had to rely increasingly on sales taxes to balance its budget.
Sales and personal income taxes have grown more than twice as fast as corporate tax revenue. The shift is regressive because sales taxes most affect those least able to pay: lower- and middle-income taxpayers. And Arkansas has more than its share of those.
The state's average tax rate is the 42d lowest in the nation. But Citizens for Tax Justice, a public interest group in Washington, says those taxes hit poor families harder than wealthy families by a ratio of 1.7 to 1. That ratio, which has worsened in the years Mr. Clinton has been Governor, is about equal to the national average, as shown in the group's study.
Rodney Burrell, a 25-year-old father of two who earns about $10,000 a year, says the state's tax policy hits people like him the hardest.
Mr. Burrell was trying to buy a used car in North Little Rock recently, hoping to find one that cost less than $2,000 so he could avoid a new sales tax that has been imposed on used car purchases costing more than that. Last year, as part of a tax package intended to raise teachers' salaries, the state raised the general sales tax from 4 percent to 4.5 percent and broadened it to apply to used car sales.
 
Regressive New Taxes
 "I'm looking for something so I don't have to pay the tax," Mr. Burrell said, adding that the tax "hurts the people who can't afford it the most."
Those new taxes are regressive. But any evaluaton of Mr. Clinton's record must take into account a clear impediment he faces as Governor: Under the Arkansas Constitution, any increase in the income tax must be approved by three-fourths of the Arkansas Legislature. That leaves the state government little choice but to raise other taxes.
Improving education has been a high priority for Mr. Clinton. Those are the chief reasons he has added or raised a variety of taxes since taking office, including taxes on cigarettes, insurance premiums and gasoline. But a clear side effect has been to reinforce a longstanding distortion in the distribution of wealth.
Donald R. Market, director of the Arkansas Business and Economic Review at the University of Arkansas, likes to describe the state as "sort of like a developing nation." He noted its persistently higher-than-average unemployment rate and cited figures showing that 75 percent of the state's households earn less than $35,000, compared to 61 percent of households nationwide.
 
The Dominance of Industry
 But he, like many other people in the state, does not blame Mr. Clinton for failing to turn this around. "I don't know if a Bill Clinton or any other governor can turn a poor state into a rich one," he said.
Still, Brownie Ledbetter, president of the Arkansas Fairness Council, a coalition of consumer and labor groups, says industry has such political and economic dominance in the state that it is no wonder the gap between the state's rich and poor remains.
"We've been dominated by corporate folks, politically and economically, since we've been a territory," she said. "We don't have much of a middle class left."
The leaders of the poultry, paper, trucking, energy and financial services industries, among others, have been highly influential members of the state's political establishment for many years. But rather than discussing that, state officials prefer to talk about the job growth rate.
"We had a 3 percent growth rate last year, ranking fifth in the nation, and we were ranked eighth for the year before that," said Joe LaFace, an economist with the Arkansas Department of Finance and Adminstration.
 
Lower Cost of Living
 Mr. LaFace says the figures showing the state's low per capita income are misleading because they are not adjusted for its lower cost of living.
Mr. Market agreed; he estimated that the income gap between Arkansas and other states would be "narrowed but not eliminated" after taking that into account.
Mr. LaFace says the 200,000-plus jobs added over the last decade include a higher than normal concentration of manufacturing positions, particularly in food processing, one of the state's biggest industries.
The most frequent source of wealth for the state's richest citizens, according to a recent cover story in the monthly magazine Arkansas Times, is the poultry industry. The Tyson family has grown rich from that.
John Tyson, vice chairman of Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry-processing company, said his company added 15,000 workers in the last 12 years, from 6,000 in 1980 to 21,000 today.
 
Business Tax Breaks
 The company and its officials have long been financial backers of Mr. Clinton, and have allowed him to use the company airplane numerous times at no charge, public records show.
State officials say the poultry and feed industry has thrived because of sales tax exemptions, investment credits and extremely low severance taxes on natural gas.
Still, three years ago a tax reform commission appointed by the Governor recommended eliminating some of the business tax breaks, including the 1985 investment credit. The commission said there was too little accountability and not enough assurance that the tax credits were actually used in ways that created jobs.
Enterprise zone tax credit regulations were eventually tightened, restricting eligibility. But the Clinton administration did not eliminate any corporate tax preferences.
 
Legislative Impediment
 Mr. Clinton has argued that eliminating the preferences would do more harm than good. And Timothy J. Leathers, the state's revenue commissioner, says the Governor has been unable to raise other taxes, such as a severance tax on natural gas, because the Legislature would not agree.
Officials in the Governor's office also say they have been unable to get the state's voters to approve any change in the constitutional requirement for a three-quarters majority in the Legislature for an income tax increase.
Others, like Ms. Ledbetter and Mr. Goggans, contend that Mr. Clinton has not tried hard enough to overcome that requirement.
Ms. Ledbetter describes herself as a longtime supporter of Mr. Clinton, but she said he "hasn't been willing to use his political capital" for that, though "other governors have done that, have been willing to take it on."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Chief Rejects Push for Change

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, today rejected initiatives by both intelligence committees in Congress to legislate a wholesale reorganization of the United States spy system.
Unveiling the Bush Administration's modest plan to reorganize the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister intelligence agencies, Mr. Gates told a joint hearing of the Senate and House intelligence committees, "Our changes should be evolutionary, conforming to the reality of an unstable, unpredictable, dangerously overarmed and still transforming world." 
 He added that based on the recommendations of 14 study groups he created soon after becoming the nation's top intelligence officer last November, the Bush Administration preferred to initiate its own changes.
Except for a request from Congress for new authority to shift money among intelligence priorities, he said: "The Administration believes legislation is unnecessary. Indeed, in a fast-changing world I believe legislation would be unwise."
 
Warns Against Cuts
 Mr. Gates also told the lawmakers to resist the impulse to slash the intelligence budget, estimated at $30 billion a year. "As our military capability shrinks, we had best be cautious about too quickly weakening our early warning capability -- our intelligence capability," Mr. Gates said.
The chairmen of the two panels, Senator David L. Boren and Representative Dave McCurdy, both Oklahoma Democrats who had proposed similar reorganization bills, expressed disappointment that the Administration did not go further in its own efforts to streamline and reduce the size of its intelligence apparatus. Mr. Boren asked Mr. Gates to "keep an open mind" on the possibility of putting some structural changes into law.
The most obvious shortcoming of the Administration plan, they said, was its failure to create a new national agency to streamline the collection and communication of satellite photographs.
Last June, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf complained to Congress about the quality and timeliness of the intelligence given his forces during the Persian Gulf war, noting as one example, that field commanders were unable to get reconnaissance photographs of potential Iraqi military targets that were less than a day old. A C.I.A. study group strongly recommended creating a new agency and wanted to model it on the National Security Agency, which is responsible for eavesdropping around the world.
In his testimony, Mr. Gates admitted that "one of the most difficult areas for us to address was that of imagery," adding that there were "a lot of bureaucratic difficulties trying to wire that thing together given the existence of a lot of other institutions."
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was adamantly opposed, because the Defense Mapping Agency, which makes maps and currently reports to him, would become part of the new agency, Administration officials said. The new agency would not report to General Powell, the officials said.
 
Cheeney Expresses Doubts
 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney also expressed serious reservations about any such reorganization, and officials in the C.I.A. were concerned about losing control over the National Photographic Interpretation Center, which analyzes satellite photographs, these Administration officials said.
Mr. McCurdy said, "This is the one recommendation that steps on the most toes," as well as involves the most money, "and therefore, you're going to have the most opposition to it."
Mr. Gates also said that the nation's espionage apparatus would move away from its preoccupation with the former Soviet Union and would focus more resources on other global issues.
The percentage of the total budget devoted to the new Commonwealth of Independent States would be 34 percent in the next budget while 50 percent had been devoted to the Soviet Union. Only 15 percent of the C.I.A.'s budget would be spent on analysis and operations in the former Soviet Union, he said.
The decision was made as a result of National Security Review 29, which was written by Mr. Gates while he was deputy national security adviser at the request of Mr. Bush. It envisioned a reshaping of the nation's intelligence priorities through the year 2005 to include a greater focus on issues that have not previously been central to insuring national security.
 
Four Concerns Mentioned
 Although Mr. Gates declined to discuss the details of the review in open session, he identified these as the main concerns: political and economic developments in the Commonwealth of Independent States, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control of nuclear weapons; the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and ballistic missiles worldwide; narcotics and terrorism; financial and trade issues and technological developments that could adversely affect the Untied States, and new issues like threats to the environment, natural resources and health.
He said, for example, that the safety of foreign nuclear reactors and health problems from nuclear waste were identified as areas of concern.
Mr. Gates also announced a number of structural changes in the intelligence community, which he said Mr. Bush had accepted.
The National Intelligence Council, for example, a sort of academic council that is supposed to bring together the opinions of intelligence agencies throughout the Government, will be broken off from the C.I.A., moved into a new headquarters away from the agency and given more independence.

HEADLINE: Broad Market Is Lower; But the Dow Gains 13.86

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday in volatile trading, with blue chips posting gains but the broader market lower.
Bolstered by rising bond prices and bargain hunting toward the close, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.86 points, to 3,249.33, after trading lower most of the session. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 186.4 million shares, compared with 182.7 million on Tuesday. In the broader market, declining issues led gainers, 1,027 to 666, on the Big Board.
The market suffered at the opening from sharp selloffs in London and Tokyo. Traders said investors were also worried about United States non-farm payroll figures due to be released tomorrow, and first-quarter corporate earnings that will be reported over the next few weeks.
 
Encouraging Signs
 But in an encouraging sign, the National Association of Purchasing Management index rose to 54.1 percent in March from a previous 52.4 percent, which was higher than economists forecast.
 Stocks also drew strength from the bond market, where the 30-year Treasury bond in the secondary market gained 21/32 point to close at 1016/32 . The yield fell to 7.89 percent, from 7.95 percent Tuesday.
 Analysts said investors would continue to look to Japan, where the Nikkei average closed below 19,000 for the first time since January 1987, plunging 764.16 points, or 3.95 percent, to 18,581.79 yesterday. It fell again in very volatile trading today.
Dick Stein, vice president at MKI Securities, said if Tokyo shares firmed, the Dow could rally as much as 30 or 40 points.
 "We need a rally over there and we may get it," said Ron Doran, director of institutional trading at C. L. King & Associates. "That could pop us up, no question about it."
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks gained 0.54 point, to 404.23. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.89, to 393.15.
 The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.17, to 223.42. The Nasdaq over-the-counter index fell 1.
 
 
Centocor and Grace Retreat
 Among active shares, Centocor dropped 1 1/2, to 27 5/8. A Prudential Securities analyst, Joseph Edelman, removed it from the position of "single best idea" in the biotechnology stock group.
 W. R. Grace shed 3 1/4, to 37 1/2. The company said first-quarter earnings were likely to decline.
 Traders attributed losses among some bank shares to worries about Olympia & York's financial predicament. The big property developer is scrambling to meet impending debt obligations.
 Citicorp lost 1/2, to 16. Chemical Banking dropped 1/8, to 23 5/8. Chase Manhattan eased 5/8, to 23 1/4.
 Bristol-Myers Squibb edged up 1 3/8, to 77 5/8, in active trading. A Kidder, Peabody analyst, Jerry Brimeyer, repeated a buy rating following a sharp decline in the share price Tuesday on concerns about first-quarter results.
 A retailer, 50-Off Stores, fell 2 3/8, to 22 1/8, on what analysts and the company said were less than expected annual results of 63 cents a share, compared with 33 cents a year earlier.

Tax-Exempt Yields Gain; Taxable Funds Hold Steady

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on the money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the last week.
Tax-exempt money fund yields moved up smartly in the week ended Monday because of a combination of factors, including the increase of supply and the absence of an increase in demand. To attract investors, issuers sometimes push up yields. 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds rose 27 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.04 percent, with the simple yield up 26 basis points, to 2.99 percent. In the same period, the 30-day compounded yield rose 12 basis points, to 2.72 percent, and the simple yield gained 11 basis points, to 2.68 percent.
Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in portfolios was unchanged at 51 days. Managers reached out to the longer maturities to try to pull in the higher yields because they did not expect interest rates to move higher soon.
According to Donoghue's, the total assets of tax-exempt funds for the week were down a sizable $1.2 billion, to $96.3 billion. In the previous week, assets declined $760 million.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded average yield was 4.22 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket was 4.40 percent.
For the week ended Tuesday, among taxable funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund was the best performer for the second consecutive week. The fund had a return of 3.95 percent, up from 3.62 percent the previous week.
The assets of taxable funds fell $16.2 billion, Donoghue's said. It was a record outflow, but analysts noted that the size of this category had grown steadily and was in proportion to the total of $481.9 billion.
Most of the outflow was attributed to institutions, which pulled $12.4 billion from the funds, leaving their total assets at $146 billion. Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said the institutions, which had entered the money funds in a big way when interest rates began dropping, were swinging out to the more attractive yields in other short-term investments, like Treasury bills, because money-fund yields were essentially flat.
 
Yields Unchanged
 The average seven-day compounded taxable average yield was unchanged at 3.80 percent, with the simple yield also unchanged at 3.73 percent. The compounded and simple 30-day yields were also unchanged, at 3.80 percent and 3.73 percent, repsectively.
The taxable fund with the best return was the Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, at 4.54 percent. The fund's distributor is the Olde Distribution Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.63 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. Its national index was down 2 basis points from the previous week.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
Aides Seek Right Song For Clinton

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Having dealt with sex and drugs, the Clinton campaign must now overcome the most impossible hurdle of all: rock and roll.
"We just can't find a theme song," said Gary Ginsberg, who is in charge of the Arkansas Governor's advance team. "We have tried everything from R.E.M. to John Philip Sousa. You could not imagine how much energy, imagination and debate has been devoted to this issue." 
 For a while the Blues Brothers caught on with the heavily Chicago-based staff. But, as many people know, John Belushi was the lead singer and he died of a drug overdose.
"That was the end of that idea," said Mr. Ginsberg. "Every song has one lyric that may offend one person. Or an artist may have had a drug conviction 10 years ago."
"I Feel Good," by James Brown seemed to work well for the Governor. But Mr. Brown was recently released from a Federal prison. Forget that one. In Chicago the campaign gave "Taking it to the Streets" by the Doobie Brothers a tryout, and the song won a quick following. At least until the staff started paying attention to the lyrics, which contain a brief, questionable reference to Jesus. Bye-bye Doobie Brothers.
"Its preposterous," said Mr. Ginsberg, who has taken to buying compact discs as he travels the country.
 
Beyond the Citadel Of Blandness
 Attentive voters are already used to the way Mr. Clinton constantly speaks in three-part plans and five-point programs. But many are only beginning to focus on former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California who, when he slips into Moonbeam Mode, can turn the most linguistically hardened head to mush.
On Tuesday Mr. Brown was asked by Mayor Douglas Palmer of Trenton what he would do to invest more money in the nation's cities. This was his reply:
"I hope to get myself elected on a platform that operates as a battering ram to break down that citadel of blindness and complacency that continues year after year to go along with a kind of almost genocide of a whole generation of youth."
Later, he was asked to clarify his position on the tax system:
"The tax code is like a wet blanket and a ball and chain on the economy," he replied.
Enough said.
 
Clinton Leaves Donahue Speechless
 Mr. Clinton visited the Phil Donahue show yesterday, a program that often explores the inner meaning of marital infidelity and drug use, among many other issues.
The Arkansas Governor believes he has said enough those subjects and was hoping to talk about a few others. Wrong program.
"We're going to sit here a long time in silence, Phil," Mr. Clinton said as Mr. Donahue pressed for more details on previously reported accusations that he had a long affair with a cabaret singer. "I'm not going to answer any more of these questions. I've answered them until I'm blue in the face. You are responsible for the cynicism in this country."
Phil looked wounded.
"I think there is, perhaps, a responsibility to speak directly to the fact that hanging over your front-running candidacy is a potential deal breaker in the fall when you run against George Bush," he said.
Mr. Clinton told him he was "debasing our politics."
After what seemed like 17 hours, a member of the audience was finally allowed to speak. It may not be representative, but here is what she said:
"I really think, given the pathetic state of most of the United States at this point I can't believe you spent half an hour of air time attacking this man's character," the woman said. "I'm not even a Bill Clinton supporter, but I think this is ridiculous.'
 
Scratch Out The Other Fellow
 When Mr. Brown visited the editorial office of New York Newsday yesterday he was surrounded by people seeking autographs. Somebody handed him a newspaper with a picture of himself, Mr. Clinton and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson on the front page.
Other politicians might have just signed the paper. But Mr. Brown took a pen and proceeded to scratch Mr. Clinton's face out of the photo.
Then he signed his name, patted the the muff on a nearby sound boom, and cheerfully handed the paper back to the astonished autograph-seeker.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Foreign Policy;
Turning His Sights Overseas, Clinton Sees a Problem at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton accused President Bush yesterday of failing to articulate clear goals for American foreign policy after the cold war and outlined his own program for assisting Russia's transition to democracy.
In his second major foreign policy address of the campaign, Mr. Clinton tried to attack Mr. Bush on what has been regarded as his greatest strength: foreign policy. Speaking at a Manhattan hotel five days before the New York primary, the Democratic candidate cited several specific areas where he disagreed with Mr. Bush -- from what he called his failure to get a handle on relations with Japan, his slow response to events in Russia and his reluctance to use trade sanctions against China. 
 But Mr. Clinton also leveled a broader critique, saying the President had failed to provide a compelling vision to justify American engagement abroad after the cold war.
Addressing the Foreign Policy Association, a nonpartisan group that sponsors discussions on foreign affairs, Mr. Clinton argued that because of President Bush's inability "to offer a compelling rationale for America's continued engagement in the world, the Administration has invited a new birth of isolationism on the left and the right."
 
'Alliance for Democracy'
 Calling the Bush foreign policy essentially "reactive, rudderless and erratic," Mr. Clinton declared that America "deserves better than activism without vision, prudence without purpose and tactics without strategy."
Speaking at the New York Hilton, Mr. Clinton detailed his own vision, in which he argued that the United States can lead "a global alliance for democracy as united and steadfast as the global alliance that defeated Communism."
He said that as first steps Washington must seize the opportunity to buttress free markets in former Communist lands, develop a national strategy to more effectively compete in the global economy -- on the grounds that America cannot be influential abroad "if we are weak at home" -- and make better use of the United Nations to stabilize and prevent regional conflicts.
President Bush chose almost the exact hour of Mr. Clinton's speech to present his own latest ideas on how to support free-market reforms in Russia, underscoring the problems that any Democratic candidate is going to have in making foreign policy an issue in the campaign.
 
Similar Ideas on Russia
 From the beginning of the Bush Administration the Democrats have often felt frustrated in the foreign policy arena, precisely because it seems that every time they propose something -- particularly in the area of arms control and support for former Soviet republics -- the White House eventually adopts a version of it, deflating the Democratic critique.
Mr. Clinton's ideas for shoring up democracy in the former Communist lands tracked closely with those of Mr. Bush. The Democratic candidate called for contributing $1 billion to a $6 billion Western fund to help stabilize the ruble so Russia can better import and export goods, but only after further draconian economic reforms are implemented by the Russians.
He also called for temporarily suspending Russia's servicing of its external debts, $1.2 billion in new American loans to help the former Soviet states import manufacturing materials, food and medicine, and replenishment of the American support for the International Monetary Fund to make it better able to assist the new democracies in Eastern Europe. He also asked for an expansion of person-to-person contacts that would bring American advisers to Russia and thousands of Russians and others to the United States for study.
Mr. Clinton argued that the several billion dollars needed to finance his programs could come from the defense budget and foreign aid savings resulting from the end of the cold war. But he left this vague and provided no breakdown or details to show exactly where the funds would come from.
He framed his general proposals in simple images that the average person might understand. Talking about a stabilization fund he said: "A fund of this kind is like a net for acrobats. By building confidence, it reduces the chance it will ever be used."
Russian aid in general, he said, should be looked at "not as a bailout, but a bridge loan, much as a family gets from the bank when it buys a new house before selling their old house."
Indeed, judging from today's speech by Mr. Clinton, what distinguishes Mr. Clinton's foreign policy from that pursued by Mr. Bush may be less the substance than the strong ability to articulate a rationale.
 
'Flattered' by Bush's Timing
 In many ways, Mr. Clinton gave the speech that Congressional Democrats and former President Richard M. Nixon have been urging President Bush to give for months. The Arkansas Governor gave voice to actions that in many cases the President himself has already done, or is proposing to do, but has struggled to put into words in a way that would be comprehensible and win broad domestic support.
Asked for his reaction to the fact that the President scheduled his announcement for the exact time of Mr. Clinton's long-scheduled speech, Mr. Clinton said: "I am flattered. I wish I could have the same influence on his domestic policy."
Mr. Clinton tried to distinguish his basically centrist foreign policy from the equally centrist approach of Mr. Bush by denouncing some specific Administration actions. But some of his criticism appeared to some listeners as a stretch, particularly his argument that the Administration propped up the Government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev "long after" it was obvious that power had shifted to the republics, or that Mr. Bush was browbeating Israel while "nurturing ties to Syria."
Where Mr. Clinton also tried to distinguish himself from the President was by underscoring his willingness to make the case to the American people about why such an investment in Russia and other republics at this time is in the long-term American interest. He said President Bush, before today, had been afraid to do that because of the unpopularity of foreign aid.
"I know it isn't popular today to call for foreign assistance of any kind," said Mr. Clinton. "It's harder when Americans are hurting, as millions are today. But I believe it is deeply irresponsible to forgo this short-term investment in our long-term security."
"Let me be clear: our nation can afford this," Mr. Clinton added. "This is not an exorbitant price to pay for a chance to create new American markets and anchor a revitalized Russia firmly in the democratic camp."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Loans for Argentina

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday announced a $3.15 billion package of loans to Argentina, which the country hopes to use to stretch its huge commercial debt.
The funds are expected to help Argentina in talks with private banks aimed at rescheduling the country's $31 billion in commercial debt. Argentina's total foreign debt is $62 billion. 
 The I.M.F. package included a $2.95 billion loan that runs through 1994 and $200 million originally pledged under a previous arrangement with the fund. About $900 million will be used as guarantees in Argentina's dealings with banks to reschedule and cut commercial debt.
The Argentine Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, said from Tokyo that Japan was willing to help Argentina raise funds for its dealings with the banks. Mr. Cavallo spoke after holding talks with Tsutomu Hata, Japan's Finance Minister.
"They confirmed that there is a good predisposition in Japan to help us raise the enhancements," Mr. Cavallo said.
Argentina wants its commercial creditors to reschedule its debt over 30 years. It has also offered to pay $400 million on past interest. Banks had sought a $1.1 billion payment.

HEADLINE: Welfare and Medicaid Bills Likely to Keep Soaring

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1

 BODY:
Although the new state budget will wring unprecedented savings from New York's Medicaid and welfare programs, even the budget's architects do not believe it will arrest the explosive growth in spending on social services in the near future.
And unless the economy makes a remarkable rebound in New York, the continued growth in spending on social services for the poor and elderly may open large deficits in the budget this year and in subsequent years. 
 State leaders have pointed to their ability to agree on $1.1 billion worth of changes in Medicaid and welfare as one of the signal achievements of this year's budget negotiations. But the patchwork package produced by the Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans is, as has often been the case in recession-era Albany, a compromise driven more by the need to generate cash quickly than by any consensus on a policy to control long-term spending growth.
"We cut growth this year, but only in a superficial way," said one legislative aide who is an expert on Medicaid issues.
Even with the $1.1 billion in savings, the state's spending on Medicaid and welfare is projected to grow from $6.1 billion last year to $6.5 billion this year. The state's welfare caseload grew from a monthly average of 1.3 million in 1990 to 1.5 million last December; the Medicaid caseload grew from a monthly average of 2.4 million in 1990 to 2.6 million in November.
 
No Driving Vision
 Because there is no guiding ideological or political imperative behind Albany's welfare reform movement, the budget's initiatives stand in contrast to more extreme measures enacted in other states. States from New Jersey to California have pared welfare-grant levels, eliminated welfare programs for the able-bodied poor and have threatened to withhold the welfare grant if recipients fail to search for work or have additional children.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Democrats who hold a majority in the Assembly have blocked similar changes in New York, arguing that such moves would balance the budget on the backs of the poor and could have severe long-term costs, both in human and financial terms.
But rather than making the Medicaid and welfare systems more efficient, many of the measures included in the budget compromise may simply shift the state's costs to health-care providers, patients and local governments.
 
Missing the Mark
 "The majority of the changes do not really cut expenditures," said Cynthia Green, an analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group financed by businesses.
The state plans to raise $229 million, for example, by extending and increasing taxes on the revenues of hospitals and nursing homes that were first imposed late in 1990.
It will save $20 million by requiring Medicaid patients to make payments whenever they receive service. And it will require local governments to begin paying a share of the energy costs that the state currently covers for welfare recipients, amounting to $50 million.
In the five months since the state discovered a $4.8 billion gap in its $30.8 billion budget, state leaders have agreed that much of the deficit would have to be closed with cuts in social services, the fastest growing part of the budget. But they have struggled to achieve a balance in how the cuts should be made.
 
New York City Influence
 The Assembly Democrats want to provide as much protection as possible to Medicaid and welfare recipients, particularly in a recession. Fifty-seven of the 95 Democrats in the Assembly are from New York City, where two-thirds of the state's welfare recipients live.
The Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are determined to protect an already weak health-care industry, including the nursing homes and hospitals that care for many of the state's Medicaid recipients.
Both sides claimed small victories. The Senate Republicans won approval to start a demonstration project in Rockland and Onandaga Counties aimed at deterring welfare fraud by fingerprinting recipients. Many Assembly Democrats objected to the project, because they felt it equated welfare recipients with criminals.
The Assembly Democrats, meanwhile, fended off Republican efforts to cut Home Relief grants and make deep cuts in Medicaid benefits. And they received Republican support for an initiative that would penalize health maintenance organizations that do not meet targets for enrolling Medicaid recipients.
They see the gradual transformation of the state's Medicaid program into a "managed care" system -- which requires recipients to use health maintenance organizations and similar prepaid health programs-- as a temporary check on health-care spending, necessary until a universal health-care system can be developed.
 
'Seasonal Budget Chaos'
 Officials with interest groups representing both the poor and health-care providers agreed that the unusual changes in this year's budget reflects not only New York's bipartisan Legislature, but also its recurring inability to balance its budget.
"It's the price we pay for seasonal budget chaos," said Daniel Sisto, president of the Hospital Association of New York State. "We no sooner get through one of these battles than we get another deficit and it starts all over again. Nobody can think long-term."

HEADLINE: Asked to Cut Back, Fernandez Seeks $517 Million More

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Brushing aside Mayor David N. Dinkins's request to trim $100 million from next year's New York City schools budget, Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez yesterday called for a $517 million increase in spending for items ranging from school repairs and security to a longer school day for some students.
The Chancellor's budget request, calling for a 7.8 percent increase, marks the beginning of the annual tug of war over how much will be spent to educate the public schools system's 973,000 students. 
 In unveiling his request for a record $7.185 billion operating budget, Mr. Fernandez conceded that he might not get everything he asked for. But he said, "We feel very comfortable with what we're requesting. We don't feel there's anything frivolous."
 
'Funds Aren't There'
 The Chancellor attributed more than half of the $517 million increase to such mandatory costs as those due to inflation, contract settlements with teachers, and legislative and regulatory requirements. But he said he would use $200 million from the increase for new programs.
Mr. Dinkins's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said yesterday that "the funds aren't there" to provide the board with an extra $517 million. But he said it was "appropriate" for Mr. Fernandez to seek as much assistance as possible from the Mayor.
"If you don't speak up," Mr. Michael said, "your agency's priorities are not going to be able to compete with other agency's priorities."
Among new programs, the Chancellor said he hoped to secure $70 million from the refinancing of city bonds with the Municipal Assistance Corporation for a three-point plan to improve school productivity. That plan, he said, would lengthen the school day for some middle school students, use computers to teach basic skills in elementary schools and help selected young students avoid costly special-education classes.
An additional $81.5 million in the budget would be used for emergency repairs at a handful of school buildings that are in "deplorable" condition, the Chancellor said, with problems like leaky roofs, faulty boilers and broken windows.
The total budget proposal, including pensions and debt service, would be $7.746 billion.
 
Assistance Corporation
 The process of fashioning a budget for the schools this year promises to be particularly heated, in light of the city's continuing fiscal constraints and the school system's rising enrollment. The board anticipates that it will have spent $6.668 billion on operating expenses when the current fiscal year ends June 30.
To help plug the city's budget gaps over the next two years, Mr. Dinkins said last month that he hoped to borrow more than $250 million, with the help of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, through a complex bond refinancing. But the chairman of the assistance corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, has warned against such a move, although he originally suggested it. The assistance corporation also controls $200 million in surpluses, accrued through past refinancings, that the city would like to use.
But even if assistance corporation money were made available to the city, Mr. Michael said yesterday, it is far from certain how much, if any, the schools would get. Mr. Rohatyn's office said yesterday that he was traveling in Europe and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Michael also said the city would not automatically pay for every expense that the Chancellor listed in the budget under the category of mandatory increases. "That certainly is not the end of the discussion," said Mr. Michael, who added that those costs would be reviewed carefully.
 
'It Wouldn't Be Pleasant'
 In his budget request, Mr. Fernandez did not suggest how he would handle potential budget cuts, despite indications from Mr. Dinkins in January that the schools might have to pare $100 million in the coming fiscal year. Mr. Fernandez said it was "too early" to make such determinations.
"It wouldn't be pleasant," Mr. Fernandez told reporters, "but we'd come up with ways of making cuts."
Mr. Michael said the city has shielded the schools from any potential cuts in state education aid that might emerge from the state budget negotiations.
Included in the Chancellor's proposal are two requests for new money that the city has already agreed to. As part of a $28 million program announced by the Mayor on March 1 to tighten school security at the city's most dangerous high schools, $8 million will be added to the current operating budget. The city has also promised $36 million for school security and conflict resolution under the Safe Streets-Safe City program.
Mr. Fernandez presented his request yesterday to the Board of Education, which will hold a public hearing on April 15 before voting on whether to send it to City Hall.
"It's important for us to talk about what we need and why we need it," said H. Carl McCall, the board president. "That's what this budget does."

HEADLINE: Reasons Assessed for Lag In Metropolitan Recovery

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Economists are growing increasingly convinced that a national recovery is finally under way, but they caution that residents of the New York metropolitan region will have to be more patient. A recovery in the region is likely to lag behind that of the rest of the nation by six months or more, many said, with economic growth resuming only in 1993.
The reasons are many. The recession started in the metropolitan region about a year and a half earlier than elsewhere and has been much more severe, making it a steeper climb back to stability and ultimately to growth. 
 "The mood here is a bit more fragile -- confidence is weaker," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which forecast on Tuesday that the region would lose an additional 200,000 jobs in 1992. That means it will take longer than in other parts of the country for people to feel inclined to part with some of their income, in stores and restaurants or with their real-estate brokers. And until they do, the region's economy is expected to be slower to rebound.
 
Sharp Drop in Demand
 The severity of the local recession has a lot to do with the fact that many of the industries that dominate New York City's economy are in the services sector, like advertising, banking, law, and accounting. After expanding at a breakneck pace in the 1980's, virtually all those industries are facing new competitors from overseas and a sharp drop in demand because so many of their corporate clients have merged or gone out of existence.
These industries are struggling to adapt to the new economic climate at a time when they are burdened with the excessive overheads that they built up during the booming 1980's. The restructuring of many of these industries has contributed heavily to the 495,000 jobs that have been lost in the region in the last two years.
"This is a region that is in the painful and wrenching throes of reinventing itself in all the industries that define what New York is all about," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "We're very far from reaching the end of that road."
The weakness in the region's private sector has been matched by state and local governments, which will further delay a recovery. With residents earning and spending less, income, property and sales-tax revenues have fallen steeply. The reduced size of New York City's budget has led to more job cuts in the public sector and less public spending on hospitals, economic development and infrastructure projects like roads and school construction.
All of that, in turn, detracts from local economic activity. Economists say one reason they are so gloomy about the region's employment prospects this year is the anticipated reduction in the size of the state and city work forces in New York.
 
Strong International Ties
 Until recently, many people viewed the city's strong international ties as a source of economic strength that could offset some of these other weaker areas. The city has served as a major distribution point for traded goods, and in recent years the export of services like investment banking, legal advice and advertising has become increasingly important to the local economy.
But with Europe suffering from high interest rates and the strain of trying to prop up eastern Europe, and with the Japanese financial and real-estate sectors slumping, even that segment of the New York economy seems to be vulnerable.
But while job losses are expected to continue to plague the region, economists say it is also important to look at wage rates.
 
Higher Wage Rates
 Even in its boom years, said Robert V. Nicoletti, senior forecasting economist for the city's Office of Management and Budget, the New York region was never great at generating new jobs. What it has done well, however, is to produce higher average wages. From 1979 to 1990, for example, employment grew less than 9 percent, while average wages, adjusted for inflation, rose by 15 percent.
"If you look at what happened to the city's economy in the 1980's," said Mr. Nicoletti, "two-thirds of the growth was due to rising real wage rates, not rising employment." Nationally during that same period, employment grew by 22 percent while real wages remained virtually flat.
Even last year, when the city lost 194,000 nonagricultural jobs, the average wage rate rose by about 3.5 percent, Mr. Nicoletti said. And he forecasts that the increase will be even greater this year, augmenting last year's gains, and will exceed the national average.
Ms. Scanlon of the Port Authority agreed. "Incomes will grow, but jobs will probably lag this year," she said. "The feeling will be one of recovery, even though the jobs won't show it."

HEADLINE: Port Agency Says Hoboken Owes Refund

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., April 1

 BODY:
A day after Hoboken voters, for the second time in two years, defeated a plan to redevelop the city's crumbling waterfront with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a partner, the bistate agency says it wants a refund of at least part of the $30 million it has spent on the project over the last decade.
Sounding clearly frustrated, the chairman of the Port Authority, Richard C. Leone, said yesterday: "As far as I'm concerned, there is no project. The people have decided the issue locally. We've invested about $30 million various ways, and I think Hoboken has a financial obligation." 
 But Hoboken officials said they were meeting with a citizens coalition to evaluate its alternative to the defeated plan and quickly propose a new one to the authority. "We're going to move very fast in evaluating what the coalition proposed and keep Port Authority funds in Hoboken," said Mayor Patrick Pasculli.
The defeat of the plan, which would have given Hoboken a $3.25 million advance lease payment from the authority immediately, means that property taxes will definitely go up next year, said Peggy Thomas, the city's director of planning and community development.
"I don't see any other alternative," said Ms. Thomas, who was a leader of the campaign to have the plan approved. "We've lost our industrial base, and we have no tax base. The only thing we can do is turn to our property owners."
Hoboken, with 33,400 residents, has had a surge of gentrification over the last decade, but the rising number of professionals buying condominiums and cooperatives has not offset the losses from dwindling industry, officials say.
The defeated plan called for 1.88 million square feet of development on parcels near the Hoboken transit terminals, including a 20-story office building and 9-story hotel on a 5.5-acre pier and two residential buildings of 21 and 17 stories just inland from the pier. The rest of the city-owned property would be developed with the advice of a citizens group.
Under the plan, the city would lease the 1.88 million square feet to the Port Authority for 55 years; the authority would prepare the site and seek a developer. It would also build a park, expand the city's Little League field and give the city 20 percent of the development's gross revenues for the first 35 years and 60 percent for the remaining 20 years.
Supporters said the plan would mean short-term budget relief, new recreation areas for children and, eventually, 4,500 new jobs and $3 million to $4 million in annual revenues.
But opponents, led by a group called the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, had several objections. They said it would mean a too-tall, environmentally destructive tower in the river that would dwarf Hoboken's three- and four-story brownstones, and maybe even siphon business from the city's vibrant commercial district. They also noted that the promised fiscal relief was no sure thing, since the agreement did not call for any development until the year 2005.
The opponents argued, apparently effectively, that the city was pushing hard for a flawed project because of its short-term budget problems. They said city officials needed the authority's $3.25 million payment to fill a budget gap projected at $13.2 million next year, or one-third of the entire city budget, and did not want to have to repay the Port Authority $7 million it had received as an advance in 1989, before a larger development plan was defeated by 12 votes.
 
Chance for Coalition's Plan
 Hoboken is now liable for the $7 million. Ms. Thomas said the money had been set aside in case of a defeat.
She also added that the Coalition for a Better Waterfront's plan may have a chance. Its proposal, designed by a Manhattan architect, Craig Whitaker, would create parkland along the water's edge, with a milelong esplanade the entire length of Hoboken and 19 blocks of mixed development no more than eight stories high.
While Mr. Leone said that the authority was seeking legal advice to recoup "at least some" of the $30 million it had invested, he added that the agency would be willing to hear "any plan from anyone."
"We're not going away as an agency," he said. "We have many items on our plate."
At least once before, the Port Authority said it would drop all plans for the Hoboken waterfront because of citizens' opposition, but it has repeatly re-entered negotiations.
In 1984, the New York and New Jersey Legislatures passed bills that would let the Port Authority spend $125 million in each state to develop mixed residential and commercial properties on the waterfronts at Hunters Point, Queens, and Hoboken. While the Hoboken project has stalled, the Hunters Point project is moving ahead, with private money already committed, said Mr. Leone.
Although Hoboken officials have said that the Port Authority could take the money elsewhere, Mr. Leone said the legislation made it clear where the $125 million was to be spent. He added, however, that it did not mean the agency had to spend it.
"It could just sit there," he said.

HEADLINE: Rev. James Harvey, 47, Founder Of Jobs Program for Ex-Convicts

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The Rev. James R. Harvey, who founded a program that has given thousands of ex-convicts training and jobs in florist shops and other businesses, died on Monday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 47 years old and lived in Queens.
He died of natural causes after a long illness, his family said. 
Father Harvey was the president of Flowers with Care, which he founded 17 years ago to provide first-time offenders with work. The program started with florist shops, then included other businesses and longer-term training.
About 1,000 former inmates a year enroll in the program. Most become gainfully employed, and relatively few relapse into crime, officials of the program say. Depending on individual need, the assistance includes food, clothing, counseling, drug addiction therapy, on-the-job training, placement, remedial high school and even college preparation.
 
Program Is Based in Queens
 A favorite among Father Harvey's success stories involved a convicted bank embezzler who went on a florist-sales call, to a bank. Father Harvey got a bit edgy as the day wore on without any word from the apprentice salesman. But at the end of the afternoon, the bank president called in an order for 30,000 cactus plants to use as premiums.
The program, which includes more than 120 small businesses, is based in Astoria, Queens, and the program is affiliated with Catholic Charities of Brooklyn.
Father Harvey was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from St. Francis College and Immaculate Conception Seminary, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1971 and became a parish priest at St. Margaret's Church in Middle Village, Queens.
When he was assigned to be a chaplain at the city Corrections Department's Queens House of Detention in 1973 and later at Rikers Island, he saw the need for training and jobs to help turn unemployed young people away from crime. He started the program with a friend who was a florist.
For several years Father Harvey also taught criminal justice at St. John's University.
He is survived by his mother, Catherine Harvey of Brooklyn, and two sisters, Kathleen Scott of Brooklyn and Patricia Costello of Crofton, Md.

HEADLINE: Industrial Expansion Continues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing economy, pushed by a surge in new orders, continued to expand in March, according to a report by the nation's purchasing managers. Economists said that the figures presented the freshest evidence available that the nation's economy had moved out of recession.
The purchasing managers' report, a closely watched gauge of the nation's manufacturing industries, said that its index of economic activity rose to 54.1 percent in March from 52.4 percent in February. It was the index's highest level in six months.
 
What Readings Show
 A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is declining; a reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion. 
 The report followed a report by the Government on Tuesday that the leading economic indicators had advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent in February. Also, on that same day, the Conference Board reported its survey of consumer confidence showed its biggest gain in a year.
"The purchasing managers index indicates that the economic expansion is clearly under way," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board and president of Brimmer & Associates, an economic consulting firm in Washington. "And it looks like future activity will be strengthened because of the substantial rise in new orders."
Mr. Brimmer said that the figures, coupled with other recent economic data, indicated that the recession had ended and that "we are now in a period of economic growth, although we should anticipate that that growth is likely to be very slow."
The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers working in a wide range of industrial companies. Also, it is the first important indicator each month of how the economy has performed in the previous month. The survey is compiled from interviews with purchasing managers at more than 300 industrial companies across the country.
The sharpest increase among the various indexes in the purchasing managers' report came in new orders, which rose to 62.4 percent, from 57.5 percent in February. That represents a 12-percentage-point increase since January's reading of 50.3 percent. Economists said that the new order figures were particularly significant because they served as a harbinger of the patterns of production.
"The economy in February and March resembles the economic recovery, which took place in the third quarter of 1991," Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee, said. He is also director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. "This time the growth in new orders appears stronger and should contribute to increased growth in production," he added. "Hopefully, this will lead to a more sustained recovery than in 1991."
Production expanded in March for the 10th consecutive month of growth. The production index rose to 60.1 percent, from 58.6 percent in February and 50.6 percent in January, the association said. The imports index rose over the 50 percent mark for only the second time since the association began surveying that item in 1989. That index rose to 51 percent in March, from 48 percent in February.
The purchasing managers' price index rose to 46.6 percent in March from 45.7 percent in February. But that reading, below 50 percent, means that the rate of inflation is continuing to be low. The group said that the purchasing managers' price index generally led movements in both the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index, and that low inflation was likely to continue.

HEADLINE: New Hope Is Seen for Trade Pact

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 1

 BODY:
After several years of tortuous negotiations, the leading trade negotiators of the European Community and the United States are saying, for the first time, that a global agreement on liberalizing trade may be possible soon.
The negotiations began five years ago under the auspices of the 108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade, and they have assumed importance in recent months as a barometer of relations between Europe and the United States, now that the strategic threat that was long the cement of the trans-Atlantic alliance has been withdrawn. 
 The stumbling block to the agreement continues to be farm subsidies. And while expressions of optimism in the past have proved empty, some compromises are now being offered that both sides say may finally nudge things to a conclusion. The key seems to be a willingness to treat differently those European farm subsidies that increase output and those that do not.
 
U.S. vs. Europe
 The dispute has pitted the United States and other food-exporting nations -- including Canada, Argentina and Australia -- against the European Community, where spending on farmers accounts for about 54 percent of the community's annual budget of $85 billion. The food exporters are seeking sharp cuts in the subsidies and tariff protection enjoyed by European farmers, which lead to overproduction and enormous stockpiles of beef, cereals and dairy products, which then get dumped on world markets.
France, whose farmers are a potent political force, has been the stumbling block among the 12 nations of the community. When Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the trade organization, proposed cuts of 20 to 36 percent in the community's domestic subsidies and tariff protection, as well as in the volume of subsidized exports allowed, France balked.
But a compromise has been taking shape over a plan to extend what Mr. Dunkel calls "a green box" -- a category of farm subsidies that do not affect production and would be exempt from cuts.
In essence, the community is striving to move from a system that encourages unlimited production by offering guaranteed prices for all products to one in which there is no premium on output. To do so, it wants to be able to make payments to farmers that would depend on the size of the farm, rather than its production. These payments would increase for farmers agreeing to take land out of production or to cut their herds.
 
Bush Sent Letter
 "We still want to encourage people to stay on the land, but we want to move away from a production-based system," one British official said.
In a letter last month to Jacques Delors, the community president, President Bush agreed that such payments could be included in the green box plan and thus exempted from the Dunkel cuts. Frans Andriessen, the community's chief trade negotiator, said, "I think we are now rather close to resolving the subsidy dispute, although we still have problems on the export side."
France has objected to the proposed 24 percent cut in the volume of subsidized exports. It wants a smaller reduction, but the United States is apparently unprepared to budge. Germany, which had stood with France on farm subsidies and exports, now seems to be emphasizing equally its commitment to a GATT accord, and is now trying to mediate.
One possible area for compromise involves services. Europe objects to an American demand that the American market in telecommunications and financial services be selectively exempt from the GATT principle of equal access for any member country to another's markets. Washington says it cannot open these markets while American companies in these fields have limited or no access to many foreign countries.
Hinting at a trade-off, Mr. Andriessen said, "How can I sell concessions in agriculture if the services question is not dealt with?" And Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said, "If we can resolve the agricultural impasse, then other areas could move rather quickly."
Both officials said negotiations in Washington, Brussels and Geneva were intense, adding that if no accord was reached this month, attention would inevitably drift to other issues. "Our belief if that if the agreement does not come in April, we will probably have to wait for the new U.S. Administration," Mr. Andriessen said.
In separate interviews, Mr. Andriessen and Mrs. Hills said they were optimistic about concluding the talks successfully before the end of April. They also warned of the potentially devastating political and economic consequences of failure.
"The talks are moving and I now think we can find a way by the end of April," Mr. Andriessen said. "It will be a catastrophe if we fail."
In a telephone interview from Washington, Mrs. Hills said, "Yes, I am hopeful it can be done by the end of April."
Mr. Dunkel, months ago, set a deadline of April 15 to conclude the current round of talks. While that target seems unreachable, the officials suggested a scheduled April 22 meeting between President Bush and Mr. Delors could be decisive.
The optimism was fueled today by the announcement of an outline agreement settling a bitter five-year dispute between Washington and Europe on subsidies to the commercial aircraft industry.
Mr. Andriessen said of the GATT talks: "A failure would affect our overall relations because it would be seen not only as a failure in trade policy but also a failure of political leadership. After all, the highest political leadership on both sides has now made a personal investment in success."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Cash Is Trash? Not This Time

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
"Cash," went the Wall Street refrain as 1991 ended, "is trash." So low were the prevailing interest rates on savings accounts, money market funds and Treasury bills that investors would have to turn to the stock and bond markets to find decent returns, the conventional wisdom held.
So what happened in the first quarter of 1992? "Cash," as the financial community calls short-term investments, did better than stocks or bonds: Investors who kept their money in cash had positive returns, albeit small ones, while investors in stocks and bonds lost money. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, for example, fell more than 2 percent in the quarter, even after adjusting for dividend income, and J. P. Morgan's index of Government bonds showed a decline of 1.6 percent, as long-term interest rates rose.
 
Soured Biotechs
 And anyone who decided to stick with last year's big winners, the biotechnology stocks, could easily have lost 30 percent.
That is not to say that no stock investors did well. Those wise enough, or lucky enough, to have bought baskets of cyclical stocks, with a sprinkling of previously unloved banks, had a wonderful quarter. And the Russell 2,000 index of small stocks was up 7.3 percent, with many of the best performers among the smallest stocks, which few money managers own.
The general softness of stocks did not seem to discourage investors, however. When March figures are in, mutual fund buyers alone will probably have poured a record $19 billion, or perhaps $20 billion, into stock funds during the quarter. That would almost be enough to absorb the entire $21.2 billion in stock offerings during the quarter, as reflected in figures from IDD Information Services.
Such public enthusiasm in a flat market is not exactly typical, and it reflects the fact that many investors have barely noticed that the great bull market has paused.
The Dow Jones industrial average, the index most investors notice most, touched several record highs during the quarter and was up almost 3 percent for the quarter, when dividends are included. That run-up reflects a great performance by the Walt Disney Company and a big rebound in the General Motors Corporation, a stock that should benefit greatly from the economic recovery that Wall Street so firmly anticipates.
Moreover, the performance figures would probably look a lot better if the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, had not moved to slash the discount rate on Dec. 20 and had waited until the new year began. When stocks soared in the final 10 sessions of 1991, it turned what had been a good year into a great one.
Byron R. Wien, the chief United States equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, calls it "the Greenspan curse," since money managers could have used the late December performance in their 1992 numbers but will not be able to. He thinks stocks now are likely to move lower.
For many stocks, the rally that ended in early January marked a great time to sell. Bob Farrell, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said 28 percent of the more than 4,000 stocks tracked by Merrill have fallen at least 20 percent from their January highs. He thinks weakness may continue for a few weeks but that a rally will start before the end of April.
There are still plenty of bulls. "This is a short-lived flat spot in an ongoing bull market," said Steve Einhorn, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs's investment policy committee.
Contrary to the arguments of many, Mr. Einhorn said stocks were still fairly valued relative to interest rates, and he forecast that continued buying by individual investors would help push shares higher. For the year, he said, he expects total return from the Standard & Poor's 500 to be about 12 to 15 percent.
The big winners of the first quarter among New York Stock Exchange stocks that began the year above $5 a share included Chicago's Continental Bank, up 78.6 percent; Boston's Shawmut National, up 64.3 percent, and New York's Citicorp, up 59 percent. The balance sheets of those banks are not likely to be compared with J. P. Morgan's, but their stock performance is certainly better. Morgan, a favorite in 1991, has fallen 15.8 percent so far this year.
Auto stocks were leaders in the quarter, with Chrysler up 52.2 percent, as investors bet on recovery. But oil stocks reeled from weak prices and seemed to get no benefit from expectations of economic growth.
Fred Leuffer, an analyst for C. J. Lawrence, notes that many on Wall Street are questioning if oil company dividends are safe. Most are, he says, and the stocks are worth buying.
With the dollar generally rising this year, most overseas investments have been poor ones for Americans. An exception is the India Growth Fund, a closed-end fund that invests in Indian equities. It was up 91.6 percent for the quarter, making it the Big Board's best performer.
The best performer on any market for the quarter was Dataram, a maker of computer peripheral equipment. It soared 189.9 percent on the American Stock Exchange in the quarter, as it reported sharply higher sales and profits.
The worst performers among stocks that began the quarter at or above $5 a share, included Chambers Development, whose class B shares plunged 69.5 percent on the American Stock Exchange, and Employee Benefit Plans, which fell 62.6 percent on the Big Board.
Both stocks had been top performers based on rising profits. Employee Benefit, a health insurance processing company, disappointed holders by saying profits would be flat, while Chambers, a developer of landfill sites for trash, changed its accounting in a way that decimated reported profits.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs in Reaction To Decline in Tokyo Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other leading currencies yesterday, mostly in reaction to the Tokyo stock market reaching a five-year low. Gold prices were lower.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $342.90 an ounce, down 80 cents. A late bid at the Republic National Bank in New York quoted it at $342.45, off 75 cents. 
 The dollar opened higher against the yen after Japan's key stock index tumbled 4 percent to its lowest closing since Jan. 13, 1987.
The dip in the Japanese stock market followed a 0.75 percentage point cut by Japan's central bank in the discount rate.
Early in the day, the United States currency also fared well against the pound on British polls showing the Labor Party with a significant lead over the Conservatives ahead of the April 9 general election, Mike Faust, currency market analyst at MMS International, said.
Then, however, a national purchasing managers report showed better-than-expected numbers on United States manufacturing in March -- a 1.7 percentage point jump to 54.1 percent -- and the dollar fell off slightly, Mr. Faust said.
"After that, the dollar didn't move much all afternoon," he said.
The dollar has not been trading higher on the most recent solid economic data, waiting for a significant change in the figures, analysts have said.
"When the dollar doesn't trend upwards on better-than-expected numbers, investors turn around and sell off a bit," Mr. Faust said.
Traders generally believe market participants actively bought dollars several weeks ago in anticipation that healthy economic reports would raise the currency's value. Analysts have said the investors apparently got too far ahead in their trading positions.
In New York, the dollar rose to 134.50 Japanese yen from Tuesday's 133.85 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar jumped to 133.90 yen, from 133.05 Tuesday. Later, in London, the dollar rose to 134.25 yen.
The British pound was quoted at $1.7260, down from $1.7355 on Tuesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.7255 from $1.7365.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6520 German marks, up from 1.6450; 1.5110 Swiss francs, up from 1.4995.

HEADLINE: Hockey;
Puck Stops Everywhere as Players Go on Strike

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
National Hockey League players went on strike yesterday, staging the first general walkout in the 75-year history of the league.
The strike began at 3 P.M. after the players, voting by secret ballot, rejected by a vote of 560 to 4 the owners' last proposal for a new collective bargaining agreement. 
 Three games scheduled for last night were called off, but negotiators for the National Hockey League Players Association and management were expected to join in new talks last evening at a Toronto hotel.
The players association said its membership had no plans to picket.
Those players who were on the road yesterday were to be transported back to their home cities at union expense. The Islanders had been scheduled to play the Maple Leafs at Toronto, the Washington Capitals were to have played the Devils at the Meadowlands and the Winnipeg Jets were to have visited the San Jose Sharks.
 
Playoffs in Jeopardy
 If the strike ends quickly, the league should be able to play the last 30 games of the regular season, which is scheduled to end on Sunday. But if the walkout becomes lengthy, it could jeopardize the Stanley Cup playoffs, a four-round tournament that is scheduled to begin next Wednesday.
The playoffs, with as many as 105 games, last until June and can generate a gross revenue of close to $100 million from tickets, television and concessions. Because it is the time of the season when many teams make their profit, the players have leverage.
One of the teams displaying particularly strong support for the union is the Rangers, a team with a lot to lose. The Rangers have the league's best record and a realistic chance for their first Stanley Cup championship since 1940.
"How do you explain a strike to the fans?" said the Rangers' Mike Gartner, a member of the union's negotiating committee, speaking at a news conference at the Skydome Hotel in Toronto. "Do we expect the fans to feel sorry for us? I don't think they will feel sorry for players who are making an average salary of about $350,000 a year. But by the same note, I don't think people will necessarily feel sorry for some owners who are making several million dollars a year.
"We're not trying to get sympathy from the fans, although the fans are the people that are generally going to get hurt. What we are trying to do is say to the people that there are some very important issues that are on the table that are extremely important for our players association and for us to continue as a players association."
 
A Show of Strength for Union
 The overwhelming vote of the membership was a strong signal of support to the union, which had appeared to be giving ground in recent weeks. After saying for months that free-agent mobility was its major goal, the union's bargaining committee had backed off on most of its demands on this issue and agreed to accept only modest reforms.
The union set last Monday as a strike deadline, then moved it back to yesterday in order to poll the entire membership. Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the players association, said it was made clear to the players that a vote to turn down the contract proposal was also a vote to strike.
Perhaps sensing weakness, team owners also demanded that players negotiate with them over an estimated $10 million in revenue the union gets from trading card companies. Such revenue has been going to the union for more than 20 years, but owners say now that they are a subject for negotiation.
When negotiations broke off last Sunday, the trading-card money was among the major issues still unresolved, along with the length of the contract and arbitration procedures. In recent days, both sides have conceded that they weren't too far apart.
"Somebody should be spanked," said Jim Lites, executive vice president of the Detroit Red Wings, who called the strike "childish."
"The issues aren't economic," he said. "It's really political."
Perhaps it is a mixture of both. The owners have said they were going to lose $9 million this season after making $125 million over the previous three. The players have said the owners will make $24 million this season.
Lites, who represents one of the most profitable teams, said he feared that owners of teams that lose money would take over the negotiations and "look for radical change, a total restructuring of the business."
 
Players Angered by Management
 Many of the players said their resolve was strengthened in recent days by the attitude of management toward bargaining. Intense negotiations began a week ago Tuesday, but William Wirtz, the chairman of the owners' Board of Governors, didn't arrive until Saturday afternoon.
The players said they had hoped to bargain until Monday's original strike deadline, but the owners said they had to adjourn the meetings Sunday to go to Chicago for a meeting of the Board of Governors.
After the owners presented a final proposal late Saturday night, the union countered with its own version early Sunday morning. Goodenow said several times this week that the union's final proposal was a major compromise and he expressed dismay that the owners rejected it without comment.
In his news conference yesterday, Goodenow said the union had agreed to expand the season from 80 games to 84 and to "modest adjustments to an already overly restrictive free-agent system."
In announcing a suspension of the season, John Ziegler, the National Hockey League president, said: "This action is required by reason of the unprecedented, and regretful, decision of the National Hockey League Players Association to go on strike. Our concerns are for, and with, the great fans of hockey who will suffer the most from the action taken today by the N.H.L.P.A."
Some players said they doubted that the owners wanted to reach a settlement and that management instead sought a confrontation to test the will of the union and its new leader to call its first strike.
"Look how much we gave in and it still wasn't a deal," said Ken Baumgartner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, one of nine players on the bargaining committee. "Some of us feel that the owners had no intention of striking a deal. They are testing us. Come strike, all bets are off. I'm sure both sides will take off what they have on the table."
"The window of opportunity to keep the playoffs alive is very small," said Gartner. "We have to take advantage of that opportunity over the next few days and try and get some kind of agreement. If we can't, I don't believe there will be any playoffs."
Along with Ziegler, members of management's bargaining committee in Toronto yesterday were Ronald Corey of Montreal, Marcel Aubut of Quebec, Bill Torrey of the Islanders, Barry Shenkarow of Winnipeg, Mike Ilitch of Detroit and Paul Martha of Pittsburgh. Missing again, however, was Wirtz. Joining Goodenow at the union's news conference yesterday were Gartner, Baumgartner, Mike Liut of the Washington Capitals and Bryan Trottier of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

HEADLINE: Conservation Makes a Case

 BODY:
"What we found is that the cheapest source of new power is conservation." Those words from a senior New York State energy official explain Gov. Mario Cuomo's laudable decision to cancel a $12 billion contract to buy power from a mammoth hydroelectric complex planned for Quebec.
The project, known as Great Whale, was bitterly contentious. It would have provided New Yorkers with clean power beginning in 1995. It would also have turned a huge, unspoiled area of Quebec into a managed system of waterways and reservoirs, threatening the hunting grounds and livelihood of native Indians. 
 Alarmed American environmentalists, led by William B. Hoyt of Buffalo, moved to block the deal. Mr. Cuomo based his reversal largely on economic grounds. He did not address the difficult question of whether New Yorkers should try to dictate environmental policy to Quebecers. Nor did he dispute the fact that the deal made environmental sense for smog-ridden New Yorkers. Hydroelectric power creates none of the gases that contribute to air pollution and acid rain.
But the protests forced a fundamental question: Does New York really need the energy? The answer turned out to be no. One reason was the economic downturn after 1989. A more surprising finding was that New York's utilities had done a remarkably good job conserving energy. Instead of building new plants to meet demand, utilities have tried to satisfy that demand by getting everyone to use existing energy more efficiently.
The Power Authority has spent millions of dollars encouraging high schools, police departments and municipal hospitals to use more efficient lighting, heating and air-conditioning systems. Investor-owned utilities, which would have bought 80 percent of Quebec's power, had done the same with their customers. By 1991, these efforts had begun to pay off. According to one study, New York's conservation-related energy savings are now close to double the national average.
"Conservation competes very well when you give it a chance," one economist remarked after Mr. Cuomo's decision. That's a lesson California's inventive utilities learned years ago. It's a lesson New Yorkers are learning now. And it's a lesson, clearly, for the country at large.

HEADLINE: Yes, Help Russia, But Stop Magnifying Threats

 BODY:
President Bush deserves bipartisan support for his new programs of aid to Russia and the other former Soviet republics. He has, laudably if tardily, seized the chance to invest in democratic and capitalist reform in what was recently a menacing Communist superpower.
Yet he forfeited an opportunity to redefine U.S. foreign policy using Russian aid as an example. Mr. Bush promotes aid as a bulwark against a renewed Soviet threat. But he could instead be describing America's larger purposes in a transformed world -- transcending military responses to advance democracy and markets through cooperation. 
 By the time Mr. Bush got around to his announcement yesterday, he had been pressed by critics as diverse as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. For months the White House has treated foreign initiatives like political poison. With Mr. Clinton poised to announce his own aid agenda in a New York address yesterday, Mr. Bush moved his plans forward, to almost the same hour.
The President's programs are sound: provide America's rightful share of international support for the beleaguered ruble and offer credits to buy food during the transition to market prices. Sensibly, Mr. Bush conditions the aid on the recipient republics following through with reforms. He offers mostly loans to be repaid when these countries get back on their feet. Wisely, he warns Americans not to expect too much too soon.
But where he might have used the transformation in U.S.-Russian relations to define the foreign policy needs of a new era, Mr. Bush turned his gaze toward the past. Echoing Mr. Nixon, he evoked the unlikely specter of a revived Soviet threat: "If this democratic revolution is defeated, it could plunge us into a world more dangerous in some respects than the dark years of the cold war."
True, the world remains a dangerous place. But the collapse of the Soviet threat immeasurably widens America's margin of security. This breathing space allows Washington to pursue other important values and interests.
Mr. Clinton appears less resistant to that change than Mr. Bush. In his speech yesterday to the Foreign Policy Association, he repeated his call for "a new strategy for American engagement." But then he was off and running -- backward. "Having won the cold war, we must not now lose the peace. . . . No national security issue is more urgent." In a similar vein, he spoke of "new threats" from armed conflict within and among the former Soviet republics and from growing ethnic rivalry "which could spill across borders."
These ethnic turf battles are serious. But how exactly do they threaten America? How much better if both he and Mr. Bush had proclaimed aid to Russia and others as stirring examples of a fundamental change in the ends and means of U.S. foreign policy, namely helping to create democracies and more open economies.
The most dramatic way to bring that message home to Americans would be to take the money for Russian aid -- and for U.N. peacekeeping and other essential international efforts -- directly out of the bloated defense budget. That would ease hostility to foreign aid by insuring that the money is not coming at the expense of urgent needs at home.
Magnifying threats is the old, reactive pattern.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
A Captive Press

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The Sunday Times of London topped the front page some weeks ago with a banner headline: "Soviet files reveal Labor's private dialogue with Kremlin." Below it was a large picture of the Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, his head shown against a red background.
The eager reader of this great scoop found that Soviet diplomats over the years had sent home reports of meeting Labor Party figures at embassy cocktail parties, the House of Commons and so on. They had conversations about current events. In other words, humdrum stuff. 
 Welcome to the world of British journalism in election years. It is journalism of a kind now hardly known in the United States: grotesquely partisan, shamelessly advancing one party's cause. And almost all of it is pro-Conservative.
The Daily Mail and The Daily Express, tabloids aimed at the middlebrow market, are totally committed to the Conservatives. So is Rupert Murdoch's best-selling Sun. The only large-circulation daily that supports Labor is The Daily Mirror, which was owned by Robert Maxwell and is now up for grabs.
"What Left Wants From Kinnock," a Daily Express headline said in late January, as the time for an election drew near. The story claimed that the left wing of the Labor Party -- which in reality has been marginalized by Mr. Kinnock -- would see to it that he "devalued the pound by 25 percent" and handed power "back to union bosses."
When the campaign started, Labor's top financial spokesman, John Smith, announced his budget ideas. The Daily Mail's page 1 coverage included a cartoon of Mr. Smith holding a taxpayer upside down and shaking money out of his pockets. The lead paragraph -- the lead of a news story -- said:
"Labor unveiled its tax plans yesterday and revealed that despite its mask of modernity and moderation, its driving force is still the politics of envy."
When Mr. Smith said he would be content if inflation were at current, "reasonable" European levels, The Daily Mail's banner was: "Mr. Rising Price."
Then there is the device of the unsourced "revelation." The Daily Express said: "Neil picks jobs for the boyos -- Britain's top ambassadors will be chosen from the ranks of the party faithful if Labor wins . . . it was revealed last night."
Last week the campaign was largely given over to brickbats about a Labor political broadcast. It described the case of a little girl who had had to wait nearly a year for a National Health Service operation while another who used private medicine was treated quickly.
"Disgusting, Distorted, Despicable" said the headline in the pro-Tory Evening Standard the next day. It quoted the doctor of the girl whose case had been the basis of the broadcast, 5-year-old Jennifer Bennett, as saying that the delay in her operation had been the result of administrative error, not underfunding of the Health Service.
The Daily Mail's headline the next day was "No Regard for a Little Girl." The Sun's was: "If Kinnock will tell lies about a sick little girl, will he ever tell the truth about anything?"
In fact, the television broadcast was evidently accurate. For the doctor who claimed it was distorted had written a letter to Jennifer's father a month earlier saying that the delay in her operation was "unacceptable," that the waiting list for the hospital had "climbed enormously" and that there was "insufficient funding" for nurses.
The Daily Mirror printed the doctor's letter with an exultant page 1 headline: "GOT 'EM: Doctor's letter damns Tories." The story pointed out that the doctor was a Conservative activist.
The satirical magazine Private Eye has taken to printing mock front pages of The Daily Mail. It had one with the banner headline "Labor Plans Slaughter of the First Born." The story began:
"One of the first actions of a future Labor Government, The Daily Mail can reveal, would be to murder the eldest children of all families in Great Britain. . . . Last night Labor spokesmen angrily denied the top-secret plans. 'How on earth did you find out?' said Gordon Brown, one of Kinnock's closest aides."

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Suspect: A Troubled Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 1

 BODY:
Next to his picture in a 1960 high school yearbook is the prediction that Edward I. Savitz, its editor, would someday be Chief Justice of the United States.
"The Flame staff believes that its editor in chief will make it," they wrote 32 years ago in the yearbook of West Philadelphia High School. 
 But the Flame staff was wrong. Instead of continuing on the upward climb expected of the class valedictorian, yearbook editor and one of the most popular students in school, Mr. Savitz faltered. Law school fizzled, his graduate studies ended inconclusively, his marriage ended in divorce and he wound up working in his older brother's insurance business as an actuary.
Today Mr. Savitz is charged in the statutory rapes of four minor boys. Last Friday the Philadelphia District Attorney and the city's Health Commissioner issued an extraordinary public health warning about Mr. Savitz, who had been in police custody for two days on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual abuse of children, indecent assault and corrupting the morals of a minor in connection with complaints by two males.
 
AIDS Test Urged
 The officials said that he had AIDS and that he had been infected with the virus that causes it for two years before he developed AIDS. During this time, the officials said, he may have had sex with several hundred teen-age boys, and they advised anyone who had contact with Mr. Savitz to seek advice about having an AIDS test.
It was in the 1970's, when Mr. Savitz was in his 30's and starting in the insurance business, that high school students in South Philadelphia began passing the word about a man they knew as "Uncle Ed," "Uncle Eddie" or "Fast Eddie." He lived in a downtown row house at the time, and paid high prices for dirty underwear and feces.
The police say they have evidence that Mr. Savitz has had contact with high school students and teen-age street hustlers since 1979. The evidence includes 5,000 photographs of boys or young men, some of them nude, and 312 plastic trash bags filled with soiled socks and underwear.
But since Friday, as public concern about AIDS swept the city, health officials have begun playing down the risk that Mr. Savitz may have passed on his infection. They said most of Mr. Savitz's activities appear to have involved oral sex and the acting out of fetishes. Both activities pose little or no risk of spreading AIDS, they said.
Mr. Savitz was released last week on $3 million bail, but later was re-arrested after two more minors came forward with similar allegations. Bail was set at $20 million, but Barnaby C. Wittels, Mr. Savitz's lawyer, has filed an appeal seeking to reduce the amount.
"Based on the information we have now, we're denying that he committed any crime," Mr. Wittels said today.
Mr. Savitz is a vice president of the Savitz Organization; his brother Samuel is chief executive officer of the company, which advises employers on retirement and health benefits.
 
Some Details Emerge
 Neither the company nor any member of the Savitz family would comment on the events that have surrounded Mr. Savitz since last week. But some details about his life have begun to emerge in news reports, principally in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Edward Isadore Savitz was born on Feb. 22, 1942, one of four sons, to Paul and Ann Gechman Savitz. The Savitzes were Russian immigrants who opened an amusement arcade in downtown Philadelphia. Mr. Savitz's parents are dead, and one of his brothers, Joseph, a lawyer who once served as a Deputy Attorney General in Pennsylvania, used barbiturates to commit suicide in 1981, according to the death certificate.
Mr. Savitz sailed through Philadelphia public schools. He was ranked first of 278 students in his high school class, and he was voted the most likely to succeed. He won a full scholarship to study economics at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1963.
In the same year he married Judith Widman, whom he had dated since high school and who become a lawyer, specializing in family law. The marriage ended in divorce a decade later. She refused to comment today.
Mr. Savitz enrolled in law school at the University of Pennsylvania but dropped out after two years. Then, in 1967, also after two years' study, he quit Temple University's graduate school of music.
Friends of Mr. Savitz said in interviews today that they are stunned and distraught over the news.
 Stanley Coren, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said he went to school with Mr. Savitz from grammar school through college.
"Eddie was really the wunderkind in school," Professor Coren said. "He was heading to be a successful lawyer or businessman, with a house in a Main Line suburb, a wife and three kids and a BMW in the driveway. End of story."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 7, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Articles on March 28 and last Thursday about a man with AIDS who has told the authorities in Philadelphia that he paid for sex with a number of teen-agers over the last several years misstated the charges against him. The man, Edward I. Savitz, is being held on several charges involving four boys, including sexual abuse, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and promoting prostitution; he has not been charged with statutory rape.

HEADLINE: West Haven Bailout Plan Calls for Hartford to Take the Rudder

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 1

 BODY:
The state began pulling a second Connecticut municipality, West Haven, back from the edge of financial insolvency today. But the $35 million package of loan guarantees approved by the House of Representatives differs sharply from the bailout of Bridgeport, the state's largest city, which filed for Federal bankruptcy protection last year.
State officials said that the far stiffer terms being dealt to West Haven, a mostly blue-collar community of 55,000 on Long Island Sound, are intended specifically to head off another Bridgeport fiasco, where the former Mayor battled the state for control, then took the city into bankruptcy court over vehement state objections. 
 Under the plan, which was approved tonight by the House of Representatives on a vote of 124 to 18, the West Haven Finance Planning and Assistance Board would effectively take over West Haven's government. Taxes could be raised by order of the state panel; labor contracts could be approved or disapproved outside regular channels; an emergency city manager could even be appointed over the head of the mayor. The state has none of those powers in Bridgeport, which it rescued in 1988 with a $60 million loan-guarantee plan.
The numbers also tell the story: Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. can appoint only three members of the 11-member Bridgeport financial review board. In West Haven, six out of seven members of the board would either be state officials or appointees of the Governor.
"Bridgeport has taught us an awful lot," said the State Treasurer, Francisco L. Borges, who would be a member of both boards.
 
The Appearance of a Reward
 But the proposal evoked some ambivalence in the House.
"West Haven should take care of itself," said one lawmaker who opposed the plan, Representative Eugene A. Migliaro Jr., a Republican from Wolcott, who feared the state was setting a bad precedent. "It looks like what we're doing up here is condoning poor spending, poor management," he said.
But both state and local officials agreed that a rescue could not be postponed, regardless of the terms. West Haven has $12.7 million in bonds that mature on April 15, which city officials say cannot be refinanced or paid off without help. Terms for new state-backed bonds would have to be set by Monday if they are to be issued in time, Mr. Borges said.
The city also faces a cumulative $17.3 million shortfall in its $90 million budget, and an aide to Mayor H. Richard Borer, Sandra Lorusso, said today that West Haven only has enough cash to pay its expenses through the end of the month.
"If there's no money, every one of the city's 1,000 employees, including teachers, won't get paid," Ms. Lorusso said.
Mr. Borer, who took office in December, was in New York today to make presentations to the municipal bond rating companies, but his pleas apparently fell flat. Late this afternoon, Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered West Haven's bonds from an already low BBB+ to BB, a "speculative" rating equivalent to junk bond status. Moody's Investors Service quickly followed suit, dropping West Haven's rating from Baa1 to Ba, a rating also below investment grade.
 
Diminished Tax Revenue
 The city's problems did not crop up suddenly. As long as two years ago, West Haven was forced to lay off public school teachers as the recession eroded property tax collections. Mr. Borer has also charged that his predecessor as Mayor, Clemente Evangeliste, aggravated the problem last year by cutting taxes in what Mr. Borer characterized as a failed attempt to win re-election.
Whatever the causes, however, restrictions on Mr. Borer's future actions, as well as West Haven's City Council, are likely to be severe. Although the bill passed by the House tonight must still be approved by the Senate and signed by Mr. Weicker, both the administration and leaders in the legislature have already agreed on the main elements.
One Treasury Department official, Donald A. Kirshbaum, said the state's role in Bridgeport was primarily to review what municipal officials did. In West Haven, he said, there will be "direct power to set the budget."
The Bridgeport panel could only "review and analyze" capital contracts over $250,000 and general fund contracts over $100,000. The West Haven panel will approve or reject any contract of $50,000 or more. The bill also pointedly prohibits a bankruptcy filing without the written consent of the governor. The Bridgeport bailout contained no such language.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, one of the state's largest lobbying groups, has already vehemently attacked the Weicker administration's attempts to impose greater controls on distressed municipalities like West Haven. Just today, the group issued a scathing attack on an administration proposal that would impose far fewer regulations on troubled cities than the West Haven plan. That bill is expected to come up for a committee-level vote as early as Thursday.

HEADLINE: Thorny Issue in Gun Control: Curbing Responsible Owners

SERIES: 200 Million Guns -- Last article of a series.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The gun controls most likely to be adopted in the near future would cause only modest inconvenience for legal gun buyers. But the controls, like the Brady Bill, which mandates a waiting period for handgun purchases, would also mean small gains at best against the murderous violence that is increasingly traumatizing an entire nation.
Even a little progress would be welcome. A 1 percent drop in firearm deaths -- which totalled 35,000 in 1989, including 18,000 suicides, 15,000 homicides, 1,500 accidents and others unspecified -- would mean hundreds of lives saved.
 
Debate Has Just Started
 But real debate about the role of guns in society has scarcely begun. A central issue is this: Should new laws simply aim to do a better job of keeping firearms away from criminals, the main goal of the Brady Bill and most of the thousands of Federal, state and local laws already on the books? 
 Or should they cut more deeply into legal gun ownership, too -- limiting guns in rural hunting regions as well as cities, for example, and preventing frightened people from buying handguns to keep at the bedside? In other words, slashing the number of guns in public hands -- but at a cost of crossing what tens of millions of people believe are their hallowed rights.
 
'Fundamental Questions'
 "I don't think there are easy or cheap gun controls that take us as far down the road, in terms of reducing violence, as a lot of people want to go," said Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley known for his advocacy of handgun restrictions. "There are some fundamental questions waiting for us."
The Brady Bill, which has the public's blessing, has been supported by a majority in Congress but is now caught up in a broader battle over crime legislation. Calling for a waiting period on handgun purchases and a background check to weed out felons and others proscribed from gun ownership, it aims to slow the flow of guns into illegal hands, and from lax states to those with tighter controls. While it should help, huge leaks would remain.
Bans on assault weapons that have recently been adopted or considered in several states may reduce the presence of some of these high-capacity, fast-shooting firearms that have provoked special outrage among the police. If it did nothing else, banning them might be worthwhile as a statement of cultural goals. But these weapons are uncommon, and no one thinks that the drug gangs who favor them will go wanting for firepower.
More sweeping and stringent gun controls remain well out of political reach. That is not just because of the plotting of the gun lobby. Measures like a general ban on the sale of handguns would face the defiant opposition of millions of law-abiding gun owners -- people who want these weapons for target shooting, self-protection or just on principle, and who think that limiting their choices would do nothing to ease the bloodshed on urban streets.
"The Holy Grail of gun control has been to find some way to keep guns out of the hands of the bad guys, yet leave the legitimate firearms-owning population alone," said James D. Wright, a criminologist at Tulane University who thinks that goal is an impossible one.
Alone in the industrial world, the United States has had a firearms "democracy" -- some say free-for-all -- in which nearly any kind of gun is legally available to nearly anyone without a criminal record. Now, with some 200 million firearms in circulation, and at least four million new guns, including two million handguns, added to the supply each year, no one should expect miracles of even the strictest controls.
Dr. Zimring optimistically draws a comparison with automobile injuries, which have been fought with everything from higher safety standards to crackdowns on drunken driving. "There, we've made a whole series of adjustments over time, chipping away at the problem, and deaths are down," he said.
 
How Long a Wait?
Brady Bill Seeks Middle Ground
 Though she is vilified and mistrusted by gun defenders, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., the largest gun-control advocacy group, has tried to occupy a middle ground. "We're not proposing banning weapons, but passing laws that will help the system do what it's already supposed to do," Mrs. Brady said.
The main bill before Congress, which would impose a waiting period of five working days and a background check for handgun purchases, is named after her husband, James S. Brady, who was wounded by a bullet meant for President Ronald Reagan. The goal is to deter felons and gun runners from buying guns, and give hotheads and suicidal people some time to cool off.
At least half the states already have some form of background check or waiting period for handgun purchases. Some cities, including Chicago, New York and Washington, have stringent limits on who may buy or own a handgun. Whether homicide rates would be even higher than they are without those controls is a subject of endless debate. Clearly, though, the restrictions imposed by some places are undercut by the lack of them elsewhere.
Of 19,000 guns seized by law officials in New York City last year, for example, more than nine out of 10 were purchased over the counter in states where sales are easier, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Virgina, Florida, Ohio, Texas and Georgia were the leaders. The sales were usually made to local "straw purchasers," or gun runners with phony local identification.
 
Should States Do More?
 Mrs. Brady is the first to say that the Brady Bill alone cannot choke off the supply of guns to criminals. She says states must do more to check out the identification of buyers -- a problem in Virginia which, despite requiring a quick computer check to see if buyers have criminal records, remains a major source of smuggled guns. The exemption of private gun transfers from the waiting period is a major loophole. And closer regulation of sales will not help prevent gun thefts, which are a major source of illegal guns in much of the country.
The National Rifle Association has said it would support instant, computerized background checks of handgun buyers, something only feasible in some states for now. But it says a waiting period would be useless, and it still hopes to kill the Brady Bill. It rejects proposals to regulate private gun sales and other measures aimed at increasing the accountability of gun owners.
"Instead of asking law-abiding people to change what they are doing, why not keep the people that are committing the crimes in jail?" asks James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist with the N.R.A.
California's experience with a waiting period suggests the possible benefits but also shows how hard it is to evaluate them. Going well beyond what would be required by the Brady Bill, California has a 15-day waiting period for the purchase of any gun, including rifles and shotguns, and it covers private sales as well as those through stores.
Last year, of almost 500,000 requests for gun purchases, the state stopped just under 6,000, including 3,000 involving buyers with assault records and 34 with homicide records. What no one knows, however, is how many of the buyers who were turned down got someone else to buy a gun for them, or turned to the black market. Nor is there a way to know how much violence was prevented.
 
How Strict a Ban?
Some Would Thin Ranks of Owners
 A large minority of shell-shocked Americans are ready to go further, restricting legally owned guns, too, in the hope it will curb violence. In a variety of surveys over the years, close to 40 percent of the public has supported a ban on even possessing handguns, let alone selling them.
Though it would stop short of confiscation, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which represents several national religious and other groups, wants to end new handgun sales. "We believe that anything less than a ban on handgun sales, while maybe helpful, is not going to lead to a meaningful reduction in gun violence," said Jeffrey Y. Muchnick, legislative director of the coalition. He said the desires of gun owners may have to give way: "There will always be people who disagree, but for the greater good of the community we will have to pass a ban against their wishes."
Dr. Zimring prefers the term "restrictive licensing" to "ban," but in any case the idea is to limit handgun sales to those who show a strong need, mainly those in law enforcement. Target shooters could buy guns but would have to keep them locked at shooting ranges. Given up would be recreational "plinking" in the countryside and, in the most controversial effect, the ability of most people to buy handguns for self-protection.
Any such talk makes many gun owners livid. "When millions of firearms owners say 'You can have my gun when you pry it from my dead hand,' they are not kidding," said Andrew Molchan, president of the National Association of Federally Licensed Firearms Dealers, which represents gun shops. Many gun owners claim that the Second Amendment prohibits any gun ban, although courts have repeatedly upheld strong local restrictions.
"I haven't seen a gun proposal in the 13 years that I've been here that had any potential for reducing the homicide rate," said Mr. Baker of the rifle association. "The law-abiding people will obey the law, and the criminals will not."
 
When Scholars Disagree
 In truth, there is serious disagreement among scholars who study guns and violence about how effective even the more sweeping measures might be.
"What I believe in my heart of hearts is that if we ban guns, all the people who want to own one for some nefarious reason will still find a way to get one," Dr. Wright said.
Another skeptic, Gary Kleck, professor of criminology at Florida State University, argues that stringent controls "will have an impact on a relatively slight, marginally involved part of the crime population" -- people who are willing to obey gun laws but who are also willing to commit violent acts.
Dr. Kleck does support background checks for gun purchasers and would extend them to private transfers, for the limited good that that would do. But he also says that restricting selective classes of weapons might backfire. Outlawing small, cheap "Saturday night specials," he says, would not only discriminate against poor people who want to buy guns for protection, but also force criminals to use more accurate, higher-caliber weapons -- and the ultimate death toll from shootings might rise. Likewise, if frightened homeowners are forced to buy rifles or shotguns rather than handguns, which tend to be less lethal, accidents and so-called crimes of passion would be more likely to cause death rather than injury.
 
People 'on the Edge'
 But other experts think that much tighter control over the sale of weapons and especially a reduction in the number of handguns, which are overwhelmingly the kind used in crimes, will surely pay off.
"I'm willing to grant that someone who's determined to have a gun and has the resources will be able to get one under foreseeable regulations," said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy and economics at Duke University who advocates measures to drive up the price of black-market guns. "But I don't think that most robbers, rapists and assailants are that determined or clever or systematic in their affairs. These are people who live on the edge financially, and if the gun is worth $300 instead of $100, they are more likely to need that money for something else."
Making handguns scarcer, in this view, might also curb the alarming increase in the number of urban teen-agers and others who carry weapons for vaguely "defensive" reasons -- resulting in an escalating arms race that allows petty disputes to erupt into deadly gun battles.
In response to those who say there are enough guns already around to supply criminals for centuries, experts like Dr. Zimring point to evidence that guns used in crimes tend to be relatively new, and that guns tend to have a limited life on the streets before being seized or abandoned.
In New York City, for example, about three-fourths of the guns seized by the police were produced within the last five years, said John A. O'Brien of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
If criminal access to new guns were crimped, thefts of firearms from homes and stores would presumably increase, partly offsetting the benefit. Still, to the extent that the black market depends on a steady infusion of newly produced guns, the problem of control seems more manageable.
Just getting the numbers down would help. "If we really had a stream of 400,000 new handguns a year instead of two million, you'd be surprised how much easier it would be to create a system of accountability," Dr. Zimring said.
 
How Much Protection?
Debating Wisdom Of Bedside Guns
 A large share of the boom in handguns in the last 30 years has involved people buying guns for self-protection. This trend continues despite the incantations of gun-control advocates and some police officials, who say that guns bring a false sense of security and are more likely to mean the death of loved ones than protection from crime.
Their argument is seemingly buttressed by studies of firearms deaths in homes, which show that accidents, murders and especially suicides are far more numerous than killings of intruders.
Whatever the facts, tens of millions of people evidently think they are more secure with a firearm in the home, a feeling that must be reckoned with politically. And recently the common wisdom has been challenged by Dr. Kleck and others. Gun accidents, they say, are concentrated among a small, reckless subset of gun owners. Many of the murders and suicides would certainly have occurred whether or not the homeowner kept a gun for protection.
Above all, Dr. Kleck argues, a body count of shot intruders grossly understates the successful defensive uses of guns, which often require merely a threat to shoot. He says there is evidence to suggest that gun-wielding homeowners ward off criminals several hundred thousand times a year.
 
Weighing the Risks
 Other scholars accuse Dr. Kleck of gross exaggeration. Dr. Cook, for example, citing what he calls more reliable data, says the number of defensive uses is far lower. He says the slight chance a gun will prove useful in self-defense must be weighed against risks that will vary according to family circumstances, such as how safely weapons are stored and whether any members are suicide-prone. "A public benefit of having a heavily armed citizenry remains to be demonstrated," he adds.
Dr. Zimring believes that widespread gun ownership causes more problems than it solves. But he pleads urgently for more research on the self-protection issue. "Personal defense is the central question of handgun ownership in American life," he acknowledged. "If it were truly shown that self-defense was a good reason to own a gun, that would strike a death blow to a restrictive policy."
"It would have to be defense not obtainable with lesser means, and for protection of life rather than TV sets. But if we're living in that world, then we couldn't justify the limits I have proposed," he said.

HEADLINE: TANKER THAT TOOK OIL TO HAITI SEIZED

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
United States Customs officials seized a tanker in Puerto Rico on Tuesday after it delivered 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel to Haiti in violation of a United States embargo, an Administration official said today. The tanker, which is registered in Belize, had picked up its cargo in New York.
The officials said criminal and civil penalties could be imposed on the owners of the ship, who have not been identified. Luigi R. Einaudi, American Ambassador to the Organization of American States, told the group on Wednesday, "We have reason to believe citizens of the United States are involved." 
 Administration officials said the ship's manifest listed the cargo as destined for the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The tanker was seized in San Juan harbor.
 
First Move by U.S.
 This was the first enforcement by the United States since the imposition of an embargo after the coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept. 30.
In Congress today, a bipartisan bill was introduced to back efforts to restore democracy in Haiti with $22 million for a civilian mission to be sent to Haiti by the Organization of American States to monitor human rights and the demilitarization of the Government.
In introducing the bill, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, also said he was asking the General Accounting Office to investigate what companies and countries had violated the embargo, which was imposed by the United States on Nov. 5.
The moves came after a decision by the Organization of American States on Wednesday to call on all members to tighten enforcement of the embargo, which was imposed to weaken the military-backed Haitian Administration. The Haitian Army has instead blocked a political agreement between Father Aristide and the Parliament.
With the political situation in Haiti continuing to deteriorate, the Coast Guard reported today that 879 Haitians had been picked up at sea attempting to flee their country since the weekend, the largest number to be intercepted in such a short period since a major exodus took place in January.
The flow apparently surged soon after a judge in Brooklyn ruled in favor of refugee advocates who sought the right to counsel for Haitians still in custody at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba. The Administration says such court orders undercut its policy of barring Haitians without demonstrable fears of persecution and tempt many more Haitians to risk their lives in unseaworthy boats.
 
The Advocates of Counsel
 Since the Sept. 30 coup, 17,546 Haitians have been picked up at sea. More than 6,600 have been allowed to apply for asylum. Of those, 2,864 are still at Guantanamo, plus 190 more who have tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS and may not be brought to the United States for hearings if these can be arranged at the base.
Most other Haitians picked up since the coup were returned by the Coast Guard after the Supreme Court backed the Administration and in effect vacated a series of temporary stays on forced returns. The Haitians rescued this week are on Coast Guard cutters.
Lawyers and human rights groups have argued that without counsel, the Haitians at Guantanamo could be subjected to pressure to change their minds and ask to return to Haiti even though they have passed the first hurdle and have the right to a hearing in the United States.
This week, after the ruling on Friday in New York, a group of volunteer lawyers and students from Yale Law School went to Guantanamo to interview Haitians. On Wednesday, they reported their findings to Judge Sterling Johnson Jr., who issued the order and who has extended it until next week.

HEADLINE: Libyans Riot at Embassies; U.N. Protests

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 2

 BODY:
Libyan demonstrators, protesting the threat of sanctions over the downing of Pan Am flight 103, today attacked the embassies in Tripoli of Council members supporting the embargo. The United Nations Security Council then issued a statement strongly condemning Libya for the rioting.
The protesters set fire to the Embassy of Venezuela, which held the Council presidency last month when the sanctions threat was made. 
 Reports from Tripoli said about 300 students scaled the Venezuelan embassy wall, rampaged through the garden and the chancery, tearing up plants, smashing furniture, scattering files and throwing gasoline bombs, which set parts of the building ablaze. The students arrived in two buses and Libyan guards protecting the Embassy apparently made no attempt to turn them back.
 
'Criminal, Terrorist Act'
 Venezuela's United Nations Representative, Diego Arias, said the rioters "destroyed the Embassy, the vehicles, everything" in what he called "an organized, criminal, terrorist act," though none of the staff was hurt.
In Caracas, the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Humberto Calderon Berti, said he was recalling all diplomatic personnel from Tripoli and has given Libya 48 hours to provide a satisfactory explanation for the attack. Venezuela will decide whether to break diplomatic relations in the light of the explanation it receives, he added.
Libyan mobs tried unsuccessfully to break into the Embassy of Russia, which also supported sanctions, throwing stones through windows and damaging the gates. A spokesman said the rioters "damaged four cars beyond repair."
 
Protests at Other Embassies
 Noisy, violent demonstrations were staged as well outside the Embassies of France, Belgium, Hungary and Austria, four other Council members that voted for sanctions. Outside the Italian Embassy, which represents Britain, another advocate of sanctions, protesters broke windows and painted slogans on walls. There were no casualties in these protests.
The United States closed its Embassy in Libya in 1979 after it was severely damaged by pro-Iranian demonstrators. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since.
While the protests were going on, crowds of women and girls laid garlands of flowers around the Embassies of Morocco and India, two of the five Council members that abstained in the sanctions vote, saying the United Nations should give Libya more time to work out a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
Libya appeared tonight to call on foreign nations to remove their companies and workers from the country as a result of the crisis over sanctions.
An announcer on Tripoli television was quoted as saying this evening, "We say to these countries: Evacuate your citizens and companies urgently and end all interests with us."
It was unclear however, whether this demand was meant to include the several thousand foreign technicians, including many Americans, who are working in Libya's oil industry, the basis of its economy.
Diplomats in Tripoli said the riots were clearly Government-organized, with Libyan policemen directing and encouraging the demonstrators. The Libyan news agency, JANA, asserted that dozens of demonstrators were hospitalized after clashes with riot police and reported that the country's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had appealed to the people for restraint.
 
Security Council Vote
 The riots came after the Security Council vote on Tuesday to cut all air links with Libya on April 15, impose an arms embargo and downgrade its foreign embassies unless Colonel Qaddafi hands over two Libyans accused by Britain and the United States of blowing up an American airliner in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and sends four other Libyans for examination by a French magistrate investigating the destruction of a French airliner over West Africa the next year. A total of 440 people died in the two bombings.
The Security Council reacted angrily to the embassy riots and attacks. After a daylong flurry of consultations, the President issued a statement strongly condemning the attack on the Venezuelan Embassy and the other attacks, demanding compensation for damage caused and telling Libya to assure the safety of all diplomatic personnel stationed there.
The statement also took direct issue with Libya's United Nations representative, Ali Ahmed el-Houderi, who this morning apologized for the attack to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the Venezuelan delegate, Mr. Arias, telling them the attacks were not directed against specific countries but at the Security Council's sanctions threat in general.
The Council said the fact that these "intolerable and extremely grave threats" were a reaction to a Security Council resolution only "underlines the seriousness of the situation" and is "totally unacceptable."
"Libya has succeed in uniting the Council in outrage," Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said referring to the fact that China and four other developing countries abstained in the sanctions vote, while today's statement denouncing the attacks was unanimous.
In addition to handing over the accused Libyans for trial or interrogation by April 15, the Security Council has also asked Libya for "concrete actions" to demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism.
This has lead to speculation Council members will demand a full accounting of Libya's involvement with terrorism, including details about terrorists it has trained or supplied with money and arms.
 
Visit by U.N. Envoy
 Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has already decided to send Vladimir Petrovsky, a senior United Nations official, to Tripoli this weekend to explain the Security Council's action to Colonel Qaddafi in person and seek his compliance.
Arab countries have generally opposed the Council's sanctions threat, warning that it will create tension and instability in their area of the world, encouraging Islamic militants to step up their anti-Western campaign.
Nevertheless, the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, said today that his country will honor the sanctions if they are imposed.
But the sanctions threat has already led to a strengthening of the Persian Gulf war alliance between Egypt and Syria and galvanized the Arab League into action at a time when most observers thought it had been incapacitated by the split in the Arab world over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr. Mubarak came down firmly against Libyan sanctions at a joint news conference in Cairo on March 18. And four days later the Arab League endorsed their stand.

HEADLINE: Specific Pledges for Money Are Absent in Russia Plan

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The United States and Germany went ahead and announced an extensive aid program for Russia without obtaining specific pledges from the seven countries involved in much of the $11 billion direct-aid part of the package, American and European officials said today.
Many of the countries jostled today to take credit for the aid. But apart from the United States, none could say how much each was donating, and one accounting suggested that about $4 billion was in the form of only a vague promise to provide the aid "if it is needed." 
 The $24 billion figure used by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Wednesday sprang from a hurried exercise in political and financial expediency. It is not clear how much Mr. Bush's involvement was driven by Gov. Bill Clinton's plans to speak on the same subject on Wednesday, although Mr. Bush juggled his schedule to make the announcement in the morning, minutes before the Democratic Presidential candidate spoke in New York.
 
Gain but No Pain
 What is clear is that the aim was to allow Mr. Bush and leaders of the other countries to claim some gain and show that the industrial giants were seizing the moment to spur democracy in Russia -- without asking their taxpayers to spend any more cash in tough political and economic times at home.
Despite those political calculations, the proposal became ensnared in American politics today. House Democratic leaders indicated that they might link approval for any new money for Russia to White House support for a permanent extension of unemployment benefits and Mr. Bush's Republican rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, broke an informal political cease-fire to denounce the aid package.
But three former presidents, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon, lent Mr. Bush their backing in a letter to the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, that urged passage of the $12 billion increase that Mr. Bush is seeking in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund as part of the aid program.
According to figures issued by the United States Government, many of them contradictory, and interviews with American and European officials, here is where the $24 billion figure came from:
The Group of Seven nations agreed among themselves to create a $6 billion fund to maintain the value of the ruble while it is being turned into a convertible currency. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, settled on an estimate that Russia would need $18 billion in aid this year.
 
Deferring Loan Payments
 So the industrial nations needed to produce $24 billion in aid. They agreed that the I.M.F. and other lending institutions would lend Russia $4.5 billion. Those countries that lent money to the Soviet Union before Jan. 1, 1991, which does not include the United States, would defer $2.5 billion in payments.
That is where the clarity ends. What was left was $11 billion, which none of the countries could politically or economically produce as new outlays of cash. So the Treasury Department added up all existing aid programs from the Group of Seven and projections of further likely assistance, and came up with $11 billion.
American and European officials stressed that these were real programs that help the Soviet economy, but they could not produce anything like a complete accounting of where it was coming from. Even American Government agencies could not agree among themselves about their contribution, mostly in credits for Russia to buy American products. The Treasury Department said it was $2 billion; the State Department said it was $2.6 billion.
 
Hedging a Commitment
 Germany appears to be listing $3 billion in export credits, Canada some part of $1.5 billion in export credits announced last year and Japan an unspecified part of $2.5 billion in credits announced last year. Britain's share is about $700 million. Contributions from Italy and France were unknown.
Two European diplomats said that actual totals amounted to $7 billion and that the Group of Seven had agreed in principle to provide the $4 billion more later, if it is needed -- and the group is hopeful that it will not be.
Although at least one of the countries involved, Japan, seemed irked at the way the aid package was unveiled in Bonn and in Washington on Wednesday, virtually everyone got something.
Mr. Bush was able to make a grand gesture of executive authority at an important time in his Presidency, when he is struggling to seize control of the 1992 election campaign and to demonstrate that he is still the senior partner in the Western coalition.
 
An Opportunity for Bush
 In return, he ended months of hesitancy over aid to Russia and promised to ask Congress for a major increase in the American donation to the I.M.F., for which Britain and Germany had long been clamoring.
Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who had been representing Russia before the I.M.F., announced today that he had "taken the lead" in putting together the aid program.
Mr. Kohl was able to present the package as an example of Germany's leadership by using his time-zone advantage to make the announcement before Mr. Bush. And the German Government, which has given far more cash to the former Soviet Union than any other country, did not have to give any more.
Neither did the other countries. But Mr. Bush did ask Congress to increase the I.M.F. contribution.

HEADLINE: Quayle Says Rules Review Saving U.S. $10 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Pressing what has become a chief domestic theme in the election year, the Bush Administration said today that its 90-day review of Federal regulations would produce savings of $10 billion to $20 billion a year.
The White House is now seeking ways to subject permanently to Administration review the thousands of regulations Congress mandates for everything from chemical exposure in the workplace to meat labeling. 
 "This is only the beginning," said Vice President Dan Quayle, who heads President Bush's Council on Competitiveness. "We are the ones who are going to run this operation -- and it's not going to be the Congress."
Briefing reporters in his office, Mr. Quayle said that with about 50 initiatives already announced by the Administration for reducing the cost of regulations, which he estimated at $400 billion a year, the focus had shifted to finding a way to "institutionalize" the review process.
In announcing in his State of the Union Message, President Bush announced a 90-day review of regulations and a moratorium on implementing some new rules.
In addition to confronting Congress, the Vice President's comments were seen as part of an election-year strategy that relies heavily on prompt recovery from the nation's longest postwar recession.
 
More Measures Announced
 "A sluggish economy doesn't need overregulation," Mr. Quayle declared. "A sluggish economy needs less regulation."
Responding to a question about the President's endorsement of various pieces of legislation requiring a host of new rules, Mr. Quayle said the Bush Administration was "probably a little bit lax" about trying to review new regulations during its first 18 months, assuming that the regulatory "beast" had been killed by the Reagan Administration.
At the same time, Government officials announced today another flurry of measures related to the review process. Included in a package identified as reforms in financial services was final adoption of a rule allowing federally chartered thrift institutions to open branches in any state or territory.
The rule was immediately denounced by the Independent Bankers Association of America, which said the Administration had pre-empted state and Congressional authority and that its action could result in the loss of thousands of jobs.
Also announced was the adoption of uniform antitrust enforcement policy by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which share responsibility for approving corporate mergers and acquisitions. The White House said the new policy would give business "greater certainty" about applicable standards.
 
Breakdown on Savings
 Aides to the Vice President, with some apparent reluctance, provided a breakdown on how the administration had calculated its estimate of $10 billion to $20 billion in savings.
The biggest part, $2.4 billion a year, would come from a Presidential order implementing a court decision that union members are not obliged to pay dues for union expenses for things other than collective bargaining.
The estimate also included $1 billion to $3 billion by adding a rule that encourages the use of more natural gas, which would mean cleaner air and cheaper energy, more than $1 billion from the accelerated approval of new drugs, and as much as $8.3 billion in rules enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, including those covering toxic waste cleanup and air pollution.
Overall, Mr. Quayle promised a regulatory policy based on the initial presumption that any new rule is unnecessary. "They ain't seen nothing yet," the Vice President said.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Lifts a Ministerial Load Off an Economist's Shoulders

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 2

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin freed his chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, of his duties as Minister of Finance today, but Mr. Gaidar will remain Deputy Prime Minister charged with overall economic strategy.
Mr. Gaidar and his aides said he had requested the change because Finance Ministry routine was taking too much of his time. He was succeeded as minister by Vasily V. Barchuk, 51 years old, a career official who had been First Deputy Minister of Finance. 
 "Gaidar can now focus his attention on strategic reforms and on coordinating the economic work of the Government," said Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, a senior aide to Mr. Gaidar. The reforms are crucial to a multi-billion-dollar package of foreign aid announced on Wednesday.
The unexpected announcement added to the suspense before next week's session of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies and roused some speculation that Mr. Yeltsin might have wanted to give the impression that he was curbing Mr. Gaidar's reach. But Mr. Ulyukayev said Mr. Gaidar remained in overall command of the Finance Ministry.
 
Happy Russians
 Commenting on President Bush's proposed measures to support the economic reforms in Russia, Mr. Ulyukayev said, "It took rather long for the United States Administration to take these decisions, but now we can only welcome them."
The United States Ambassador, Robert S. Strauss, who had been a leading advocate of large-scale aid to the republics, said he had spoken to senior Russian officials "and they are all extremely pleased.
"They are pleased with the package, they are pleased with the Bush-Baker energy that was devoted to it, pleased to learn that it is getting bipartisan support," he said.
"There is concern, a serious concern, that the International Monetary Fund will force some disciplines that will be too harsh for the public taste, and I have spent some time explaining that the I.M.F. may not be the most loved organization in the world, but they are respected for understanding the kind of problems, better than any other institution, that they face out here."
The I.M.F. has called for stringent economic reforms, including letting oil prices rise to free-market levels, as conditions for its assistance.
Whatever its longer-term impact, the announcement of the economic package is certain to benefit Mr. Yeltsin when the Congress, Russia's elected legislature, convenes on Monday.
By all accounts, Mr. Yeltsin's economic program and his style of rule will come under considerable criticism. Already Ruslan Khasbulatov, the ambitious chairman of the Congress, has circulated what amounts to an alternative reform program and has staked out areas of attack.
 
Political Russians
 But Mr. Khasbulatov has denied that he will attack Mr. Yeltsin himself or try to vote out his Government. His main goal is generally viewed as an attempt to assert the powers of the legislature -- and his own powers -- against those of the President and the Government.
The soaring prices and the economic shock that will accompany the end of oil-price controls this spring are the main weapons of the critics. Part of Mr. Yeltsin's problem with the Congress is that the legislature, elected two years ago, is still heavily laced with members of the old nomenklatura, who are instinctively opposed to the reforms under way.
From the other flank, Mr. Yeltsin has to contend with radical members who accuse him of dragging his feet on privatization and of exercising an authoritarian style. Mr. Yeltsin is expected to concentrate on privatization in his opening address on Monday.
Washington's timing in announcing the proposed aid was generally accepted as an attempt to dull the critics' attacks and to make further sacrifices more palatable. The I.M.F. specifically praised Russia's reforms earlier this week when it opened the way to Russian membership.

The Economy
Opening a new front in the drive to reduce smog, a coalition of New York, New Jersey and the New England states announced an agreement to impose extensive controls on electric generating stations to cut the emission of nitrogen oxides. The states' action was spurred in part by the Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which call for controls but give few details. [Page A1.] 
 The S.&L. bailout began grinding to a halt after a House vote against continued Federal spending on the industry cleanup. Federally insured deposits are not threatened, and Congress is certain to approve further spending eventually. [D1.]
Orders to U.S. factories rose 0.5 percent in February, the second straight small gain. But first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose for the second week, climbing by 9,000, to 456,000, providing further evidence of a weak recovery. [D1.]
A bill to regulate the cable TV industry bogged down on objections from both Democrats and Republicans, making it likely that the measure will be greatly weakened to pass the House. [D5.]
The Administration said its review of Federal regulations would produce savings of $10 billion to $20 billion a year. [A15.]
 
Companies
A run developed at Metro North State Bank in Kansas City, Mo., spurred in part by depositor fears that bank insurance can no longer be completely trusted. The bank's chairman blamed an "unsubstantiated rumor" that regulators were on the verge of closing the bank. [D1.]
Some victims of stroke and head injury are cared for at home by a private company, Neurocare, of Concord, Calif., which sends a team of therapists to patients' homes daily. The cost, at $5,000 a month, is a fraction of traditional residential programs. [D1.]
A historic changing of the guard at Big Steel -- that is what many say about Thomas J. Usher, president of USX's steel operations, who actually seems to listen to what union leaders have on their minds. [D1.]
Immunex said it was suing Hoechst, with which it developed a drug used in bone marrow transplants, contending that Hoechst provided the drug free to Immunex customers and others. [D3.]
 
International
Olympia & York put off for a week a meeting at which it had promised to open its books to 100 creditor banks to renegotiate its debt. The session, originally scheduled for Monday, will be held on April 13, the company said. [D3.]
 
Markets
Stock prices fell, partly because of computer-driven sell programs, as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the report on March employment. The Dow fell 15.21, to 3,234.12. [D6.]
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading. [D12.]
The dollar fell against most currencies in response to the increase in unemployment benefits claims. [D13.]
Orange juice futures prices sagged after a Government report said Brazil had a much larger share of the newly liberalized Japanese orange juice market than the U.S. had. [D13.]

For stock mutual funds, the first quarter was a perplexing combination. The money poured in from investors, but the profits from investing all that money were decidedly mixed. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D1.]

HEADLINE: House Democrats Push for Permanent Jobless Pay

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders today demanded a permanent expansion of unemployment benefits and other relief measures, and they pressed President Bush to go along by linking them to proposals to aid Russia's depressed economy.
The steps, proposed by Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the third-ranking House Democrat, and indirectly supported by the majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, are intended to entangle Russian aid and unemployment in election-year politics. 
 They are also intended to renew confidence among Democratic members who are disgruntled about the way in which House leaders have been dealing with the House bank scandal and in confronting the White House.
Mr. Bonior's effort to link foreign aid to domestic policy is part of an emerging Democratic campaign line promising to meet the needs of Americans before the needs of foreign Governments. It is also intended to underscore the impression that Mr. Bush loses his leadership compass when he returns home from his travels abroad.
 
Jobs Bill in Works
 He said the Democratic leadership is working hard to draft a sweeping jobs bill, which he hopes to have introduced in the next few weeks. He gave no details, but Democratic aides suggested legislation would be introduced to expand public works programs significantly.
Mr. Bonior also announced the Democratic leadership's support for a bill introduced Wednesday by Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, to change the extended unemployment benefits program permanently by expanding eligibility and bolstering the financing of unemployment insurance. Mr. Bonior said Democrats would push to extend unemployment benefits to the 60 percent of the unemployed he contended receive no benefits at all because they have been unemployed for so long or because they have part-time jobs.
Currently, about every three months Congress extends benefits for 13 or 20 more weeks, depending on the unemployment rates of individual states. In early February, Mr. Bush signed an extension of benefits valued at $2.7 billion for two million jobless people after Democratic leaders agreed not to press for a longer extension. Last year he killed similar measures on two separate occasions, arguing that he did not want to increase the deficit.
Emergency benefits averaging $170 a week are given to people who have lost their jobs, cannot find work and have exhausted their 26 weeks of state-financed benefits.
 
Relaxing Eligibility
 Under Mr. Downey's proposal, Federal benefits would be extended, and effective Oct. 1, 1993, they would be permanently expanded by lowering the eligibility standards by which states qualify for Federal unemployment benefits and restricting the rights of states to disqualify applicants for benefits.
Currently, most states qualify for 13 weeks of benefits when the rate of unemployment for the recently employed reaches 5 percent, and is 20 percent higher than for the same period during the previous two years. Under Mr. Downey's program, the qualifications for benefits would be expanded considerably. States would qualify for the same 13 weeks once their overall unemployment rate reached 6 percent and 10 percent higher than the same period in the first or second preceding year.
The proposal would also reduce the Federal unemployment tax rate by more than half for most employees, but it would make up the revenue by reducing itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers by 2 percent for every $2,500 their income exceeded $100,000 for a single person and $150,000 for married couples.
Judy Smith, a White House spokeswoman, strongly suggested that Mr. Bush would veto a permanent extension of benefits, saying, "as a general matter we would not support a bill that would bust the budget or raise taxes."
 
Americans' Foreign Stake
 But she contended, "The American people have a major stake in the success in the developing democracy of the states of the former Soviet Union."
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Bonior's statement linking the expanded unemployment benefits to aid to Russia represented a trial balloon, or a preliminary announcement by the House leadership.
An aide to Mr. Gephardt said Mr. Bonior was speaking for himself. But the Missouri Democrat later issued a statement implicitly supporting the Bonior position.
"The President must understand the linkage between this country's economic well-being and the success of his foreign policy," Mr. Gephardt said. "Not only must he convince the public that his aid package to the former Soviet Union is in our deep self-interest but he must also assure them he is equally committed to creating jobs and helping the unemployed here at home."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 15.21, to 3,234.12, Ahead of Job Data

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Computer-driven sell programs contributed to a drop in stock prices yesterday, as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Government's report today on March employment figures.
Many on Wall Street are anxiously awaiting the employment report, which is the first official indication of how the economy did last month. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.21 points to close at 3,234.12. After moving in a narrow range for most the the session, the Dow tumbled more than 35 points in the afternoon, but recovered 15 points before the close of trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 185.4 million shares, compared with 186.4 million on Wednesday. Losing issues outpaced gainers 1,109 to 605.
Analysts said that futures-related programmed trading guided the market in recent sessions and that its impact was magnified yesterday as many traders took a wait-and-see attitude about the economy.
They said the market's underlying sentiment remained suspicious about the strength of an economic recovery and concerned about the sharp fall in the Japanese stock market.
"There is a deepening concern in world financial markets that there is a financial crisis brewing in Japan," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues has been plunging all week.
As for the American economy, some analysts said the latest survey of purchasing managers indicated that the employment report would be weaker than expected. A consensus of economic forecasts predicted that non-farm payrolls would show an increase of 45,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 7.3 percent.
"Concern is that the economy is sputtering and we will not get strong enough earnings to validate current prices," Mr. Johnson said.
Analysts said that while the Dow would continue to find support near the 3,200 level, breadth and volume data sketched a gloomy outlook.
"We are beginning to see 40 or more new lows" in a single session, said Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company. "This is the first time we have had that in a long time."
 
Other Indexes Drop
 In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.73 points, to 400.50. The American Stock Exchange index dropped 2.67 points, to 390.48. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks was off 8.27 points, or 1.37 percent, to 593.82.
Among active over-the-counter issues, Immunex plunged 10 1/2, to 31 1/2, after the company said first-quarter sales of its drug Leukine were below expectations because of a giveaway program by Hoechst A.G. Immunex is suing Hoechst, which was its partner in developing the drug.
Other biotechnology companies were also hurt. Amgen fell 2 3/4, to 59 1/2, and Genzyme, lost 2 3/4, to 40 1/4.
The Price Company plummeted 10 3/4, to 35, after the wholesale merchandiser reported disappointing earnings.
CMS Energy topped the most active list on the Big Board, dropping 6, to 15 3/4, after Michigan regulators denied the utility's rate request.
Transco Energy was off 2 1/4, to 9 7/8. It said in a filing it could face a liquidity problem by late summer unless it completed a restructuring.
Polaroid dropped 2 1/2, to 25 5/8. The company said its first-quarter sales would be lower than expected.
Citicorp fell 1/4, to 15 3/4, after its Citibank unit said it had settled litigation against BankAmerica. Meanwhile, BankAmerica lost 1 1/8, to 42.
Paine Webber Group, another financial company, lost 3 3/8, to 20.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index was off 1.91 points, to 221.51. And the Wilshire Associates Equity Index was down 36.115 points, to 3,926.541.

A.T.& T. Video Phone Chip

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., April 2

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company introduced new computer chip technology today that will allow people in different cities to see and talk to each other over their personal computers.
The low-priced PC innovation could break a critical cost barrier that analysts say has prevented the video-conferencing business from breaking into the lucrative mass market. 
 The telecommunications company said its new three-chip video coder-decoder, called the AVP-100, could process video signals and sound simultaneously for interactive transmission.
Samples will be available in the fourth quarter, with full production beginning by mid-1993.
A.T.& T. said it would sell the chips in its own products and make them available to other manufacturers. Its computer subsidiary, the NCR Corporation, will also build PC's and automated teller machines with video equipment.
The AVP-100 will allow PC users with digital phone service to communicate by sight and sound for less than $400 in additional equipment costs. Video-conferencing equipment today generally costs $30,000 and up and usually requires a special room.
Steven Sazegari, an analyst for Dataquest Inc., predicted the market would grow rapidly over the next decade. "I think the others will follow," he said.
Analysts noted that Compression Labs Inc. and the Integrated Information Technology Company hope to introduce a personal video system. A similar venture is under way between the Picturetel Corporation in Peabody, Mass., and the Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif.
While A.T.& T. did not project what the actual product would cost once built into a PC, analysts expect it to be less than that of existing equipment.
Analysts also said the announcement marked A.T.& T.'s sixth attempt at a video communications product since 1964. None of them have done well in the market.

HEADLINE: Argentine Sees Falklands' Return But Pledges, 'Never Again War'

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 2

 BODY:
Marking the 10th anniversary of Argentina's ill-fated invasion of the Falkland Islands, President Carlos Saul Menem predicted today that his country would recover the archipelago in the South Atlantic "before the year 2000."
But he added that Argentina would gain sovereignty over the islands, which the Argentines call the Malvinas, "by diplomatic channels and methods." 
 "Never again war," President Menem said after leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Lujan, 40 miles north of Buenos Aires. "We lost a lot more than what we had gained through dialogue, which now, with an open and strong diplomacy, we are recovering."
On April 2, 1982, Argentina's military leader, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, sent troops into the windy islands some 300 miles east of the southern tip of Argentina and captured the tiny British garrison. Troops then hoisted the Argentine flag over Government House.
 
Underestimating the Reaction
 Though Argentina and Britain had tried for months to negotiate a settlement to the dispute over the islands, which Argentina has claimed for more than 150 years, each side deeply underestimated the other's reaction.
In response to the invasion, Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister at the time, sent thousands of troops 8,000 miles to recapture the islands. Seventy-four days after the invasion, Argentina surrendered. In all, 649 Argentines and 285 Britons died.
"From a strategic point of view, it was a bad decision," President Menem said of the decision to invade.
For Argentines, the marking of this anniversary carries both high emotion and deep ambivalence. Graffiti on walls in downtown Buenos Aires say, "Malvinas, we will return," and street signs erected by the Government proclaim, "The Malvinas are Argentine."
But for the country as a whole, the war was both a deep embarrassment and a huge economic setback, with some here calculating that it cost almost half a billion dollars. For many Argentines, it is a war that should never have been fought.
It also marked the end of the military junta that had ruled Argentina since the mid-1970's. Soon after the surrender, the Government of General Galtieri resigned in disgrace.
 
U.S. Ties Strained
 Argentine relations with the United States were also strained when the Reagan Adminstration decided to support the British war effort.
Mr. Menem restored diplomatic relations with Britain early in 1990. Under an agreement, issues like fishing limits and military flight paths have been worked out, and there have been numerous exchanges of diplomats between the two countries. But Britain has refused to talk about sovereignty.
The Falkland issue is certain to continue. For its part, Britain has made sure it will not be surprised by an attack again. Since the war it has invested as much as $6 billion in building a highly sophisticated air base that can defend the islands.

HEADLINE: As a Caesar Goes, So Goes His Family

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
The conviction yesterday of John Gotti, a Mafia Caesar, virtually assures the decline of the Gambino family as the nation's pre-eminent organized-crime family.
It is also another sign that Mafia families across the nation are on the run, battered by aggressive prosecutors, betrayals and internal strife. "This could be the death knell to organized crime as we know it in the United States," asserted James M. Fox, the assistant director of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 The Gambino family's empire once extended over New York City's waterfront and the construction, garment and air-freight industries as well as gambling and loan-sharking rackets and it has had a strong presence in New Jersey, Connecticut and southern Florida.
But recent convictions of top Gambino leaders are believed to have significantly weakened the family, even during the five turbulent years that Mr. Gotti ruled it with an arrogant iron fist that was said to engender hostility within the gang and hatred from other organized-crime leaders.
Through court-authorized wiretaps and electronic bugs, law-enforcement authorities say they have frequently heard Mafia members rail against Mr. Gotti for his attempts to encroach on their rackets.
 
An Unwritten Code
 The Mafia's unwritten code calls for a boss to keep his titular rank even in prison. But organized-crime experts believe that Mr. Gotti may try to anoint his son, John Jr., as the new boss. That power play could lead to bloody battles among Gambino factions.
"John Jr. is not well liked or respected by the older guys," said Jules J. Bonavolonta, the former head of the F.B.I.'s organized-crime section in New York.
The husky 28-year-old John Jr. is a physical carbon copy of his father. In 1990, his father promoted him to the rank of capo, or captain, over the heads of many older family members.
Mr. Gotti may have a hard time naming a successor or running the family from prison. His authority had ebbed in the 15 months he has been in jail. Experts say rivals in the family blamed him for their problems, believing that his swashbuckling life style attracted too much attention to the Mafia. At the trial, tapes in which Mr. Gotti was heard belittling other Mafia members further antagonized underworld confederates.
During his imprisonment, Mr. Gotti appointed a 73-year-old capo, James Failla, to be the acting boss. Exactly what power he will retain is unclear.
 
Deadly Internal Wars
 Prosecutions and deadly internal wars in the last decade have virtually eliminated the Bonanno, Colombo and Lucchese families as potent organized-crime battalions in New York.
But for the Genovese family, Mr. Gotti's conviction should be welcome news. The Genovese and Gambino families have been fierce rivals since Mr. Gotti became boss of the Gambino family in December 1985. Many of the Genovese top leaders have avoided indictments and they are in position to become the area's most dominant Mafia group.
The strength of the Gambino family rests with about 400 "made" or inducted members and more than 1,000 associates or people who actively assist the family.
The Genovese family's rackets include interests in the construction and garbage removal industries in New York and New Jersey. It has about 300 members and 1,000 associates. The other families, riddled by convictions and defections of top members, have been reduced to about 100 members each.
 
A Grim Horizon
 For Mr. Gotti's remaining loyalists the horizon is grim. Salvatore Gravano, Mr. Gotti's underboss and right-hand man, defected to become the Government's critical witness at the trial of Mr. Gotti and his co-defendant, Frank Locascio, the family's consiglieri, or counselor.
Federal and state law-enforcement officials say they expect that Mr. Gravano will provide additional evidence that will lead to prosecutions of other Gambino members and inroads into the family's remaining rackets.
After flourishing for 50 years, virtually untroubled by Federal or local authorities, the nation's Mafia families in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston, Providence, Kansas City, Cleveland, Detroit and Los Angeles have been largely eliminated by prosecutions in the last decade. But law-enforcement authorities doubt that New York's Mafia families can be eradicated or prevented from engaging in illegal gambling and loan sharking. The New York metropolitan region, with its five large families, and Chicago, where the Mafia is called the Outfit, have been the hardest targets to knock out for the F.B.I. and prosecutors.
In the last decade the Goverment's strategy has been been to seek to eliminate the top echelons of each family and to dismantle the economic foundations of the gangs through civil lawsuits against the mobsters and their corrupt allies in labor unions. The object, the authorities say, is to turn back the clock 70 or 8o years to when the Mafia consisted of unsophisticated street gangs with little political influence or power.
Many officials say Mr. Gotti, through inept leadership and self-incriminating boasts on secret tapes, accelerated his own family's demise.
"In retrospect, his leadership was marked by profound failures," said Ronald Goldstock, the director of the state's Organized Crime Task Force. "His high points were the earlier acquittals and fireworks in Ozone Park on the Fourth of July."

HEADLINE: Lard Havers, 69, Former British Attorney General

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 2

 BODY:
Lord Havers, who as a prosecutor and Attorney General was involved in some of Britain's most controversial trials of the last 20 years, died on Wednesday in London. He was 69 years old.
Lord Havers retired from Government service in 1987 because of ill health after serving only four months as Lord Chancellor, the highest-ranking legal office in England and Wales. As such, he had presided over the House of Lords. 
 He served as Attorney General of Britain for eight years after being named to the post in 1979 by the newly elected Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. When Mrs. Thatcher appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1987, he was made a baron.
His son Nigel, a British television and film actor, said his father had been working at his private office in London on Wednesday when he became ill. He died later at a hospital. Lord Havers had undergone coronary bypass surgery in 1985 and again in 1987.
Upon hearing of Lord Havers' death, Prime Minister John Major described him as a "a very great law officer."
Robert Michael Oldfield Havers was born on March 10, 1923, the second son of Sir Cecil Havers, a barrister, and Enid Snelling. He attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and served as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In 1949 he married Carol Elizabeth Lay.
He became a member of the bar in 1948 and a Queen's Counsel in 1964. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1970, representing Wimbledon, and retained the seat for 17 years, until he was made a Baron.
In 1972, he was named Solicitor General by Prime Minister Edward Heath and received a knighthood.
As Solicitor General and later as Attorney General, Sir Michael Havers prosecuted two of the most famous bombing cases involving the Irish Republican Army. Appeals courts later ruled that defendants in both cases had been wrongfully convicted, in one case for the prosecution's withholding of evidence, and the defendants were released from prison.
The debate over the two cases cast a cloud over a career in which Lord Havers had been celebrated for his skill as a prosecutor.
Sir Michael was the prosecutor at the 1981 Old Bailey trial of Peter Sutcliffe, the serial killer of 13 women who was known as the Yorkshire Ripper. In 1982, in one of his most spectacular courtroom successes, Sir Michael got Hugh Hambledon, a Canadian economist, to confess under cross-examination that he had passed NATO secrets to the Soviet Union.
It was also Sir Michael who decided in 1986 to prosecute Peter Wright, a former British counterespionage agent, on charges of violating the Official Secrets Act by writing a book about his experiences. The book, "Spycatcher," became a best-seller in the United States and Sir Michael's attempts to block its publication in Britain and Australia ultimately failed to the embarrassment of Mrs. Thatcher's Government.
He was also a co-author of several books, including "The Poisoned Life of Mrs. Maybrick," "The Royal Baccarat Scandal" (which was adapted into a play) and "Tragedy in Three Voices."
In 1981, the I.R.A. bombed his home in Wimbledon. Sir Michael and his family were on vacation in Spain at the time and press reports later said he informed his wife of the incident by saying, "Darling, we seem to have had a slight accident at home."
Lord Havers is survived his wife, Lady Carol, and his sons, Nigel and Philip.

The Horror of 2-28: Taiwan Rips Open the Past

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 30

 BODY:
A jeep pulled up in front of Lin Mao-sheng's house at 11 A.M. one March day and two plainclothes officers summoned him for a meeting with the provincial Governor.
Mr. Lin, the dean of National Taiwan University and the first Taiwanese to earn an American Ph.D., was never seen by his family after that day in 1947. He was one of thousands killed in a massacre that has haunted Taiwan ever since, but that almost no one dared mention in public until a few years ago . 
 Now, as Taiwan gallops toward democracy, the taboo has been lifted. The Government is planning a memorial to honor the victims, and a month ago it published an officially backed report that suggested that 18,000 to 28,000 people may have died in the massacre.
What is almost as astonishing as the cruelty of the massacre itself is that the Government should acknowledge it. The Nationalist Government responsible for the killings is still in power, and for decades it was likely to imprison anyone who raised the issue.
 
An Enormous Departure
 For thousands of years, the writing of history in Chinese societies has usually been a process of molding events to serve a political purpose, with each new emperor commissioning scholars as "spin doctors" to cast the previous reign in just the right light. So it is an enormous departure for the Government to own up to such brutality.
"In 5,000 years of writing history, this is the first time that the Government hasn't interfered in the process," said Marvin C. H. Ho, the president of the Taipei Language Institute and a member of the commission that issued the report.
Lin Tsung-yi, the 71-year-old son of Lin Mao-sheng, the university dean who was executed, complains that the report covers only the immediate aftermath of the uprising in 1947 and neglects the "pure terrorization" of Taiwanese for decades afterward. But he commends the Government for having "the guts to produce a report with fairly objective data."
The massacre is known as 2-28, because the date of the first substantial killing was Feb. 28, 1947. It all started when officials in the Nationalist Government pistol-whipped a 40-year-old widow who was selling contraband cigarettes on the street. An indignant crowd pressed around and an inspector fired, killing one person.
Rioting began almost immediately, directed against the Nationalist Chinese officials from mainland China who had taken control of Taiwan two years earlier. Taiwan had been occupied by Japan from 1895 to 1945, and the newly arrived mainland Chinese were resented for their corruption and economic mismanagement.
 
Uprising Is Crushed
 The protesters gained control of most of the island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, but army reinforcements arrived from the mainland and crushed the uprising. This account is included in a scholarly book about 2-28 published last year:
"As the Nationalist troops came ashore, they moved out quickly through Keelung streets, shooting and bayoneting men and boys, raping women and looting homes and shops. Some Formosans were seized and stuffed alive into burlap bags found piled up at the sugar warehouse and were then simply tossed into the harbor."
President Lee Teng-hui, a native Taiwanese who was reportedly almost shot during 2-28, announced soon after he took power in 1988 that the Government was prepared to reconsider its approach to 2-28. The centerpiece of the new policy is the new Government-financed report.
"It's very difficult to write such a history," said Lai Tse-han, a history professor who was in charge of drafting the report. "At the beginning, it was very difficult to interview the victims' families. They were very suspicious of anything to do with the Government."
The report helped ease the suspicions, partly because it stated that some of the indirect responsibility for the killings lay with Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, who was then based on the mainland. After losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, Chiang fled with his troops to Taiwan. Today about 15 percent of Taiwan's population consists of mainland Chinese or their descendants.
 
No Government Interference
 Some Taiwanese wanted more direct criticism of Chiang and of his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was President of Taiwan until his death in 1988. But Professor Lai said there was no hard evidence that either of the Chiangs played a direct role in planning the massacre.
Professor Lai, a tweedy scholar with owlish spectacles, said Government officials never interfered with the commission's work. The military and civilian authorities provided secret archives, but Professor Lai suspects that a few things may have been held back, and he was never able to get his hands on a 1947 diary of Chiang Ching-kuo to help assay his role.
Another contentious feature of the report was the estimate that 18,000 to 28,000 people may have been killed. Mr. Ho said he and the majority of commission members did not subscribe to so high a range.
While the Government is now planning a memorial for the victims, and probably an apology and compensation as well, it is not clear whether the gestures will heal the wounds or reopen them. Some Taiwanese believe that tugging on the string of history might unravel the entire historical underpinning of the Government, as happened in the Soviet Union.
Thousands of people were imprisoned and executed for political reasons in the 1950's. At that time, unlike 2-28, Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo were in Taiwan and unmistakably bear direct responsbility. If the authorities acknowledge that the two Chiangs were behind the routine torture and execution of thousands of citizens in the 1950's and 1960's, it might be difficult to explain why their portraits still hang in every classroom on Taiwan.
"A lot of people here don't know about the repression in the 50's and 60's," Professor Lai said. "More people were killed at that time than during 2-28. Police just knocked on the door at midnight, and then the people inside just disappeared."

GRAPHIC: Photo: As democracy continues to bend Taiwan inexorably toward a more open society, a dark chapter in its history has been opened. A massacre in which thousands were killed in 1947 is being brought to light, and a Government-led report has been credited with casting aside many of the shadows. Lai Tse-han, a history professor, directed drafting of the report from his archive-filled office. (Nicholas D. Kristof/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Legislature In New Jersey Cuts Sales Tax

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 2

 BODY:
The Senate gave final legislative approval today to a one-cent rollback in the state sales tax, but Gov. Jim Florio said he wanted to see how the Republicans who control the Legislature would make up the $608 million in lost revenues before he approved or rejected the measure. If he decides to veto it, he faces an almost certain override.
"I'd love to sign a sales tax rollback," said the Governor, a Democrat, "but I need to know whether it is a good deal for New Jersey's citizens." 
 The Governor's definition of a "good deal" is a tax reduction that will not require higher property taxes, college tuition or transit fares or significantly lower state aid to education.
The Senate approved the tax rollback, from 7 to 6 percent, by a vote of 28 to 1. The rollback would take effect July 1.
One Democratic Senator, Raymond J. Zane of Woodbury, voted with the 27 Republicans and the remaining Democrats abstained or were absent.
The measure passed the Assembly last week by an even larger margin, 59 to 5. Two Democrats joined the Republicans and the rest were absent or abstained on the ground that they could not vote on a rollback without knowing what programs or services would be cut to make up the lost revenue.
 
A Buoyant Atmosphere
 The vote in both houses was sufficient to override a veto by the Governor.
The rollback was a Republican pledge since the party won overwhelming control of the Legislature last Nov. 5 on a tidal wave of voter anger over a $2.8 billion tax increase imposed by Governor Florio and the Democratically controlled Legislature in 1990.
With the outcome a foregone conclusion, the Senate debate was essentially a reprise of last week's discussion in the Assembly, and, though pointed, took place in an almost buoyant atmosphere. Both sides wore lapel pins, the Democrats' asking "Who Gets Cut?" and the Republicans' saying "Jobs Now!" referring to their program to revitalize the economy, which includes the tax cut.
On the floor, Democrats argued that they were being asked to vote in the dark and Republicans maintained that they would explain their proposed cuts in early May. The Republicans insisted that their spending reductions would total more than the $608 million needed to replace the revenue that would be lost through the sales tax rollback.
The Republican Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, in fact ruled that debate over the revenue shortfall was not pertinent and that only the rollback itself could be discussed.
"It may be legitimate to ask questions," about revenues, he said, "but it does not have anything to do with the bill, which is to reduce the sales tax. The debate is not over revenues."
Senator Walter Rand of Camden, a Democrat, retorted, "It's a sham and a shame, irresponsible at best, to move this legislation without identifying the cuts. If you think you can hide behind parliamentary camouflage, you are mistaken."
Beyond saying that the necessary cuts will be forthcoming, Republicans have generally said only that the sales-tax reduction itself will spur spending that will generate more sales-tax revenue, an analysis that Governor Florio described as "discredited supply-side voodoo economics."
The tax cut would translate to about $77 over a year for each New Jersey citizen, although some analysts say that the figure would be closer to about $47 for an individual because corporations account for an estimated 40 percent of the spending that generates sales taxes.
 
Renters May Lose Out
 One Republican Senator, Dick LaRossa of Trenton, suggested in floor debate that $330 million of the shortfall could be made up by reducing the amounts returned to taxpayers under the Governor's expanded Homestead Tax Rebate program, which took effect last year.
Governor Florio and the Democrats increased the rebate from a flat $180 for each homeowner to a sliding scale that, on the basis of income and property tax paid, can go as high as $500 and includes renters for the first time.
Mr. LaRossa alluded to the inclusion of renters as a possible source of cuts. "I'm certainly not interested in redistributing tax dollars to people who have never paid a dime in property taxes," he said.
The Senate's approval of the rollback left Governor Florio with four options. He can sign the bill, veto it outright, veto it with conditions or allow it to become law without his signature after 45 days. If he vetoes it, he faces a virtually certain override, since the Republicans control two-thirds majorities in both houses.
Today, he gave no strong indication of his intentions, except to say that no decision is likely until he knows where the cuts will be made, and he may take all of the 45 days he is allowed under the law to make up his mind.
"If we can cut the sales tax by a penny, or two pennies for that matter, we should do it," he said in a written statement issued after the vote. "I will be listening to and consulting with the people of New Jersey during the 45 days I have to study this legislation" to "make sure this would be a good deal."
Elderly people, he said, "have told me it wouldn't be a good deal if it means losing their homes because the scandalous property tax increases of the 1980's return."
He also said he opposed a rollback if it caused substantial tuition increases at state colleges and universities or fare increases because of reduced subsidies to N.J. Transit.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primary;
Far-Removed Feeling in Kansas Race

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan., April 1

 BODY:
Here in the middle of the country, the New York Presidential primary campaign is a distant spectacle playing on national television news, but for Kansas voters, what they learn from the video backwash is of particular interest. Next Tuesday they, too, will be voting in a state primary, but their choices will be made without contact with candidates, or even candidates' commercials.
It is a phenomenon that has a lot of Democratic politicians here worried. 
 At the Capitol, with its handsome murals of prairie history, some party leaders say they have a sinking "here we go again" feeling seeing their Presidential candidates self-destruct, and this week some top Democrats began talking up a brokered national convention, in which another candidate might be chosen through negotiation.
"Right now I think the best thing I can do for my state is to plan on going to the convention uncommitted so that in case of a deadlock Kansas might put a candidate over the top on a third or fourth or fifth ballot," said Gov. Joan Finney.
The state party chairman, John Bird, says he is considering recommending votes for uncommitted delegates, which can be done by checking the last line on Tuesday's ballot, "None of those named."
 
Paper Backs Tsongas
 The fidgety political atmosphere here was even reflected on the editorial page of The Wichita Eagle, a southern Kansas newspaper that is influential statewide, which Tuesday endorsed former Senator Paul Tsongas, hoping he would revive his suspended campaign.
"In this wacky political year, anything is possible," the editorial concluded.
For many Democratic office holders and party regulars, remaining uncommitted has been easy because neither Gov. Bill Clinton nor Edmund G. Brown Jr. has broken away from the battle for New York's 244 delegates to campaign personally for the 36 delegates at stake here.
In fact, neither has even mounted enough of a Kansas campaign to attract much local news coverage. They do not have advertisements on television, no polls have been published, and with the exception of a one-day fly-through by Hillary Clinton last week, the candidates do not even have surrogates making news for them here. Tonight Mr. Clinton came as close to campaigning in the state as he is going to when he appeared in live interviews on three Wichita television stations.
 
Interest in Perot
 Without even any signs of a protest against President Bush in the Republican primary, the efforts by volunteers for H. Ross Perot to put the Dallas tycoon on the November ballot in Kansas seem to have generated as much or more local interest as the vote next week.
So the Kansas primary may be a unique experiment in political science, with voters making their decisions almost solely on the basis of national media coverage of a another contest taking place the same day.
"New York politics is not a lot like what we do in Kansas to begin with," said State Representative Gary Blumenthal of Merriam, a Kansas City suburb. "And what people have been exposed to here is television stories about tabloid stories. With all the press attacks and denials and misinformation, our voters think they've got a choice between a flake and a liar, when actually both these guys have a lot to say on the issues."
The sight of such a bruising primary fight at the top of the ticket is especially troubling to Kansas Democrats, who in recent years have struggled to make gains in a largely Republican state. They now have a Democratic governor, a majority in the state House of Representatives and two of the five Congressional seats.
 
Visions of a Free-for-All
 As former state chairman and leader of the party in the west Kansas farm country, Norm Dreiling is exasperated with the national campaign. "We are hellbent to cut each other to death again," he said, "and now you can just see that establishment crowd back East in Washington and New York figuring how they can deny Clinton the nomination. Well, if they broker the convention, they are just going to get the American people even more mad at them."
Others are less concerned about a potential free-for-all. State Representative Anthony Hensley of Topeka, the majority whip, said: "I hear lots of rank-and-file regulars saying that a brokered convention could be better than picking Brown or Clinton. Look, it could be very dramatic. We could get a lot of TV time and really launch a candidate into the general election with some excitement."
Mr. Clinton is widely expected to win the primary in this state, where most Democrats share his centrist views. During her visit last week Mrs. Clinton met labor leaders and helped secure the endorsement of the machinists union in Wichita, the largest labor organization in the state. And, with just three paid staff workers and a few volunteer phone banks, the Arkansas Governor has the largest campaign operation.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill on Jobs In Big Economic Package

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 2

 BODY:
Capping a nearly festive day spent showing off their new political muscle, Republicans today pushed through the New Jersey Senate a bill to generate nearly 100,000 new jobs, an idea that Gov. Jim Florio proposed in his State of the State address.
In a legislative session in which bipartisan cooperation has been rare and agreement between Mr. Florio, a Democrat, and the new Republican majority has been almost nonexistent, the bill establishing the Economic Recovery Fund passed, 39 to 0. 
 The legislation was part of a seven-bill package that the Senate approved today, including a bill to roll back the state's sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent.
"Taken together, these bills will create jobs, retain jobs and spur New Jersey's economy," said the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco. The unemployment rate in New Jersey is 7.6 percent, matching the national rate.
Mr. DiFrancesco said the package of bills would produce at least 118,000 jobs, protect the jobs of 500,000 manufacturing workers and pump more than $2 billion into the state economy.
The Senate, where Republicans outnumber Democrats, 27 to 13, also signed off today by a vote of 37 to 0 on Mr. Florio's request to raise the spending cap on the state's Transportation Trust Fund to $565 million, a move that state officials say will create tens of thousands of jobs.
Other bills in the package approved today would extend the expiration date of all state and local government permits and approvals on development projects; exclude chemical, pharmaceutical and other businesses from paying local property taxes on their machinery, apparatus and equipment; limit the liability of secured lenders in cases of hazardous spills, and establish a program to assist banks in becoming more involved in export finance. The measure on hazardous spills would protect, for example, a bank that had foreclosed on a property where a business had been sued because of a spill.
All of the bills passed today except the one cutting the sales tax now go to the Assembly, where easy approval is expected. The Assembly has already approved the tax cut but Mr. Florio has said that before he signs the bill he wants the Republicans to show where they will cut spending to compensate for the loss in revenue.
Under the Economic Recovery Fund bill, the state would use $200 million in revenues from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for projects like an Atlantic City airport and a state performing arts center. Sponsors say the measure will generate $800 million for the state's economy, and Mr. Florio has said that it will lead to the creation of 20,000 construction jobs and 75,000 permanent jobs over the next three years.
The proposal was the cornerstone of the State of the State message Mr. Florio delivered Jan. 14 only hours after the Republicans assumed overwhelming control of both houses of the Legislature.
This is is the first time in 20 years that a New Jersey Governor faces a Legislature in which the rival party commands two-thirds majorities in both houses. But the Republican leaders eagerly supported Mr. Florio's idea and made it a major part of their own economic plan for the state.
 
More Construction Jobs
 The Republicans also supported Mr. Florio's proposal to raise the spending cap on the Transportation Trust Fund, which is supported by gasoline taxes. The Governor has said that raising the limit could create 13,000 construction jobs, and the Department of Transportation says the ripple effect could create 43,000 other jobs.
There is a $365 million annual limit on state spending from the seven-year-old trust fund, and surpluses must go into a reserve. Two years ago, the Legislature, then under Democratic control, increased the spending limit to $565 million a year to pay for transportation projects. Without today's bill, the cap would have reverted to $365 million on July 1, the beginning of the state's fiscal year.
The most controversial bill voted on today was one that would extend the expiration date of all state and local government permits and approvals on development projects.
"Approved permits are expiring or lapsing due to the current inability of many builders to obtain construction financing," said John H. Dorsey, the Senate Majority Leader.
The bill passed, 33 to 1, despite protests from environmental groups and the League of Women Voters, who argued that the legislation would allow developers to circumvent environmental authorities and to build in buffer areas around wetlands.
The legislation to exempt certain businesses from local property taxes on their machinery was sponsored by Mr. DiFrancesco.
He said he had introduced the bill in response to recent decisions in the state tax court allowing municipalities to consider machinery and equipment, including heating or air conditioning systems and elevators, when figuring the property tax base of businesses. The measure was approved, 31 to 5. All five dissenters were Democrats.
The bill would apply to tax cases now before the court as well as future tax assessments. A statement that accompanied the bill said no data had been compiled on its fiscal impact on municipalities.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Race Relations in Arkansas Reflect Gains for Clinton, but Raise Questions

SERIES: Clinton as Governor: 12 Years at Arkansas's Helm -- Fourth of five articles.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 27

 BODY:
Two years ago England, Ark., a town with a recent history of racial tensions, was about to blow again.
A fight in the high school playground between a black student and a white student had escalated to a larger racial confrontation. Black parents kept their children home from school. Whites felt the incident was overblown. The Knights of the Klu Klux Klan began distributing inflammatory leaflets in England, a town of nearly 4,000 people 22 miles southeast of Little Rock. 
 Using a racial epithet, they charged blacks wwith disrupting "law and order," and warned, "If you think you have troubles NOW, wait until the minorities become the MAJORITY."
After that, Gov. Bill Clinton decided to get involved.
He came to town and met privately with an integrated group of residents, urging them to form a biracial committee to work out their problems. His efforts bore fruit. A committee was set up, the two sides started to talk and tensions were defused. To Mr. Clinton's supporters, his performance typified his ability to forge biracial coalitions that work through racial animus.
 
Bridging the Divide
 As he campaigns for President, Mr. Clinton has been able to attract a vast majority of the black vote -- although with a much lower black turnout than in 1984 or 1988 -- by presenting himself as the candidate best able to bridge the nation's racial divide.
He is the Governor of a Southern state that has seen its share of racial violence. Black sharecroppers took part in an angry uprising in 1919, for example, and in 1957 President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered Federal troops to Little Rock to escort nine black students into newly integrated Central High School. Now, Mr. Clinton asserts, he is "uniquely qualified" to bring blacks and whites together.
His long record as Governor offers support for that assertion, and raises some questions. Most Arkansans agree that under Governor Clinton more blacks and women have been appointed to boards, commissions and departments than under any other chief executive in the state's history. Mr. Clinton has appointed blacks to influential positions as the state's chief financial officer, health commissioner and head of the Department of Social Services, Arkansas' largest state agency.
"I never detected any reluctance on his part to appoint blacks to important positions in state government because of their color," said Mahlon A. Martin, president of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. "If fact, he made an affirmative effort to do so."
Mr. Clinton appointed Mr. Martin as director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, the state's top fiscal job. He was the first and only black to hold that position.
 
Legal Protection for Blacks
 A close examination, however, shows that by most measures Mr. Clinton's achievements in Arkansas are no better than those of many other governors nationwide. At the same time, the Clinton administration's record in providing legal protection for blacks and in improving their economic conditions comes under frequent criticism.
Arkansas is one of only nine states that has no law banning discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. It is one of only two states -- Alabama is the other -- with no civil rights bill barring racial discrimination in hiring and promotion. A civil rights bill was introduced in the Legislature last year, and Mr. Clinton supported it. But even with his backing, the measure failed.
While the Clinton administration has tried to help the development of black businesses while also trying to lure jobs for everyone, poverty persists among blacks living in the rural counties of the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Arkansas. There, illiteracy and joblessness remain stubbornly high, and at least one county has an infant mortality rate higher than that of French Guiana, Malaysia and Cuba. Even Mr. Clinton's admirers among blacks complain that his administration has yet to materially improve the lives of blacks in the Delta.
"Clinton has appointed a few token Negroes to various boards, and he knows how to go into African-American churches, get in the pulpit and sound like a black Baptist preacher," said Jimmie L. Wilson, a black State Representative from the Delta. But in the final analysis, he added, eastern Arkansas has fared no better under Mr. Clinton than it did under previous governors.
 
Drop in Farm Population
 The Delta's rich loam makes it one of the most fertile agricultural areas in the United States. But mechanization, the development of large-scale farming and the credit crisis of the 1980's have thrown many poor farmers and agricultural workers, both black and white, off the land. In 1950 Arkansas had 215,270 farmers and agricultural workers. By 1980 that number had dropped to 50,616.
In some ways Lake View, Ark., an all-black town near the Mississippi, typifies the Delta's problems. The town was founded in the 1930's as part of the New Deal; the Federal Government settled 96 black families in Lake View, and each was given 40 acres and two mules.
Today, Mayor Leon Phillips said, only five of these families still own their farms, and they are barely hanging on. Most of the black families lost their farms in the last 10 years, the Mayor said.
So how are most of the town's 609 residents making ends meet now?
"Welfare, man, welfare," Mr. Phillips said without hesitation.
In small Delta towns like Holly Grove, many blacks live in crumbling shacks; outside, scrawny chickens dart around abandoned cars rusting in front yards. In Lake View, situated on a narrow, curving lake, there is little more than two miles of paved road, even though the town covers 30 square miles.
 
Most Get Free Lunches
 Mr. Phillips, who is the superintendent of schools as well as the town's mayor, says 96 percent of the 230 students in Lake View's only public school are so poor they are eligible for federally financed free lunches, while another 2 percent qualify for reduced-priced lunches.
Some blacks in Arkansas complain that the Clinton administration's economic development efforts have been focused only on northwestern Arkansas, a section that is predomnantly white. State officials vehemently deny the charge, but they do acknowledge that most of state's economic growth in recent years has been in areas outside the Delta.
But the officials say business owners themselves have chosen northwestern Arkansas for a number of reasons. For one thing, the main campus of the University of Arkansas is in Fayetteville, in the northwestern corner of the state. Moreover, the area has a better educated work force, and the state's largest companies were already situated there. Among them are Tyson Foods Inc, the country's largest poultry processor, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the nation's largest retailers.
"In the industrial recruitment business, anyone who understands it at all understands that the public sector cannot take companies where they do not want to be," said Dave Harrington, director of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. "You take them where they've asked to be taken or to an area that has the criteria that they've asked for."
 
Controversy Over Records
 The issue was raised three years ago when several black legislators charged that a Japanese-owned company, Tokusen USA, was steered to Conway, Ark., a mostly white city 27 miles northwest of Little Rock. The legislators demanded that the development commission make public confidential state records related to the company's decision to move to Arkansas.
Mr. Harrington, a Clinton appointee, said Tokusen was not steered away from black areas, and insisted that the records would show that race played no part in the company's decision to put its plant in Conway. Still, he refused to release the records, arguing that making them public would harm Tokusen's competitive position.
When The Arkansas Gazette sued the state to gain access to the documents, Mr. Clinton persuaded the Legislature to pass a bill tightening the state's freedom of information law, preventing the release of all but the most innocuous portions of the records relating to the Japanese company.
Throughout the dispute, however, it became clear that Arkansas routinely gave businesses that were contemplating a move to the state demographic data that included the racial makeup of cities and counties under consideration. The agency has since stopped providing that data, although Mr. Harrington defends the practice.
"It becomes important to a certain extent," he said in an interview. "When people are looking to the area they want to live in and the types of employees they want, it's important that you give them a personality and a makeup of the community, providing that is not always negative. In some cases it's very positive."
 
Black Jobless Rate
 In his campaign statements, Mr. Clinton says the number of blacks in the state who were unemployed decreased by 34.8 percent from 1983 to 1990. But a Federal agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says the number of blacks nationwide who were jobless fell by 37.6 percent in the same period. Indeed, Arkansas' 17.5 percent unemployment rate for blacks in 1991 was higher than the rate for a number of other Southern states, including Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.
As the campaign notes, the Clinton administration has made a concerted effort to create new, black-owned businesses. The Arkansas Industrial Development Commission has made more than $2.3 million in loans to minority enterprises since 1983, and the state has established programs to assist struggling black farmers in the Delta.
In 1983 Mr. Clinton signed an executive order committing the state to purchase 10 percent of its goods and services from black-owned businesses. But the executive order did not carry the force of law, and most agency heads have ignored it. In addition, according to Mr. Martin, the state's former chief fiscal officer, Arkansas had too few black business with the experience and wherewithal to meet the state's demands. As a result, the state bought less than 3 percent of its goods and services from black entrepeneurs.
Last year the Governor pushed a bill through a reluctant Legislature that committed the state to make a good-faith effort to reach its goal of buying 10 percent from black-owned busisnesses. He also established a Minority Business Advisory Council to oversee the law.
And despite the problems, black officials in Arkansas say they believe Mr. Clinton is doing about as well as can be expected, given that he has to contend with a conservative Legislature that often is resistant to change. While these officials say the Governor made a mistake last month by playing golf at a Little Rock country club that has not admitted blacks, they seem willing to forgive him.
"I look at the overall picture, what he has done for blacks and the overwhelming support he has gotten from the black community every time he has run," said William L. Walker, Jr., a black State Representative from Little Rock. "If I didn't know anything about the guy," Mr. Walker added, he would consider the country club episode far more critically.

His appointment of blacks has been one measure by which he has been judged. Mahlon A. Martin, left, president of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, praised his record. His efforts to erase the poverty of such areas as Lake View, in the Delta, have met an even more stubbon wall. (Photographs by Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Behind the Scenes;
Reflections on People, Props and (Oh, Yes) Issues

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
The New York primary happens to fall on the Yankees' opening day. But modern politics is anything but baseball: Just because the candidate shows up doesn't mean the people will come.
In this age of television politics, where the reality on the nightly news is more real than the day-in, day-out of the campaign, nothing, paradoxically, is more important than the crowd. 
 And nothing is more elusive. TV giveth, and TV taketh away.
"People watch television," said John LoCicero, a political consultant who was Mayor Edward I. Koch's behind-the-scenes handler and has volunteered his expertise to Bill Clinton's campaign. "What do they need to go and see the candidates for? You have to work to get a crowd."
 
How to Build a Crowd
 Advance people have a special term for this work: building a crowd.
Time was when the political rally was the emotional and informational medium of the campaign. No more. "The people are just props," said Norman Adler, a political consultant and veteran of 20 Presidential campaigns. "When the candidates go out, they're not really going out for votes. They're going out to be on the news. What you want are a lot of different kinds of props."
At 5:30 A.M. March 26, Bruce Nyman, a Nassau County supervisor from Long Beach, got a call from one of Mr. Clinton's advance people asking him to produce a crowd -- in less than eight hours. "They wanted to do a senior hit," said Mr. Nyman.
Mr. Nyman guaranteed a great crowd of senior citizens. "Then I panicked," he said. All he had were 50 to 75 senior citizens in a lunch program at the Temple Beth-El Synagogue on Long Beach.
By 1:45 P.M., when the candidate and the television cameras showed up, the auditorium was packed with more than 350 enthusiastic senior citizens. Here is how Mr. Nyman did it: "We called Democratic committee people, election inspectors, the presidents of all the organizations," he said. "At 9 A.M. we printed up flyers: 'Governor Clinton coming to Long Beach today. We sent mini-buses to bring more senior citizens from adult homes."
 
Not the Right Message
 One big problem: The senior citizens in the lunch program were supposed to leave by 1 P.M. But someone, no one will say who, arranged for the buses to be delayed until 2:30, long after the candidate had left.
Asked about the mysterious scheduling change, Mr. Nyman said, "That must have been a coincidence."
Mr. Clinton had also had a mysterious scheduling change. His Long Island appearance was supposed to have been at a medical-equipment factory in Bayshore. His staff would say only that they didn't learn until the last minute that the factory "would not have sent the right message." The factory makes, among other things, toilets and crutches.
It's not a matter of just showing up, warned Mr. Adler. Some crowds are politically incorrect.
"You don't want to show up at a factory gate and find it's nonunion," he said. "You don't want to go to a place where people are going to complain a great deal, especially in an organized way. I would be very chary of campaigning in the East Village where there are a lot of anarchists and dissenters."
Even though the political masterminds might think of them as props, the people in the crowd persist in thinking of themselves as voters. John Lundin, who lives in Mount Vernon and is an auditor for the New York Stock Exchange, braved the rain Monday night to attend a Clinton rally at Mount Vernon High School.
"I want to hear what he says for myself," Mr. Lundin said. "On TV, you only get little bites.
 
In Quest of Knowledge
 Last Saturday, another voter, 28-year-old Joe Pigott, an unemployed banker, traveled from the Upper West Side to Union Square to find out about Edmund G. Brown Jr.
He joined what is known in the advance lingo as a "built-in crowd," the throngs who visit the Greenmarket Farmers Market at Union Square on Saturdays. By noon, more than a thousand people were waiting for the candidate.
The former California Governor didn't show up until nearly three hours later. The crowd cheered: "Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!"
"What a crowd," the candidate called out. "It's incredible."
This crowd blocked the customers who were trying to buy the farmers' organic meat, eggs and vegetables, home-made jam and bread, and fresh fish. Joel Patraker, the manager of the market, estimated that the farmers lost about $8,000. "This is so oxymoronic," he said. "Here we have the environmental candidate, and he wipes out the Greenmarket."
 
The Focus Is Off
 Despite the setting, Mr. Brown talked about his flat-tax proposal, not about issues of specific interest to farmers. His team had apparently not known that Union Square is the home of a farmers' market.
"We thought we'd get a lot of public exposure," one volunteer said. "California set it up. They didn't realize there is a significant community event there every Saturday. If they'd known, they would never have done it."
Mr. Pigott was disillusioned. "I didn't learn anything more about Brown by attending that rally than if I'd watched the 11 o'clock news," he said. "The crowd was looking for someone who would actually speak to them, not the cameras. But it was just an egregious photo op."

HEADLINE: The Steel Man With Kid Gloves

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
On a recent trip to the USX Corporation's largest mill, in Gary, Ind., Thomas J. Usher unexpectedly strolled into the offices of the United Steelworkers local to listen to what union leaders might have on their minds about the mill.
A visit by the president of the corporation's vast steel operation to a union office might seem like business as usual. But "it was very, very unusual," said Cary Kranz, president of the local. "Other heads of U.S. Steel would never have dreamed of being in the same room with the union people. He is bringing in a breath of fresh air."
Mr. Kranz's testimony itself represents a significant shift in relations between management and labor at the nation's largest steel company, which had long been characterized by criticism -- not compliments. To many, Mr. Usher, 49 years old, represents a historic changing of the guard at Big Steel, replacing the autocratic managers that President Kennedy once referred to as "a bunch of S.O.B.'s."
"Our long-term interests are exactly the same," Mr. Usher said recently in an interview at the company's headquarters here. "Whether you are a manager or a member of the union, everyone wants to do a good job, and they want to provide for their families. But I think there is a growing realization that we are not going to make it without the union and the union is not going to make it without us."
That realization has led to a number of changes in the way the two sides treat each other and has helped forge a big comeback for America's largest steelmakers. Although the biggest steelmakers are losing money in this recession, there has been a marked improvement in efficiency and quality. For those reasons and others the Bush Administration decided not to extend limits on imported steel.
But the task ahead for Mr. Usher, who took over the steel operation in 1990, is to find ways to cause the business to grow profitably and retain customers as well as find still more ways to make better steel more efficiently.
At the U.S. Steel Group, USX's steel division and America's most efficient large steel producer, there are now regular meetings with managers and union officials that cover everything from retraining and environmental progress to health-care costs. And under Mr. Usher's guidance, groups of union workers and managers have started visiting customers to interview them about their products. Slowly, the carefully drawn line between management and labor, which existed for generations, is beginning to blur.
 
'A Different Breed'
 "He is an excellent manager, and he is a different type of manager from what we have seen before," said Paul T. Sullivan, executive director for purchasing and transportation at the Ford Motor Company, a large USX customer. "From my perspective, Tom Usher is an effective manager who seems to be totally committed to getting everyone involved in the process of quality. To me, he is a different breed of fellow."
Many suggest that Mr. Usher's style reflects his exposure to foreign steel companies, particularly those in Japan and South Korea. Mr. Usher, who came to U.S. Steel in 1966 as an industrial engineer and has held numerous management positions in plants and headquarters ever since, has had his executive tenure shaped by the waves of joint ventures between USX and the Pohang Iron and Steel Company of South Korea and the Kobe Steel Company of Japan.
"He has been more open with customers and employees," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "He has managed in a short time to create a sense of team spirit there."
Mr. Usher is unwilling to acknowledge that his management style has been heavily influenced by those partnerships. But he insists that there was a need to run matters differently.
"Twenty years ago, there was very little that was ever expected of anyone who wasn't in management, particularly to come up with an idea," Mr. Usher said. "Everyone looked up to the oracle on high for all decisions."
Indeed, the American steel industry has long been a symbol of rigid management. Like many in American industry, steel executives gave orders to managers, who in turn passed them along to foremen who barked them at workers.
Today, steel managers are more likely to have committees made up of union members and executives to discuss quality, customer service or productivity. Executives often ask workers to help in devising methods to shave minutes from one process or another. "As a culture in this company, we have asked a lot of people's backs, but not enough of their minds," Mr. Usher said.
Mr. Usher's climb up U.S. Steel's corporate ladder began after he earned an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering, a master's degree in operations research and a doctorate in systems engineering, all from the University of Pittsburgh.
By 1975, he had become the assistant to the general superintendent of the company's large plant on the South Side of Chicago, which he recently decided to close. Mr. Usher went on to hold posts in strategic planning and research for the corporation and became vice president for engineering for the steel business in 1984. A year later, he was a senior vice president and five years later became president of the steel division, succeeding Thomas C. Graham, who retired last year at age 63.
Mr. Graham, who came to USX in 1983 after a lengthy career at the former Jones & Laughlin Steel, saw the nation's largest steel producer through its toughest years. Although Mr. Graham is credited with investing huge sums in new equipment and forging important joint ventures with foreign steelmakers, he was nonetheless widely seen inside the company and by workers as having an autocratic style of management.
 
Facing New Tests
 Mr. Usher's management will be put to the test in the coming years. He is leading the steel business at a time when manufacturers like auto makers are turning away from steel to substitute lighter materials. He also faces growing competition from nonunion, low-cost mini-mill steel producers like the Nucor Corporation, which make steel from scrap. Those companies have been more aggressive about taking market share from large steel companies. Also, there will be more stringent environmental regulations.
Mr. Usher said his strategy in dealing with the mini-mills was to make flat-rolled steel -- the steel for cars and appliances and the bread and butter of his company -- as inexpensively and efficiently as he can. He said he would continue to have a presence in the export market, something historically uncommon for steel companies in the United States.
"He has a lot of constituents he has to keep happy," Mr. Jacobson said. "The company has done a good job of cutting, but you can only go so far in cutting. You eventually have to address the issue of how to grow the business profitably and hang on to customers and to assure that steel is going to be desired by various industries."
Mr. Jacobson added that Mr. Usher's big contribution to the company would have to be in "generating dialogue with customers and workers and management so that everyone is talking to each other." He said: "But that's something that will require a shift in that company's culture. It's too soon to say how well he is doing in establishing that, but he has made a good start."

HEADLINE: Adviser to Dinkins Again Tops List of City Lobbyists

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A law firm headed by a close friend and tennis partner of Mayor David N. Dinkins made more money lobbying the city last year than any other concern. Overall, the amount of money that lobbyists earned for their attempts to influence city government rose only slightly from the previous year.
A report issued yesterday by the City Clerk showed that spending on lobbyists rose 3.5 percent in 1991, to $8.8 million, compared with $8.5 million in 1990, when the figure was up a third over 1989. 
 The law firm of Davidoff & Malito -- which is headed by Sid Davidoff, an administrative assistant for former Mayor John V. Lindsay and a frequent adviser to Mayor Dinkins -- led the list for the third straight year, collecting $1.7 million, or almost 20 percent of the total amount paid to city lobbyists.
The number of lobbyists registered with the city increased to 92 last year, from 89 in 1989, but 72 percent of the fees received by lobbyists were paid to 10 firms.
 
Koch Aides Doubled Revenues
 Another firm, that of Capalino, LoCicero, Marino & Tan, Inc., more than doubled its client list and lobbying revenues last year, collecting $776,931.
The firm's chief lobbyists are James Capalino, who was Commissioner of General Services in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, and John LoCicero, who was Mr. Koch's special assistant.
Its clients include Manhattan Cable Television, Paragon Cable Manhattan, TriBeCa Film Center, Inc., which is partly owned by the actor Robert DeNiro, and Penn Yards Associates, in which the developer Donald J. Trump owns a controlling interest.
New York City law requires anyone who receives more than $2,000 a year for representing someone in legislative or regulatory matters before the city to report fees and clients to the City Clerk, Carlos Cuevas. Such representation includes decisions on laws, rules, regulations and rate-making before the City Council, Mayor, city agencies, boards, and commissions.
 
Growth Is Slowing
 Although growth appears to be slowing with the recession, lobbying the city has increased greatly in recent years, reflecting the election of a new Mayor and the adoption of a new City Charter that changed many goverment rules and procedures.
Gene Russianoff, a senior lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, which is financed by college students' activity fees, said the Clerk's report showed that not all lobbyists were created equal.
"Sid Davidoff is a classic example of the power that former city officials wield," Mr. Russianoff said. "There certainly are a lot of his clients who believe that he can do a better job than his competitors because he has a higher level of access to the Dinkins administration."
 
The Importance of Access
 Among Mr. Davidoff's clients are the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the McDonald's Corporation, the New York City Committee of Asphalt Producers, the Trump Organization and Vanguard Meter Services Inc., a small Kentucky company which won $50 million dollars in city contracts to install water meters. But the city stopped doing business with the firm when a grand jury accused Vanguard of undercutting competition.
Mr. Davidoff was not at his firm yesterday and could not be reached for comment. But Howard S. Weiss, who supervises the firm's lobbying activities, said that Davidoff & Malito had no special entree to city government. "The truth is what we do, we do well and we have gained a reputation over the years not only with this administration but with others as well," Mr. Weiss said.
Mr. Weiss said that the firm's lobbying revenues as reported by the City Clerk were misleadingly high because the firm included fees received for representing clients seeking city contracts, although lobbyists are not required to report such fees. But Mr. Weiss declined to say what the adjusted figure would be.
City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman have introduced legislation that would require lobbyists to report such activities.
Mr. Capalino said that charges that former government officials have special access were without merit.
"It's been my experience that we are held to an even higher standard by city government because current officials do not want to be accused of being predisposed," Mr. Capalino said. "We win clients because of our insights. We can tell them what government officials are looking for."

Stock Funds Attract Money But Produce Mixed Results

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For stock mutual funds, the first quarter was a perplexing combination. The money poured in from investors, but the profits from investing all that money were decidedly mixed.
The average equity fund in the quarter had a total return to investors of a negative 0.82 percent, Lipper Analytical Services reported yesterday. Among the 19 types of funds that Lipper tracks, only one narrow category, financial-services funds, showed a gain of more than 5 percent, with a rise of 6.31 percent. 
 Biotechnology funds, the hottest funds of last year and some of the most attractive to investors early this year, were among the biggest losers. The average health and biotechnology fund lost 9.51 percent in the quarter, Lipper said. The worst performer in the group was Fidelity's Select Biotechnology fund, which fell 16.39 percent.
The worst performers among funds were those dedicated to Japanese stocks. Capstone's Nikko Japan Fund plunged 22.93 percent in the quarter, as the Japanese stock market fell rapidly. The Nikkei index of 225 issues has lost more than half its value since the end of 1989.
Despite the dull overall picture, there were three funds that managed to return better than a 20 percent profit to investors in the quarter. Atop the list, with a profit of 24.59 percent, was Fidelity's Select Automotive fund, which benefited from the rapidly rising stock prices of auto makers. Those stocks, headed by Chrysler's rise of more than 50 percent, reflected investors' expectations of an economic recovery in the United States.
The second-best performer was the Sherman, Dean Fund, a highly unusual and small fund based in San Antonio. It posted a first-quarter gain of 22.17 percent.
With just $2.5 million in assets, the fund is run by the 74-year-old Walter J. Sherman and his 39-year-old son, David. The Sherman family owns about a third of the fund, and the elder Mr. Sherman said yesterday that outsiders had not bought many shares in his fund so far this year. "Marketing is not our forte," he said.
The Sherman, Dean Fund owns only 13 stocks and is officially classified as a non-diversified fund. Last year, it rose only 12 percent. But in this year's first quarter, all 13 of its stocks went up, including some that leaped by large amounts on hopes for turnarounds. For example, Greenman Brothers, a toy distributor and retailer, jumped 53 percent as it reported a sharp increase in profits.
Ranking third was the $40 million Heartland Value Fund of Milwaukee. It is an unusual small-capitalization fund that buys only stocks trading at low multiples of earnings and is willing to take huge positions in companies that it likes. The fund, which is restricted to buying companies with total market capitalizations of less than $300 million, gained 20.05 percent, pacing small-company growth funds, which averaged 2.39 percent.
At one point, Heartland Value, along with other accounts managed by William Nasgovitz, owned a quarter of LCS Industries, a New Jersey company that provides direct-marketing services. Those shares were bought for less than $5 each, and about half were sold during the quarter, when good earnings briefly pushed LCS above $16. The shares fell back, but still ended the quarter at $11.25, more than double their price at the beginning of the year.
One secret to doing well in the quarter was to believe the economic recovery was coming and to buy stocks that would benefit from a pickup in business. Such cyclical stocks led the market and formed the basis for an 18.4 percent rise by Pioneer's Capital Growth fund. The fund's manager, Warren Isabelle, yesterday described it as "an aggressive growth fund" that focuses on small to medium-sized companies and has $44 million in assets.
One might have expected the mediocre performance of stock funds to have discouraged investors from pouring cash into them. But the opposite was true. In February, the net cash flow into stock funds was a record $7.5 billion. And when the March figures are posted, the total for the quarter is likely to be $20 billion.
That flood of money reflected in part the fact that 1991 was an excellent year for stocks and for stock funds. Last year, the average equity fund turned in a gain of 30.66 percent. And it also reflected low short-term interest rates, which have persuaded many investors to accept increased risk in exchange for a chance of getting higher returns on their investments.
For the 12 months ending in March, that average return for equity funds is down to a less impressive, but still substantial, 12.26 percent.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Up, as Are Jobless Claims

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories were higher in February, but first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose for the second week.
The Commerce Department reported factory orders rose five-tenths of 1 percent in February, the second straight small gain. But the second weekly increase in initial unemployment claims showed businesses continued to hand out pink slips. Joblessness typically remains high for a time after the economy begins to turn up. 
 The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable goods rose to a seasonally adjusted $236.4 billion, the second consecutive one-half of 1 percent advance after falling 3.7 percent in December.
"Manufacturing is on an upswing, but a weak upswing," Kris Bledowski of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said. "The early gains will be only so-so."
The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment insurance unexpectedly posted the second straight increase for the week ended March 21.
The report said 456,000 claims were filed, up 9,000 from the previous week to the highest level since 460,000 applications were made in the week ended Feb. 29.
The four-week moving average, which many analysts consider a better gauge of labor activity, also rose, up to 448,750 from 444,000 a week earlier.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release its unemployment report for March on Friday. Many analysts expect the rate to remain at about 7.3 percent as previously discouraged workers re-enter the market while job growth remains soft.
Analysts say that businesses often delay hiring workers in the early stages of a recovery. Companies tend to rely on overtime to meet rising demand until they are confident the turnaround can be sustained.
Factory orders for durable goods -- items like trucks and turbines expected to last more than three years -- slipped three-tenths of 1 percent in February, to $120.2 billion, after gaining 2.4 percent a month earlier.
Ms. Bledowski noted that those orders "were heavily affected by the military sector."
Orders for military equipment, which often are volatile, fell 18.7 percent after dropping 20 percent in January and soaring 89.4 percent in December. Excluding this component, orders rose 1.2 percent in February.
On the other hand, orders for non-durable goods such as chemicals and clothing rose 1.4 percent, the first advance in three months. Analysts said growth in this sector usually preceded the more expensive durable-goods category as a recovery began.
Shipments, a barometer of current production, rose 2.1 percent, the 10th increase in 11 months.
But unfilled orders fell 1 percent, their sixth straight decline. Unfilled orders indicate future business and whether additional workers will be needed.
Inventories were down three-tenths of 1 percent, their fifth consecutive decline, to the lowest level since February 1989.
"The lower inventories will help in the end," Ms. Bledowski said, adding that they will "give a kick to production schedules" as businesses replenish their stocks.
Among the durable-goods components, transportation orders advanced nine-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.9 percent gain a month earlier. Excluding transportation, orders rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders for primary metals rose 8 percent after a 2.3 percent gain.
But orders for industrial machinery and equipment such as engines and computers slipped 1.9 percent after rising 5.8 percent.
Electronic and other electrical equipment orders also fell 1.9 percent, following a 5.1 percent loss in January.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a barometer of industry plans to expand and modernize, fell 2.9 percent after rising 4.5 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: Officials Question if Newly Passed State Spending Plan Will Remain Balanced

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 2

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature completed work on the new state budget just before 4 A.M. today, giving the state its earliest spending plan in eight years but raising questions among some fiscal monitors about whether the $30.8 billion budget will remain balanced through the year.
The monitors, including State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, expressed doubts about some revenue estimates and noted that lawmakers failed to give legal approval to the sale of property at the Aqueduct Race track in Queens despite a provision in the budget for $50 million in proceeds from the transaction. 
 Mr. Regan, a Republican, pointedly called on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to issue an update of all budget projections in September "so voters are made aware of the state's fiscal situation before the election." All 211 members of the Legislature, but none of the statewide officials including Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Regan, are up for re-election in November.
Nevertheless, after missing the April 1 budget deadline by a record nine weeks last year, there was an air of good feeling and self-congratulation among the state's leaders.
"This should be the start of something good," said Governor Cuomo, who had fought with legislators for five months over the state's finances.
 
Politics Plays a Role
 Cuomo administration officials, who insisted that ample precautions had been taken to insure a balanced budget, brushed aside Mr. Regan's objections, arguing that he could not have reviewed the whole plan. "It's hard for us to understand how the Comptroller could imply the possibility of a deficit when he hasn't studied the bills yet," said Claudia S. Hutton, a spokeswoman for the Mr. Cuomo's budget division.
Electoral politics played a clear role in the budget deliberations, and indeed were responsible for pushing final passage of the budget just beyond April 1, the date lawmakers were hoping to attain for symbolic as well as legal reasons.
In the Republican-controlled State Senate, the final approval did not come until near dawn because G.O.P. Senators were holed up with their leader, Ralph J. Marino, for more than seven hours on Wednesday as several of them pleaded for permission to vote "no" on the tax portion of the budget. That included hundreds of millions of dollars in new fees plus the deferral of $1 billion worth of scheduled tax cuts.
At least seven of the Republican Senators are facing primary races this fall, with many of the challengers emboldened by the guerrilla tactics of Change-NY, a conservative organization. Among other things, the well-financed group has flooded the Senators' districts with mailings reminding voters that their representatives have been voting for higher taxes.
"After what happened in New Jersey, where both houses of the Legislature changed hands, these people are a lot more sensitive to the concerns about taxes," Tom Carroll, the president of Change-NY, said of the Senators. "In prior years they were able to get away with saying one thing in their districts and doing another thing in Albany, but we're not going to let that happen anymore."
 
Soundly Balanced Budget
 Despite the failure in securing legal language for the Aqueduct deal, which Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said they would try to hammer out later, the Governor said there was enough of a cushion built into the budget that he could confidently take it before credit rating agencies .
Last year's $30 billion budget fell out of balance by nearly $900 million, with state officials blaming the recession -- specifically, declining tax revenues and greater demands for social services -- for the problem.
This time around, Mr. Cuomo said he thought the budget was more soundly balanced than any he had seen in his nine-year tenure. But even at that, he added, there was no way he could guarantee New Yorkers fiscal equilibrium.
"We're trying to make an absolutely firm calculus about something that it is in its nature unpredictable," he told reporters today. "You have to guarantee now that it's going to come out even a year from now whether you have a war or not, a plague or not, crack or not."
Cynthia Green, a senior analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a Manhattan-based watchdog group financed by businesses, said that the goal of a timely budget may have prevented greater budgetary reform. "The timing isn't everything here," she said. "It may be everything in comedy but it's nothing in tragedy, and this is a tragic budget. "

Prices Little Changed in Slow Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as market participants prepared for the release today of March employment data.
"We saw very good buying on Wednesday, and now the market is just evening out going into the numbers," one government securities trader said. 
 Most economists expect the employment data to show that non-farm payroll employment rose by a modest 25,000 to 50,000 last month, and that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.3 percent.
 
Unaffected by Data
 Economic data released yesterday, including a rise in factory orders during February and a surprisingly large rise in initial unemployment claims in the week that ended on March 21, had no effect on prices in the credit markets, traders said.
Analysts said that the increase in unemployment claims, however, coupled with a decline in the employment component in the survey of the nation's purchasing managers released on Wednesday, seemed to increase the odds the March employment numbers might be weaker than anticipated.
"The risks now seem to be on the downside," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
"We have an economy that is growing in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent," he said. "But without job growth, I don't see us jumping much above that level."
 
Money Supply Falls
 An additional sign of potential weakness appeared late in the day, when the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on March 23.
A decline of $10.2 billion in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was much larger than anticipated.
"The slowdown in money supply is just one more piece of the puzzle that we expect to contribute to the more bullish environment this quarter," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said in their daily market commentary.
The analysts added that they expect further declines in the monetary aggregates next week.
The money supply numbers did provoke a small reaction from traders, and prices moved modestly higher. But concern about the coming employment data limited the size of the rise.
 
30-Year Bonds Unchanged
 By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1015/32 , down by 2/32 , to yield 7.89 percent, unchanged from late on Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10013/32 , unchanged on the day, to yield 7.43 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 1007/32 , down by 2/32 , to yield 6.82 percent. And the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 10015/32 , unchanged on the day, to yield 5.49 percent.
Traders reported good demand at an auction of $13 billion in one-year Treasury bills.
The bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.34 percent, down slightly from the 4.37 percent average rate at the last one-year bill auction on March 5.
Rates on outstanding Treasury bills were unchanged to slightly higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4 percent late yesterday, unchanged on the day. And six-month bill rates rose by 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 4.10 percent.
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by the sale of $1.2 billion in 7-year and 12-year securities for RJR Nabisco Inc.
The $600 million in 8.30 percent seven year notes were priced at $100, or par, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $600 million in 8 3/4 percent 12-year securities were also priced at $100, or par, 1.29 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
All of the securities priced yesterday are noncallable for life.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
7-Year Bonds Sold
 Investment bankers at Goldman said all of the seven-year securities had been sold, and that commitments for 85 percent of the 12-year bonds had been received.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire bank debt the company used earlier this year to repurchase $1 billion in high-cost debt.
Falling interest rates and a sharp rise in the stock market have been a boon to RJR Nabisco, allowing the company to retire or refinance billions in high-cost debt securities.
Terry Dwyer, a group vice president at Duff & Phelps/MCM Credit Research Company, estimates that by the end of the year the company will have pared its total interest expense to $1.4 billion, from $3.2 billion in 1990.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

Bank Talks Are Delayed By Olympia

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 2

 BODY:
Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the struggling real estate giant that had promised to open its books to 100 creditor banks to renegotiate its debt, delayed the meeting for a week today.
The session between the world's largest commercial property developer and its international bankers, originally scheduled for next Monday, will be held April 13, the company said. Olympia & York said the delay was needed so it would have more time to prepare a financial picture of the company. 
 The company, which is the largest office landlord in New York and Toronto and is owned by Toronto's publicity-shy Reichmann brothers, said it would offer an interim proposal to the bankers while a long-term plan was developed. It is scrambling to restructure its debt because of a cash crunch brought on by the recession, an office-space glut and upward spiraling costs at its Canary Wharf development in London.
Olympia's total debt outstanding, including that of subsidiaries, is about $18.5 billion.
 
Some Debt Is Paid
 The company managed today to come up with nearly $124 million, or $147.3 million in Canadian currency, through an early dividend payment and used it to pay back some pressing debts, including $65 million of commercial paper that was due last month.
GW Utilities Ltd., which is 89 percent owned by Olympia, issued the dividend two weeks early from funds received from the first installment of its sale of Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc., announced in early March.
GW Utilities has been selling assets and passing the proceeds on to Olympia for the last year and a half.
Meanwhile, the Labor Party calmed fears that it might leave the Canary Wharf office development in London's Docklands area without good transportation if it won the general election next Thursday.
The Labor opposition, which opposed the 71-acre project begun under then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, is currently leading in opinion polls.
Canary Wharf -- half complete but producing little cash flow -- desperately needs better transportation links to London's financial center.
 
Deal to Sell Headquarters
 "We want to be pragmatic," a Labor Party spokesman said. "We are already committed to the rejuvenation of the Docklands area in East London, and now the Canary Wharf development is a reality, we do not want to fight old ideological battles with O.& Y."
People close to the restructuring said Olympia was working on a deal to sell its 36-story headquarters building, Exchange Tower, in downtown Toronto. The deal would help pay other commercial-paper obligations.
Olympia's $378 million mortgage ($450 million in Canadian funds) on the nearby Scotia Plaza building came due Wednesday without being paid.
The banks holding the mortgage on the 68-story tower could call the loan at any time, forcing Olympia into default, but they appear willing to let the mortgage sit on the table and become part of the restructuring process.
"This will most definitely take a long time," Brian Neysmith, president of the Canadian Bond Rating Service, said of the debt restructuring talks.
Olympia said it would open its books to its major lenders, but the contents were expected to be kept secret for reasons of client confidentiality and the Reichmanns' penchant for secrecy.
"I can't think of any other company where you have so little consolidated information," Mr. Neysmith said.
A group of bankers is reported to have made a loan to Olympia recently, using as collateral the second installment of the proceeds of the $210 million Interprovincial sale.

Dollar Off as Job Data Hurt Bulls Who Bet on Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday in response to an increase in unemployment benefits claims.
Gold was also lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $340.90 a troy ounce, down $2. A late bid at the Republic National Bank quoted gold at $340.30, off $2.15. 
 The dollar fell early in trading after the Government said unemployment claims for the third week in March were higher than expected, said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange director at the Bank of Boston.
The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 9,000, to 456,000. It was the second consecutive weekly increase and the highest level in three weeks. Economists had been looking for little change in the number.
 
Traders Change Positions
 Trading was volatile as investors who had been bullish on the dollar reconsidered their positions, Mr. Lawrie said.
Market participants bought dollars several weeks ago expecting that healthy economic reports would raise the currency's value, traders said.
But the market has not been satisfied with the slightly better-than-expected economic data showing a sluggish recovery. Only much better indicators would push the dollar further, traders said.
There was little change later in the day ahead of full March employment data, to be released today, Mr. Lawrie said.
"There wasn't much in the way of pressure to bring the dollar up again," said Mike Faust, a currency market analyst at MMS International Inc.
A report showing orders to United States factories somewhat stronger than expected did not support the dollar, he said. The Commerce Department said factory orders in February rose five-tenths of a percent for the second straight month.
In New York, the dollar fell to 133.70 Japanese yen from Wednesday's 134.50. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 134.77 yen, from 133.90 Wednesday. But later in London, it fell to 133.80 yen.
The British pound was quoted at $1.7310, up from $1.7260 Wednesday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7314, from $1.7255 Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.64375 German marks, down from 1.6520; 1.5015 Swiss francs, down from 1.5110; 5.5675 French francs, down from 5.6025; 1,240.00 Italian lire, down from 1,246.50, and 1.19195 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19125.

HEADLINE: Father's Papers and a Son's Politics;
When Jerry Finkelstein Buys, Andrew Stein's Foes Wonder

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Jerry Finkelstein's business is newspapers. The business of his son, Andrew J. Stein, is politics.
But now the media company that counts Mr. Finkelstein as its largest shareholder is buying up weekly newspapers all over the New York metropolitan region. Mr. Stein, the City Council President, is preparing for a mayoral race. All of which leaves some of his political opponents wondering if the family businesses have become a little too symbiotic. 
 "These are arguable investments," said Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayoral candidate, who contends that Mr. Finkelstein intends to use the weeklies as a vehicle to further his son's election drive.
"You'd have to have your head in the sand not to figure out what he's doing," added Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who lost to David N. Dinkins in 1989 and plans to run again.
Mr. Finkelstein, the 76-year-old former publisher of The New York Law Journal and a man with a long personal history in both politics and newspapers, indignantly denies that the media company, News Communications Inc., is doing anything other than building an empire of weeklies.
 
Neiether Hurts Nor Helps
 "I've been in the business all my life going back to 1939," he said, refering to his founding of The Civil Service Leader. His son, he added, "is an important person in the city."
"He doesn't need a few community papers to help him," he said.
Mr. Stein shrugs off his father's newspaper interests. "I don't think I'm hurt or helped," he said. "I have a 24-year record in public service. It's going to be looked at. My ideas for the city will be judged by all the media. So I don't think this has any effect one way or the other."
Yet the disclaimers do nothing to soothe rivals who remember that Mr. Finkelstein was instrumental in his son's early career, pouring money into an extravagant East Side race in 1968 that catapulted Mr. Stein, who had shortened his name, into the State Assembly.
It does not seem to matter that a year and a half before the election, the newspapers -- in Queens, Manhattan, the Hamptons and Montauk and with a total circulation in the hundreds of thousands -- barely cover Mr. Stein, or that their gossip columns show only the most negligible, perhaps just imagined, tendency to criticize his potential opponents. New York's political circles have been abuzz with each new purchase and Mr. Finkelstein's role has become a subterranean issue in an unofficial race.
"Jerry Finkelstein is a very smart man," said Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, who says she would not challenge Mr. Dinkins but does have mayoral ambitions. "He has always known how to protect his investments. His biggest investment is his son. It doesn't hurt to own all the weekly newspapers in two or three boroughs. It's a resource you can always call on if you really need it."
Even former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who says he does not believe Mr. Finkelstein is involved in anything other than canny business, felt compelled to make a public announcement when he became a movie reviewer for News Communications.
"I said I would not be supporting Andy Stein," Mr. Koch said. "And the reason is that I asked him to support me in my last election and he said he was for me, but did not endorse me." Mr. Koch said he spoke out to highlight his independence from Mr. Finkelstein.
"I was sure that people would think he was buying me," he said. "I'm sure that was not his intention."
Michael Schenkler, the president of News Communications, insists that the newspaper chain is a business, not a political enterprise. He added that the chain is looking to expand into Nassau County and New Jersey.
 
Looking to the Shore
 He noted that while Mr. Finkelstein is the largest shareholder, he owns only 20 percent of the company. The second largest shareholder, with 12 percent, is Gary L. Ackerman, the Queens Congressman who founded the Queens Tribune newspapers, now a part of the chain. Mr. Schenkler, the publisher of The Queens Tribune, is third, with 8 percent.
Among the other members of the company's board are two more people with connections to Mr. Stein: Martin McLaughlin, a consultant and political adviser to Mr. Stein, and Christopher McGrath, who was a deputy to Mr. Stein when he served as Manhattan Borough President.
The chain's first property was The West Side Spirit -- now the Manhattan Spirit -- founded in 1985. In 1988 it purchased Dan's Papers and The Montauk Pioneer, papers that pick up a substantial New York City readership in the summers, particularly many influential politicians and business leaders. One year later it took over The Queens Tribune, which has nine editions, with a total circulation of 146,000.
Last year, Manhattan's Our Town paper was acquired, adding another 119,000 readers. And last month, News Communications signed a letter of intent to buy The Downtown Express, The Chelsea Clinton-News and The Westsider, which would give the chain five weeklies in Manhattan and bring its city and Long Island circulation to about 476,000.
Mr. Finkelstein said in an interview that the company is finished with acquisitions in New York City and needs to diversify because the recession will last longer in New York than elsewhere.
This month, the chain announced plans to acquire two papers on the Jersey Shore. The chain has also had sporadic talks over the last year or so with two Brooklyn newspaper chains and with The Bronx Times Reporter.
 
A Father's Motives
 The newspapers, most of them distributed free, cover community issues that seldom appear in New York's dailies. There are profiles and interviews of local elected officials, and gossip items that Tom Allon, the editor in chief of The Manhattan Spirit, aggressively tries to propel into the gossip pages of the city's tabloids.
Mr. Allon says he resents suggestions that he is beholden to anyone. He said he almost never talks to Mr. Finkelstein and his paper rarely writes anything about Mr. Stein.
"It's hard enough to cover this city, but when you're up against people who try to impugn motives that aren't there it makes it more difficult," Mr. Allon said.
But he ran right into that perception recently when he printed a gossip item, which he also leaked to The New York Post, saying that Mr. Giuliani, a former United States Attorney, was a "major player" in rewriting an extradition treaty that smoothed the way for deportation of Joseph Doherty, an Irish Republican Army member who has been sent to Britain.
Mr. Giuliani -- who denies that he helped rewrite the treaty -- refused to take a call from the weekly. Instead he passed it on to the executive director of his campaign committee who delivered the message that "if Jerry wants to interview us about the Doherty matter we'd be happy to be interviewed directly by Jerry rather than using an intermediary."
Mr. Allon calls the reference to Mr. Finkelstein a "smokescreen."
"Giuliani is a smart politician," he said. "When attacked for something he will wildly counterattack and try to deflect attention from the issue, and that's what he's doing here."
 
Record of Publishing
 Mr. Giuliani, who is collecting a small archive of items from News Communications' newspapers critical of himself or other potential rivals of Mr. Stein, contends that the gossip columns are being used for "hit jobs." He noted that during a week in which Mr. Stein was receiving coverage in the city's dailies -- much of it negative -- for his lavish January fund-raising event, the News Communications gossip column did not carry a word of it.
But it carried items on Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Messinger. Mr. Allon said that he felt the fund-raiser had already received saturation coverage in the dailies.
The Dinkins administration, meanwhile, is staying above the fray. Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary, said that like "anyone who knows anything about the newspaper business in New York," he was aware of News Communications' growth. But he added, "I think we have faith in the objectivity and integrity of the reporters and editors."
As he sits in his midtown office, decorated with pictures of his children and prominent elected officials, Mr. Finkelstein insists that his long career as a publisher should end the speculation about his intentions.
"The record is important," he said. "The record is that in the 25 years that I published the Law Journal, I don't remember one story about Andy Stein. The record is there."

Facing Dangers Of a Global Bust

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE American economic recovery is being threatened by a global recession. In all the major countries, including this one, the recessions of the 1990's have proved to be deeper and more tenacious than the consensus forecasts of economists or governments.
What distinguishes the present slump from earlier postwar dips are the structural drags, especially the huge public and private debts and the inflated asset values built in the careless and speculative boom of the 1980's. "The unwinding of an asset-driven credit mania is always longer and more difficult than observers and economic actors at first believe," said Kenneth S. Courtis, the Tokyo-based strategist and senior economist of the Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Asia. 
 In Japan, he said, "It is just over these past few weeks that the cozy consensus view has begun to come to terms with the reality that the economy is much weaker than official forecasts and that the trials of the equity market are far from complete."
In Europe, recessions in many countries -- and the difficulty of getting out of them -- are being hampered by Germany. It has the most powerful economy, and is fighting inflation while the others want to fight recession. With its heavy costs of unification, the German budget has swung from a modest surplus in 1989 to a deficit of 5 percent of the gross domestic product this year. Consumer prices in Germany have been rising at a rate above 4.5 percent, high by German standards and an outrage at the Bundesbank.
So the German central bank has held money tight and interest rates up, and other European countries, linked to Germany in the European Monetary System, have had to keep their interest rates higher than their domestic economic conditions would warrant. They are finding it hard to pry themselves out of recession. Many Europeans fear that they are caught in a slump that could last five years or more, stymied by high real interest rates.
Although nominal interest rates are fairly low, Prof. Edmund S. Phelps of Columbia University said that with expectations of inflation low, "what we call real rates of interest are not low by historical standards." He argues that "this interest rate situation" is a major factor behind the slump in the United States, which "suggests the slump will continue to be with us, with only modest improvement, over the next few years."
Could the world economy be facing actual deflation? "I would guess not," Mr. Phelps said, because "the central banks would step in with easier money if that began to happen." But in his view what may well occur, and indeed has already begun to happen, "is deflation in relation to previous anticipations," and as a result, "the real burden of debts is much greater than the borrowers were anticipating when they borrowed."
The problem is how to float companies and economies off the rocks in the short run without causing inflation and instability in the long run. The answer for the United States proposed by 100 economists led by Prof. James Tobin of Yale is for the Administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve to pursue a program of stimulus to achieve a "vigorous" economic recovery in 1992 and higher expenditures to promote productivity growth now and over the long run. The three elements in their program are further cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, tax credits for business investment in plant and equipment and a $50-billion-a-year program of Federal aid to state and local governments, stressing public investment in education and infrastructure.
Some economists are wary of putting the debt problem in abeyance once more. Prof. Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard said, "In today's fiscal climate, temporary fiscal stimulus has about as much credibility as the tooth fairy." He favors more aggressive monetary ease now, while the inflationary risk is low.
Similarly, Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, says the "massive debt overhang" is the biggest drag on the American economy. Now, with the recovery "modest and tepid," he urges the Fed "to take some risks on excessive ease." Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady takes the same position.
The global recession is also restraining the American recovery. Exports, a strong source of support last year, have been dropping, and the rising dollar may push them further down. High interest rates in Germany, sluggish European economies, and the draining of capital funds by Japan are also drags on the American economy.
If the major trading countries and regions were to resort to hostile beggar-thy-neighbor trade and investment policies, the danger of a worldwide bust would be greater still. It has become more urgent than ever that the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- work together to coordinate their macroeconomic and trade policies. Mutual fears of a breakdown in world trade are making for a compromise deal to settle the long-stalled Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.

Almost 6 Weeks' Previews for Pacino
Al Pacino is coming to Broadway, but his producers say they can't afford an opening. Circle in the Square will present Mr. Pacino in two plays, "Salome" by Oscar Wilde and "Chinese Coffee" by Ira Lewis, from May 21 through July 18. The more than 600 Tony voters, whose presence qualifies an opening as official, will not be invited, says Circle's managing director, Robert Buckley, who estimates that the theater will save $140,000 in free tickets. 
 Editors, reporters and critics will be given one free ticket apiece, instead of the usual pair. Mr. Buckley confirms that Mr. Pacino and the creative personnel in both shows have agreed to work for union scale (Actors' Equity scale is $900 a week) to help the theater reduce its deficit. But Circle will ask critics not to review the shows until June 29, almost six weeks after the first preview and two weeks before the show closes.
Will the press really wait? The memory of "Nick and Nora" is still fresh, and its nine weeks of previews prompted some critical snooping before the official opening. A star of Mr. Pacino's stature on Broadway is a major news event, after all.
"We normally play 18 previews before the press comes," Mr. Buckley says. "Because these plays are running in repertory with only seven performances a week, we will only have had 14 performances of 'Chinese Coffee' and 19 of 'Salome' when they come this time. When it's explained this way we hope people see the reason behind it."
Circle also says it is in compliance with rules established by the Department of Consumer Affairs that ads must either state when a show is in previews or give a review date. Still, the press may decide not to wait. Linda Winer, the drama critic at New York Newsday who focused consumer attention on "Nick and Nora," and jumped the official review date at the National Actors Theater's long-previewing "Crucible," says, "This is a situation my editors and I will think about seriously."
"Chinese Coffee," co-starring Mr. Pacino and Charles Cioffi, will be directed by Arvin Brown. "Salome" will co-star Mr. Pacino, Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer in "Twin Peaks") in the title role, Suzanne Bertish and Esai Morales. Lar Lubovitch will choreograph Salome's Dance of the Seven Veils and Robert Allan Ackerman will direct.
 
Season's Finale at the Second Stage
 Carole Rothman and Robyn Goodman, the co-artistic directors of Second Stage, have announced their final production of the season, "Spike Heels," a new play by Theresa Rebeck. Michael Greif will direct the post-feminist sex comedy starring Kevin Bacon, Saundra Santiago and Tony Goldwyn. Performances are to run from May 12 through July 4.
 
The Public Is Taking Papp's Name
 On April 23, the Public Theater, home of the New York Shakespeare Festival, will be renamed the Joseph Papp Public Theater in honor of its founder, on the birthday of his favorite playwright, William Shakespeare. Mayor David N. Dinkins will officiate at the dedication along with Mr. Papp's widow, Gail Merrifield Papp; his successor, JoAnne Akalaitis, the artistic director of the festival, and Robert Pittman, the chairman of the theater's board. The public is welcome.
Mr. Papp purchased the former Astor Library in 1966, saving it from demolition. He named it the Public, in the hope it would be a theater for everyone, fighting for its landmark status and turning it into a five-theater cultural complex. Its inaugural production in 1967 was "Hair."
 
A Roster of Opening-Night Parties
 The crunch is on for Broadway openings: 11 are scheduled this month, trying to beat the April 29 cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility. The stakes are high, the competition fierce. But what does everyone really want to know? "Where's the party?" Even in a recession, the tradition of the opening-night party endures. It is a producer's way of thanking everyone from a show's investors to its ushers, and not incidentally, provides an excellent opportunity for extra press coverage on attending celebrities, anything from "Entertainment Tonight" to the local news.
Here they all are, from the economic to the glorious: "Five Guys Named Moe" will celebrate at the Supper Club, the new hot place for openings this season, where "Death and the Maiden" and "Crazy for You" had their soirees; "A Streetcar Named Desire" will have a traditional night at Sardi's; "Two Trains Running" is going to the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza; "Guys and Dolls" at Roseland with cheesecake (not Mindy's) for all; "Metro" to Tavern on the Green; "The High Rollers Social and Pleasure Club" at K-Paul's for a New Orleans blowout personally prepared by its chef, Paul Prudhomme, a longtime fan of the show's star, Allen Toussaint; "Shimada" to the Marriott Marquis in black tie as well as "Man of La Mancha," which will feature an all-Spanish menu, flamenco guitarists and dancers; "Jelly's Last Jam" in what promises to be the most theatrical of all: black tie at Roseland with black and white decor, Champagne fountains, cigarette and camera girls and a menu of oysters Rockefeller and chateaubriand; "A Small Family Business" at Laura Belle, featuring Lancaster Hot Pots, a British variation on shepherd's pie that is mentioned in the show. Finally, "Falsettos" caps the season in black tie at Tavern on the Green. Party on.
 
Plums for Long-Range Planners
 If you're the type to plan ahead, here are some dates to keep: Performances begin June 2 for Keith Reddin's "Innocent's Crusade," at Manhattan Theater Club, starring Deborah Monk, James Rebhorn and Welker White. Mark Brokaw directs the new play about a student applying to college who rebels against the system. . . . Hector Elizondo joins Eli Wallach in the Roundabout's production of Arthur Miller's "Price" on May 20, directed by John Tillinger. And if your date book is still empty for 1993, don't panic. Kelly McGillis will play the title role in Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" at the Roundabout from May 26 through July 18. The English director, Sarah Pia Anderson, will direct.
 
Not a Single Star? Don't Get Excited.
 On Wednesday evening, this is what the audience at "Death and the Maiden" heard on the loudspeaker: "May I have your attention, please? At this evening's performance, Glenn Close, Richard Dreyfuss and Gene Hackman will be unable to appear." After considerable groaning, the loudspeaker came back on. Ms. Close, Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Hackman spoke together. "April Fool's!"

National's Victory
While Christie's may have lost a prized picture, England has secured a national treasure. 
 After weeks of negotiations, the National Gallery in London has succeeded in buying Hans Holbein's "Lady With a Pet Squirrel and a Starling" from the Marquess of Cholmondeley for $17 million. The museum had had its eye on the 16th-century painting ever since Christie's announced six weeks ago that the Holbein would be the star work in its April 15 auction in London. At the time, Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, said that the painting was "one of the greatest of Holbein's works of this kind" and that "its retention in this country is therefore of great importance."
Lord Cholmondeley had been asking $25 million for the painting, and had maintained that the museum could not meet that price. Although he inherited a fortune estimated at more than $170 million in 1990, Lord Cholmondeley said his income was not enough to maintain his two estates, Cholmondeley in Cheshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk, where the painting has hung since 1780. He said the proceeds of the sale would be used to help pay for the rising costs of keeping these two stately homes.
Although the price was well beyond the museum's annual purchase grant from the Government, which has been frozen at $4.5 million for the last seven years, the National Gallery was determined to find the money. Six weeks of negotiations began between Jack Baer, managing director of Hazlitt Gooden & Fox, the London gallery, which represented the museum, and Christie's, which acted as agents for Lord Cholmondeley.
What is known in the auction business as a private treaty sale -- a negotiated transaction as opposed to a purchase made in a public sale room -- was enacted. After much maneuvering, a $17 million deal was arranged that satisfied both parties. Mr. Baer said that $5.1 million came from the National Heritage Fund, a special state fund; that $425,000 was donated by the National Art Collections Fund, and that the rest would be paid in three annual installments by the National Gallery.
Because of special tax incentives in England for selling to museums works of art that are considered national treasures, Lord Cholmondeley will get the $17 million tax-free. "If Lord Cholmondeley had sold the picture at auction he would have had to pay a 60 percent tax based on the hammer price," explained Mr. Baer. "The negotiations had quite a lot of complications, but in the end it was an elegant transaction. Lord Cholmondeley wanted to raise enough money to ensure the future of Houghton Hall."
In a telephone interview this week, Mr. MacGregor said he was surprised and happy that the negotiations had worked out. "This is a very important painting and there is not a single small Holbein portrait in an English collection," he added. "They've all gone abroad."
Charles Allsopp, chairman of Christie's in Europe, acknowledged that had the painting been sold at auction the house would probably have received a larger commission. "But you can never tell," he added. "At auction anything can happen and nothing can happen." Mr. Allsopp also admitted that, given all the adverse publicity the forthcoming auction has received, he realized it might have been a particularly difficult sale. "From the beginning of this saga we always knew it wasn't going to be easy," he said. "But now everyone is happy, and that's the end of the story."
 
Emergency Arts Fund
 In an effort to help Manhattan's nonprofit arts and cultural organizations, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, in collaboration with almost two dozen representatives of arts councils and arts service organizations in Manhattan, have formed the Special Arts Fund for Emergencies. The fund plans to be open for business on April 15 at the New York Foundation for the Arts, 5 Beekman Street in Manhattan.
"This is the art community's response to a serious need at a time when there's a particular sense of powerlessness," Ms. Messinger said. "Emergencies always exist, and especially in this bad economic climate." Ms. Messinger said that over the last few years arts establishments in Manhattan had lost about one-third of their public subsidies. The new fund will try to make up for at least part of this loss by providing a type of help that has not been available recently to arts organizations.
The fund will provide loans of up to $10,000 for what it considers emergencies -- fires, thefts, canceled tours, performers' illnesses -- that threaten the existence of an arts organization. The fund will be able to respond in as little as three days, depending on circumstances. In addition to addressing immediate problems, it will provide expert help in fields ranging from banking to real estate.
The initial funds that helped start the fund came from Ms. Messinger's office. Loan guarantees and technical-assistance subsidies are being provided by the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation and the Booth Ferris Foundation, two Manhattan-based organizations that have actively responded to crises in the arts.
To raise additional money for the fund, eight young Manhattan artists -- Candida Alvarez, Brett DePalma, Colin Loy Lee, Judith Linhares, Frank Moore, Lorna Simpson, Hunt Slonem and Robin Winters -- have each donated a print that will be on view tomorrow through April 11 at Brooke Alexander Editions, 476 Broome Street in SoHo. The collection has been organized by Tony Whitfield of the Manhattan Borough President's office, and Julie Sylvester, a print dealer. Prints may be purchased for $1,000 each or for $6,000 for the entire portfolio of eight.
 
A Collection Divided>
 Both the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art received gifts recently from the estate of Edith and Milton Lowenthal. Mr. Lowenthal, a lawyer, died in 1987, and Dr. Lowenthal, a psychologist, died last year. Between 1943 and 1958, they assembled an important collection of modern American paintings and sculpture of the 1930's and 40's. Thirty-one works have been left to the Brooklyn Museum and eight to the Metropolitan.
"For the Met, the donation is building strength on strength," said Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director. "We are strong in American paintings, and the addition of this gift perfectly complements our holdings." The Metropolitan received two works each by Stuart Davis, Marsden Hartley and Charles Sheeler and one by Arthur G. Dove and Max Weber. Three of them -- Hartley's "Mount Katahdin, Maine," and two Sheelers, a drawing, "Open Door," and a painting, "Americana" -- will be on view starting Tuesday in the Met's contemporary-art galleries.
The Brooklyn's gift is far more substantial: 31 works by such artists as Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Milton Avery, Georgia O'Keeffe and Davis, and 8 Hartleys. "The gift fills a substantial gap in our holdings," said Robert T. Buck, the museum's director. "We were spotty in American paintings."
Five paintings have been installed at the Brooklyn Museum this week: Avery's "Artist's Daughter by the Sea," Davis's "Landscape With Clay Pipe," O'Keeffe's "Ram's Head, White Hollyhock Hills," Hartley's "Gull" and Macdonald-Wright's "Synchromy." The entire collection will be hung in September.

Network Relief Fails to Get N.F.L. Support

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
It was a brief, shining moment, a tiny blip in time when the TV networks thought the National Football League would make their financial woes its own and grant much-needed financial relief.
So ABC, CBS and NBC looked toward a Dallas airport hotel on Wednesday, hoping for passage of N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's bold proposal: a $238 million reduction in 1993 payments and a two-year extension at the 1993 level. 
 The deal would ease the pain of the networks' projected $250 million loss for 1993. But all hope was crushed. Tagliabue counted too few owners' votes and compromised with a $28 million reduction in 1993 and no extension.
"It's disappointing," said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, "because Tagliabue and Art Modell" -- the owner of the Cleveland Browns -- "worked so hard to make it work. The consequence will be that we'll have these huge losses even if the economy grows 5 percent."
The league also cut one week from the planned 18-week 1992 schedule, noting that the networks didn't need to sell another week of commercial time.
Implicit in the relief plan was that by extending the deal for two years at the reduced 1993 level, the N.F.L. would be spared potentially far lower fees in 1994 and 1995 if a new deal was bid in a recession-transformed market.
Dennis Swanson, the president of ABC Sports, said: "Maybe it's a mixed blessing that we didn't get the extension. It was not a great deal. Maybe we're better off negotiating a deal we really like."
Ebersol would have loved to have locked in lower fees through 1995. "Unless they accept a bid from us that assures we will be risk free," he said, NBC may be out of the N.F.L. business.
The league will try to pitch the relief plan again in October.
Val Pinchbeck, the N.F.L.'s broadcasting director, looked for a silver lining in the $28 million sliver of relief, saying: "At least the networks know we did something and went to bat for them in a difficult circumstance."
 
Talk About Not Talking
 The New York Mets' balking at talking to the media is as sad as it would be if Al Sharpton clammed up or if A.T.&T. cut off Jerry Brown's 800-number. The team's moments of silence mean we will be sadly without all cliches and stock answers to: "How do you feel about ---------- ?" and "What pitch did you throw to ---------- ?"
The Mets' discourse does not approach "Masterpiece Theatre."
"They don't want to talk to me," said Bob Page of the MSG Network.
"I'm not talking to them." said Len Berman of WNBC, Channel 4. "What will we do without sound bites? More time for bowling highlights."
The overlapping of sports at this time of year, especially, makes losing the Mets' verbiage easy to accommodate. The absence of MetTalk simplifies life for the TV sports anchors, who have about 3 minutes 15 seconds on the air. With highlights and the police blotter, there is nary 10 seconds for a player comment. Now there is no compulsion to plug in bon mots from Eddie Murray.
"If they don't talk, we'll just go to the manager," said Berman. "We'll talk to the other teams. We'll get more John Kruk. We've backed off on using sound bites, except for big and controversial games."
The possibility of not getting personal comments from players who have done something extraordinary rankles Russ Salzburg of WWOR, Channel 9. "What if Doc Gooden pitches a no-hitter or a shutout or his arm pops out?" he asked.
Perhaps the biggest TV losers from the Mets' silence are the WWOR and SportsChannel post-game shows. "If you watch a post-game show, you want to see the players," said Fran Healy, a SportsChannel announcer.
The muting of the Mets has created a new star: Jay Horwitz, the team's public relations chief. He has substituted for players as a guest with Healy and with Ralph Kiner on WWOR's "Kiner's Korner." He was not bad. To a caller who asked him on Healy's show what he does, he said: "I'm the janitor."
Horwitz has been bobbing around in the background for many years with the Mets, almost anonymous to viewers. But now he's prime-time. Except for Manager Jeff Torborg, who's still talking, Horwitz is all the media's got.
"I'd rather hear what Jay has to say than Doc Gooden," said Page.
Letting Horwitz respond as if he were Bobby Bonilla or Howard Johnson could make for amusing TV. Give Jay a uniform and let him be EveryMet.
"But how many Jay Horwitz interviews can you see?" asked Salzburg.
Many, I hope. I want to hear about his repaired rotator cuff.
 
That Other Final Four
 When CBS hawks March Madness, it means the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament. But during the women's Final Four semifinals (tomorrow at 12:30 P.M.), and final (Sunday at 4 P.M.), we get to see their below-the-rim game.
Ann Meyers, the CBS analyst, said: "I like the way Western Kentucky and Southwest Missouri play defense, and rebounding in their game will be a key. Virginia's been No. 1 most of the season and Stanford 3, 4 or 5. There'll be a lot of scoring."
She added: "If people know the personnel, they'll know it's a fun sport. The men are tremendous, but sometimes they get away from fundamentals. The women don't dunk, so they have to think a little more."

Suddenly, and with just a few days left to go, the central question of the New York Democratic primary has been turned right around.
The question is no longer whether Bill Clinton will prove himself smart enough for New York Democrats. It is whether they will show themselves smart enough, mature and sophisticated enough to listen to the man. 
 And I mean listen, not just sit there so twitching with gotcha that they do not take in what he is saying. Until now New York -- media and public -- has seemed less an audience than a giant bowl of malevolent jelly quivering with eagerness to swallow him up.
That's an old New York game -- come right on in and make it here, try. But it is getting close to decision day and as those times approach, New Yorkers can put aside games and fright masks and grow up fast.
If they actually listen to Governor Clinton, they may find out that he is telling them he wants the same kind of America that New York Democrats have gone around for decades saying they wanted.
Of course, yes -- there is a long way between saying and doing. Right. But Americans can either rule out every candidate who has never been put to the test as President or Vice President or pick one who has a concept of American purpose that they share, and seems ready to put his life where his mouth is.
At the Hilton Hotel Wednesday, Mr. Clinton did what no other Democratic candidate did and what President Bush seems not to know how to do. He drew the essential connecting lines between the two bedrock purposes of American government: to work for an economy strong enough to give Americans a decent, safe life at home, and to work for political freedom and democracy abroad.
Without the first, Americans must live in fear for their jobs. Without the second, they will have neither the markets, peace or lasting international stability needed for the American economy to grow.
It's a simple reality -- the powerful political conjunction between pragmatism and idealism that can be called American democratic realism. With it, we can fulfill our own hopes and help light the world. Without it, this country will become just real estate from sea to shining sea.
The favorite Democrats of New Yorkers all knew it -- F.D.R., Truman, Kennedy, Scoop Jackson, the Wagners, father and son, A. Philip Randolph, Herbert Lehman, Hubert Humphrey, Mayors Edward Koch and Fiorello La Guardia; that type of Democrat. And there is no place where that simple reality is more important than in New York.
Our New York depends on the world for its trade. It depends on political freedom for the creativity of art and commerce at home and abroad, which is its bread and soul.
But Americans have been forgetting the connection between those two bedrock American purposes, and the importance of working toward them, not just prattling about them.
So it's taken this man from Arkansas to remind New Yorkers what the election is all about. Why not? New Yorkers love political freedom, but we did not invent it.
But now we are told by a bunch of party and union "leaders" that the smart thing to do is to vote for Jerry Brown just to stick the knife into Bill Clinton. Then these party and union statesmen could get together at the convention and find the Democratic candidate for us, even though most of them do not have enough brains to find their way out of the subway.
But, great leaders, don't you see? Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton have had the courage, strength and imagination to run, three important Presidential qualities none of the fence-sitters showed while collecting splinters.
New Yorkers should vote for Bill Clinton if they agree with what he is saying and believes about the connected American purposes. They should vote for Jerry Brown if they really think he would be a better President than Bill Clinton and also want Jesse Jackson as Vice President.
At least it would be interesting to hear Mr. Brown trying to dampen some of Mr. Jackson's vivid views, or to see Mr. Jackson keep a straight silent face while the band plays "Hail to the Chief" to his new commander.
But what's that, great leaders? You still think we should be patsy enough to hand over our voting power to you party and union bosses?
Buzz off.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Clinton: Running Against the Press

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT


GRAPHIC: SCRIPT: "He's stood up to the tabloids, the false attacks, told the truth and shown real character. Bill Clinton.
Chart: "Clinton: Running Against the Press"
 "A lifetime of commitment to fighting for people. Re-elected five times by the people who know him best. Voted most effective by his fellow Governors, Democrat and Republican. A Rhodes scholar, educated at Georgetown and Yale Law School. His state is recognized as a leader in education reform and economic development. Creating manufacturing jobs at 10 times the national rate. A record of achievement unmatched in the last decade.
"Bill Clinton, fighting for the forgotten middle class. He'll put people first."
 
 ON THE SCREEN: Footage of Mr. Clinton at a rally, then with his wife and daughter. Young Bill Clinton as a student, with President John F. Kennedy at Boys' Nation. Mr. Clinton with students, then with workers.
 
 ACCURACY: The claims are accurate though incomplete. Arkansas's growth in manufacturing jobs did outpace the nation's by 10.2 percent to 0.9 percent, but during a relatively brief period, 1985-89. During the 1980's, a time that more closely approximates Mr. Clinton's tenure, the figures for all jobs, including manufacturing, were 25 percent in Arkansas and 18 percent nationwide.
 Arkansas has introduced a number of educational innovations at Mr. Clinton's urging, but the record of educational achievement is mixed at best. Arkansas's schools were ranked among the worst in the nation when Mr. Clinton took office 12 years ago, and by most measures they remain in that position today.
 
 SCORECARD: Increasingly, Mr. Clinton seems to be trying to run against the press, a tactic that could be effective given what polls show to be the unpopularity of the media. The ad has a generally positive tone and represents an effort to give voters a reason to vote for Mr. Clinton rather than against his opponent. But the many claims in the ad seem too diffuse to give viewers a clear impression of the Governor.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Calls Announcement Of Aid to Russia 'Premature'

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 3

 BODY:
Showing some irritation toward Washington, Japanese officials said today that it was "inappropriate" and "premature" for President Bush to announce a $24 billion aid package for Russia without having worked out details with Japan.
Several officials who insisted on anonymity said they assumed that Mr. Bush had rushed into the announcement this week because of pressure from critics, including former President Richard M. Nixon and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other officials said Japan was prepared to join international efforts to stabilize Russia's currency and help it meet its balance-of-payments deficit. But in a careful qualification, officials also said Japan was not yet prepared to do more.
 
Trans-Pacific Confusion
 "As far as our Government knows, there has been no agreement on this package," said a policy maker involved in aid to Russia, referring to the package announced by Mr. Bush and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Wednesday. "These figures are extremely new to us. It was inappropriate to announce them."
Mr. Miyazawa told reporters that Japan "will of course cooperate" with the effort by the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the ruble, an effort estimated as representing $6 billion of the package. Press reports here say Japan's portion of this may be about $1 billion.
But there was confusion in Tokyo on exactly what else Mr. Bush's package entailed, mirroring what appeared to be confusion and contradictions in Washington. Officials said they did not know what in the announcement was new, and what was a restatement of previous commitments of aid.
An official also said that there was concern about too much being announced on rescheduling Russian debts before Moscow had a chance to show it was prepared for austerity programs.
It was also not clear whether the Bush-Kohl package includes the $2.5 billion in export credits and insurance announced by Tokyo last year -- none of which has been disbursed because arrangements are being negotiated.
In any case, officials here said Tokyo could not consider increasing that $2.5 billion until there was greater progress on resolving a territorial dispute with Moscow.
 
Dispute Over Seized Islands
 Among the major industrialized nations, Japan has always been the most cautious in its attitude toward aid to Russia because of the longstanding dispute over a group of islands north of the Japanese archipelago that were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of world war II.
The dispute has long obstructed conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union after World War II, and it is holding up a peace treaty with Russia at present.
Indeed, many Japanese officials fear that Boris N. Yeltsin and other Russian leaders may be even less flexible about turning over the Kurile islands than their predecessors. Mr. Yeltsin is to visit Japan in September, and talks in preparation for his visit have not resulted in any progress on the dispute.
According to reports in Washington, the $24 billion figure announced by Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl included perhaps $11 billion in new cash outlays, which Japanese officials reject if the plan involves aid going directly from Japan to Russia, rather than passing through a multilateral agency.
 
Domestic Obstacles
 A senior official said Japan would take a "two-track approach," supporting the I.M.F. and other balance-of-payment efforts, but not promising assistance directly from Japan.
Just as Americans are questioning the value of aiding Russia at a time of a deep recession at home, various officials here said it was politically impossible to make huge outlays for Russia without resolving the territorial matter or convincing Japanese that the money would not be wasted.
A Foreign Ministry official said earlier this week that he did not agree with Mr. Nixon's analysis that the West was in danger of "losing Russia" for lack of aid.
"The basic problem is not economics," but one of political disintegration, he said of Russia. "Massive economic assistance will not change the chaotic situation," he said, adding that "the Russian people should do their best" to solve their own problems.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Republics Qualify for Program
 WASHINGTON, April 3 (AP) -- President Bush certified today that Russia and the former Soviet republics of Armenia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan had adopted policies of free emigration, making them eligible for United States credit guarantee programs.
The certification moves the states closer to winning most-favored-nation trade status, which allows countries to deal with the United States under the lowest tariffs possible.
The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act stipulates that countries that impede free emigration are ineligible for favorable trade treatment. Mr. Bush waived the amendment for the Soviet Union in return for a sharp improvement in its emigration record, but the breakup of the country requires that each of the new states be judged on their own.
The United States Export-Import Bank is also working on $2 billion worth of requests from American businesses for help in selling their products to Russia.

HEADLINE: As Italy Nears Vote, Rare Anxiety About Results

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, April 3

 BODY:
As Italians reflect on their nation's destiny two days ahead of major elections and in advance of Europe's move to integration, they do so with a heightened sense of uncertainty.
By European Community accounting, Italy is the world's fifth biggest industrialized economy behind the United States, Japan, Germany and France -- a statistic that illustrates the nation's postwar transformation from ruin to riches. Yet as the land votes Sunday and Monday in an election that will decide whether the Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti maintain the dominance they have held for four decades, Italians are weighing their choices with unprecedented national soul searching and introspection. 
 For the first time in the memories of most voters, the outcome of the vote is uncertain, and after its headlong gallop to wealth and status, the nation seems to have paused, unsure of where it is being led.
"This is a true crisis, a crisis of identity, of credibility," said Giorgio Bocca, a leading political commentator here, alluding to woes that embrace a political system adrift and under challenge, an economy plagued by home-grown debt and official corruption spreading along with the organized crime of the Mafia and its allies.
 
Many Splinter Parties
 The unease is playing itself out electorally in a wider than usual array of often locally based splinter parties committed to single issues. Among the 54 parties hoping to take advantage of a system of proportional representation are new groups from the wealthier north that have tapped into resentment of northerners who feel their taxes are wasted by being spent on a crime-ridden and corrupt south. Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lombardy League, is widely thought to become a focus of dissent if he wins a seat, as is expected.
The extensive list of candidates -- including contenders like porn star Moanna Pozzi and Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of the Fascist dictator -- poses a challenge to the governing four-party coalition dominated by the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. If the coalition does not win more than 51 percent of the votes cast Sunday and Monday, it will not be able to form a new government.
There is no doubt that the Christian Democrats will still control the single largest bloc after the vote, retaining as they do their strong support in the south and the backing of the Roman Catholic Church. What is less certain is whether they will be able to reconstruct the coalition since their chief allies, the Socialists, appear to be seriously weakened by scandals involving charges of misappriation of funds.
In the last election in 1987, the Christian Democrats won 34 percent of the vote and the Socialists just over 14 percent. Together with votes for the smaller partners in the colation, the Liberals and the Social Democrats, that gave the alliance 57.4 percent of the vote.
But even if the coalition survives, the expected presence of a far more vocal opposition galvanizing around critics like Mr. Bossi will press it to take unpopular economic measures that could threaten its survival.
"There probably won't be an electoral earthquake," said Milan's Socialist Party boss, Vittorio Craxi. "But there's a climate of catastrophe. It does exist."
While as is normal in Italian politics few clear issues have surfaced among the broad slogans and vague promises of change, there are many analysts who say the vote for a new Parliament is likely to be far less of ritualistic exercise than most elections since 1948, when frail coalitions formed around the same core of Christian Democrats and their allies.
Underlying the electoral anxieties are broader concerns dealing with the rigors of European integration. In an election eve interview, Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis contended that these processes were confronting Italy's 57 million people and their sense of national identity with the most momentous challenge since the nation opted to anchor itself in the Western world by rejecting Communism at the polls in 1948.
"It is Europe or nothing," Mr. De Michelis said, adding that the economic regulations around which Europe is being organized demand far tighter economic controls than Italy is used to.
The European Community's charter for integration, he said, "lays down new rules in every sector of human life." He continued, "Typical Italian behavior tries to break the rules."
This is a country whose regions maintain their own sense of history and identity. The north evokes images of suits and cellular phones, automobile and riches in a region, and the architecture recalls the Austro-Hungarian Empire to which part of it belonged. In the south, the cellular phones are confined to the mob and the politicians, and central Government and European Community subsidies have sunk without a bubble in a quagmire of graft in the lands the Bourbons once ran.
"Equity is not the rule," said Prof. Paolo Leon, a left-leaning economic analyst in Rome.
And as those social and economic strains have widened, unchecked in the 1990's by the end of global political constraints, the economist continued in an interview, "the difficulty of unifying these things makes for a fracturing of the political parties."
 
Unwritten Compacts Fading
 For many years, most Italians say, their country has been run by a strange compact between the semi-governing and semi-governed: The government looked the other way, while people bent the rules to pursue their own interests. While governments remained inherently weak, political parties drew strength from various sources -- ideology, pork-barrel and the Roman Catholic Church, some of whose prelates still insist that their followers vote for the Christian Democrats.
But those unwritten compacts are breaking down.
Public services are collapsing. People die untended in hospital corridors. Public transport is an overcrowded chaos. The phones are often erratic.
"People are concerned that they are contributing more to the state than the state is giving them," Professor Leon said.
The sense of "public disillusion," Mr. De Michelis argued, relates far more to the changing world around Italy than to Italy's own problems after the end of the cold war.
 
Ideological Barriers Fall
 Indeed, the Communist ideology had deeper emotive and social roots here than in any other West European country, just as Italy's Fascism was second only to Germany's, building a revulsion to centralized power. Now, Professor Leon said, "the ideological barricades are down."
"There are no longer any dikes to be built, anti-Communist, anti-Fascist," he added.
Mr. De Michelis, in an interview Thursday at a luxury retreat near Venice, said: "In Italy, Communism, anti-Communism was a powerful element of order. But now Communism, anti-Communism has gone. So people express their real feelings, and there's a confused desire for change."
Yet the fiscal mess seems peculiarly home-grown. A huge public debt has built partly on financing ambitious, vote-catching pension schemes and other social benefits.
Now repayment of the debt consumes substantial chunks of state money, crippling the system. Many retirees have to wait years before the state begins to pay out their pensions. And the level of public deficit -- on a per capita basis twice the size of that in the United States -- has somber overtones beyond Italy's borders because, unless it is corrected, it will disqualify Rome from joining the leading European powers as they advance toward economic and monetary union.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Proposals;
Brown's Tax Plan Seen As Attack on Status Quo

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
In recent weeks one of New York's Senators in Washington, the Mayor and Finance Commissioner of New York City and a host of economists of all persuasions have joined Gov. Bill Clinton in dismissing Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s tax proposals as a sop to the rich, a crushing blow to the poor and profoundly anti-New York.
So why are so many Brown supporters in New York unfazed by their candidate's plan for a 13 percent flat tax on all income and a 13 percent value-added tax on goods? They could, after all, lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes from their Federal tax burden, the largest and most commonly claimed deduction in the state. And they could end up paying a 13 percent national sales tax on top of the 8.25 percent in state and city sales taxes. 
 The response that many give is that while they may not like, or even understand, all the details of Mr. Brown's tax plan, as long those proposals are part of a more general sweeping-aside of the status quo, they do not much care.
Some seem to be so captivated by the simplicity of the former California Governor's proposals that they have not thought through the implications for their own pocketbooks.
 
Expecting Some Modifications
 "Deductions for state and local taxes?" said Denise Fitzgerald, a Brown volunteer, with a queasiness that conveyed her lack of familiarity with such an option. "I haven't thought that through thoroughly."
Others acknowledge having some concerns, but are convinced that before Mr. Brown's proposals went any further they would be modified to protect those at the bottom of the income scale. And indeed, in recent days, Mr. Brown has indicated as much, conceding that the plan is still very much in flux.
Still other Brown supporters say that although they might end up paying more taxes under the plan, that would be a price worth paying if the result was a President whose ideas on the environment, health care and schools are closer to their own.
Underlying many Brown supporters' explanations of their support for the tax proposals is the sense that what exists now is not working, that they are paying an unfair share of taxes while big corporations and wealthy people get away with murder by hiring sharp-eyed accountants who know how to exploit loopholes.
That view is echoed at the national level. A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted from March 26 to 29 found that 39 percent of the 1,638 people interviewed across the country said the current tax system was quite fair or reasonably fair, while 59 percent considered it somewhat or quite unfair. The poll had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points.
"It's a game now," said Brendan Meade, an economist who wandered into Mr. Brown's mid-Manhattan headquarters this week to lend a hand. "It's a tax-dodge industry, and that's a total waste of economic resources."
Mr. Meade said what he liked about Mr. Brown's plan was that it would put everyone on an equal footing and eliminate the need to pay accountants large sums of money at tax time. As for losing deductions, he said he was not eligible for many of them anyway.
Frank Carr, a Brown supporter who has been unemployed since January and previously made $18,000 a year, said he was not bothered that lowering the top rate on wealthy taxpayers from 31 percent to 13 percent might let them off the hook. "The rich are already off the hook," he said. "What hook?"
As for the 13 percent value-added tax, Mr. Carr rejected the conclusion of most economists that it would end up as a sales tax on retail goods. To the extent that companies could pass that tax along to consumers, he said, they are already doing so now with the corporate income tax they pay.
New York residents who stand to lose the most from Mr. Brown's proposals are those with the lowest incomes, many economists say.
Officials at the city's Department of Finance say about 1.2 million state residents pay no Federal income tax because their income falls below the value of their exemptions and deductions -- about $15,000 for a family of four. About 500,000 of those have actually been getting checks back from the Government in earned income credit, which amounts to about $1,200 for families with more than one child.
All of those breaks would be wiped out under the current Brown proposal.
The accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company conducted an analysis for The New York Times of what would happen to seven different New York City taxpayers at various income levels. It found that whether it was a home-owning family of four with an income of $50,000, or a single wage-earner making $80,000 who either rents or owns, or a family with an income of $250,000, everyone would end up paying less in Federal taxes under Mr. Brown's proposal than they do now.
But when the accounting firm analyzed those with incomes of $15,000, it concluded that a single parent with two children paying rent of $450 a month would end up paying more in Federal taxes. When rough estimates for the value-added tax were factored in, Mr. Brown's tax plan became even more biased against those with lower incomes, the firm said.
Gary Davidson is one low-income New Yorker who said he believed he would probably pay more under Mr. Brown's tax plan. But he said he intended to vote for Mr. Brown anyway. A freelance photographer who earned less than $10,000 last year, Mr. Davidson said having a President who redirects a large part of the military budget to domestic programs would ultimately improve his quality of life far more than the financial benefit he would enjoy if the current tax system were maintained.
"The money from one bomber could rebuild a borough," said Mr. Davidson, who lives in the rough-edged East New York section of Brooklyn. He said he volunteered to help the Brown campaign to change the system. "After 12 years of yelling at my TV, it feels great to finally be doing something," he said.

HEADLINE: Momentum Is Building for Afghanistan Peace Plan

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 3

 BODY:
A peace plan for Afghanistan has suddenly gained momentum, with United Nations officials predicting that President Najibullah could relinquish his office within the next two weeks.
With food supplies in Kabul, the Afghan capital, all but exhausted, restlessness increasing among dissident Government militia leaders and the patience of neighboring countries wearing thin, the United Nations official charged with finding a route to peace says he expects a cease-fire and a new interim government in Kabul by the end of the month. 
 "We believe peace is at hand," Benon Sevan, the personal representative of the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said in Pakistan on Thursday. "We're on the right track and moving fast, faster than expected. With help, we shall be able to resolve the Afghan conflict now -- this month, not next."
 
The Key Concession
 Last month Mr. Naijbullah announced that he was willing to step down as President, meeting a key demand of the Muslim fundamentalist guerrilla factions that have been fighting Afghanistan's Marxist Government for 13 years. Although Mr. Najibullah left the timing of his resignation vague, the concession opened the way for Mr. Sevan to outline plans for a peaceful transition to free elections.
The United Nations plan called for convening a series of meetings of representatives from across Afghanistan's political and ethnic spectrum, with the notable exception of "prominent personalities" like Mr. Najibullah and the mujahedeen leaders.
The goal of the meetings was to create an interim government by June that would organize national elections.
But a rebellion by Tajik ethnic militia forces in the north and critical food shortages in Kabul have prompted Mr. Sevan to speed up his original timetable, United Nations officials in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, said today.
"Nobody wants a collapse in Kabul," a United Nations official familiar with Mr. Sevan's discussions said. "Everybody realizes that Kabul is up to its eyeballs in difficulties."
The 13-year war between the Government and the fundamentalist guerrillas known as the mujahedeen has left at least two million Afghans dead and another six million in refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran.
Always a poor country, Afghanistan has reached the point where its economy no longer functions. With the countryside littered with millions of mines, even rudimentary agriculture is a risky business.
Three years have passed since the departure of Soviet forces, which intervened in late 1979. The United States, which had armed and supported the mujahedeen, reached an agreement with the Soviet Union last September to cut off military supplies to both sides by the end of the year.
But the turning point came in January, when Pakistan reversed its position after 13 years of supplying the mujahedeen with weapons and military advice and declared its support for Mr. Sevan's peace proposals. Suddenly deprived of their principal backer, the mujahedeen were compelled to take the United Nations peace proposals seriously.
Under his accelerated timetable, Mr. Sevan is now calling for a single conference of as many as 500 Afghan representatives in Geneva or Vienna by the end of the month. In the meantime, a small group of 12 to 15 Afghans regarded as "neutral" is to travel to Kabul and establish itself as an interim government. Mr. Sevan is hoping that the group will be in Kabul within two weeks, United Nations officials said.
"There is a sense of optimism," one official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "It has to happen soon, probably within two weeks."
Chris Bowers, a BBC correspondent in Kabul, reported today that Mr. Najibullah appeared "confident, relaxed, almost relieved," that the peace process was well under way, even though it means giving up the office he has held since late 1987.
The breakthrough has also heartened Mr. Sevan, who has been shuttling for several years from Islamabad and Kabul to Peshawar, the Pakistani city where many Afghan rebel leaders are based, and to Teheran, which supports guerrillas in Afghanistan's west.
 
Big Problems Remain
 But the intense pace of negotiations has not diminished Mr. Sevan's appreciation of the enormous difficulties his plan still faces, officials familiar with his diplomatic activity said. Foremost among the concerns of the United Nations is how to protect the members of the interim government, and guarantee their authority.
Also undecided is how a cease-fire will be declared and enforced. With United Nations peacekeeping efforts already taxed to the limit in a disintegrating Yugoslavia and in Cambodia, there is little expectation in Islamabad, the site of Mr. Sevan's main office, that the world organization is prepared to commit itself to another vast peacekeeping effort.
In the next week or so, Mr. Sevan is to meet with Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who is expected to announce an Afghan peace conference and the appointment of an interim government.
Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani journalist who has covered the war from the beginning, said the problems confronting the United Nations peace effort were formidable.
"Things are moving very fast now," Mr. Rashid said. "But anything can happen in Kabul at any moment. There are massive food shortages. There's a danger of food riots. Mazar-i-Sharif in the north is controlled by rebel militias now. The militias are a third force now, and nobody knows which way they will go. And today, five rockets landed in Kabul. It's now or never."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Clinton Relies on Voluntary Guidelines to Protect Environment in Arkansas

SERIES: Clinton as Governor: 12 Years at Arkansas's Helm -- Last of five articles.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERRYVILLE, Ark., April 3

 BODY:
The Kings River tumbles clear and cold out of northwest Arkansas and flows past forest and pasture land that is home to one of the largest concentrations of farm animals in the world. By the time it reaches Table Rock Lake in Missouri, the stream picks up enough fecal bacteria to make it unfit for swimming. It also accumulates nitrogen and other nutrients that spatter its coves and banks with dark green ooze while smothering the stream bed with chocolate-brown algae.
To Gov. Bill Clinton's supporters, the Kings River, untouched by development, and the state's other bountiful natural resources are evidence of an approach to environmental issues that effectively balances economic goals with the protection of Arkansas's land and water. 
 But to Mr. Clinton's environmental critics, the slime that is slowly engulfing some streams in the state is a result of a hands-off approach to conservation that is sacrificing the state's natural gifts to powerful industrial interests.
Two years ago, when the fecal contamination, odors and unsightly slime caused a public outcry, Mr. Clinton reacted with measures that have become typical of his stewardship of Arkansas's natural resources: He appointed a 27-member committee, made up largely of industry executives and state agency heads, to study the problem. The committee was asked to recommend ways that farmers could be encouraged to change their waste disposal practices voluntarily, obviating the need for stringent regulations. It plans to complete its work in September.
Even environmentalists agree that Mr. Clinton has established himself as a staunch preservationist. During his time in office the state has purchased hundreds of acres of wilderness and streams for preservation.
Mr. Clinton also has a strong record of issuing stiff fines against people who violate rules on hazardous waste disposal. And because Arkansas is so sparsely populated, even with some serious problems the state still has some of the nation's cleanest air and water.
But in his 12 years as Arkansas's chief executive, Mr. Clinton has usually dealt with the problems that do arise -- particularly the environmental threats posed by industry -- not by proposing new rules but through voluntary guidelines and tax incentives intended to encourage businesses to change their polluting ways. Environmental leaders complain that the voluntary programs have delayed solutions, allowing the problems to grow bigger and even more expensive to solve.
 
Guidelines on Clear- Cutting
 That was the case in 1980, when Mr. Clinton set up voluntary rules to protect the state's bountiful forests from destructive clear-cutting, while also trying to protect streams that course through those forests. Clear-cutting can cause damage to waterways, too. So the state's guidelines suggested how close to these streams loggers were allowed to cut, while also setting out voluntary criteria for building roads in the timberlands and offering guidance for using defoliants and other chemicals in the forests.
Executives of Arkansas's $3 billion paper and forest products industry, one of the state's largest manufacturing sectors, warmly endorsed the Governor's tact.
"This approach recognizes the economic importance of forestry in Arkansas," Chris Barneycastle, executive vice president of the Arkansas Forestry Association, said in an interview.
But the state's environmental groups take a different view. They say the voluntary guidelines are routinely ignored on thousands of acres. Miles of streams have been destroyed by silt, they say, or scoured to their bedrock by the heavy flows that follow big storms. The reason, they say, is that timber companies have cut all the trees that normally would absorb the moisture.
Environmental groups also charge that defoliants are used so heavily in some areas that the character of the forests is changing. What had been diverse mixed hardwood and pine forests now hold a single variety of recently planted loblolly pines, the kind favored by paper companies.
"I stomp around the woods across this state, and it's just sad to see how the land is being abused," said Tom McKinney, administrative director of the EcoCenter, an environmental education group in West Fork. "The watersheds are degraded. The top soil is washing off. Wildlife is disappearing. The voluntary rules aren't working."
But State Forester Edwin E. Wadell disagrees, saying the environmentalists' varied claims are exaggerated.
"The program is working very well, as evidenced by the results of our continuous monitoring program," he said.
In 1985 Mr. Clinton also tried the same voluntary approach to prevent farmers and some industrial plants from depleting valuable supplies of underground water in the Delta region in southeastern Arkansas. The Delta is the center of Arkansas's crop-growing industry -- an industry that brings in $1.6 billion a year from rice, cotton, soybeans and other crops -- and farmers were drawing water from the aquifer 20 percent faster than it was being replenished.
The Governor and officials of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission developed a program of voluntary rules, coupled with tax credits, to reduce consumption and encourage farmers to build rainwater storage facilities. But J. Randy Young, the commission's executive director, says the program has not worked.
"We have not achieved the level of reduction that it will take to reach a balance between withdrawal and recharge," meaning replenishment of the water, Mr. Young said.
Last year, as a result, Mr. Clinton changed course and proposed a new program of regulations that would be enforced with fines and other penalties. The state government is still working on this proposal.
 
What Approach?
Clinton's Policies Resemble Bush's
 Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledge that in many ways, the Governor's approach to environmental problems resembles the policies developed and promoted by President Bush's chief environmental advisers, especially William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Kenneth L. Smith, Mr. Clinton's special assistant for natural and cultural resources, said Mr. Clinton admires Mr. Reilly. "The Governor likes a lot of the work Bill Reilly has done," Mr. Smith said in an interview.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush have quite a lot in common on environmental matters. Both men favor building coalitions with industry to establish pollution control programs; both generally take a skeptical view of critical assertions from environmental groups.
At the same time, though, both men have made efforts to preserve some areas of unspoiled land. Since 1979, when Mr. Clinton established Arkansas's first land bank, the state has spent more than $10 million to purchase land for new parks and wildlife refuges. The purchases include hundreds of acres of hardwood forests, many miles of wild streams and rivers, 500 acres of unturned prairie east of Fort Smith, and a cave west of Fayetteville that is home to the endangered Ozark cavefish and gray bats.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush also have been given credit for enforcing hazardous waste laws, even while often relying on voluntary compliance rules for other environmental problems.
In Mr. Clinton's first term, which started in 1979, the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology did not have authority to fine violators. But in 1983 Mr. Clinton sponsored a law to give the agency power to penalize polluters. By 1991 Arkansas was collecting almost $1 million in fines each year, most of it for infractions of the hazardous waste law -- 10 times the amount collected in 1985.
 
Does It Work?
Officials Differ On the Results
 Mr. Smith, the Governor's special assistant for environmental matters, is just one of many state environmental officials who say Mr. Clinton's voluntary approach works. But he acknowledges that, with 2.35 million people in a state 10 percent larger in area than New York, the challenges here are fewer. Arkansas remains a thinly settled region of green forests, clean streams and clear air.
Most of the state's large manufacturing plants were established after Federal pollution control laws went into effect. So Arkansas is one of a handful of states that meet all Federal air quality standards. About 82 percent of the state's rivers and streams are clean enough for fishing and swimming, one of the highest percentages in the country, Federal figures show.
Business executives here say Mr. Clinton's environmental policies have done nothing to mar Arkansas' slogan as "the Natural State."
"Bill Clinton has been given a bum rap on the environment by those people running against him and those who oppose him here," said Charles D. Martin, executive director of the Arkansas Federation of Water and Air Users, which represents 300 of the state's largest companies on environmental issues.
But Mr. Clinton's opponents in the Democratic primaries and caucuses and some conservation leaders say the Governor's hands-off policies for the biggest and most influential industries have not worked in Arkansas, and will not work if he is elected President.
Barry Haas, a former president of the Audubon Society of Central Arkansas who is an animal-feed dealer in West Little Rock, said of Mr. Clinton: "Everything he has done was based on political pressure. He reacts rather than acts. It's unfortunate because we wait for a fire to burn out of control rather than to snuff it out at its source."
 
Cleaner Water?
Runoff From Farms Poses Problems
 The animal waste pollution, particularly around Fayetteville in northwestern Arkansas, may be a case in point. The national Clean Water Act exempts farmers from Federal regulation, so that leaves the problem up to the states. And even with its voluntary controls, Arkansas is one of a few states, along with Florida, Virginia and Delaware, that have an organized program to control runoff from farms.
Each year Arkansas farmers raise roughly one billion chickens, hogs, turkeys, cows and steers, making this state's $2.7 billion animal agriculture industry the nation's eighth largest. But all those animals produce as much organic waste as 40 million people, and state studies show that the traditional practice of spreading the manure and chicken "litter," as it is called, on fields and pastures has allowed fecal bacteria, nitrates and phosphates to wash into streams, lakes and countless wells.
Since 1983 the state has required its hog producers to get permits and follow modest rules for storing and spreading liquid wastes. And since 1989 technical experts from the state and the food companies have been sent into the field to teach thousands of chicken farmers how to apply manure so that it minimizes runoff that could foul streams or pollute underground water.
Randall Mathis, who directs the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology, said environmentalists are exaggerating the contamination problems. Nitrate levels, he says, range from 2 to 6 parts per million in streams that have been tested -- less than the 10 parts per million that makes the water unsafe for drinking, according to Federal guidelines.
Mr. Mathis acknowledges that the fecal coliform levels do occasionally exceed the 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water that make streams unfit to swim in. Still, he said: "It has not had the impact at this point that everybody is afraid of. We're well ahead of the game."
 
Bacteria in Some Springs
 Some fishermen and residents of affected areas disagree. They say the damage from nitrate pollution is already apparent in streams throughout northwest Arkansas. State water quality reports support that claim; they show that virtually every tributary and major river in the area is marred by bacteria.
A tour of northwestern Arkansas this week demonstrated that even some springs are so contaminated with bacteria that residents no longer feel safe drinking the water. Rivers that teemed with small-mouth bass and other game fish just a few years ago now support only red-horse suckers, a species that feeds on algae that proliferates in the region.
Janet Avenoso, who bought 80 acres along the Kings River 10 years ago because she wanted to live along a pristine wilderness stream, said: "I never had any hesitation about swimming in it before. And now it's plain that it isn't as clean as it was. You look at the banks and the bottom of this river now, and it's covered with scum."
The state's own data show that nitrate levels in the Kings River and other tributaries have increased 50 percent since the 1950's, when the animal agriculture industry in Arkansas was very small. In addition, levels of bacteria in the water have increased sharply, the data show.
And David Mott, a hydrologist for the National Park Service in Harrison, Ark., says the problems are likely to get worse.
"The problem is that in these clear, warm, flowing streams in this warm and humid climate, we have the perfect conditions for algae growth," he said. "We're seeing the effects of putting six tons of manure on pastures when three tons is the maximum amount that should be put down. State studies say the poultry and hog industries are going to double in the next 10 years."
 
Data on Impaired Streams
 Still, farm industry leaders say the voluntary controls can work.
"If the best management practices are utilized, the potential threat to excess nutrients will be greatly diminished," said Archie Schaffer 3d, a spokesman for Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer and processor, in Springdale, Ark.
But environmental leaders in the northwestern part of the state point to the most recent state data showing that 450 miles of streams, most of them between Fayetteville and Harrison, continue to be impaired by fecal bacteria.
Mr. Young, the executive director of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission, says it is too early to tell whether the voluntary programs will work. The state has placed equipment into streams to monitor levels of contamination to see what effect the program is having, but the conclusions will not be clear for at least three years, he said.
"By 1995 we will have conclusive evidence to know whether this is working or not," Mr. Young said. "If it's not, it's fair to say we would be prepared to take legislative action to protect water quality."

Fecal contamination, odors and unsightly slime pollute the Kings River in Arkansas. By the time the river flows into Missouri, it contains enough fecal bacteria to make it unfit for swimming. In Fayetteville, Ark., chicken coops close to the bank of the river each house at least 15,000 chickens. (Photographs by Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Congress and White House Shed Perks of Power With Rare Zeal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
With zeal worthy of an inquisition, Congress and the Bush Administration tried today to outdo each other in abandoning the perquisites of power, burning up privileges enjoyed for decades by Government officials.
The Administration announced that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, shocked at the cost of his personal travel on military aircraft, would take commercial flights for private trips whenever possible. The Milwaukee Journal reported this week that the cost to taxpayers for 11 such trips on military planes was more than $370,000. 
 The new policy went into effect immediately, as Mr. Baker and his entourage took a commercial flight for a long-scheduled private trip, to San Antonio. It was not clear how much taxpayers' money was saved because the State Department said little about the flight, except to note that Mr. Baker seemed to enjoy the experience.
 
$400 for Use of Gym
 At the same time, leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives announced that they were casting off perquisites believed likely to anger voters in this election year.
"Gift items, mementos and souvenir items" will no longer be offered for sale at a discount by the House and Senate stationery supply stores, the leaders said. Members of Congress will have to pay $400 a year to use their gymnasium or other exercise equipment; in the past there was no charge.
Members of Congress will also have to pay $520 a year if they wish to continue receiving medical care previously provided at no charge by doctors and nurses assigned to the Capitol. Lawmakers can no longer get prescription drugs in the Capitol, but must buy such medications "at fair market value" from commercial pharmacies. The Senate dining room will cut back its hours of operation to save money. And, as previously announced, the House sergeant-at-arms will no longer fix parking tickets for House members.
In the current political atmosphere, no custom is too venerable, no official too lofty, to escape the assault on perquisites. Officials are less interested in the reality of Government perks than in the voters' perception of such privileges, because for politicans the voters' fury is political reality.
Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, and Representative Charles E. Bennett, Democrat of Florida, illustrate the current mood. They have introduced bills that would outlaw discounts for members of Congress on health care, meals, flowers, plants, pictures, haircuts or other items. "To counter the claims that we are a privileged class," all such perks must be abolished, Mr. Packwood said recently on the Senate floor.
The House bank, the House post office, the franking privilege, the subway that connects the Capitol with Congressional office buildings, the patronage plums, the special restaurants, barber shops, beauty parlors, parking privileges and medical care for members of Congress -- all have come under intense scrutiny in the last few weeks.
Republican strategists, in the White House and at President Bush's re-election campaign, had hoped to thrash Democrats with evidence of scandal at the House post office and the House bank. But Democrats replied this week with a barrage of their own.
 
Bush Called 'King of Perks'
 The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, assailed Mr. Bush today as "the king of perks," and denounced Vice President Dan Quayle as "the crown prince of perks in this Government."
Representative Vic Fazio of California, who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the Republicans: "They can take this as a threat or view this as a warning. We will match every ethical impropriety, perk and privilege they level at Congress with the same and more at the White House or this Administration."
E. Spencer Abraham, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said, "Tom Foley ought to put the House in order before he starts criticizing the President or Vice President or anybody else in the executive branch on the use of perks."
Historians see many precedents for the current orgy of abnegation -- in New England Puritanism, in Midwestern populism, in the nation's strong republican traditions.
 
'A Very Old Debate'
 Paul R. Lucas, a professor of history at Indiana University in Bloomington, said: "This argument over the perks of Congress goes to the heart of a very old debate about what a republic should be like. In the 18th century, colonists and the Founding Fathers believed that the rulers of the new nation must avoid an exorbitant life style and must not behave like decadent European aristocrats."
Washington insisted on being addressed as "Mr. President," not as "Your Highness," and he rejected the sort of pomp and pageantry associated with kings, Mr. Lucas said.
Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, echoed the Founding Fathers when he said this week, "The public wants a House of Representatives, not a House of Lords."
Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said Mr. Baker made 15 private trips on Government aircraft in the last three years. In addition, she said, on seven trips the Secretary combined personal and official business.
Miss Tutwiler said Mr. Baker had paid the Government $38,453 to cover costs of private travel on military planes. That is far less than the cost to the taxpayers, as reckoned by auditors from the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. The Milwaukee Journal said Thursday that the auditors had put the cost for just 11 of Mr. Baker's private trips at $371,599.
 
Some Possible Exceptions
 Mr. Baker learned of the audit results late last week and issued new instructions to his scheduling staff this week. "In the future, on private travel, book me on commercial flights."
Miss Tutwiler said there could be exceptions to this policy, if there was a terrorist threat to Mr. Baker, for example, or a foreign policy crisis in which he needed "continuous 24-hour secure communications with the President" and the Pentagon.
A spokesman for KSAT television. the ABC affiliate in San Antonio, said Mr. Baker arrived there this afternoon on a Continental Air Lines flight.
Miss Tutwiler said Mr. Baker traveled in economy class today and was accompanied by friends and security agents, but she declined to say how many guards were in his detail.
She said she talked to Mr. Baker by telephone when he made a stop on his trip. "Lots of people are coming up and talking to him and he has gotten notes passed up the aisle" of the plane, she said. She quoted Mr. Baker as saying the experience was "terrific."

HEADLINE: Breadbasket of New York Gets a Russian Appraisal

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The potato machine had received considerable advance billing.
"That's something that should really make their eyes open up," predicted Joseph Carella, a spokesman for Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx, the world's largest wholesale produce market by volume, which a group of 14 Russian economists and businessmen toured yesterday morning. 
 But when Galina Chernyavskaya, an economist and a leader of the group, stepped into the room where an enormous, clattering machine was sorting and bagging potatoes, all that showed in her eyes was recognition.
"I worked on a machine like this when I worked on a collective farm," she said with a nostalgic smile.
And so it went. The Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative Association may, as its executive administrative director, Myra Gordon, averred, employ 10,000 people and do $1.2 billion in business annually. It may draw on 35 countries and 49 states to supply 22 million people with their avocados, their lettuce, and their Jamaican ugli fruit -- a cross between a tangerine and a grapefruit. But it didn't exactly wow the Russians, who seemed far from happy with the conditions back home but also a little weary of being treated like recently thawed icemen.
When Ms. Gordon gestured to a large vehicle and explained, "This is what we call a flat-bed truck," Dr. Chernyavskaya observed, "The Americans think we know very little, and they explain every little thing."
The group, composed of members and clients of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, had been in New York City for three weeks, visiting sites like the Commodities Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange and attending seminars at the Henry George School, an adult education institution in Manhattan, said George L. Collins, the school's executive director.
The Hunts Point Terminal Market, which sits on 113 acres of the South Bronx sandwiched between the Bronx and East Rivers, is managed by a cooperative of 69 tenants, or "houses," that import produce by planes, trains and trucks to sell mainly to green grocers, restaurants and hotels from southern Connecticut to Pennsylvania, Ms. Gordon said.
For two hours, Ms. Gordon guided the Russians up one row and down another, pointing out Italian radicchio, Belgian endive, baby squash, and the bottled water some houses keep on hand for their workers. "This is bottled water," she said, laying a hand on one specimen.
Like several others, Vladimir Galanov, an economist who is helping establish a commodities exchange in Moscow, said that none of the fruits or vegetables were new to him. He rarely saw artichokes in Moscow, he said, but he didn't like them anyway. "Nobody asks for them, that's why we don't sell," he said.
While they seemed eager to show they had some sophistication about economics and vegetables, the Russians were quick to discuss horror stories about how the dismal distribution system is driving up recently decontrolled prices in Russia.
 
Our Bronx Comrades
 Leonid Cherepanov, vice president of Krakar Manufacture and Commerce Company, an importer of American products, had a friend photograph him lifting a pineapple. "The price of a pineapple in Moscow is from 350 rubles to 500 rubles," he said. "Five hundred rubles is approximately the middle wages of the people in Russia for a month." He blamed high fuel prices and the tariffs that republics have begun to levy on goods transported across their borders.
But for the most part, the Russians seemed to find more at Hunts Point that was familiar than extraordinary. When, after being questioned, Ms. Gordon confessed that some of the potato trucks were "unfortunately" unloaded by hand, Mr. Cherepanov began to laugh. "Americans and Russians are of the same stuff," Mr. Cherepanov said. "We are very similar."
And while they said they were impressed by the quantity of produce, the Russians were less approving of the quality.
"I'd like to mention that the fruits and vegetables do not have the proper taste," said Dr. Chernyavskaya. "They look beautiful, but they are not so sweet."
Pavel Murashkin, the manager of Krakar, bit into his nectarine to discover a worm, or half a worm. With a look of disgust, he showed the fruit to Mr. Galanov, who burst out laughing.
"Just like in Russia!" Mr. Galanov crowed.

HEADLINE: Beach Club Settles Suit On Race Bias

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, April 3

 BODY:
A New Rochelle beach club that had been sued by the state for excluding blacks agreed today to a series of measures aimed at opening its doors to minority-group members.
In a settlement with the State Attorney General, the Colony Beach Club agreed to advertise in black-oriented newspapers, to set aside $15,000 to compensate people who might have been discriminated against and to suspend for three summers rules requiring that applicants be sponsored by current members. 
 But the club did not admit any wrongdoing and its lawyer attacked the Attorney General, Robert Abrams, for filing the suit and calling a news conference last fall without first meeting with club managers.
Mr. Abrams sued in October after receiving complaints, including one from a white woman who said club officials told her a black baby sitter would have to wear a uniform to enter because club officers "want to know the difference between the members and the helpers."
 
Black Resident Locked Out
 During an undercover investigation, a black New Rochelle resident working with state investigators said she was literally locked out of the club's office.
The case attracted wide attention when it was filed because civil-rights advocates have long cited the racial uniformity of many private recreation operations as evidence that discrimination remains pervasive in New York suburbs. Truly private clubs are permitted to discriminate under the law if they satisfy certain criteria, but operations that are actually open to the public must be open to all groups.
Even while the settlement papers were being filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the club's lawyer asserted that Colony, which is in the Davenport Neck area of New Rochelle on Long Island Sound, does not discriminate. The lawyer, Peter Bienstock, said Mr. Abrams should not have filed the suit and should not have said that Colony did not have any black members.
"It is not true," Mr. Bienstock said, "that there have been no African-American members." He declined to say whether the club currently has any black members.
Saying that the cost of the settlement would be less than the cost of fighting Mr. Abrams, Mr. Bienstock added, "But it is a shame that small entities already hurt by the recession must be subject to these costs to resolve lawsuits with no merit."
 
'Difficult' for Non-Whites
 A spokesman for Mr. Abrams, Leslie Gersing, said an investigation had shown that the club "made it very difficult for people" who were not white. She said investigators are unaware of any black members.
Betty Jean Jackson, the black woman who was locked out of the club office, said the settlement was a small victory for black people in Westchester County. But she said she doubted it would alter deep patterns of discrimination. "It's a way of life," she said. "It has worked for so long."
Mr. Bienstock said the club, a privately owned nonprofit corporation, continues to accept people who "agree to abide by the club rules."
In all, Colony agreed to pay $25,000 in settlements costs. The $15,000 set aside for people who claim to have been discriminated against is to be paid to people who make claims to the Attorney General's office in the next 45 days. Under the settlement, the club also agreed to advise state officials during the next three years of the race of applicants and the action taken on applications.
The club charged up to $1,925 annually for family memberships last summer and had more than 300 members.
Mrs. Jackson said she would file an application to join the Colony Club. "I do intend to join," she said. "That's what it was all about."

OPEC Cut Sends Oil Above $20

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The price of oil closed above $20 a barrel yesterday for the first time since Dec. 13.
The market pushed prices up when the International Energy Agency reported that OPEC production had fallen 900,000 barrels a day in March, to 23.5 million barrels a day. The agency also said that global demand had increased 300,000 barrels a day. 
 Some dealers also said they saw signs that economic improvements were raising domestic demand, with the possibility of prices rising further.
"I think the bull move has officially started," said Peter C. Beutel, an oil analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J.
The price of oil rose 49 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to close at $20.29 a barrel.
 
Libya Issue Cited
 Several other factors played a role. Oil traders are concerned about deteriorating relations between the United Nations and Libya, which produces about 1.4 million barrels a day. The United Nations Security Council has voted to impose economic sanctions, and Libya has responded by threatening to halt oil shipments to unfriendly nations.
With Iraq still out of the oil market, and Kuwaiti production still short of its prewar level, world production is now near capacity. In addition, the United States has had unusually cold early-spring weather, which drives up demand for heating oil. Mr. Beutel said that cold weather at the beginning of the heating season made little difference, because tanks were already full, but that when it came in March, an increase in demand quickly rippled through the system.
To some extent, a rising market creates momentum for itself. "When it broke above $20, a lot of new buying came in," said James R. Fiedler, vice president of the energy division at E.D. & F. Man International. "People were short as long as it didn't go above 20 bucks, and when it did, they bought."
In a futures short sale, a trader bets on lower prices by selling a contract that obligates him to deliver a commodity like oil at a fixed price at afuture date.
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet again at the end of this month to discuss further cuts in output. According to the International Energy Agency, Saudi Arabia cut its exports by 300,000 barrels a day in February, to about 8.2 million barrels a day. Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela also cut production.

Hog Prices Gain Again
 By The Associated Press
Hog futures prices continued to rebound yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Strong demand for pork countered news of an expanding American hog herd.
Precious metals, meanwhile, finished mixed in dull trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold for April delivery rose 30 cents, to $341.20 an ounce, and the April silver contract rose 0.2 cent, to $4.076 an ounce.
In Chicago, hogs for April delivery rose 0.85 cent, to 41.87 cents a pound. The June contract surged 1.23 cents, to 47.90 cents a pound, for a cumulative gain of 3.65 cents in four days.
May frozen pork bellies rose 0.38 cent, to 35.60 cents a pound. April live cattle rose 0.12 cent, to 79.37 cents a pound, and April feeder cattle rose 0.13 cent, to 79.95 cents a pound.
On Monday, hog futures fell as much as 1.5 cents, the most allowed in a day, after the Agriculture Department reported a larger-than-expected expansion of the hog herd. But prices have climbed back steadily since then, partly reflecting strong wholesale demand for ham and the cuts of pork used for sausage.
The demand for hams by meat processors usually peaks about four weeks before Easter, said Dale Durchholz, livestock analyst with Agri-Visor Services Inc. During the monthlong interval before the holiday, the hams are cured and packaged for the retail trade. But this year, ham demand remains strong two weeks before the Easter weekend. Mr. Durchholz said wholesale prices for 17-to-20-pound hams rose this week to as much as 72 cents a pound, from a high last week of 68 cents.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for May delivery rose 4 1/2 cents to settle at $3.67 1/4 a bushel. Corn for May delivery rose 1 cent, to $2.60 1/4 a bushel. May oats climbed 1 1/4 cents, to $1.42 1/2 a bushel, and May soybeans rose 3/4 cent, to $5.76 1/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New York;
Upstate, Neither Clinton Nor Brown Stir Passions

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, April 3

 BODY:
Four years ago, the key to Michael S. Dukakis's triumph in the New York primary lay in upstate cities like this.
Aided by a large black vote, the Rev. Jesse Jackson carried New York City, despite hostility toward him among many Jewish voters. But while attention was focused there, Mr. Dukakis ran strongly in the suburbs and amassed a huge majority upstate. 
 This year, neither of the remaining candidates seems to have developed any real momentum in the vast expanse north of the Westchester County line, which in most years casts slightly more than a quarter of the statewide Democratic primary vote.
A poll taken on Wednesday in Erie County, which includes Buffalo, showed Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas leading former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California by a narrow margin, but with 53 percent undecided -- the largest such figure that the poll-taker, Prof. Gerald M. Goldhaber of the State University at Buffalo, has ever encountered this late in a campaign.
"What it says is that people can't stand either candidate," Professor Goldhaber commented. "That's not too surprising, since all they've seen is one candidate attacking the other and reporters attacking both."
Laurence J. Kirwan of Rochester, a former state Democratic chairman, said that "thousands of people you'd have hoped to have energized and involved in this campaign just aren't there, because it's a failure."
"There's great disillusionment with a process that brings us a Brown and a Clinton as the choice," he said. "People have no confidence that that's the best the Democratic Party has to offer, and they feel let down. Brown's an anybody-but-Clinton candidate, and Clinton is rapidly dissipating all the big advantages he started with. Didn't inhale marijuana! If my son told me that, I'd tell him, 'Come on, you've got to get serious.' "
 
Sticking With Harkin
 Upstate New York consists, of course, mostly of farms and small towns. Over all, it is heavily Republican. But in the cities strung along the main transportation route -- the Erie Canal followed it first, then the New York Central Railroad, now the Thruway -- there are large numbers of factory workers and others who have traditionally voted Democratic.
Yet at the Xerox and Eastman Kodak plants here, the remaining steel mills in Buffalo, the General Electric and Carrier air-conditioning factories in Syracuse, union officials see little inclination to vote on Tuesday.
Jim Duncan, the political officer for the United Automobile Workers in the area, foresees a record low turnout. In an effort to gain some sort of leverage at the Democratic National Convention, especially over the platform, he is urging members in Western New York to vote for the slates of delegates pledged to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who pulled out weeks ago.
Asked why he was not backing Mr. Brown, who was supported by some U.A.W. locals in Michigan in the primary there last month, Mr. Duncan replied, "I don't think they have the wherewithal to make a good showing." With two mailings to 11,000 members in three Congressional districts, he said, "I think we can do rather well for the Harkin slates around here."
If the U.A.W. strategy seems improbable, The Buffalo News has felt compelled to advocate something even more far-fetched. After commenting in an editorial the other day that Mr. Brown is "not qualified to be President," the newspaper urged its readers to cast "a well-placed protest vote" against "the Clinton juggernaut" to keep the race open. Such a vote would have to go to Mr. Brown, it said, because only he seemed likely to get the 15 percent needed to gain delegates.
 
Hierarchy Backing Clinton
 Across the state in Albany, Mayor Thomas Whalen 3d, whose Democratic organization retains vestiges of machine power, is also supporting Mr. Brown, reportedly in the hope that a brokered convention would lead to the selection of someone other than the two active candidates as the party's nominee.
But almost everyone else in the party hierarchy is backing Mr. Clinton, and his list of supporters has continued to grow despite his troubles with tabloids and television questioners in New York City. On Thursday, for instance, he won the endorsement of Rochester's Mayor, Thomas P. Ryan Jr.
Mr. Brown has drawn large, enthusiastic crowds on college campuses in Rochester and Buffalo, and his backers in Ithaca, site of Cornell University, say they have registered several thousand new voters in recent days.
Apparently sensing that the situation remains fluid, the former Governor plans a swing through the area this weekend, starting Saturday in Syracuse, and Mr. Clinton is also also visiting upstate cities this weekend.
Perhaps Mr. Clinton's biggest asset in Buffalo, the state's second-largest city, is Dennis Gorski, the Erie County Executive. He said Mr. Clinton would carry the county "because he comes from the middle of the political spectrum, like most people here, and because our organization will get out the vote for him."
 
Playing Economic Fears
 Attacking Mr. Brown as "a man who finds out wherever he goes what people fear and then plays on it," Mr. Gorski said that Mr. Brown's proposed 13 percent value-added tax would cripple Buffalo's economy by making goods so expensive that hordes of people would no longer cross the Peace Bridge from Canada to go shopping.
But Mr. Gorski conceded that Mr. Clinton's lead had been eroded by "the cumulative effect of the character assassination he's been subject to, which is recirculated from the tabloids to the television and from there through the bowling alleys and coffee shops and bars and living rooms."
Professor Goldhaber, the poll-taker, said Mr. Clinton had been hurt by the response of his wife, Hillary, to charges that her legal career had enmeshed her husband in conflicts of interest. She said angrily that she supposed she could have stayed home and baked cookies, and that, Professor Goldhaber commented, "sent a chill through all the communities around here where the women car-pool, cheer for Little Leaguers and hold bake sales."
In a sense, Buffalo is the eastern terminus of the Rust Belt, and there is economic dislocation there and in other upstate cities. But Joseph Crangle, who spent 23 years as the Erie County Democratic leader, retiring in 1988, said that the state budget and its estimated $1.8 billion in tax and fee increases could prove to be the most important economic issue.
"The budget inevitably spills over into anti-government feeling," Mr. Crangle said, "and that could help Brown a bit. Fair or not, Clinton has become the Establishment candidate. He's almost an incumbent in this race."

HEADLINE: U.S. and France Fight Over Piece of Airline Market

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Just as the summer season for trans-Atlantic travel begins, a dispute between the United States and France over how many passengers United States airlines may carry between the two countries is threatening to disrupt flights and increase ticket prices.
After the latest round of negotiations in Washington ended fruitlessly on Tuesday, France warned that it intended to act unilaterally to restrict the capacity of the American carriers, which have made strong gains recently, perhaps as early as this weekend. 
 But by this evening it was uncertain what steps, if any, the French Government would take immediately. It appears that the uncertainty might last for a few days, if not longer, as the brinkmanship that typifies such negotiations takes over.
The dispute could have implications for Americans flying to other countries as well. The Bush Administration is reluctant to accede to the French demand out of fears that Germany, Japan or other nations might follow suit. Eventually, airline and Administration officials warned, the dispute may severely disrupt air travel.
France wants the eight American carriers that fly to France to cut their available seats by 500,000, or nearly 20 percent, in the coming six months. Then, Air France, which is heavily subsidized by the French Government, would face less pressure to compete for passengers by cutting fares. Passengers from both nations would end up paying higher fares regardless of which airline they chose.
Although the United States has been pressing its trading partners for more free trade in airline flights, this dispute shows how far from a free market the situation remains. Although domestic air travel was deregulated in the 1970's, for international routes the airlines and the governments in effect negotiate cartel-like marketing agreements that vary in the kinds of restrictions they impose.
The dispute comes as travel between the two countries is recovering strongly from the recession -- mainly to the benefit of the United States airlines, which have captured at least two-thirds of the market.
Most of the eight American carriers that fly to France resubmitted their schedules today, ignoring the French demand. Some made modest reductions, but without eliminating anything near the 20 percent, 500,000-seat cut that the French have demanded, representatives of several airlines said.
"We are planning to fly our schedules as announced," said a spokewoman for United Airlines, Lynn Martenstein. "We remain confident that the U.S. Government will be able to resolve outstanding issues with the French Government."
On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card signaled a tough negotiating stand in a speech before a large gathering of aviation industry executives in Washington. He said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Paul Quiles, and had insisted that the Americans be allowed to fly their full schedules.
"Let me be clear about this issue: the United States places a very high value on its bilateral agreements," Mr. Card said, referring to a 1990 agreement between the two countries. "We respect those agreements, and we honor them faithfully. And we do expect the same from our trading partners."
Laurent Aublin, the spokesman for the French Embassy, replied that in the French view the 1990 agreement, which would have accommodated the increase in service sought by the Americans, was superseded by the original 1946 aviation treaty between the two nations and could be revised at will.
In any event, he said, the French are willing to allow an increase in seats, but not as many as the Americans have sought.
The Americans hope to sell 2.7 million tickets between the two countries for April through October flights, better than a 40 percent increase from the 1.9 million tickets sold in 1991. The French have insisted that the total come to no more than 2.2 million seats this summer.
 
Many Different Air Fares
 Thousands of different air fares are in effect between various American and French airports, depending on when a flight is, how far in advance it is reserved, special promotions and other factors, but as one airline executive said, if the number of seats is cut back, the lowest fares will be the ones to go.
The United States carriers flying to France are American, Continental, Delta Air Lines, Northwest, Tower Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and USAir. None are heavily dependent on flights to France, but several are planning to add to their service between the two countries this month.
For example, United Airlines will begin using a Boeing 747 instead of a smaller plane from Washington's Dulles International Airport on Saturday, and will inaugurate nonstop 767 service from San Francisco on Sunday.
If France turns down increases in service, Washington can retaliate immediately by restricting Air France flights to the United States.
The only reductions that the United States is willing to offer would be those proposed voluntarily by American airlines. During the negotiations, the airlines volunteered to cut between 100,000 and 150,000 seats, but the French rejected the offer.

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

God and Misery
Popular wisdom has it that the tougher the economic times, the more people go to church. Like the old saying about atheists in foxholes, the reasoning goes that people with holes in their pockets are also drawn to the Lord. 
 But a new report by the Princeton Religion Research Center, an affiliate of the Gallup Poll, challenges that assumption. "The historical record shows very minor swings, if any, in both church attendance and membership when the economy either goes boom or bust," the report said.
The research center analyzed statistics gathered over the last 40 years and through the nine recessions that occurred in that period. It found that the difference in church attendance between the recession and the year preceding it never has exceeded 2 percentage points.
Through it all, church attendance -- that is, people who say they attended at least once in the last seven days -- has hovered about 40 percent. In 1991, 42 percent of those polled said they were weekly churchgoers, compared with 40 percent in 1990. But the upswing in churchgoing in the 1991 recession was only the second time more people reported going to a church in an economic downturn. On three past occasions there was a slight decline in membership, and four times it held steady.
As for those church officials hoping that an economic recovery will bring more people to church, the results are no more encouraging. In six of the eight recoveries, no change was registered; once the numbers went up slightly and once they went down. The margin of sampling error for the surveys was plus or minus three percentage points.
 
War of Words
 Bishop John S. Spong, the head of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, attracted attention on Tuesday when he assailed the policies of the Roman Catholic Church with regard to women and homosexuals.
His language was strong, using words like prejudiced, hypocritical and repressive. The reaction that followed was also strong.
"Your hostility against the Catholic Church has grown apace until today it seems obsessive," Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick, the Catholic Archbishop of Newark, wrote to Bishop Spong in response. "I truly regret that you have decided to move in the direction of such personal attacks on the Catholic Church by making a parody of our teaching and a caricature of our theology."
Bishop Spong's criticism of the church appeared in the April edition of the Virginia Quarterly Review, a scholarly journal. In it, he argues that the differences between the Episcopal and Catholic Churches are so great that their long-established dialogue should cease.
His call was rejected by Catholic Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee and Episcopal Bishop Theodore Eastman of Maryland, who head the ecumenical committees of their churches in the United States. Bishop Eastman said, "We would not want to close the door to what the Holy Spirit may do for both churches through these continuing dialogues."
 
Primate Confusion
 The nave of a church (the main part of the building) has nothing to do with a knave (a rascal). A missal (prayer book) has nothing to do with a missile.
But a primate, whether in the jungle or in the church, are spelled the same and open to confusion. Take the case of Archbishop Michael Peers, primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. Not long ago, he received a request for information from the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, which was gathering information for an "International Directory of Primatology."
The Archbishop's secretary, the Rev. Michael Ingham, took the letter in stride. He responded: "I think the primates in your study are perhaps a different species. While it is true that our primate occasionally enjoys bananas, I have never seen him walk with his knuckles on the ground or scratch himself publicly under the armpits."
An apology came swiftly from Dr. John Hearns of the primate research center. "We have strayed on this occasion from the arboreal to the spiritual," he wrote.
 
Rabbi Reissues
 Three classic works by American rabbis -- one Reform, one Conservative and one Orthodox -- have been reissued in new editions in recent months. "9 1/2 Mystics," Herbert Weiner's 1971 exploration of the spiritual tradition of Judaism has been reissued by Collier Books, with a new chapter on Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the mystical leader of the Lubavitch Hasidim.
"Judaism," an introduction to the faith by Arthur Hertzberg, first issued in 1961, has been brought back by Simon & Schuster with new information on such topics as women's rights, homosexuality and Arabs and Jews.
And Doubleday has published Joseph B. Soloveitchik's "The Lonely Man of Faith," a personal meditation on faith and loneliness that first appeared in the scholarly journal "Tradition" in 1965. Rabbi Soloveitchik's essay has never been in book form before but was photocopied and has been circulated for more than 25 years.

HEADLINE: New York Area Shows Job Gain

 BODY:
New York and New Jersey both showed improvements in their employment pictures during March, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday.
In New York, the unemployment rate dropped to 8 percent in March from 8.9 percent in February, while in New Jersey the rate went to 7.1 percent from 7.6 percent. 
 "I think we have to take it as good news," said Prof. Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. But, he cautioned: "It may be that we had just hit bottom. You have to see more than one month of this to draw any conclusions."
He speculated that the drop could most likely be attributed to unemployed workers who decided to stop looking and take lesser jobs than they had, a major turnaround in financial services, and the simple fact that the employment picture had gotten so bad there was no way to go but up.
There were no figures available for Connecticut. Unemployment in Massachusetts, which has been battered by sharp reductions in defense, rose a sharply to 9.1 percent from 7.5 percent.
"The New England economy is much worse than New York's," Professor Moss said.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Stays at 7.3%, With Scant Job Market Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The job market showed only slight improvement in March, with the nation's unemployment rate remaining at a seven-year high of 7.3 percent, according to Labor Department figures.
Payrolls grew by 19,000, a meager gain that owed much to the fact that many poll watchers and other election workers briefly held jobs related to the Super Tuesday primaries, which came during the survey week. 
 With the economy a main electoral battleground and employment the most politically sensitive indicator for incumbents, Democrats were quick to spot political ammunition and to urge a permanent expansion of jobless benefits.
 
Bad News, Democrat Says
 "This morning's report cannot be read as good news for the millions of jobless Americans who read and took hope from the assertions that a recovery has begun," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, head of the Joint Economic Committee. "Employers remain cautious about hiring, and the labor market is showing little sign of life."
At the White House, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, gave the kind of circumspect appraisal he has in the past. "While sales and production have been improving," he observed, "improvements in unemployment generally lag behind. Stronger economic growth and job creation is the Administration's top priority."
The reaction of securities markets initially appeared to be one of disappointment, with bonds rising and stocks falling. Later, however, the stock market rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining almost 15 points. This may have reflected the sentiment of more optimistic analysts, who found the March data quite consistent with expectations for steady, if subdued, recovery.
"I see an emerging momentum of the economy that is still well maintained," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, dismissing month-to-month fluctuations in the statistics. "The dynamics of a self-sustaining recovery are in place."
In keeping with the halting recovery that most economists believe is now under way, today's report included bits of good and bad news and a lot that was inconclusive.
There was no significant movement in the jobless rate for any of the main demographic groups, the length of both the average workweek and of jobless spells held steady and there was no appreciable change in the Labor Department's quarterly tabulation of Americans who have given up looking for a job because they think they would be unable to find one.
"It's basically a no-change report," declared Walter M. Cadette, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company, noting that while there has been little job gain from recent surges in retail sales it is also true that job erosion in general has ended and that the labor force has begun to grow again.
Among the 11 biggest industrial states, three showed meaningful changes in their jobless rates. The rate for New York, which conducts primary elections Tuesday, fell to 8 percent from 8.9, while Illinois saw its rate fall to 7.8 percent from 8.5.
 
Kennedy Demands Action
 The rate for Massachusetts jumped 1.6 points, to 9.1 percent, causing Senator Edward M. Kennedy to complain that his state's economy "is far from out of the woods" and calling on Congress, the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve to "do more to stop the recession and insure that a vigorous recovery actually begins."
William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee he found it "noteworthy" that the 303,000 rise in the labor force last month was the fourth in a row, bringing the total since November to 1.2 million.
Other analysts said this probably reflected increased optimism about the prospect of obtaining jobs, with about half the 1.2 million having done so.
Typically, such optimism causes the jobless rate to rise until recovery is well under way but in March the economy generated just enough jobs, 305,000 as measured by the department's survey of households, to absorb them all.
The ranks of the jobless thus edged down to 9,242,000 from 9,244,000.
But economists disagreed about how to interpret the household survey's 305,000 job gain, with some dismissing it as statistical quirk in light of a payroll gain of only 19,000 while others regarded it as solid evidence of improvement.
Taking the latter view, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Bank, said that the household survey showed a 620,000-job gain since last July and, whatever its deficiencies, has proved a reliable predictor in previous business recoveries. He said these numbers, which included an 882,000 March surge without seasonal adjustment, were "so strong they shouldn't be ignored."

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Growing Backlog of Delinquencies

BYLINE: By John H. Cushman Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Though the White House has long said that collecting back taxes is a top priority, the Internal Revenue Service has been falling farther and farther behind. In 1991, collections actually declined by 5 percent, to $24.3 billion from $25.5 billion.
What's going wrong? "As we chat about this at the G.A.O., we feel this is one of the mysteries of the Government," said Jennie S. Stathis, director of tax policy for the General Accounting Office, a Congressional auditing agency. 
 One reason for the growing backlog is that Congress extended the statute of limitations on tax-dodging from 6 years to 10 years, even though older debts are harder to collect. That technicality accounts for $6 billion of the $14 billion increase in accounts receivable in the 1991 fiscal year.
The lingering recession may be another reason that many people and companies are not paying their taxes. Of the $111 billion owed, $27 billion is tied up in insolvencies and bankruptcies (which were up 24 percent last year). Another $28 billion cannot be paid because of personal hardships.
But the question that most troubled members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a hearing this week was why Congress saw no quick results after providing $55 million to hire 1,000 new tax collectors in 1991.
The General Accounting Office contends that the I.R.S. used some of that money to pay for unbudgeted cost increases, like higher rent for its offices and a pay rise. That would mean it hired fewer collectors than Congress had intended. But the I.R.S. said that it had indeed hired the tax collectors. It has taken some time to bring them up to speed, but the results are now beginning to appear, I.R.S. officials said. In the first five months of fiscal 1992, through February, collections on delinquent accounts increased by an average of $55 million a month above a year earlier, the service said.
That is progress. But Shirley D. Peterson, the new I.R.S. Commissioner, demurred when asked whether she would promise, as did her predecessor, Fred T. Goldberg Jr., to halt the backlog's growth. To the extent that the agency becomes more efficient in identifying deadbeats, like the estimated six million people who don't bother to file a return at all, the backlog will rise, she said.
 
I.R.S. Help Line Gets Mixed Review
 The General Accounting Office has offered a mixed review of the performance of the Internal Revenue Service's telephone help line, a toll-free service for befuddled taxpayers. (The "800" numbers are listed in the tax instructions.)
The good news is that the people answering taxpayers' queries are more likely than they used to be to give right answers. There is now about an 87 percent chance that questions will be answered correctly, up from about 81 percent last year and 2 points above the target set for this year.
On the other hand, the chances of getting connected to a helpful person have declined sharply, because a surge of users is tying up the lines.
Only about 27 percent of the attempted calls are being answered this year, compared with 42 percent last year, the G.A.O. said. "As far as we know, this is an all-time low," the agency reported.
About 10 million calls had been answered through March 7, at least 260,000 above last year's pace. But the phones have rung 13 million times more than last year; millions of callers evidently got a busy signal or they hung up while on hold.
This week, Senator Pete V. Domenici's Albuquerque office called the line 70 times at all hours of the day over a three-day period, and 57 times got a busy signal, getting through only 18 percent of the time. In 1990, the staff of the New Mexico Republican got through 3 times out of 35, or 9 percent, and in 1991, 23 times out of 35, or 65 percent.
 
An S.& L. Wrinkle On Retirement Accounts
 Failed savings and loans often pay off high-yielding certificates of deposit designated as individual retirement accounts by sending checks to the depositors. If that happens, the certificates' owners must be careful to reinvest the money within 60 days. If not put in a new I.R.A., the money will be taxed as income, and there will be a 10 percent penalty to boot. That is true even if the payment comes from the failed institution's receiver or from a deposit insurance fund.
The United States Tax Court recently rejected an argument by a Maryland couple who contended that they did not receive a taxable distribution when their $10,659 savings certificate was involuntarily cashed out by First Maryland Savings and Loan Inc. when it failed in 1986.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls After Bad News On the Unemployment Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most currencies yesterday after the release of disappointing data showing that the nation's jobless rate held at a seven-year high in March.
Gold prices closed higher. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $341.20 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted gold at a late bid price of $340.70, up 40 cents. 
 The dollar opened the New York session lower in anticipation that the unemployment report would be weak, said Kevin Logan, chief economist of the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Investors were looking for poor jobless figures because economic data released earlier this week had suggested that the recovery was cooling.
"The dollar held its own for a while," Mr. Logan said. "Then, after an hour or so, the buyers weren't there, and the dollar gradually eroded."
The Labor Department said the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent in March, unchanged from February. The number of jobless people was 9.2 million, 2.5 million more than at the start of the recession in July 1990.
As the dollar's decline gained momentum, the currency broke out of a tight trading range for the first time since mid-February, Mr. Logan said.
He predicted that the dollar would remain weak in the near term, amid signs that the economy is not as strong as expected. "For the dollar to move upward, there needs to be a sense in the market there is stable, sustained growth taking place," Mr. Logan said.
The dollar is faring somewhat better against the yen as the weakened economy in Japan and declining interest rates there have scared away investors.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 133.57 yen, from 134.77 on Thursday. In London, it declined further, to 133.33 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 133.40 yen, down from 133.70 yen on Thursday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds Rally in Reaction to Jobs Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An employment report that was generally weaker than anticipated helped to push up prices of Treasury securities and force down interest rates yesterday.
The report, which showed that non-farm payrolls expanded by just 19,000 in March, came a day after the Federal Reserve Board said that important monetary aggregates contracted in the week that ended March 23. Most analysts had forecast an increase of about 50,000 jobs in March. 
 Traders said the employment statistics and the downturn in money growth were allowing market participants to become more comfortable with the notion, widespread among analysts, that recovery would be distinctly less robust than in most rebounds.
 
Sluggish Numbers
 "If this were a traditional recovery, we would be seeing employment rising by 200,000 to 250,000 a month," another trader said. "But right now we are struggling to see positive numbers."
In addition to the softer-than-expected employment data, a report yesterday said that March car sales were at a sluggish seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million.
"Car sales were fairly poor in March," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., "and that means retail sales will probably be flat to down."
Many of yesterday's price gains were recorded among short-term securities, suggesting that market participants were now beginning to think that the Fed might again ease monetary policy. Indeed, minutes released yesterday from the February meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee reinforced the notion that the central bank could well act to lower interest rates.
At the February meeting, the committee voted to lean toward easing. The group met again this week, and most analysts said the committee was likely to have chosen to keep the bias toward easing in place.
 
The Fed's Options
 "What we are seeing is a subtle shift in emphasis that suggests the Fed once again has the option of considering another cut in short-term rates," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds.
"Against the backdrop of weakness in money, there is good reason to think the Fed will be more inclined to ease," he said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10114/32 , up 3/8, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Thursday and 7.94 percent on March 27.
Among outstanding Treasury notes, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/4, up 11/32 , to yield 7.38 percent. And the 5 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 3/4, up 1/4 point, to yield 5.34 percent.
In the when-issued market, the new seven-year Treasury notes to be auctioned on Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 7.10 percent.
 
Bill Rates Decline
 Short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.95 percent late yesterday, down 5 basis points, or five one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 6 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.02 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 13 basis points, to 4.19 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Texaco Capital Inc., a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., offered $200 million worth of 40-year noncallable bonds through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 8 5/8 percent bonds were priced at $99.50 to yield 8.669 percent, 80 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.

HEADLINE: Fed Policy Panel Favored Easing if Needed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee unanimously decided in February to give Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, the latitude to lower interest rates further if the economy continued to languish.
The minutes of the February meeting of the Open Market Committee were released today. Minutes of previous meetings showed that the 12 members of the committee, while concerned about the economy's sluggishness, were divided on whether to ease monetary policy. 
 Traditionally, a unanimous decision has empowered the chairman to cut rates by up to one-half of 1 percent without consulting the committee. But Fed officials say Mr. Greenspan is generally loath to adjust rates by even one-quarter of 1 percent without consulting committee members.
Economists who follow the Fed say the central bank has not lowered rates since the Feb. 4-5 meeting because the economy has shown some signs of recovery since then. The last time the Fed lowered rates was Dec. 20, when it cut the discount rate to 3 1/2 percent from 4 1/2 percent.
The report noted that during discussions at the meeting many members expressed fears that the effects of earlier moves to ease "could prove to be less stimulative than anticipated." It added that "the persistence of a weak economy might well have especially severe consequences, and, in the view of some members, signs of such an outcome would call for prompt action."
The Open Market Committee met again on Tuesday, but the minutes of that meeting will not be released until May 22. Many experts speculate that the Fed again adopted a bias toward easing that would empower Mr. Greenspan to lower rates if the signs of recovery sputtered.
The February minutes say the members were in favor of "some bias" toward easing, while the minutes of the December meeting, shortly before rates were lowered, spoke of a "marked bias" toward easing.
 
Mixed Signals
 Fed officials have been encouraged by recent increases in retail sales and housing construction. But some economists said reports released today, showing the jobless rate unchanged at 7.3 percent and employment up only slightly, could be signs that the incipient recovery was faltering.
The Open Market Committee comprises the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board and five presidents of Federal Reserve districts.
According to the February minutes, "The members generally agreed that enough monetary stimulus probably had been implemented to foster the desired upturn in economic activity without further policy moves." But the report added that the outlook was so uncertain that the committee "needed to remain alert to the possibility of developments that might require additional easing."
In appearances before Congressional committees, Mr. Greenspan often reiterated these views, saying he thought that enough monetary easing was in the pipeline to bring about a recovery, but adding that additional insurance, in the form of lower rates, might be warranted if the economy trailed off.
 
Careful Wording
 The report said that many of those leaning toward easing stated that "there should not be an unusually strong presumption that any easing would in fact be implemented" between the February meeting and the meeting on Tuesday.
"The committee should ease only in response to cumulating evidence that economic activity was not picking up or that monetary growth was falling appreciably short of expectations," the report said.
In the discussions, a few members argued against a bias toward easing, saying more emphasis needed to be put on the inflationary risks of overreacting to economic weakness. But when the vote came, these members joined the unanimous decision, apparently because their views were not so strong that they thought it was worth dissenting.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Rose In Period

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built vehicles rose 5.2 percent in late March, led by a strong buying surge of mini-vans, pickups and other light trucks.
Analysts remained divided whether the United States automotive market had turned for the better and was gaining strength. Financial analysts tended toward caution, while automotive executives expressed optimism. 
 "We've had indications that the market is reviving, but we've had our fill of indications," said Tom Pappert, vice president of sales for the Chrysler Corporation. "These are results, and we'll take continued sales improvement, big or small."
 
Sluggish a Year Ago
 David Bank, general manager of Bloom Pontiac in Long Island City, Queens, said: "Traffic is still slow. Sales are up for January, February and March but that's not a fair comparison" with last year's unusually sluggish sales. "Sales aren't up as much as we'd like," he added.
Sales of domestically built cars fell 1.2 percent, to 229,317, compared with a year ago, while light-truck sales advanced 16.7 percent, to 152,234, in the March 21-31 period. Vehicle sales totaled 381,551. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for car sales in late March was 6.2 million, compared with 5.8 million in mid-March and 6.3 million during the corresponding period last year.
For all of March, vehicle sales of all types, imported and domestic, were up 2.5 percent, to 1,104,807. The total was made up of car sales of 723,691, a drop of 1.7 percent, and light-truck sales of 381,116, an increase of 11.5 percent. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for domestic car sales for the month was six million, roughly in line with the trend of the last few months.
 
Production to Increase
 Makers of domestic cars, which consist of the Big Three as well as several Japanese auto makers, are betting that the automotive market will continue to gain strength. Production of cars during the second quarter is scheduled to rise 9 percent over last year's level, to 1,455,788; production of light trucks is scheduled to rise 13.6 percent, to 920,190.
The General Motors Corporation sold 258,313 cars in March, imported and domestic, an increase of 1.2 percent over a year ago. The Ford Motor Company sold 148,409 cars, a drop of five-tenths of a percent, and Chrysler sold 55,727 cars, almost exactly equal with last year's total.
The G.M. Oldsmobile division reported a 9 percent increase in vehicle sales, partly from the popularity of the new Achieva mid-sized model.
The Honda Motor Company sold 59,458 cars in March, a drop of 20.7 percent from a year ago; the Toyota Motor Corporation sold 73,036 cars, an increase of 9.3 percent, and the Nissan Motor Corporation sold 29,446, a drop of 9.3 percent from a year ago. The Mazda Motor Corporation sold 30,732 cars, a drop of 4.8 percent.
Toyota said its Lexus luxury division sold nearly twice as many cars during the first quarter of this year as the corresponding period a year ago.
In the light-truck segment, G.M. sold 127,062 units, imported and domestic, for the month, an increase of nine-tenths of a percent, Ford sold 119,834 light trucks, an increase of 21.3 percent, and Chrysler sold 89,476 light trucks, an increase of 25.5 percent. Toyota's light-truck sales for the month rose 21.9 percent, to 16,692, and Nissan's light-truck sales fell 11.1 percent, to 12,722.
"The truck market is much more indicative of the overall retail climate," said Robert L. Rewey, vice president of sales for Ford. He said Ford's gains in light-truck sales resulted from the auto maker's redesigned Econoline/Club Wagon, F-Series pickup trucks and Explorer utility vehicle.
Big Three auto makers were able to increase their share of the domestic car market in March to 61.5 percent from 59.8 percent a year ago. Sales of models made by Japanese auto makers, including transplants, slid to 30 percent, from 31.4 percent last year. Sales of all other imported cars dropped to 8.4 percent of the market, from 8.8 percent last year.
The Big Three also increased its share of the light-truck market, to 87.9 percent, from 85.6 percent last year. The share captured by Japanese auto makers dropped to 10.9 percent from 13.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Bias-Crime Rate Up 18%, And Juveniles Led the Surge

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 3

 BODY:
Led by a surprising number of hate crimes committed by juveniles, bias offenses increased 18 percent last year in New Jersey, despite one of the toughest laws in the nation, state officials said today.
"The perpetrators of hate crimes in New Jersey are most likely to be between the ages of 7 and 18," the head of the state's bias-crime office, Paul Goldenberg, said today as the state released its fourth annual Bias Incident Report. Officials also announced a pilot program to try to stem the increase in juvenile bias crimes. 
The report, compiled by the state police, showed that 976 bias offenses were reported in 1991, compared with 824 in 1990, and that blacks were the victims in 358 cases, or 37 percent of the total.
Mr. Goldenberg blamed "a lack of self-esteem and identity" for the increase in the number of juveniles involved in bias crimes. He said the problem was fed by parents and grew worse with the economy.
 
'Act Out Their Parents' Anger'
 "When people are out of work, they tend to vent their frustrations and anger on other groups of people, often in front of their children," he said. "The youth, in some cases, act out their parents' anger and fears by scapegoating on other people, especially minorities."
It was the fourth year in a row that reports of bias crimes had increased in New Jersey. There was an increase in the number of reports from 15 of the state's 21 counties. Increasingly, the attacks occurred on highways and in parking lots, now the second-most-common locale. The most common site was the victims' homes, the officials said. Nearly a third of the offenses took place there, and they usually involved vandalism.
Racial bias accounted for 513, or 53 percent, of the crimes in 1991, and Jews were the most frequently victimized religious group. Twenty-one incidents involved homosexuals as victims.
The bias incidents generally involved cross burnings, the painting of swastikas or graffiti and racial or religious insults delivered in person, by telephone or in letters. The report listed a lone murder, in Passaic County, as bias related.
What most surprised and worried officials was the number of young people involved. Ten juveniles younger than 10 were charged with bias crimes in 1991, and there were 173 defendants between the ages of 11 and 17, the report said.
"We are finding out that it is juveniles, and not organized hate groups, who are responsible for most of the bias crimes in New Jersey," said Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo.
Two years ago, Gov. Jim Florio signed into law the Ethnic Intimidation Act, creating what state law enforcement officials called the toughest anti-bias law in the nation. It allows a judge to give an extended prison term to anyone convicted of a crime in which ethnic or religious hate was a motivation.
Although the law applies to all defendants, it was aimed at organized hate groups, and law enforcement officials said today that it has rarely been used to prosecute juveniles.
Partly for that reason, Mr. Del Tufo announced the creation of a program to rehabilitate juveniles and their parents through "re-education."
Mr. Del Tufo said the program would be an option a judge could consider when sentencing a juvenile. The juvenile and the youth's parents would be required to attend classes and meet victims of hate crimes.

HEADLINE: Latest Fraud Preys On Loan Applicants

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Scam artists have found a new way to profit from the recession: bilking hard-pressed consumers who are looking for loans.
The ways of deception are many, but the most common is for thieves to set up a company that poses as a lender or loan broker promising a "guaranteed" loan. What's the hitch? The prospective borrowers must pay a fee up front. 
 The hoodwinked consumers never see the loan, nor do they ever see their up-front money again. On Wednesday, the police in New York arrested three Florida men who formerly ran a company called the First Southeastern Corporation, which had been based in New York. The State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, charged them with larceny of more than $900,000 from loan seekers by demanding up-front fees but never delivering the loans.
In addition, Mr. Abrams had planned to bring action against seven other companies engaged in requiring up-front fees for loans, but when he tried to serve them with legal papers he found that three had been shut by the Federal government and a fourth had disappeared. Up-front fees are illegal in New York and many other states. New York bars any advance charge for loans, except real-estate loans, and limits that charge to one half of 1 percent of the loan amount, or $50 per $10,000.
"Some companies tell you to send $250 by express mail," said Leslie Gersing, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General.
 
False Promises
 In the case of the men from First Southeastern, the Attorney General's office said they collected fees from more than 3,500 people, many of whom were attracted by ads in the Army Times and Navy Times offering "guaranteed loans." None got loans, Mr. Abrams said.
Robert L. Ellis, a lawyer for one of the three, Marc Hameroff, of Altamont, Fla., said, "these men tried to help people, who were difficult credit risks, in getting a loan." Mr. Ellis insisted that no guarantees were ever made and that his client had made his "best efforts" to obtain the loans. Mr. Hameroff and his associates, Arnold Eisenstadt and Wilfredo Gonzalez, both of Miami, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The State of New York charges that First Southeastern told its customers that it was merely a broker but had sent their applications on to loan companies, which rejected them for "insufficient income." But Mr. Abrams said the "loan companies" were First Southeastern itself.
The ploy is common, according to government officials and consumer advocates. At the New York State Banking Commission, Clare Sykes, a spokeswoman, said, "they prey on the people who are most vulnerable, people who have exhausted the traditional resources to obtain money." If a lender turns down your application for a loan, she said, the lender is required to return the application fee.
Another fraud used on credit-hungry consumers is a "900" number for loans. Callers may find it is nothing more than "someone reading a list of banks from the phone book," said Ms. Gersing of the Attorney General's office. Usually, such numbers are useless, she said.
Experts advise those seeking loans not to look for a loan from a company in another state. State banking authorities can sometimes force loan companies to make refunds, but generally the aggrieved party must complain to the authority in the lender's, not the applicant's, state. Dealing with a regulatory authority in a far-off state can be difficult.
A faraway address means potential trouble, said Carrie Getty, vice president of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. "The rule of thumb is that a lender that is 2,000 miles away isn't more likely to give you a loan than the local lender who has turned you down," she said.
The picture is made even more complicated because comparison shopping for a loan these days should in fact look beyond banks for the best deal. For example, if you are looking for a real-estate loan, independent mortgage companies, with names most people have never heard, often offer better rates.
The Better Business Bureau, one of the few sources for comparative information on consumer frauds, reported recently that personal financial services rocketed into first place in 1991 as the most inquired-about category of business, with nearly 14,000 inquiries, up from 2,800 in 1990. Complaints about financial services were also up sharply, although mail-order companies still led in the number of complaints.
 
False Identities
 Ms. Getty said that still another scam is for a company to tell an applicant that it will obtain a loan or a credit card for him despite past credit problems. "But you have to be completely honest with us," the company tells the customer, she said. The company then asks for extensive personal data, including date of birth, social security number and various account numbers. Con artists use this information to create false identities under which they obtain telephone service and rent post office boxes from which they run illegal operations.
The bureau, which has a new computer system for tracking complaints and inquiries, said in its report for 1991 that the largest number of inquiries, 11,400, concerned loan companies, up from sixth place the previous year. Banks and credit unions drew nearly 800 inquiries.
Of the five companies about which the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York received the most inquiries, four were loan companies. Two, First Southeastern, and Roman Enterprises of Staten Island, are no longer operating. Two that may still be in operation are E. Raynor & Associates and MJ Industry, both of the Bronx. All four had unsatisfactory ratings with the bureau.
Neither E. Raynor nor MJ Industry have listed telephone numbers.
 
 
 
BEING A WARY APPLICANT
 Consumers applying for a loan who wish to check out a company can call their state's banking commission. New York's, like many, will say how many complaints are outstanding against lending companies of various types, not just banks.
In addition, your local Better Business Bureau will say whether a company has a satisfactory rating. To inquire about a business in New York City or Long Island, the number is (900) 463-6222. The call costs 95 cents a minute, with an average of $3.80 a call.
Members of the public who want to inquire or complain without paying for a "900" call can write to the bureau, at 257 Park Avenue South, New York 10010.

HEADLINE: When to Wink at Price-Fixing

 BODY:
Price-fixing is a dirty word, conjuring up images of corporate C.E.O.'s conspiring against defenseless consumers. But not all price-fixing is bad.
Resale price maintenance, for instance, can help consumers. That's the practice whereby a manufacturer sets a minimum price below which retailers are not allowed to sell a product. Manufacturers like the practice, even though it is nominally illegal, to insure that retailers provide sales information. So when the Senate recently passed legislation to make prosecuting manufacturers easier, it did consumers no favor. 
 The House has passed similar legislation, but with an all-important addition. The practice is now hard to prosecute successfully. An amendment by Tom Campbell, Republican of California, would keep prosecution difficult where resale price maintenance does only good: in competitive markets.
Conspiracies among several manufacturers to set prices always harm consumers and are illegal. But resale price maintenance involves only a single manufacturer. Many economists have come to believe that the practice is generally pro-consumer. The Supreme Court has reflected this new thinking in two decisions, making prosecution more difficult. It is now harder to prove the existence of an illegal agreement. The proposed legislation would reverse the effect of these decisions.
The complaint that resale price maintenance is primarily designed to raise prices doesn't make much sense. The manufacturer could do that simply by raising the price to retailers. The practice has a subtler, better purpose.
Consider the task of marketing a computer that looks like its rivals but is technologically superior. Most customers wouldn't know the difference unless a knowledgeable salesman patiently explained it. That costs the retailer money.
Yet, once informed, customers are free to walk down the block to the neighborhood discounter. That imperils full-service dealers and high-quality manufacturers. By setting minimum prices, manufacturers could force retailers to compete for customers by offering better service.
In a market dominated by a few large sellers, manufacturers could conspire to use retail price maintenance to charge high prices. But, as Mr. Campbell observes, such conspiracies can't survive in markets with plenty of competition.
His amendment would exempt competitive companies -- sellers too small to control prices -- from the legislation. That would make prosecution difficult where price maintenance is likely to do consumers good, but easy where it could do bad.
Conferees are about to decide the fate of Mr. Campbell's amendment. Here President Bush could help out by delivering a swift veto threat: No amendment, no approval.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform Proves Sluggish

 BODY:
The 1988 Family Support Act, celebrated by liberals and conservatives alike, promised to transform welfare into a program that provides education, training and jobs to the needy rather than cash alone. So far, it hasn't worked out as its proponents had hoped.
A study released this week by two professors at the State University of New York at Albany found that states have been painfully slow to put the new program into effect -- reluctant to spend, during these recessionary times, much money on radical new programs. 
 Instead, about 40 states have decided to cut benefits and stiffen eligibility requirements. But turning harsh won't make the welfare problem disappear. It will simply make the needy more desperate than ever.
That's why the Family Support Act went a different route. The Government would provide a full welfare check if the recipient participated in training and education. Mutual obligation would replace mutual resentment. And to help the states along, Congress provided $1 billion a year to be matched with state funds.
But as the study shows, the contract hasn't so far taken hold. What got in the way was recession, which swelled welfare rolls and budget deficits. Unwilling to fork over their share, the states haven't touched 40 percent of the Federal money. State initiatives have been extremely modest.
That said, the researchers do not conclude that the law can't or won't work. After all, the program has only just begun. And states have met their enrollment goals, if only grudgingly. What's lacking, the researchers say, is any sense of urgency and excitement.
That can be remedied. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a sponsor of the 1988 law, proposes to make even more Federal money available, lower the required state contribution and boost the proportion of welfare recipients that states are required to incorporate into training and education programs. Senator Moynihan's bill, or a less expensive version, is the right response.

HEADLINE: Chilean Wineries Outgrow the Jug

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PIRQUE, Chile

 BODY:
During the day in this semiarid river valley some 20 miles south of Santiago, the sun is hot and dry. At night, a chill descends. There is little rain throughout the year, and the winters are cold.
"A perfect climate for producing very fine wine," said Eduardo Guilisasti, president of Chile's largest vineyard, Concho y Toro. "We really have it all." 
 A few years ago, that might have been hard to say. Chile made wine for hundreds of years, selling it locally and to its Latin American neighbors. But most of it was jug wine, and most of the rest was hardly appropriate to grace tables in New York, London or Montreal.
 
No. 3 Wine Exporter to U.S.
 No more. Thanks to foreign investment, Government tax breaks and a market economy that has given rise to entrepreneurship and growth, Chile has surpassed Germany to become the No. 3 exporter of wine to the United States, selling almost 1.4 million cases last year. Only Italy, with 8.1 million cases, and France, with 5.8 million, sold more.
Only seven years ago, Chilean exports of wine to the United States were so insignificant that they hardly showed up on the charts, a mere 180,000 cases, or about what a mid-size California winery produces in a year. But while Chile's market share has doubled in the last two years, those of Italy and France have fallen 40 percent. And Chilean wine importers predict that their share will rise another 30 percent this year.
Today, vineyards like Concho y Toro, which accounts for about half of the Chilean exports to the United States, are turning out cabernets, pinot noirs, merlots, chardonnays and sauvignon blancs, some of remarkable quality considering that they sell in the United States for as little as $4 a bottle.
"It's beyond what we could have imagined several years ago," Mr. Guilisasti said as he offered his vineyard's Don Melchor cabernet sauvignon, which it sells as its premium wine in the United States. "We feel Concho y Toro, and Chile as a whole, is coming into its own."
One reason for Chile's success is that much of the wine falls into the fast-growing price niches in the United States, the $4-to-$5-a-bottle bracket and the $8.50-a-bottle neighborhood.
Chile's cost advantages arise from two main sources -- labor and land. Workers are paid about one-third what they are paid in California and France. And while land suitable for vineyards sells for $1,200 to $5,500 an acre in Chile, the cost in California ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 an acre and in France from $100,000 to $140,000 an acre, industry experts say.
The result is that the merlot and cabernet produced by Concho y Toro start at about $4 a bottle, its better Don Melchor cabernet sells for around $10 to $12, its chardonnay has a $9 price tag and its brut champagne can be had for $7 a bottle.
"Our advantage is that we can produce a terrific cabernet sauvignon or chardonnay for one-half the price of a comparable California wine and one-third the price of a French wine," said Goetz von Gerdsdorff, Concho y Toro's chief oenologist.
"We sell a ton of Chilean wine," said Jeff Zacharia, vice president of Zachy's Wine and Liquor, a large merchant based in Scarsdale, N.Y. "We love it because it is a great value. No one is producing the quality and quantity of wine selling for $8 a bottle that Chile is."
"French wines are going up and up in price, and so are Italian wines to a lesser extent," Mr. Zacharia said. "And people are always going to look for value. They come in and buy a few bottles of Chilean wine and then come back and buy a few cases."
But price alone does not assure Chile of continued success. As long as it continues to bring a good value to America it should do well, wine merchants say. But as with all wine, quality can vary, and if it varies too much, wine buyers can be an unforgiving bunch. Also, some Chilean wines turned up on a Food and Drug Administration list last year with lead levels higher than Washington considers safe for drinking.
Lead damages the nervous system, bone marrow and kidneys, and has been linked to birth defects and to mental retardation in children. Lead can get into wine through the lead foil capsules used to seal bottles. The F.D.A. said it intended to ban the use of lead foil wrappers, but it has not begun the formal rule-making procedure. In California, lead wrappers were illegal as of April 1 for all newly bottled wine sold there, foreign or domestic.
The history of Chile's wine industry in recent years is not unlike that of the entire Chilean economy, often looked to as a model for development in Latin America.
The industry's success is linked to the generous tax breaks available to exporting industries, but also to the open-market economy that was passed on by the military Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and essentially unchanged by the democratically elected Government of President Patricio Aylwin.
As a consequence, more than $20 million in foreign and domestic capital has been sunk into the wine industry here in the last five years. Among prominent investors are Franciscan Vineyards in Rutherford, Calif., which bought 50 percent of Errazuriz Panquehue (pronounced Eh-rah-zoo-RIZ Pan-KAY-way) in the mid-1980's, then sold its interest and established its own vineyard with a $3.5 million investment.
More than half a dozen investment projects from French and Spanish wineries are in the works. And Robert Mondavi Winery of Oakville, Calif., is said to be currently looking for a Chilean wine venture.
But the biggest splash was created in 1988, when Baron von Rothschild, owner of the famous Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in France, bought 50 percent of Los Vascos family winery.
While some of the new money has gone into buying new vineyards, much has been put into updating and modernizing Chile's once woefully antiquated wine-making technology.
A walk through Concho y Toro's wine operation here illustrates where the money has gone. Cement vats used to ferment wines have been replaced with dozens of spanking clean stainless steel, automatically cooled vats that can produce world-class white wines.
Concho y Toro's 100-year-old behemoth wine barrels, some 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide, are now used only for jug wine production or for decoration. Stacked throughout the cellars are hundreds of small 58-gallon barrels made from American and French oak, in which the best red wines for export are aged.
French and American oak barrels, which can cost up to $900 each and impart the rich woody flavor to red wines, are considered essential for making wine that can compete with California cabernet and French Bordeaux.
Old manual presses stand as museum pieces and have been replaced by pneumatic presses. And workers no longer stick labels on and stuff corks into wine bottles by hand; assembly-line machines do everything but put the bottles into boxes.
 
Fruitier, Crisper Flavor
 The new technology has resulted in a new generation of white wines that tend to be fruitier and crisper, and red wines that are more complex, full bodied and smooth.
Undurraga Vineyards is another example of aiming at the lower end of the price range with wine of exceptional quality made with new equipment. Over the last four years, the vineyard has invested $600,000 in stainless steel vats and refrigeration units and now produces wines selling for less than $5 that critics say could match $8 to $10 California wines.
"What we offer is a fruitier, fresher flavor, something that the American wine palate seems to want," said Francisco Santelices, exporting director for the Undurraga Vineyards. "But we realize the price is a very sensitive issue. Chilean wines cannot afford to outprice themselves. "
Undurraga's exports went from 11,000 cases in 1989 to 72,000 two years later, and Mr. Santelices predicts that the winery will sell a minimum of 85,000 cases this year. It has turned down several takeover offers.
Other prime exporting vineyards include Cousino-Macul, which sells an exquisite Antigua Reserva carbernet and a Chardonnay Reserva, both for less than $10 a bottle, and Santa Rita, which markets a Medalla Real carbernet and a chardonnay, also for less than $10.
"We know we have to be very careful with the price," said Mr. Guilisasti of Concho y Toro. "The temptation at this point is to start raising prices. Other countries did that, and they made a mistake."

PAINTED LOVE
Prostitution in French Art of the Impressionist Era.
By Hollis Clayson.
Illustrated. 202 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $45. 
 AS a way of making a living in 19th-century France, prostitution was a popular choice. There were few other opportunities for an unmarried working-class woman to earn her bread and have a little fun besides. But bourgeois French men -- according to Hollis Clayson in "Painted Love" -- were terrified that the ubiquity of prostitutes would bring sexual liberation to decent women, and so a strong system of police control, which lasted from 1800 to 1946, monitored the activities of the fallen ones, creating an underclass of "deviants" in which professionals were not distinguished from amateurs.
The flamboyant presence of sex for sale in Paris made it a hot topic for (mostly male) artists and writers: Alexandre Dumas fils presented his play "La Dame aux Camelias" in 1852, Edouard Manet unveiled the nude "Olympia" in 1863, Paul Cezanne painted a series of brothels between 1870 and 1877, Edgar Degas did a group of brothel prints in the late 1870's, Emile Zola wrote "Nana" at the end of that decade and Manet painted "A Bar at the Folies-Bergere" in 1882.
For a revisionist, feminist, sociologically-oriented art historian, what better subject than this heated conjunction of art and the oldest profession? Ms. Clayson -- an associate professor of art history at Northwestern University and a former student of T. J. Clark (a professor of art history at the University of California at Berkeley and the guru of French 19th-century revisionism) -- tackles it with gusto, but also a heavy overdose of academic jargon. What she's out to prove is that artists, even the most avant-garde of them, helped perpetuate the popular view of prostitutes (to whom she refers as "sexual workers") as a sub-human species endangering the social order.
Analyzing the production of painters ranging from schmaltzy Salonists like Henri Gervex, whose superheated canvas "Rolla" showed a young male aristocrat as the victim of a lowdown temptress, to haute avant-gardists -- Cezanne, Degas and Manet -- Ms. Clayson concludes that even the work of what she calls the most "modern" practitioners fails to contradict popular sexual stereotypes. Take what she calls that "widely admired icon of modernist uncertainty," Manet's famous painting "A Bar at the Folies-Bergere," with its double image of a waitress. Although the painting has hitherto gone unnoticed as an antifemale tract and has even been considered a defense of working-class women, Ms. Clayson, following her mentor, Mr. Clark, makes the case that Manet's "deadpan" treatment of his subject raises moralistic questions about her sexuality.
The painting presents a frontal view of a woman behind the bar at a busy nightclub. Her expression is guarded; her eyes do not indicate that she is talking with anyone. But the reflection of her back, in a wide mirror behind her, shows that she is addressing a male customer. According to Ms. Clayson, "the possible double profession of the barmaid -- serving and prostitution -- was clear to observers in 1882," since one image of the barmaid is "cool, detached, aloof," and the other, which puts the woman in a subservient position to the man, hints at a sexual transaction. While Manet's ambiguity is essentially modernist, Ms. Clayson holds, at the same time his raising the question "Was she or wasn't she?" actually helped reinforce stereotypical thinking about prostitutes and intensified the public perception of them as commodities rather than women. But couldn't Manet's work also be read a comment on what the working girl -- greedily ogled by her customer -- was subjected to by her exposure in a public bar?
As for Degas, although he broke with Salon cliches about courtesans by depicting them as decidedly not sirenlike, and with apish faces, they were in his eyes "objective commercialized matter" and he presented them "not only as sexual deviants but as threatening social deviants," Ms. Clayson writes. Still, she observes, Degas in his monotypes also made the male clients complicit by projecting them as "buyers in a sexual market." He attacked their fantasies of control over prostitutes by indicating that the "psychic advantage was actually (only) economic." (Later, in a 20th-century reprise of Degas's brothel prints, Picasso took a giant step backward, she adds, demonstrating "the ultimate misogynistic cultural perception": assuming that all sexual women were prostitutes.)
What's more, Ms. Clayson surmises that certain of the Degas prints show that, despite his disgust with what she calls the "commodified" women (meaning those he regarded as commodities rather than individuals), the artist shared the cultivated male's attraction to certain portions of their anatomy, notably their buttocks, which he rendered with obvious zest.
The idea of exploring public attitudes toward prostitution through the art of the period is a provocative one. Yet Ms. Clayson's heavy political agenda leads her into highly debatable assumptions. It could be argued, for instance, that it is not the "canny masculine achievements" of Manet and other French avant-gardists that, as she says, helps to explain their popularity, but their talents as painters. After all, how can we expect politically correct thinking from artists whom we cherish for their "ambiguity"? And is it reasonable to expect that artists, even the most avant-garde of them, will be immune to the faults of their society?
MS. CLAYSON is on firmer ground when she uses her art-historical scholarship to provide a wealth of information about the workings of the 19th-century Parisian social order. She describes in detail, for instance, the system of police regulation of prostitutes and its "definition of female sexuality solely in relation to the needs and desires of men." In a chapter on working women, she reminds us that single or married ones who had jobs outside the home often took to prostitution to eke out their miserable salaries. Hat stores in particular were seen as dens of iniquity; Renoir -- for one -- in a painting on the theme suggested "his ease with a definition of the millinery shop as a place of female scheming and collusion, where the groundwork might have been laid for sexual dealings." (But here again, assumption looms. Note the tricky wording: "His ease with a definition," "the groundwork might have been laid.") Although he and other avant-gardists did not depict the shopgirls as sexual commodities, the elliptical way in which they did present them, Ms. Clayson insists, helped to reinforce the belief that working-class females were sexually unstable.
In short, Ms. Clayson does well at describing a societal problem -- coping with prostitution by declaring the victims an underclass subject to humiliating regulation. Where she is on shakier ground is in trying to establish the complicity of artists. And she does not help her case by cloaking her insights and information with politically correct revisionist jargon.

Rich in Time
The basic difference between our acquisitive societies and those of hunter-gatherers isn't a matter of sophistication, Juliet B. Schor suggests, but of desires. This is from "The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure" (Basic Books). 

Faith in progress is deep within our culture. We have been taught to believe that our lives are better than those who came before us. The ideology of modern economics suggests that material progress has yielded enhanced satisfaction and well-being. But much of our confidence about our own well-being comes from the assumption that our lives are easier than those of earlier generations or other cultures. . . . The lives of so-called primitive peoples are commonly thought to be harsh -- their existence dominated by the "incessant quest for food." In fact, primitives do little work. By contemporary standards, we'd have to judge them extremely lazy. If the Kapauku of Papua work one day, they do no labor on the next. !Kung Bushmen put in only two and a half days per week and six hours per day. . . . The key to understanding why these "stone age peoples" fail to act like us -- increasing their work effort to get more things -- is that they have limited desires. In the race between wanting and having, they have kept their wanting low -- and, in this way, insure their own kind of satisfaction.
 
Love's Crowded Bed
 Around the beds of longtime lovers hover many ghosts, as this excerpt from a monologue by Joan Logghe about a farmer's wife reflecting on her marriage illustrates. It is included in "The Unmade Bed: Sensual Writing on Married Love," edited by Laura Chester (HarperCollins).
 
 When you know somebody that deeply, so many bodies lie in the bed alongside. We need a king-sized bed to contain them. Our bed is full of farmland, 200 acres including the back pasture. And you know, that is where the best sex always is, despite the scent of cows. The Jungians say that in bed there are always at least four people, invisible man and dark surly woman. But in our bed there is a herd -- siblings and offspring, his parents, my parents, and the church, full of incense and Latin. My temple, so old it's got the history of God engraved in the bedsheets. It isn't a bed, it's a text, a Russian novel.
 
The Mirror of Our Age
 Jonathan Raban reminds us that our view of the natural world, far from being an exact rendering, is shaped by each age's hopes and needs. This is from his introduction to "The Oxford Book of the Sea" (Oxford University).
 
 The sea is one of the most "universal" symbols in literature; it is certainly the most protean. It changes in response to shifts of sensibility as dramatically as it does to shifts of wind and the changes of the moon. The sea in 18th-century literature is one place, the sea in 19th-century literature quite another; as the American sea is importantly different from the British sea. Conrad's title for his collection of maritime essays, "The Mirror of the Sea," puts it nicely: the writer who goes to sea finds himself confronting a disturbed reflection of his own age, personality and preoccupations. The sea in literature is not a verifiable object, to be described, with varying degrees of success and shades of emphasis, by writers of different periods; it is, rather, the supremely liquid and volatile element, shaping itself newly for every writer and every generation.
 
The Art of Knowing How
 Baltasar Gracian (1601-58), a Spanish Jesuit, offered a succinct and still pertinent argument for injecting a touch of the practical into our affairs in his collection of maxims "The Art of Worldly Wisdom: A Pocket Oracle," translated by Christopher Maurer (Doubleday).
 
 Not everything should be speculation; you must also act. The wisest are easiest to deceive: they may know extraordinary things, but they know nothing of life's ordinary necessities. The contemplation of sublime things keeps them from lowly, easy ones, and because they don't know the first things about living -- an area where everyone else is so sharp -- they are either marveled over or considered ignorant by the superficial crowd. So let the wise have a touch of the practical, enough not to be deceived or mocked. Know how to get things done: it may not be the highest thing in life, but it is the most necessary. What good is knowledge if it isn't practical? These days true knowledge lies in knowing how to live.
 
An Orchestra of Angels
 In the scramble to explain the dazzling originality of Mozart's music, commentators have often turned to heaven for an analogy, as Wolfgang Hildesheimer points out in this excerpt from "Mozart" (Noonday, paper).
 
 The theologian Karl Barth . . . imagines that the angels, left to themselves, play Mozart, and that the dear Lord likes especially to listen to them then. I am a stranger to those spheres, but can visualize a pretty picture: I see God like Rembrandt's Saul enjoying the music of David's harp, lost in the thought that one ought perhaps to have done something for this divine musician during his earthly life. Musicians, too, have availed themselves of the analogy with divine realms: "Others may reach heaven with their works. But Mozart, he comes, he comes from there!" This exclamation, with its rhetorical repetition, also reveals an emotional relationship to its object rather than a valid statement about it. . . . And yet we must admit that, on some uncomfortably irrational level, we apprehend what is meant: recognition of the miraculous quality in Mozart, the deepest reason for all work about him, a reason so deep that its premise is beyond thought.

HEADLINE: College vs. Community: The Civil Wars

BYLINE: By William Celis 3d

 BODY:
IN THE MIDDLE of the night, residents in a toney Coral Gables, Fla., neighborhood have been awakened by University of Miami students celebrating too loudly. The residents have grumbled to city officials about finding fraternity members passed out on their front lawns, apparently from too much revelry the night before.
But the breaking point came with the university's proposed expansion under its master plan. After three years of negotiations, Coral Gables officials approved the plan last December; residents, however, did not. Last month they filed a lawsuit in Dade County Circuit Court, charging that the master plan violates the zoning code by proposing dormitory-style housing near single-family homes. 
 "How the university can think people will live with this and not do anything about it is beyond me," said John G. Fletcher, a lawyer representing the irate residents in the suit, which names both the city and the uni-
versity as defendants.
Like Coral Gables and the University of Miami, many other towns and universities throughout the nation are clashing over a host of nettlesome issues, casting a pall over relationships that have always been tenuous. Residents in university towns grouse about traffic and litter generated by students. Universities complain about rigid zoning codes that bar or stymie growth and development. Town councils complain, particularly in these recessionary times, that public universities are not required to pay local taxes, even though towns finance street maintenance, mass transit and other services used by university populations.
The universities counter that they are good neighbors and major employers, and that the towns derive other benefits because of their presence.
"The problem is we're looking at two different entities with two different missions," said Donna London, a researcher at the Strom Thurmond Institute for Government and Public Affairs at Clemson University in South Carolina who studied so-called town-gown relations in 26 university hometowns and cities nationwide. "One of them is having to answer to a very large body of students and you have the city trying to answer to taxpayers. When you are dealing in close proximity with one another, sometimes toes get stepped on."
Relations in some places have so soured that lawsuits are becoming a common form of town-gown communication. Northwestern University, for example, filed suit against Evanston, Ill., over the city's plan to levy its hotel and motel tax on the university's management center, where visiting corporate executives live and take classes. Last November the Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor of the university.
In Malibu, Calif., a group of residents took Pepperdine University to court trying to block the university's proposed expansion along the coast. The residents have twice appealed court verdicts in the case, which is now before California's Second District Court of Appeals.
Sometimes communities have not one but two or more universities with which to contend. Cambridge, Mass., one of the best known of the academically well endowed, has engaged in skirmishes and full-fledged battles with Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over a host of issues, from development to compensation for services rendered to the municipal dangers posed by university lab experi-
ments. "Each university has had its periods of ups and downs with the city," said James Maloney, the city's finance director.
Even when a community has invited university involvement, friction sometimes results. For example, after Boston University assumed management of the troubled Chelsea, Mass., school system at Chelsea's request three years ago, animosity flared among some teachers who thought the university was too heavy-handed and residents who thought it too arrogant.
Universities, for their part, are slowly but increasingly recognizing the tense nature of the town-gown relationship and are taking action. Some have agreed with local officials to make annual contributions in lieu of taxes or to help buy equipment for the city. In Columbia, Mo., the University of Missouri contributed enough money recently to remodel a fire station that serves the university.
Other institutions have embarked on projects with widespread community appeal. In Greeley, Colo., the University of Northern Colorado, the city and the business community have come together to help address the public school dropout rate.
Behind these efforts are formal agreements struck between universities and their communities. In addition, the National League of Cities in recent years has established a standing committee on university-town issues, a reflection, many say, of the growing importance of these relationships. "Obviously universities are a large asset to communities," said Mary Anne McCollum, the Mayor of Columbia, Mo., and chairwoman of the league's university-town caucus. But Ms. McCollum said the caucus increasingly was looking at ways to lessen the financial onus of being a college town or a univer-city.
 
Social Worries: Differences in Life Style
 From parties to student behavior to parking to housing, life-style differences tend to be the biggest town-gown issue. The existence of multifamily dwellings (home to students) amid single-family houses (home to what some residents think of as normal people) has generated sparks too. The resulting traffic congestion, lack of parking and presence of litter have angered permanent residents, prompting some cities to take action.
In Seattle, the University Park neighborhood just north of the University of Washington became so clogged with student resident and nonresident vehicles, some parked in front of private homes, that residents complained about having to park blocks from where they live and walk home at night -- an arrangement that single working women considered unsafe. So the city initiated a neighborhood parking permit plan, requiring both townspeople and students living in the neighborhood to pay $27 a year for the privilege of parking there. Neither students nor residents were happy about the cost. "But generally I believe that residents are pleased with the results because it has cut down on the amount of traffic and parking in the neighborhood," said Robert H. Hardy, a member of the neighborhood association board.
The sprinkling of fraternity houses throughout residential neighborhoods continues to bedevil university towns. In Ann Arbor, Mich., the decibel level of fraternity parties in areas abutting the University of Michigan became so high that residents complained to fraternities. When those protests failed, residents complained to city officials and the university.
"We have our problems," said Walter Harrison, the university's executive director of university relations. And one of those problems -- loud students -- "is a timeless irritant."
As a result the Noisy Party Task Force, comprising representatives of the city, the university, residents and fraternities, was formed last spring to find a solution. Residents went for the jugular; in the initial agreement stiff fines and even jail sentences were proposed for repeat noise offenders.
"There is a fair amount of animosity between the neighborhood and certain fraternities," said Matthew Commers, past president of the Interfraternity Council, a student group that oversees the university's 37 fraternities and a task force member. "The problems would begin with irate neighbors calling at night to a fraternity house and having the phone answered rudely."
Fraternity members, with the university's help, succeeded in eliminating jail sentences from the final pact; it calls for citations with cash fines that increase with repeated offenses. "We are desperately trying to change things here," said Mr. Commers, adding that the pact is a step in the right direction.
 
How Universities Affect the Economy
 If life style is the ranking issue, a university's effect on the local economy is a close second. The University of Michigan and the city of Ann Arbor no sooner set limits on fraternity party noise when another issue surfaced: the city's fiscal contribution to the university's well-being. "Without the University of Michigan, the city of Ann Arbor would be completely bereft of its economic base," said Mayor Elizabeth S. Brater. "Having said that, we have to pay for services for which we are not adequately reimbursed." The city, for example, is spending $4.3 million for fire protection in the current fiscal year ending June 30. Of that amount, $1.8 million is spent to protect the university's 2,607-acre campus.
In an unusual arrangement, the city receives some aid under a state reimbursement plan designed to help defray the cost of fire protection for the university. But Mayor Brater said the Legislature in recent years had allocated only 47 percent of the money authorized by the legislation for the reimbursement plan.
"Relations between universities and their towns are always going to be contentious," said Mr. Harrison, the university's executive director for relations. "It's my personal contention that the current economic climate has made universities tempting targets for towns. Universities are under the same financial pressure as everyone else, but we appear to be more prosperous." That perception, he said, is untrue.
Economic issues have also surfaced when universities establish bookstores, bowling alleys and eating establishments that compete with local businesses. That's the rub in Blacksburg, Va., where Virginia Tech University recently opened a "food court," where several restaurants operate under the same roof.
"That has taken traffic away from the town, and merchants are not very happy," said Thomas G. Goodale, the vice president for student affairs, who also handles calls from community residents. The town proposed to increase a local meals tax on prepared food and drink to 4 percent from 3 percent, but the university, as a state agency, is exempt from local taxes.
Merchants who run downtown restaurants and stores won a point when the university agreed to remove advertising for the food court and other university-based businesses like the bookstore from the downtown area and from the town's two newspapers. But the sour feelings persist because the food court is just the latest economic slap at a town buffeted by the recession and the loss of about 400 jobs. "All this together spells tension," said Mr. Goodale.
 
The Politics of Town-Gown Contention
 To no one's surprise, the economic and social contention between universities and towns has generated political friction. To the clashes over university expansion plans and zoning codes can now be added student involvement in local politics.
Some communities have made it difficult for students to register to vote in local elections by holding voter registration drives during summer months or, as several New York State college towns have done, by attempting to impose extra conditions on voters.
In Syracuse, for example, students were required over the last several years to fill out a three-page questionnaire in addition to the normal registration requirements to determine whether their primary residence was their college address. If not, they were not allowed to register. The questionnaires, initiated by Onondaga County, were discontinued in January.
A bill approved last month by the New York State Assembly would force the rescinding of all such election codes that discriminate against students. The legislation, however, is not expected to receive Senate approval because of strong opposition from many college communities.
"It's not that towns don't want students voting on campus," said Jerry Koenig, a legislative specialist for the New York Assembly's election-law committee. "They don't want them voting period. A lot of these towns are paranoid that the students will overwhelm the other voters. They're afraid that what happened in Ann Arbor will happen in their towns."
Student turnout from the University of Michigan there has occasionally tilted elections in favor of student candidates for local office, electing people whose views are more in tune with the university than with the permanent residents.
However, anecdotal evidence from nearly 20 college towns suggests that fears of student voters regularly altering local election results are unfounded. Student candidates have just as often lost political races. And even when they win office, they often confront the hostility of permanent residents.
"Some of them told me I had no right to represent them since I'm not from the area," said Scott J. Ziance, a 21-year-old junior at Bowling Green University in Ohio who is from Altoona, Pa. Despite the resentments, Mr. Ziance was elected to the Bowling Green City Council last November as a Republican, beating another student and the Democratic incumbent, an education professor at the university.
Since his election, Mr. Ziance says, fellow Council members have been supportive. "People have begun to realize that not all college students are bad," he said. "And I think that students are beginning to see that not all town people have a negative view of them."
 
Pulling Together: Solutions in Action
 Students elected to city councils are part of a detente that is gathering momentum and is rooted in the belief that universities and towns can work together for mutual benefit. Increasingly, task forces and committees are being considered or have been established in university towns to tackle housing problems, life style differences and economic worries.
For example, discussions are under way between Arizona State University and Tempe city officials to establish a standing committee that would meet regularly to discuss issues affecting both entities.
And the University of California at Berkeley, under an agreement that went into effect in 1990, will pay the city of Berkeley $24 million over a 15-year period to help buy fire trucks and pay for sewage costs and other services that the city provides without charge.
Although such university largess is still rare, more universities are engaging in community outreach projects of some kind. In Clemson, S.C., town residents can use the nursing services at Clemson University for a minimal charge. In New York City, students at Co-
lumbia University's Graduate School of Business are helping Harlem residents with their taxes. In New Haven, Conn., Yale University has established a center designed to help public school teachers update themselves about curriculum and other education issues.
Many of the universities or town-university partnerships address education issues. The University of Northern Colorado's participation in Greeley's dropout prevention program is a case in point. It is one of the projects the university and the city embarked on together in a relationship that both sides assert is becoming stronger. The next step, according to Greeley's Mayor, William J. Horton, is to explore the economics of the relationship. Both the university and the city maintain parks, Mr. Horton said, and the cost of maintenance should be shared to save tax dollars.
"It would save a lot of money," said Mr. Horton, who added that he has been pushing hard to share infrastructure costs and other services. "We need to pull together."

HEADLINE: Lean and Mean Is Foreign to Schools

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr

 BODY:
THE DEBATE over education spending in the United States is often a hostage to ideology. Liberals see rundown schools, tattered textbooks and beleaguered teachers -- a system starved for resources. Conser-
vatives see rising education budgets and international comparisons showing that America is a big spender yet its students are underachievers -- a system bloated with waste and inefficiency.
But the two sides do find common ground in the view that how the nation's education dollars are spent may be as important as how much is spent. President Bush has declared that "dollar bills don't educate students." Yet even Chester E. Finn Jr., a professor at Vanderbilt University and a chief architect of the Bush Administration's education strategy, conceded: "We're going to spend more on education in this country -- there's no doubt about that. But people like me want to make sure the dollars are spent where it counts, so that kids learn more." 
 The case for reform is a strong one. Study after study, typically at the school district or state level, has found that an increasing share of education spending has nothing to do with the classroom. In Georgia, for example, the percentage of education spending on classroom instruction fell from 77 percent in 1970 to 52 percent in 1990, according to a recent report by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a research group. The foundation, based in suburban Atlanta, cited ever-higher administrative costs as a key culprit.
A recent report by the Business Council of New York State titled "The $11-Billion Mystery" also singled out swollen bureaucracy as an explanation for where the big increase in the state's annual education budget since 1980 was spent.
 
Declining Percentages
 Nationally the picture is much the same, though the most reliable national statistics are in head counts, not dollars. From 1950 to 1989 the portion of total staff members in the nation's public schools who were teachers declined from 70 percent to 53 percent, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, the Department of Education's number-gathering unit. The other large category of personnel, "support staff" -- a catch-all grouping that includes secretaries, custodians, food service workers, nurses, bus drivers, accountants and computer programmers, grew from 23 percent in 1950 to 31 percent of the education work force by 1989. Teacher's aides, who proliferated from 1.7 percent in 1970 to 8 percent in 1989, followed by principals and assistant principals, school district administration and other categories accounted for the remainder.
Many experts agree that the "middle management" ranks of the education system -- the layers of people between the school principal and the school board -- have grown partly through bureaucratic inertia and could be trimmed back. The middle management jobs would include business managers, teaching supervisors, compliance officers, directors of special education programs and others. The advocates of this kind of streamlining compare it to the so-called restructuring process that corporate America has been going through in recent years to become more efficient and competitive enterprises.
In the business world, the justification for operating with fewer people in middle management posts is that the information-gathering work traditionally performed by these people can now be done by computers and that having more decisions made by the salespeople and factory workers closest to the customers will result in better decisions.
"The education world simply hasn't gone through that process yet," said Harold Howe 2d, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "And it is the real hope for saving money, especially in large school districts."
Still, cutting the education bureaucracy may be more difficult than it seems at first glance: What fueled its growth were the twin requirements for federally and state-mandated special education programs for the handicapped, the disadvantaged and students in need of bilingual instruction, along with offices set up to administer those programs. The oversight and staff were added in the name of public accountability.
 
Bigger Tasks
 Some layers of administration can be pared down, experts say, but much of the growth results from America's schools being asked to handle a larger population of children whose parents are poor, uneducated and may have drug or alcohol problems. "These are the problems you get when you have more and more children living in poverty," said Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit research organization. "The schools didn't create those problems, but they are being forced to deal with the results."
Besides thinning out management ranks, the other major target for savings in public schools is basic support functions such as custodial work, food service and clerical help. The recent controversy over the pay levels for custodians in New York City's public schools -- average pay $58,000 a year, more than the teachers' top-scale pay of $52,750 -- seemed to underline how inept school districts can be in purchasing basic services.
 
Nationwide Problem
 The same problem exists nationwide, according to David Bennett, president of Education Alternatives Inc., a consulting firm that privately manages public schools in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. Mr. Bennett, a former superintendent of schools in St. Paul, says that school districts typically pay far more for custodians, secretaries and food service workers than people in those occupations receive in the private sector, from 50 to 100 percent more.
Strong unions, he says, are only part of the explanation for generous compensation. "The main reason is that you have almost a complete lack of management scrutiny of these services," Mr. Bennett said. To trim those costs, school districts are increasingly opening those services to bids from private contractors, bringing the benefits of market competition.
Some education experts are skeptical of the effort to transplant business techniques to school districts, noting that various management nostrums have been tried over the years and the current enthusiasm is merely the latest fashion. Others disagree, saying that past efforts tended to deal with the style of school administration, but left the bureaucratic monopoly in place. "The capacity to save large amounts of money by cutting back nonclassroom spending is clearly there," Mr. Bennett said. "But the real question is whether the political will exists to change things, whether at the district school board level or nationally."

HEADLINE: Separation Anxiety

BYLINE: By Roberto Suro

 BODY:
WHEN A SMALL university is situated in a small town, the relationship between them can be defined by a few individuals, especially if they are extraordinary people. That seems to be the case for Southwestern University and Georgetown, a little town in central Texas.
With just 1,200 students, Southwestern is tiny compared with public institutions like the University of Texas at Austin, 30 miles away, which has an enrollment of some 47,500. In Georgetown, however, with a population of just 14,800, Southwestern is the largest employer, the biggest budget and the most extensive landowner. 
 Ostensibly the university ought to be an overwhelming factor in Georgetown's life. But even here there are impermeable membranes between town and gown. Differences in goals, constituencies and mindsets create barriers, as they do for most universities and their municipalities. But in this case, the small scale means that individuals who cross the barriers can do so with dramatic effect.
Esther Weir, who went to Georgetown in 1938 to teach women's physical education at Southwestern and has been active at the university and in the town ever since, describes the relationship through three such individuals -- all women.
 
Three Quietly Effective Lives
 There was Laura Kuykendall, dean of women who from the 1910's through the 1930's organized flamboyant May Fair celebrations that drew visitors to the town by the trainload. From 1948 to 1965, when local schools were still segregated, Iola Bowden, a music professor, ran the Negro School of Fine Arts, bringing black students to a Methodist church to learn piano and other artistic skills with her university students serving as teachers. "It wasn't exactly a secret," Mrs. Weir said, "but it had to be done quietly and it affected many lives."
Finally, there is Martha Mitten Allen, who has taught history at the university since 1960 and is currently the department chairwoman. In 1983 she organized Handicrafts Unlimited as an outlet for arts and crafts produced by Georgetown area residents age 50 and older. Their creations are sold at a store on the town square. Last year more than 400 artisans contributed while 50 volunteers from the university and the town ran the store.
The links between town and university predate Dean Kuykendall, and the nature of those links seem to be more durable than her May Fair celebrations. They began in 1869, when Texas Methodists were looking for a place to build a university and Georgetown competed with other towns for the site. During the Depression local merchants accepted the scrip issued by the university to faculty members when it was virtually broke, and ended up forgiving many of their debts.
This symbiotic history set the stage for current town-gown dealings. The university's library, for example, was built as a project of the Works Progress Administration during the Depression with the stipulation that local residents could use it; the tradition continues. The university also has a history of collaborative efforts with local schools, such as "Operation Achievement," in which 40 junior high school students come to the campus once a week for tutoring.
Still, there are inevitable distances between Georgetown and Southwestern, highlighted during the 1980's when each set out to define a new identity.
Southwestern has spent the last 10 years working to make itself a liberal arts college of national repute, and it has largely succeeded. The endowment was tripled to exceed $125 million, and faculty salaries were boosted to competitive levels. The academic mission was more tightly focused as the number of degrees offered was cut from nine to four. Teaching was emphasized over scholarship, and the size of the student body rose from just under 1,000 to the 1,200 target. The number of applicants has since jumped 130 percent, allowing the university to be ever more selective in admissions.
This success has not come without some cost to the university's relationship with Georgetown. "The big impacts on the town are positive, and the university is so important here that nobody likes to talk about the negatives," said the head of a local business who asked not to be identified. "But it's clear that the university's priorities have changed and that Georgetown just isn't as important to them as it used to be."
 
'Little Things That Add Up'
 This longtime resident complained that on several recent occasions people at the university had committed themselves to help with local projects only to back out later. "It's little things that add up to an impression that as an institution Southwestern doesn't see itself tied to Georgetown on an everyday basis anymore, even though on some major issues, like economic development, it really does deliver," said the business owner.
Roy B. Shilling Jr., who as university president since 1981 has led its move to establish a national reputation, generally acknowledges the changed focus. "In several important ways we have redefined the meaning of town and gown for Southwestern," he said. "Our hometown is here and we have deep roots in this community, but our mandate in recent years has been to develop and expand our ties to constituencies in every major city in Texas and across the country. In many ways Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are our towns as well as Georgetown."
While Southwestern was broadening its horizons, Georgetown was coping with the boom and bust of the 1980's Texas economy. The population grew more than 50 percent, to 14,800 from 9,800 inhabitants, and it struggled to avoid becoming an Austin suburb.
Once an important way station for cattle drivers on the Chisholm Trail, Georgetown had suffered the economic decline experienced by many small towns during the mid-1900's. By the late 1970's many buildings on Main Street and on the courthouse square were deteriorating; some were boarded up.
Those structures, most dating from 1885 to 1905, became the focus of Georgetown's effort to retain a small-town identity. Ornate limestone facades were restored as part of an $8 million project that renovated some 50 buildings between 1983 and 1986. Now the square is lined with restaurants, shops and professional offices.
The university played no role in this project, but was drafted into a campaign to draw new businesses to Georgetown. On June 1, 1989, Mr. Shilling signed a resolution committing the university to support the town's economic development plan, making specific promises to do things like putting on receptions to promote the city to industrial prospects. By all accounts the promises have been kept.
Still, in Georgetown personal rather than institutional initiatives often produce the clearest results. For one example, since 1988 Southwestern has helped the local school raise $325,000 in foundation money for "Partners in Reading," a joint computer-based program that helps develop verbal skills in those from kindergarten age to adults who did not complete high school. That program grew out of a late-night phone call from Mr. Shilling welcoming a new school superintendent.

HEADLINE: Industrial Revolution

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, in a town-gown relationship, the gown can remake the town and become more stylish itself. Ask George Bugliarello.
In his 18 years as president of what is now Polytechnic University in downtown Brooklyn, Mr. Bugliarello has shepherded the institution and the neighborhood through a $1 billion-plus construction program called Metrotech -- a 16-acre, university-corporate park that has risen in what was once a rundown neighborhood. 
 The development, one of several projects that herald the rebirth of downtown Brooklyn as a business and commercial district, is considered by many people in academia, real estate and government to be a prime example of how a university can improve its environment, and by doing so enhance its own image.
Metrotech includes four new commercial buildings with 2.9 million square feet of office space. The Brooklyn campus of Polytechnic, which consisted largely of a converted and modernized 150-year-old razor-blade factory, has a new, $42 million library that includes the New York State Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications.
Plans call for more commercial buildings, a total of five million square feet of office space, the bringing of 16,000 jobs to the area and the continued renovation and expansion of the university, which is generally rated in the top 5 percent academically of all United States colleges and universities.
"The Metrotech complex has really provided a wonderful foundation for the redevelopment of downtown Brooklyn," said Robert B. Catell, president and chief executive officer of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, a participant in the complex. "It has brought together the business community and the education community and offered a wonderful alternative for firms that are thinking of leaving the city."
The genesis of Metrotech can be traced to the early 1970's, when Mr. Bugliarello was dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. He and the college received a National Science Foundation grant to study the role of engineering schools in the community.
"We came to the conclusion that indeed the engineering schools were potentially a good resource for the community," Mr. Bugliarello said.
In 1973, before the report was finished, he became president of Polytechnic. There he found that before he could act on the report's conclusions he would have to help Polytechnic emerge from "a very difficult time."
Founded in 1854 as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute, the university had been known as Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and was renowned for its distinguished faculty. Budget problems surfaced in the late 1960's, the result of cuts in Federal support and a decline in engineering enrollment nationally.
In 1973, just as Mr. Bugliarello was taking over the reins, Polytechnic was forced to merge with New York University's School of Engineering and Science in the Bronx. He and his staff began an intensive student recruitment program, initiated large-scale fund-raising and started an undergraduate engineering program at Polytechnic's Long Island campus in Farmingdale.
In 1975 Mr. Bugliarello proposed to the board of trustees creating a university-industry park in the university's Brooklyn neighborhood, which at the time was a rundown area. "It was difficult to attract students," he said. "It was costing us faculty. Crime has never been too high here, but it was more the perception of a lack of safety than the actual lack of safety."
At the board's behest, he said, "we then started looking for what kind of industry made sense to us."
New York had a powerful industry, but it was not a traditional one -- the use of information and telecommunications in the financial sector, and more generally in the service sector.
 
City Began to Move in Early 80's
 Mr. Bugliarello assembled a team for the project. Providing political savvy was Seymour Scher, former Deputy Comptroller of New York City; he became a senior vice president of the university and president of the Metrotech Corporation, a Polytechnic affiliate.
In early talks with New York City and New York State, Mr. Bugliarello said, "we got very little attention." But in the early 1980's, the city decided to stem what was becoming a major outflow of jobs, primarily to New Jersey, and to create more jobs in the outer boroughs. The city told Polytechnic that if it could find interested companies, discussions could begin about developing the area.
Mr. Catell of Brooklyn Union, who was on the university's board, was interested because the company's building was too constraining. Brooklyn Union gave Mr. Bugliarello a letter of intent saying it would move if other companies came. The Securities Industry Automation Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York and American Stock Exchanges that processes financial transactions, also gave a letter of intent.
It was 1982, and after seeing the letters the city gave the university the go-ahead, "provided we build 350,000 square feet of commercial space, put up an additional academic facility and find a commercial co-developer," Mr. Bugliarello said.
No one in New York was interested. "So we looked at a developer in Cleveland, Forest City Ratner Companies, which had worked on a large industrial park at M.I.T," he said. Forest City is owned by the family of a former New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Bruce C. Ratner. The company agreed.
Meanwhile, New York State was anxious to build regional centers for advanced technology at universities statewide. In 1983, it designated Polytechnic home of the Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications and threw in its financial weight -- a long-term, interest-free $16.5 million loan.
In June 1987, after a three-year study, the New York City Board of Estimate approved Metrotech, which is between the access ramps to the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. To make the complex more attractive, the city has provided $325 million in subsidies, including site improvements; a 13-year exemption from real estate taxes on new buildings; a 12-year elimination of the commercial rent tax, and a 12-year corporate tax credit of $500 a year for every employee moved to Brooklyn.
As with many redevelopment projects, there were protests. All, however, were settled.
In November 1988, the Chase Manhattan Corporation agreed to shift what is now 6,000 employees to two Metrotech buildings, which are to be completed this spring. With last October's announcement by Bear, Stearns & Company, the financial concern, that it was moving 1,500 employees to Metrotech, the first two buildings have been fully leased. Polytechnic's Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology was completed in February. In the middle of it all is a 3.3-acre, tree-lined commons, the center of a quadrangle that is two sides university, two sides business.
"The creation of Metrotech has given us a campus," Mr. Bugliarello said. "There is no longer that sense of depression, that perception of fear. And it shows that a university can help its community, and at the same time help itself."

HEADLINE: Universities Grope For Lost Image

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
WITH ONE of New Jersey's state colleges named for his family, it is only natural that former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, now the president of Drew University, should be more sensitive than most university officials to the public's image of higher education.
Recently Mr. Kean addressed 400 educators in Philadelphia and leveled with them about how colleges and universities, including Kean College of New Jersey, are now perceived by the public.
 
Ivory Tower Besieged
 "Here is the reality, plain and simple," he told his audience. "Our ivory tower is under siege. People are questioning our mission and questioning who we are. They claim we cost too much, spend carelessly, teach poorly, plan myopically, and when we are questioned, we act defensively." 
 Higher education may have been the last great institution in American society to enjoy unstinting public trust -- but no more. Now, like medicine, religion and other important and once revered fields, higher education is discovering how difficult, and how costly, it can be to be scorned. Louis Harris, the public opinion pollster who has been tracking confidence in public institutions since 1966, says that trust in universities has been ebbing over the last five years. Now, only 25 percent of those polled say they have a great deal of confidence in the people running higher education, as against a high point of 56 percent in 1966.
"Universities did better than other institutions for a while," Mr. Harris said in an interview, "but now they're coming back to the pack."
The loss of public trust has been most dramatic in public higher education. Until the end of the 1980's, the state university systems had enjoyed more than 30 years of steady financial support.
The economic recession of the last few years would have forced the states to moderate spending anyway, but as universities' image grew darker it became easier for legislators to target professors who seemed underworked and administrative staffs that appeared to be bloated. In almost every state, the universities are getting a shrinking percentage of the state's overall spending, an indication, many say, of a public perception that higher education has grown fat.
Part of the reason for universities' unpopularity is a string of unsavory episodes. These include college athletics scandals over point-shaving and improper recruiting; the controversy over the inclusion of non-Western authors in humanities curriculums at the expense of traditional Western figures; a United States Justice Department antitrust suit against Ivy League colleges, which were accused of colluding on financial aid grants; and the disclosure -- for many, the last straw -- that Stanford and other universities had improperly charged the Federal Government for indirect research expenditures that included the upkeep of a yacht and the purchases of personal furniture and flowers.
 
University-Bashing
 Tainted by such allegations and by lingering suspicions among parents and legislators that tuition hikes are not justified, most colleges and universities have indeed come under siege. University-bashing has become so popular that the American Association for Higher Education, an organization of 8,000 administrators, professors and staff members, has chosen as the main topic for its annual conference "Reclaiming the Public Trust." The conference begins today in Chicago.
"It just seemed more and more that higher education was falling out of favor," said Louis S. Albert, a vice president of the association. "Our conclusion was that there has been a real decline in public trust and we need to take steps to reclaim it."
It is not only here that universities are under attack. In England, the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher severely reduced higher education appropriations in 1981. Mrs. Thatcher had determined that while population changes meant fewer college-age students, many voters had grown increasingly convinced that universities were pampered.
"Universities were deeply shocked to have been cut in this way," said Auriol Stevens, director of the universities information unit of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom. "And they were even more deeply shocked that no one seemed to mind."
To regain their high ground, the universities became more responsive to the needs of British industry, creating private research partnerships and changing curriculums to better prepare students for work. They also established Ms. Stevens' office in London, their first public relations effort to control the debate.
Higher education in the United States may lag a few years behind the United Kingdom in that respect, but it seems to be following a similar path. Catherine T. Stimpson, dean of the graduate school at Rutgers University and a scheduled panelist at the American Association for Higher Education conference, said universities are only partly to blame for the shift in public attitudes.
"If there has been a loss in public trust it has come from two sources: what we've done to ourselves and what has been done to us," Dean Stimpson said. In the first category she includes the athletic scandals, high minority dropout rates and confusion over curriculum. She is more bitter about the second category, which she describes as "a decade of half-truth and distortions about the reality of higher education, all of which culminated in the P.C. debate."
 
A Catch-All Putdown
 P.C., or political correctness, has evolved into a catch-all campus putdown. It is used to accuse universities of pandering to members of minority groups and others who might be considered "victims" by adopting requirements such as multicultural curriculums and codes to ban offensive speech.
Academic traditionalists such as those in the National Association of Scholars have portrayed these trends as an orthodoxy of liberal ideas. And they say the universities' loss of face is deserved. Dinesh D'Souza, the traditionalist author of "Illiberal Education," an indictment of higher education, has said that universities have lost the public's confidence because they "have not given an ample accounting of themselves."
Once the universities' image was tarnished, it didn't take long for the public to turn away. No one knows how long it will take to reclaim this lost trust, but there are signs, such as Stanford's rigorous new accounting system and Harvard's new emphasis on teaching, that universities have gotten the message.
"If those good things start to spread," said former Governor Kean, "then the period for reclaiming trust could be relatively short." On the other hand, he argued, "if we stonewall, if we think we're better than everyone else, if we think we know better, then it will take far longer."

HEADLINE: FOOD;
A Man for All Seasonings

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
IT IS 10:45 ON A SATURDAY MORNING, and Daniel Boulud, the 37-year-old chef of Le Cirque, strides into the kitchen. Trim and diminutive under a starched chef's jacket and white apron, he wears pin-striped trousers, precisely cuffed, perfectly pleated, and spit-polished shoes. Half of Boulud is a big-city executive; the other half is a shy, fastidious Frenchman who cooked his way off his family's farm to the apex of his craft.
Le Cirque's kitchen is backstage to the most glamorous dining room in Manhattan. Serving both the passing fancies and inflexible tastes of the rich and the urbane, the kitchen has been a major way station on the road from Escoffier's dictums to exotic cuisine. With his instinct for the chemistry of food and a cautious Gallic originality, Boulud turns trends into new classics. 
 "Bonjour, chef!" Boulud is carrying a list of the day's 20 specials in his left hand. His right hand stretches toward the 14 cooks who leave their stations to greet him. "Bonjour!" he says. "Good morning!"
It could be any morning, at almost any country restaurant in France; for a moment, the white-jacketed huddle is family. It was like this when Boulud, the son of a Lyonnais farmer, left his family at 14 to apprentice in Lyons, where he worked 13-hour days for 5 French francs a month. "No one asked if you were happy with the arrangement," he says.
Within three years Boulud moved to Georges Blanc, the three-star restaurant in Vonnas, where his technical skills evolved into flawless technique. He then signed on with Roger Verge in Mougins. It was Verge, Boulud says, who gave him "an energy, a spirit of adventure."
Boulud moved on to Copenhagen to run the kitchen of a restaurant for which Verge was a consultant. There he applied his French technique to unfamiliar ingredients, like elk, lingonberries and a variety of smoked fish. He learned an essential lesson: "With the known, you are in control. With the unknown, you have no choice but to trust your instincts and just cook." The pull between control and inventiveness is still central to Boulud's particular genius.
Boulud worked briefly with Michel Guerard in the south of France, moved to Washington as the private chef for the Frenchman who was head of the European Economic Community delegation and finally settled in New York, where he ran the kitchens at the Polo in the Westbury Hotel and Le Regence in the Plaza Athenee.
By the time Boulud arrived at Le Cirque in 1986, his vivid modernity was already becoming legend. A subtle exoticism has continued to creep into his dishes. He mounds fresh crab claws on a confetti of julienned mango, chayote and almonds and seasons it with lime and coriander, gives a carpaccio of salmon a lemon-grass dressing, wraps a roasted duck breast in a bacon jacket, pairs a puree of fava beans and diced root vegetables with plums and combines roasted pigs' feet with fresh morels and Chinese pea shoots.
On the surface, Boulud is cordial and calm. Other chefs say he has a streak of diplomacy as wide as the Rhone. They credit him with bridging the traditional gulf between what they call the "French chef Mafia" and young, emerging American chefs. But something in the set of his Lyonnais jaw belies the warm, easygoing smile that he flashes for the cameras of food and society magazines. Behind his wire-rimmed glasses, his green eyes flash restlessly. He is easily bored, relentlessly demanding.
As soon as his assistants return to their stations this Saturday, Boulud swings into Type-A French chef personality, moving through his kitchen and finding annoying imperfections along the way.
One hand testing the mettle of the day's lamb, the other rubbing a basil leaf to check its perfume, he instructs an apprentice in the correct cleaning of a sea urchin. "Do you see?" he asks gently. His tone becomes more clipped as he moves to a group of more experienced assistants. "Bon, good," he says, checking stocks and sauces. Not so a melange of leeks and celery root. "Do it again -- you need more bacon," he says. And the flageolets! "You've overcooked them. Here. Let me show you." Without a wasted motion, he demonstrates both dishes in less than five minutes.
"It's like this every day," he says. "You plan. You have perfect control. And then something happens. You can never trust it."
He stalks among the day's food deliveries, checks the refrigerators, tastes a petit four, winks at the French butcher and moves toward the line of stoves where his top three assistants are finishing their lunch preparations. He nods, sniffs and nibbles his way past each. Nervously he consults the clock. He glances at the swinging doors that separate his domain from some of the most demanding palates in the world.
"I do my best work when I don't know what I am doing, when I cook from myself, not from some recipe on a piece of paper," Boulud says.
Still, a scintilla of the unknown causes his knuckles to whiten around the handle of his chef's knife as he chops herbs for a specially requested dish. With their sassy interplay of contrasting flavors, textures and temperatures, his most memorable dishes seem to reflect this tension.
There is also a consistent unifying principle in the cuisine of Boulud -- something that is at once familiar and startling. Boulud brushes a stray leaf of chervil from his trousers and says simply: "I'm French."

 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
 2 artichoke hearts, cooked, cleaned and cut into 1/8-inch cubes
 1 large, ripe tomato, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/8-inch cubes
 4 large white mushrooms, cleaned, stemmed and cut into 1/8-inch cubes
 1 small ripe avocado, peeled and cut into 1/8-inch cubes
 1/4 cup nicoise olives, pitted and coarsely chopped
2 1/2 tablespoons chopped chives
 
The napoleon of tuna:
 1 10-ounce piece of fresh tuna, about 1 inch thick
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 6 slices good quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed, toasted and halved
 1 clove garlic, peeled
 4 tufts mache lettuce, rinsed and dried.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Put the artichoke hearts, tomato, mushrooms, avocado, olives and chives in a large glass or ceramic bowl, toss with half the dressing and set aside.
2. Preheat the broiler. Brush the tuna with the olive oil. Place under the broiler, 4 inches from the heat and broil until rare at center, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Brush both sides of the tuna steak with the remaining dressing. Refrigerate until cold.
3. To assemble the napoleon, rub the toast with the garlic clove and discard the clove. With a sharp knife cut the tuna steak on an angle into 12 thin slices. Cover each piece of toast with one layer of sliced tuna; trim the edges. Stack three slices of toast to make each napoleon.
4. Put each napoleon in the center of a serving plate. Spread a layer of the salad on top of each napoleon. Garnish with a tuft of mache.
Yield: Four servings.
 
SWEET LEMON TART WITH PLUM TOMATOES AND VERBENA
 
The pastry:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
 1 egg, lightly beaten
 
The tomatoes:
 1 cup sugar
 1 1-inch piece lemon peel
 1 verbena tea bag
 1/2 cup water
 6 fresh, ripe plum tomatoes, about 1 1/2 pounds, peeled, cored, seeded and quartered lengthwise
 
The custard:
 3 lemons, peeled to the pulp, seeded and cut into thick slices
 1 egg yolk
 2 whole eggs
 1/2 cup sugar
 3/4 cup heavy cream
 1 tablespoon grated lemon rind.
1. In a small bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. Set aside. Put the butter and confectioners' sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until smooth. Add the egg, beat for a few seconds, then add the flour mixture all at once. Beat the ingredients until just incorporated, about 1 minute. Shape the dough into a flat disk, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
2. Meanwhile, put the sugar, lemon peel and verbena tea bag in a saucepan, add the water and bring to a boil. Add the tomatoes and simmer gently over medium-low heat until they are soft, about 20 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the tomatoes to a plate covered with paper towels. Pat dry and set aside. Let the syrup simmer gently until reduced to1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle a handful of flour onto a flat surface. Roll the dough into a large circle, 1/8-inch thick, and gently press it into a 10-inch tart pan. Prick the bottom with a fork, line the shell with wax paper, fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake until golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
4. Put the lemon slices, egg yolk, whole eggs, sugar and cream in a blender and puree until smooth. Strain, and stir in the lemon rind. Pour 1/4 cup of the lemon custard into the tart shell. Arrange the tomato wedges, cut side down, in a circle at the center of the tart and slowly pour in the remaining custard. Bake until the custard sets, about 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside to cool. Cut into slices and drizzle 2 teaspoons of syrup around each slice.
Yield: Six to eight servings.
 
COLD CELERY SOUP WITH PINK RADISHES
 
 1 teaspoon olive oil
 2 medium leeks, white parts only, well rinsed and thinly sliced
 3/4 pound celery, rinsed and thinly sliced
 2 teaspoons curry powder
 6 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
 1 white boiling potato, about 1/3 pound, peeled and diced
 1 bunch pink radishes, rinsed, green tops reserved
 1 cup low-fat yogurt
 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
 Salt and freshly ground pepper
 12 shrimp, steamed, peeled, cleaned and cut in half lengthwise.
1. Warm the olive oil in a stockpot over medium-low heat. Add the leeks, celery and curry, and saute for 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth and potatoes, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 17 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, finely chop all but 2 of the radishes. Discard any bruised radish greens and finely chop the rest. When the soup has simmered for 17 minutes, add the chopped radishes and greens and simmer for an additional 3 minutes.
3. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth and strain through a sieve. Refrigerate until cold.
4. When the soup is thoroughly chilled, stir in the yogurt and Tabasco. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Thinly slice the two remaining radishes, float a few slices in the center of each serving bowl and arrange six of the shrimp halves around the radishes like the petals of a flower.
Yield: Four servings.
 
CHICKEN WITH MORELS, FAVA BEANS AND SPRING POTATOES
 
 1 teaspoon salt
 1 pound fresh fava beans, shelled
 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
 1 3 1/2 pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces
 1/2 pound small new potatoes, scrubbed and halved
16 garlic cloves, skin intact
 8 small shallots, peeled
 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
 2 bay leaves
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 4 cups fresh morels, stems removed, cleaned and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 1/2 cups chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
 3 tablespoons minced chives.
1. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to a large pot of boiling water and cook the fava beans for 1 minute. Drain, submerge them in ice water, drain again, peel off the outer skins and set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the chicken, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, turn the chicken and add the potatoes, garlic, shallots, thyme and bay leaves. Add the remaining salt and the pepper and put the skillet in the oven.
3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large saute pan over high heat. When hot, add the morels in one layer and saute until golden brown. Add the chicken broth, bring to a boil and remove from heat.
4. When the chicken has roasted for 10 minutes, pour the morels over the chicken. Stir until the vegetables are coated with broth. Continue to bake the chicken, basting with the pan juices, until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes longer.
5. Add the fava beans and chives to the chicken. Stir until the beans are coated with the pan juices and bake for 2 to 3 minutes more. Arrange the pieces of chicken in the center of a warm platter, pour the vegetables and pan juices over the meat.
Yield: Four servings.

HEADLINE: Another Opening, Another Show

 BODY:
The curtain may have rung down on commercial touring classical acting troupes in America, but the Acting Company is keeping the tradition alive. The nonprofit group based in New York is a bridge between conservatory training for actors and the profession. For the last six months the 16-member ensemble has been on the road with Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream," directed by Joe Dowling, and Athol Fugard's "Blood Knot," directed by Tazewell Thompson. After stops in 23 states, the company begins performances at the John Jay Theater in Manhattan on Monday for a 10-day run of both plays in repertory ending April 15. 
 During the tour, from Burlington, Vt., to Little Rock, Ark., from Iowa City to Green Bay, Wis., members of the company recorded their impressions of the road. Here are excerpts from their tape.
 
Dan Berkey -- We get these high school kids kicking and screaming at "an educational experience." Inside of 20 minutes they discover we are cool. They relate to us in an MTV kind of way that makes us subversive. Shakespeare becomes exciting, fun. At the end, when they leap out of their chairs, you know something has happened.
 
Lisa Benavides -- On the road you see how empty some of these downtown areas are. You see how the economy is affecting everyone. And you feel touched that you can get someone from a "Curley Sue" movie audience to go to a play and have a truly enjoyable time.
 
Jeffrey Wright -- I was sitting in the hotel bar in Green Bay, and this guy I was talking to was surprised we were doing Shakespeare. "You're doing Shakespeare? Here? I love Shakespeare!" He was so excited and wanted to know when and where the show was. They have nothing like that there.
 
Rainn Wilson -- What is great is playing to the whole nation, to its ugliness and the horror of some of its consumer-mall-culture ways. At the same time, it's glorious to see how magnificent the country is and how wonderfully spirited the people are.
 
Jonathan Earl Peck -- After a performance of "Blood Knot," the audience, which had been very enthralled, began to discuss the play. I sat in the room with my baseball cap on backward and listened. At the end I stood up and thanked them for coming. They looked at me quizzically and one guy said, "Were you in the play?" You forget that there are people not used to seeing actors walk in the street.
 
Derek Meader -- It is important, even revolutionary, to see a black man playing Oberon, a Puerto Rican woman playing Titania and a fairy played by a big strapping man or a small Oriental woman. When people end up loving it, we make a strong point. We become, as Shakespeare said, like a mirror held up to society. (Photographs by George Gryzenia for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: TALES FROM THE BABY FACTORY

 BODY:
Couples suffering from infertility technology are fighting a war on many fronts. They must compromise their attendance at work, undergo invasive procedures, have their sexual relationship on display, cope with family and personal differences and constantly keep abreast of the discriminatory, ever-changing insurance regulations affecting the reimbursement they may receive for their treatment. What such couples should be spared are the morality-laced parables that seek to define what is "reproductively correct." 
 Assisted reproductive technology is an experiment in consumer medicine brought about by the deliberate economic and political decisions made over the past 10 years. The Federal Government refuses to provide traditional National Institutes of Health funding for the nascent technology, deeming it "fetal research." Since such money was not forthcoming in the face of consumer demands, the present unregulated situation has come about. The ramifications of the Government's desire to drop the ball on this issue will continue to be felt throughout the current decade. The absence of research funding will greatly slow the accumulation of the knowledge about these techniques and keep the patient's cost high.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: $2 Million-Plus;
High End Sales Rise

 BODY:
For the past few months buyers, sellers and real estate brokers have had their poles in the water in a search for signs of a bottoming out in the cooperative apartment market.
The most recent prediction that a market recovery may be near comes from The Corcoran Group, a Manhattan residential sales company. It holds out as evidence a surge in sales of apartments selling for $2 million or more. 
 "Historically," said Barbara Corcoran, head of the firm, "the highest end of the market is the first to recover during a sustained recession."
In an analysis of sales completed from September 1990 to March 1991 and from last September to March of this year, the Corcoran Group found an 80 percent rise (from 41 to 74 sales) on Park and Fifth Avenues and a 100 percent rise (from 7 to 14 sales) on Central Park West. For the same periods, the study showed a slight increase in the average selling price -- from $3.45 million to $3.6 million -- for apartments on Park and Fifth Avenues. The average price on Central Park West remained stable at about $2.8 million.
By the Corcoran Group's standards, $2 million might be characterized as the low end of the high end. But it still buys a pretty nice apartment. One $2 million sale was of an eight-room penthouse on Fifth Avenue in the 60's with a greenhouse and maid's quarters. In a $2 million sale on Central Park West, the buyer got 11 rooms including a 50-foot living room, a library and an eat-in kitchen.

HEADLINE: Prime Area Town-House Sales Rebound

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
TOWN-HOUSE sales in Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side and other prime Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods have rebounded after a three-year downward drift. In recent reports, brokerage companies said that last year brought their highest volume of sales since 1988, when the phenomenal price rises of the mid-80's for town houses shifted into reverse.
Many of the buyers in the market in 1991 were responding, the realtors said, to softening prices and the start of the drop in mortgage interest rates. But practical considerations aside, the upsurge in sales also is strong evidence that town-house living still has a strong appeal in a city where space is a precious commodity and most people must live in apartments with no more charm than a shoebox. 
 "I wanted to live in a brownstone," said Dr. Danielle Gilman, who last month bought her first residence, a 19th- century house on a tree-lined street in Greenwich Village. "I didn't look at regular apartments. As long as I was going to be buying, I wanted the things like a fireplace, high ceilings, the features that make you feel you are in a home."
After looking mostly at floor-through apartments in town houses because that was all she thought she could afford, she found a tiny house she was able to buy for a price in the low $400,000's. It is about as different from a cookie-cutter apartment as it could be. It is triangular in shape and has a top-floor master bedroom with a skylight that suggests the Parisian garret where Rodolfo met Mimi in "La Boheme."
Sotheby's International Realty, which tracks town-house sales in Manhattan south of 96th Street, recorded a 26 percent increase in the sale of one- and two-family houses, from 50 in 1990 to 63 in 1991. At the same time, the dollar volume remained virtually the same, meaning there was a 20 percent drop in the average selling price of town houses. The average was $1,710,019 and the range was $200,000 to $12 million.
"I sense that people got tired of waiting and decided to bite the bullet," said Joan Ambrose, a principal of Ambrose-Mar Elia Company, which recorded 69 town-house sales last year, including transactions on properties in the low 100's blocks of the Upper West Side.
There also was a feeling among buyers, some brokers said, that prices had bottomed out.
Sales jumped noticeably during the third quarter, which Ms. Ambrose believes was influenced by the resolution of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. The firm recorded 14 sales each in the first and second quarters and then 24 in the third quarter before the year ended with 17 in the final quarter.
But prospective town-house buyers looking for the same free fall in prices that hit some segments of the co-op and condominium market were dissappointed. There were no fire sales or auctions for town houses.
THE main reason is that one- and two-family town houses are relatively scarce. Few are being built theses days, and the city's Department of Finance counts only 1,696 residences that it categorizes as single-family mansions or town houses. By contrast, the Real Estate Board of New York puts the number of co-op and condominium apartments in the city at about 120,000.
Adding to the appeal of town houses is that they tend to be in historic districts and in such gentrified old neighborhoods as Park Slope and Chelsea. Others are in attractive enclaves in otherwise troubled areas.
The Upper East Side and Greenwich Village saw the strongest increase in sales last year. But the Upper West Side was not part of the market's 1991 upswing. Brokers said that sellers and buyers just were not in sync when it came to prices.
Harlem, an area that saw an influx of enthusiastic middle-class town house buyers during the 1980's, has not regained the momentum of the past decade. There are no statistics on the volume of sales because so many transactions are private. But Harlem realtors say sales have slowed to a trickle compared to the levels of the 1980's. One reason is that there are not enough properties to meet the demand.
In the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and Prospect Park, one brokerage company that tracks sales in those areas said that house prices actually bumped up a bit last year. Roberta Faulstick, a senior vice president of William B. May, said the average closing price went from $489,000 in 1990 to $518,000 in 1991. In 1990, the selling prices ranged from $200,000 to $767,000 and in 1991 the range was $320,000 to $915,000.
But realtors say selling prices of homes in other Brooklyn town-house neighborhoods, among them Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant, have fallen since 1990.
Eva M. Daniels, a broker whose territory includes those neighborhoods, used sales on South Portman Place, a prime block in Fort Greene, to illustrate the trend. "The selling prices for the block peaked in 1988 at $500,000," said Mrs. Daniels, "but recent sales there have been in the range of $350,000 to $375,000 and a house there recently went for $300,000."
Mrs. Daniels said that some people who have $500,000 to spend are now looking in Park Slope, a more established neighborhood.
While overall the town-house market held up well against the ills of New York's weakened economy, some brokerage companies saw significance in a noticeable increase in sales of Manhattan town houses selling for less than $1 million.
Sotheby's International Realty, for example, found that by the end of 1991 24 town houses had sold in Manhattan for under $1 million. That number was the highest since 1987 and was more than twice as many as were sold the year before when only 11 town house sales were recorded at under $1 million.
But 1991 did bring at least one eye-popping sale.
Last April, Leslie Wexner, who owns The Limited clothing chain, got $12 million for his 13,000-square-foot, six-story house at 5 East 74th Street. Mr. Wexner, who sold it to the German Goverment, had paid $5.8 million for the house in 1985.
That deal nipped at the heels of a 1989 transaction at $12.5 million, the highest price ever paid for a Manhattan house. The house was 603 Park Avenue at 64th Street.
"I THINK the East Side in the 70's and 80's is still the neighborhood of choice for people who have $2 million or more to spend on a residence," said Lillian Fisher, a vice president of Sotheby's.
In Greenwich Village, prices for town houses have eased significantly.
"It was not so long ago," said Robert Eychner, a principal of Eychner Properties, "that an owner of a town house in the Village on a really good block could name his price and get it. Price adjustments for town houses in the village came late in the economic cycle and followed co-ops, condominiums and lofts. But the adjustment did come, and now there are some very nice deals out there"
Mr. Eychner is negotiating a sale on a home off Fifth Avenue on a choice block just to the north of Washington Square in which the owner is expected to accept $1 million less than the original asking price of $2.8 million.
A few years ago, when people came into Mr. Eychner's office with $500,000 to $600,000 to spend on a town house, he would have to tell them that there was nothing available. "Today when buyers come to us with that kind of budget looking for an apartment or a loft," he said, "we might ask them if they are interested in a house. There has been that much of a change in the market."
After a deal to buy a brownstone duplex fell through, Dr. Gilman discovered a house that was just close enough to the top of her budget to be worth a look. She believes that its peculiar shape --triangular -- and configuration, helped her bring the seller down from the original asking price of $495,000. The house has a kitchen, dining room and laundry on the ground floor, a living room on the second, a bath and dressing room on the third and a bedroom on the fourth.
LOUIS B. KAYE, president of L.B. Kaye, one of the most active town house brokerages, believes that the flexibility of sellers in Greenwich Village is giving sellers on the Upper West Side their strongest competition.
"Homes are not moving on the West Side now," said Mr. Kaye. "One reason is that owners are staying pretty firm on their asking prices. In the meantime, buyers are finding that they can get a town house in the village or on the East Side if they are willing to go east of Lexington Avenue, for what sellers on the West Side are asking."
Of the 69 sales of Manhattan properties tracked by brokers last year, 52 were on the Upper East Side, 14 were in Greenwich Village and only 3 were on the Upper West Side.
"There are plenty of listings," said Mr. Kaye, "but right now buyers' interest is just not there."
Jessie Burnett, an agent with Webb & Brooker, the largest Harlem-based real estate company, has a problem that is the opposite of Mr. Kaye's. "I don't think we have more than a dozen listings." she said.
The asking prices fall into the $250,000 to $350,000 range and most are in established town house areas like Striver's Row, along Convent Avenue near the campus of City College or on Hamilton Terrace.
"In most cases they are in very good condition because the same family has been in them for 40 years or more," she said. "But to buy a home in that price range takes a salary of at least $100,000. People who are in the market today are looking for something in the $150,000 to $200,000 range."
As recently as the early 80's homes in these areas could be had for $70,000 to $150,000. Those in need of repair or on less well known blocks could be picked up for $50,000 or less.
"In the late 70's," said Russell M. Banks, a vice president of Webb & Brooker, speaking from the vantage point of 12 years as a realtor in Harlem,"Harlem was the last place in Manhattan where you could get a brownstone or row house for less $100,000."
Although most buyers now realize that Harlem is not likely to become a gentrified neighborhood like the Upper West Side, Mr. Banks said, more areas would have been upgraded if it were not for the enactment of the city's S.R.O. law. In 1985, in an effort to stem the rising tide of homeless people, the city put a moratorium on the conversion of single-room-occupancy hotels and rooming houses into apartments and single family residences.
"I understand the motive behind the law," Mr. Banks said. "But it helped to kill the market in Harlem. A lot of people who could not meet their mortgages took boarders to hold on to their houses. If they could convert their homes back into single- or two-family residences, I think there would be a strong market for them."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: City Housing Cutbacks;
New York Slashing an Array of Programs

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
OPPORTUNITY knocked, and Alice Davis responded. "I'd better jump on this," she remembers telling herself.
She was thinking of buying a new two-family house built with city and state assistance in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. She bought just in time. Drastic cuts sought by Mayor David N. Dinkins for a planned revision in the capital budget for coming years would all but end city assistance to this and other housing production programs. 
 "I was hearing rumors that the city was cutting out funds for the program," said Ms. Davis, a 39-year-old repair-service attendant for the New York Telephone Company. "I said to myself, 'with all the layoffs, how could they go on building houses?' "
Ms. Davis has gone to contract on a $154,000 two-family house being built on DeKalb Avenue through the New York Housing Partnership's production program. There are 68 houses in the development, named Sojourner Truth Homes, on three blocks off Stuyvesant Avenue near Broadway. Sixty have been sold. Occupancy will start in May.
Completion of this development and others for which funds are already committed is not affected by the prospective cuts. But the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has been told by the Office of Management and Budget to find $510 million by the end of April to slash from the four-year capital spending plan that the Mayor announced in January. City spending would fall from the planned $1.34 billion to $835 million over the four years starting with fiscal 1993, which begins July 1.
The agency has responded that to accomplish this it will have to eliminate the major production programs -- new houses for moderate- to middle-income people and gut rehabilitations of vacant buildings. Funds that help existing rental housing also would be cut sharply.
A key program that would be spared is the newly announced plan to rehabilitate occupied, tax-foreclosed, city-managed buildings in preparation for stepped-up transfers to private or nonprofit management. There are 3,200 such buildings with 33,000 apartments, currently costing the city about $130 million a year to run.
The cutbacks would mean no city money to support the Partnership program or the Nehemiah program, through which church organizations develop housing in East Brooklyn and the South Bronx. The Partnership also gets state assistance. Early Thursday morning the Legislature adopted a budget that includes funds for affordable housing programs, but it comes on a matching basis, so that the city could lose its share if it makes no appropriation itself. The Nehemiah program might qualify for funds under a newly available Federal program, known by the acronym HOME.
The vacant building program, under which both private and city capital has been used for gut rehabilitations of city-owned buildings, would cease. A gradual phase-out would end city aid to gut rehabilitations of low-income rentals by nonprofits through the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation, which raise tax-credit financing for the projects.
New city-financed gut rehabilitations that have produced permanent housing for homeless and low-income families, under nonprofit ownership and management, would also cease. Other programs, though surviving, would be cut back severely.
City funding of public-private participation loans for existing rentals -- usually occupied buildings with low-income tenancies getting building-systems replacements -- were set at $80 million last January for the four-year period. They would be cut to $36 million.
City loans to rehabilitate single-room-occupancy buildings for the neediest poor were to have been funded at $68 million. That would drop to $15 million.
ALL of this is a striking reversal of the plans Mayor Dinkins announced two years ago. At that time the housing department under a newly appointed commissioner, Felice Michetti, was looking forward to administering a balanced preservation and production program that would essentially complete a 10-year housing plan begun by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1986, but with greater emphasis on nonprofit participation.
With the recession, many housing specialists would agree on the need for shifting the balance in the allocation of city resources toward preservation-oriented from production-oriented policies. The question is how to strike the balance.
Through the Housing Parnership program, a formidable housing delivery system has been established, capable of developing, financing, building and marketing for-sale housing citywide. Chase Community Development Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Bank affiliate that financed Sojourner Truth Homes, has itself committed nearly $200 million to assisted-housing production in the city. The investment has provided ownership opportunity, construction work and neighborhood stabilization.
THE stabilization effect is on view in the vicinity of the Sojourner Truth development, which is named for an upstate woman who ran an underground railroad for slaves.
The homes are on scattered sites along Hart, Pulaski and Kosciusko Streets and DeKalb Avenue. It was a dreary neighborhood of blight amid demolished sites when construction began.
The builder, The Hudson Companies, a Brooklyn company that has built 400 housing units through the Partnership program, bought vacant city land for 10 of the houses at a city auction in 1990. The city gradually expanded the site by adding new parcels, so that the development has transformed a broad area.
Hudson's community-based partner in the project is the Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corporation. Nicholas Lembo, who is also president of a Brooklyn contracting company, Monadnock Construction, William Fowler 3d and Alan R. Bell are the principals of The Hudson Companies.
Certain characteristics of the homes are distinctive. First, they preserve the street line. There are no curb cuts for parking pads. Instead, parking is at the rear. At the end of a row of houses is a driveway entrance to the commonly owned paved drive that separates the rear yards of back-to-back houses. Buyers get one rear space on their properties.
The 2,760-square-foot houses, with 920 square feet on each of three levels, are described as two and a half stories because the lowest level is a basement, half below street level. However, broad metal-guarded windows give them extensive light.
The owner can use the space as a family room, and add a bathroom as well. But there is no practical way of building an outside entrance to the space, so that it cannot be subdivided by an owner to create a second rental apartment. This is a possibility buyers often consider.
The rental apartment is on the third floor, entered through a separate door at the top of a common concrete stoop. The facade uses precast lintels and decorative brick to create design interest. The architect is the firm of Harden/Van Arnam of Brooklyn.
The buyers at Sojourner Truth Homes are local working people who have managed some savings.
"YOU always wanted a place of your own, a little backyard, but most of the places you see are out of your league," said Jimmy Talton, a purchasing agent for a small Brooklyn manufacturing company, who bought a Sojourner Truth house with his wife, Daisy. They had lived for 20 years in Eleaner Roosevelt Houses, a public housing project.
Now, said Ms. Davis, it costs no more to own than to rent. "You get something you can own and control," she said. Ms. Davis, who is divorced, will be moving with her two children, Josette, 21, and Joseph, 18, both college students.
Another house was sold to Betty and Seymour Clarke, who have a 2-year-old son, Galen. They are moving from a $600-a-month rental in Park Slope. Mrs. Clarke's sister will rent the upstairs apartment.
"The house is something we would be able to handle even without the rent," said Mrs. Clarke, who calculates her monthly costs at $1,100 to $1,200, before rental income. Mrs. Clarke works for a law firm; her husband is a printer.
The builder, The Hudson Companies, calculates after-tax housing costs to buyers at about $500 a month. The buyer needs about $15,000 in cash for the down payment and closing costs.
It is possible because of a $50,000 subsidy per house ($25,000 per apartment), $30,000 from the state and $20,000 from the city. It is that subsidy level that is in jeopardy because of budget cuts. If it doesn't come from some level of government, new home construction will not be feasible in New York City, even on free land, for buyers in the $25,000-to-$50,000 income range.

HEADLINE: Talking: Minorities;
Removing Barriers To Loans

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
MINORITY and ethnic home buyers have long sensed that they do not get equal consideration when they apply for mortgages and suspected that they were rejected more hastily than whites with similar financial profiles.
Studies have recently confirmed this. A Federal Reserve Board study based on 5.3 million applications from 9,300 banks, published last October, found minorities twice as likely to be rejected as whites with the same household income. 
 A similar study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that lenders in the New York City area had a particularly bad record on minority loans. This was followed by a study by Barry Leeds & Associates, a Manhattan financial market research firm whose findings, released in February, showed subtle levels of bias in the less-than-helpful way many loan officers handled nonwhite applicants.
Bankers have since concluded that a major reason for the high rejection rate may be that many minority and ethnic applicants, among them recent immigrants, do not have credit or employment histories that conform to anticipated norms.
As a consequence, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) have issued what they call "clarified" guidelines to encourarge lenders to become more flexible in their interpetation of qualifying criteria. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are Government-chartered corporations that buy mortgages from lenders. In making a secondary market for home loans, these agencies set lending standards for the entire mortgage industry.
Derrick Cephas, the New York State Superintendent of Banks, sent a letter to some 500 lending institutions reiterating the theme.
Mark Willis, a member of the American Bankers' Association Residential Mortgage Task Force, who is working on similar goals, said: "We have all begun re-examining the criteria to make sure we are excluding only those people who won't pay and making sure we don't overlook people who will."
For a loan to be salable on the secondary market, the borrower needs to show a stable income for the prior two years. Under the old guidelines, lenders often held this to mean they had to exclude an applicant who had changed jobs too often in that time or those who had to incorporate part-time earnings, seasonal work or unemployment compensation to maintain a certain income level.
Under the new guidelines all these sources are now considered "good" income.
A lack of credit history also tended to be a drawback. This was particularly hard for some immigrants who are used to dealing only in cash and are not connected to the world of credit cards and American-style banking. The credit history requirement can now be met by documenting a history of timely telephone, rent and utility payments or other proofs that bills are paid on time.
Even certain blots on a credit record will have to be more carefully scrutinized by lending officials before they can form the basis for rejection. "We emphasize that excellent credit does not have to be perfect or spotless, since certain circumstances can be beyond a borrower's control," notes Robert J. Engelstad, Fannie Mae's senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards in his directive to lenders.
Other modifications allow grants from church, municipal or community sources to replace the portion of the down payment that can be supplied by a gift from a relative. Even the definition of "family member" as the source of these funds can now be broadened in many instances to encompass large extended families or the closely-knit "savings clubs" common among certain groups.
In addition, the condition of the home may be evaluated in comparison to others in the neighborhood and not judged by a more arbitrary standard that often exluded many houses. Even if a neighborhood has many offices, stores or gas stations and is thus not strictly a residential area, this should no longer preclude a loan.
DESPITE these changes, reformers fear that deep-rooted practices and attitudes will not alter overnight. Thus they urge potential borrowers who fear they may be rejected to take advantage of counseling services to help them through the mortgage maze.
One of these is Acorn (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), a group that helped redraft the language of the Freddie Mac guidelines. It has just opened offices in Brooklyn (call 718-693-6700). It also maintains branches in St. Louis, Dallas, Phildelphia, Houston, New Orleans, Little Rock, Ark., Chicago, Washington, Des Moines and Minneapolis.
John Hemschoot, director of home mortgage standards for Freddie Mac, said that banks and savings and loans associations are expected to respond more rapidly to the directives than independent mortgage companies since these institutions are under greater pressure from regulators to fulfill their responsibilites to minorities and the poor under the Community Reinvestmet Act.
In the New York area, Chemical Bank in January began an Affirmative Mortgage Progam and a Neighborhood Homebuyers' Mortgage Program, both incorporating virtually all the changes in the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae directives.
These programs should also reduce the regular points charges and application fees and assure any rejected applicant a second review to see if exceptions might be made. They further provide counseling services and a $10 million fund to cover loans that would not be salable on the secondary market because special exceptions are being made, said Carol Parry, Chemical'st managing director for community development. Call (800) 243-6226 for more details.
Chase Manhattan Bank has established a similar program combining counseling services with a redefinition of qualifying criteria. For more information, visit any local branch and ask about the bank's Community Development Programs, or call its New York area mortgage hotline at (718) 797-5441.
Nancy Gordon, vice president of Globe Mortgage, of Hackensack, N.J., which has handled many minority applications in the region, warned, however, that documentation will still be needed to substantiate deviation from the norm.
If, for example, a car is to be sold to raise money for a downpayment, rather than tapping into a long-term savings account, proof of this sale will have to be produced. Similarly, independent corroboration of a lengthy illness or family breakup will be needed to explain a credit problem.

HEADLINE: ART;
At Yale, a Photographer's Images of Pain

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
SEBASTIAO SALGADO'S fame began in the 1980's with his photographs that showed the effects of starvation sweeping across Africa. Then came the shots of the Serra Pelada gold mine in his native Brazil. These were taken for The New York Times Magazine, as was a scene of a Kuwaiti oil field, one of a series published in the issue of June 9, 1991.
Though the photographer has not focused exclusively on human anguish, it would seem that during his 19-year career he has been on hand for just about every major disaster, except for Bhopal, Chernobyl and the Challenger explosion. Hence, there are those who regard him as something of global ambulance chaser. Otherwise, the response to his images has been widespread admiration together with honors on the order of the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Award in 1982 and citation as Photojournalist of the Year by the International Center for Photography in 1986. 
 Now Connecticut viewers have a chance to form their own opinions. The Yale University Art Gallery is offering a score of Salgado black-and-whites excerpted from "An Uncertain Grace," a show generated by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that is touring the nation. The Yale display was inaugurated by the photographer when he recently visited the university as a guest of the Chubb Fellowship.
Mr. Salgado's subjects seldom inspire anything less than awe. In Mali he records a solitary naked figure who stands supported by a stick on the desert that has filled in a lake bed. It is hard to tell if the figure is a man or a boy, and it hardly matters, for he's barely more than the sum of his bones, which echo the branches of a dead tree in the background. A younger skeleton, also in Mali, hangs in a sling being weighed in order to establish how much food he needs. The dial is illegible, but the needle is only one-quarter the way around.
But the final word on starvation is the picture of a man laying out a child according to the Coptic rite in Ethiopia. The corpse is as desiccated as a mummy except for swollen hands that lie, little curled paws, on what was once a belly, while the bent-over father hovers above. It seems safe to say that in all of art there is no Pieta as affecting, and there it is, in a small tent made of translucent plastic.
When interviewed by John Bloom in the November 1990 issue of Photo Metro magazine, Mr. Salgado expressed admiration for Cartier-Bresson, W. Eugene Smith, Walker Evans, Alvarez Bravo and others. He also mentioned writers -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for one. His photographs, however, speak of 19th-century French Realism -- in word and paint -- and none more so than those in the gold-mine series. In a cut that looks as deep as the Grand Canyon and twice as wide, labor myriad figures, including one who has just scaled one of the countless ladders lashed to the rock walls. In panoramic views of the scene, the figures swarm as if they were larvae just hatched from the eggs of a monstrous insect.
Noting that he is concerned with paying homage to the working class, Mr. Salgado said in this interview that the old ways of producing are "fast disappearing." Yet his pictures suggest the very opposite. In the age of high technology, the need for backbreaking labor is clearly as great as ever, if not greater.
But Mr. Salgado may be a hard-core romantic and optimist. The son of a cattle rancher and a former economist, he said that the working class is one group he can get "inside of." Whether or not this is the case, he always leaves his subjects their dignity, as did Lewis Hine, with whom he has often been compared.
Most photographers would italicize aspects of horror in order to convey their own feelings and to make the viewer feel guilty. Mr. Salgado lets a situation speak for itself. He does not, he says, interfere with "anything in reality" or with the people that he photographs; he does not want to give his audience "a bad conscience," nor does he seek out the picturesque aspects of pain and destitution, although his Madonna and Child from Ethiopia seem too good to be true.
There are pictures of suffering that should never have been taken -- notably the famous shot of the Vietnamese child on fire. But whatever the outrage engendered by Mr. Salgado's prints, it is not directed at the photographer, because somehow he seems trustworthy.
Still, that is only one opinion. At their first publication, the Kuwait pictures, in which the landscape is nothing but sludge and lakes of oil, came with an essay by Martin Wade. This tells of Mr. Salgado burying an Iraqi soldier he found under a coat of oil. A fellow journalist asked him if he did this "so that no other photographers would get the shot." Oddly enough, Mr. Salgado dignified the question with an answer. In Brazil, he explained, the soul of a body left unburied would get no rest for all eternity.
The photographs of Sebastiao Sal gado remain through April 19 at the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street in New Haven.

HEADLINE: New Move To Combat Sex Bias in Classroom

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
THE Lawrenceville School is suspending classes on Thursday and Friday so that students and faculty members can attend a conference dealing with the role of sex bias in education. Teachers in the Princeton public schools have begun to monitor one another's classes, in part to insure that girls are being called upon as often as boys.
At Douglass College in New Brunswick, a summer- school program offers girls entering the 11th grade special classes in mathematics, science and engineering. 
 Across the state, an increasing number of New Jersey schools and colleges are taking a hard look at the so-called gender gap and are revising curriculums and teaching methods to eliminate possible bias against girls.
Their efforts received a major boost recently with the release of a report by the American Association of University Women that summarized hundreds of national studies on the subject. The report concluded that girls begin school with roughly the same ability as boys but fall behind in a number of areas, including mathematics, science and self-esteem, by the time they graduate from high school because they receive neither the quality nor the quantity of education that boys do.
For many New Jersey educators, the report seemed to validate what they have been arguing for years. "What is really exciting is that the A.A.U.W. can move some of the research center stage," said Dr. Margaret Crocco, dean of students at the Oak Knoll School of the Holy Child, a girls' elementary and secondary school in Summit.
New Jersey was one of the first states to take charges of sex bias in the classroom seriously. In 1988 it became the first state to attempt to incorporate scholarship on women's studies throughout the college curriculum.
The New Jersey Project, as the effort sponsored by the Department of Higher Education is known, works with both public and private colleges and publishes a hefty journal of scholarly articles and teaching recommendations that is circulated to 1,500 New Jersey educators and 4,000 educators outside the state twice a year.
 
'We Have a Long Way to Go'
 "Some school districts and institutions have done quite well," said Prof. Paula Rothenberg, executive director of the New Jersey Project, "but I think for the most part we have a long way to go."
Oak Knoll was the site of a 1988 conference on sex bias that was attended by public and private school educators and that led to a booklet on ways to eliminate bias against girls in elementary and secondary school curriculums. The booklet has gone through several printings and is being used as a textbook at Hofstra University in Hempstead, L.I.
The faculty at Oak Knoll carefully examines its curriculum and teaching materials to root out sex bias. Textbooks that ignore women or treat them superficially are eliminated. For example, a 10th-grade history book that included biographies of famous women but did not discuss the lives of everyday women was recently dropped.
"We see that as a primitive approach to women's history," Dr. Crocco said. "We're now trying to understand the way women lived their lives, rather than what they did of value for the public culture, which is a more masculine view of history."
Oak Knoll's advanced-placement American history textbook, with its heavy emphasis on politics and economic history, has also been replaced by a book that takes a more social approach to history. Students spend more time discussing "material culture" -- how people built their homes, for example, and what was in the kitchen.
"We're not eliminating treatment of the Presidents of the United States or the important pieces of legislation, but we've enriched it by understanding what happens in the lives of everyday people," Dr. Crocco said.
 
The 'Evaded' Curriculum
 Emily Style, the diversity coordinator for the Madison public schools, finds herself increasingly addressing in her English classes what the university women's report calls the "evaded" curriculum. She begins discussion of John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" by writing on the blackboard statistics about battered women to help students understand the character who is known simply as Curly's wife.
Half the women murdered in the United States, she tells her students, were killed by their husbands or lovers. She juxtaposes the classic 1925 tale of white American affluence, F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Great Gatsby," with Anzia Yezierska's "Breadgivers," a novel published the same year about poor Russian Jews growing up in New York's Lower East Side.
Ms. Style said she was trying to achieve a balance of "windows and mirrors," so that students could learn to understand themselves and others.
"For a lot of kids, the windows at school are looking at the lives of dead white men," she said. "Not that dead white men didn't do a lot of things we can learn from. But if that's the constant diet and there's hardly ever a mirror of your gender or color, it can be terribly damaging."
 
Boys Are Also Affected
 Ms. Style said it was as harmful for boys to learn in a "house of mirrors," since it "gives them a false picture of the planet -- it doesn't give them windows into people not of their gender or race."
Ms. Style co-directs a summer workshop for elementary and secondary school teachers on women's studies for the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, which developed the university women's association report. More than 200 teachers, both men and women, have attended the workshops over the last six years and returned to their school districts around the nation to instruct other teachers on how to eliminate bias against girls in the curriculum.
Verdelle Freeman, a participant in one of the workshops, returned to her job as an English teacher at Piscataway High School and, with her husband, Alexander Jones, assembled a girls' performing arts troupe that presents the history of African women since the 11th century. Mrs. Freeman said it was particularly important for black girls to have role models that predate slavery.
"If you don't know where you've come from, you can't know where you're going," Mrs. Freeman said.
 
Math and Science Singled Out
 The association's report singled out the way math and science are taught to girls for special criticism. It contends that girls are discouraged from taking advanced math courses and are less likley than boys to pursue scientific or technological careers even if they are talented.
The report cites a study of Rhode Island high school seniors, indicating that 64 percent of the boys who had taken physics and calculus were planning to major in science or engineering, compared with 18.6 percent of girls with the same background.
There are a number of college-based efforts in New Jersey to lure elementary and secondary school girls into these areas. A summer- school program in math, science and engineering for girls entering the 11th grade that was offered by Douglass College had 467 applications for 46 openings last year. The project is now focusing on younger high school students with a series of Saturday programs.
Teaching math has also changed in some schools. At Oak Knoll, such standard classroom rituals as time trials in multiplication tables are de-emphasized because of research showing that girls learn more in cooperative settings than in competitive ones.
In Princeton public schools, teachers have begun to analyze their own classroom behavior to see if they unwittingly favor certain students. The teachers have been asked to identify their highest- and lowest-achieving students, and other teachers sit in the classroom to observe and measure who is allowed to answer questions in class, among other things.
 
An Effect on Self-Esteem
 "It's based on the simplest concept that if you send out cues to students that they are competent and capable and can achieve, they probably will," said John Sakala, the Princeton school district's assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction. "If you identify students as underachievers and they recognize it, it is probably a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Princeton is one of five school districts to participate in a five-year pilot program of the New Jersey Department of Education to integrate multiculturalism, including the study of women's issues, throughout the curriculum.
While most school districts would like to think they are treating girls and boys equally, there is often unintentional discrimination, said Dr. Gilda Rorro, director of the Education Department's Office of Equal Educational Opportunity, who oversees the pilot program.
"It's a question of omission," she said.
New Jersey chapters of the university women's association have sought to take advantage of the attention the report has received. In one of several events association chapters have sponsored around the state, representatives from more than 60 educational groups and businesses gathered at Jersey City State College last month to discuss the report and develop strategies for increasing educational equality in New Jersey.
 
'Concern Is Growing'
 "We really didn't expect such a large response," said Arlene Inglis, chairwoman of the event and of the business department at Morristown High School. "But interest is growing and concern is growing, and we're hearing from organizations we didn't even know existed."
Next week, a number of public and private school officials and representatives from the Y.W.C.A. and American Association of University Women from the Princeton area will be meeting at Princeton University to discuss the report.
Not everyone has greeted the association's report with praise. Diane Ravitch, an assistant United States Secretary of Education, has been one of the sharpest critics of the association report.
She said that schools were the wrong target and that television and advertising were more to blame for shaping girls' attitudes about themselves. She said girls should stop complaining and simply take more math and science courses if they want to get ahead in those areas.
Dr. Crocco of Oak Knoll believes that Dr. Ravitch is only partly right. "There's truth about what she says about the media," she said. "But that doesn't deny the fact that kids today spend more hours in school than in front of the TV. I don't think she's being realistic when she's talking about the way things work with juveniles."
Feminists have been known to say that it will take at least 100 years until school curriculums are fairly balanced. Professor Rothenberg of the New Jersey Project is not quite so pessimistic.
"We've got at least another 20 to 30 years' work before it will begin to look good to me," she said. "To really replace what is fundamentally a white male perspective on reality with a much more inclusive starting point is going to take a long time. These habits die hard."

HEADLINE: Towns Respond to County Overture

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
AFTER nine years as the Bedford Town Supervisor, Lawrence E. Dwyer was recently forced to take an action he thought would never be needed in his affluent community. He wrote personal letters to 70 residents urging them to pay their taxes.
The response was immediate. "People came in, very upset, talking about their problems," he recalled last week. "Many are out of work and others bought big houses when the market was good, homes they can't sell in this economy," he said. "It's not 'Panicville,' but people are truly in trouble." 
 With his town facing a $650,000 shortfall in tax money that it must pay the county, Mr. Dwyer was one of 20 Westchester town supervisors and city officials who accepted last week's invitation from the County Board of Legislators and senior members of the County Executive's staff to discuss common problems.
Local officials shared their concerns about what they called the tax crisis affecting all local governments. The situation, they said, has been perpetuated by state officials' setting unfair tax-equalization rates while courts tend to favor small-property owners in lowering assessments and a poor economy makes taxes more difficult to collect.
 
Legislative Revision Urged
 "You can help right now," Mr. Dwyer told the assembled legislators and members of the County Executive's staff, describing corrective legislation pending in Albany, which is backed by Mr. Dwyer and the members of the Municipal Officials Association, a Westchester-based organization he heads. "It is critical that you write our state representatives now," he said.
The legislation would require the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to change the method it uses to establish tax-equalization rates -- the ratio of real to assessed property value, a figure used by the state to determine school-aid formulas and to establish real property tax values.
The current practice of estimating value rather than actually surveying property has caused state officials to misjudge the impact of a declining real estate market, local officials say. Estimates are used because state budget cutbacks have reduced the number of available assessors. But the effect on municipalities has been severe, Westchester town supervisors agreed.
"It's a bureaucratic nightmare," said Supervisor Mark S. Tulis of the town of New Castle. "The state is trying to save money, but the expense is borne by the local communities."
Factual errors have compounded the problem, Mr. Tulis said. Last year, New Castle challenged state estimates of the value of 51 of the 70 land parcels surveyed by the state, saving residents an estimated $350,000.
 
Guaranteed Tax Payments
 The courts, meanwhile, have gone in the other direction, using real property values to grant property owners large tax reductions while municipal legal expenses for defending against citizen suits have risen dramatically. "Our towns are losing millions of dollars through the small claims process," Mr. Dwyer said, adding that recent legislation has compounded the problem, increasing the ceiling on tax reductions to 25 percent of assessed value.
Westchester is the only county in the state that is guaranteed payment of taxes from its towns and cities. (Elsewhere, towns may collect taxes for a county, but the towns are not directly liable for the bills.) While guaranteed tax collection has helped Westchester maintain a Triple A bond rating, town supervisors last week said the time has come for Westchester County to help towns fight local tax battles.
"Westchester County has an excellent bond rating as a result of our collections," said John A. Lombardi, the North Castle Town Supervisor. "It's a horrible day when the little communities have to fight Westchester County's battles to keep that bond rating."
The legislators and members of the County Executive's senior staff at the meeting promised to support the proposed state legislation and to consider providing aid to communities that face challenges to their tax levies. Town Supervisors attended the regular meeting of the Board of Legislators on Monday at which legislation was introduced that would assist municipalities in cases that exceed $100,000.
 
A Commission Called LINK
 Stephen V. Reitano, the county's Commissioner of Finance, said last week that he would consider changing the deadline for payment of county taxes to ease the burden on municipalities. Among other possibilities, the percentage of money that local governments owe to the county could be staggered to allow communities more flexibility, Mr. Reitano said.
This first meeting of the two levels of government was sponsored by a special commission established by the Board of Legislators and named LINK, which is not an acronym but a label that refers to the goal of fostering cooperation among various groups, including business, labor and municipalities. The commission's co-chairwomen are the Board's vice chairwoman, Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican-Conservative from Yonkers, and its former minority leader, Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat from Ossining.
Last week's meeting took place in a much warmer atmosphere than that prevailing two years ago when several local officials were invited to the legislative chambers to suggest ways the county could save money. "They were not received well," Mrs. Galef recalled. "Some legislators were asking why local officials should have any input. Now, that has all changed."
Mrs. Carsky agreed. "It's high time the legislative body held out its hand," she said. "We are trying to reduce what had been an adversarial relationship, and if we can keep this arrangement going, it would be great."
 
Some Tension Over Recycling
 Most participants in the meeting last week agreed that the new spirit of cooperation would continue but so would the frank exchange of views that marked this first encounter between leaders of two different levels of government, who have different perceptions of their responsibilities.
That tension was evident last week when Mr. Tulis said he hoped that county legislative efforts to mandate recycling "would be careful not to hurt successful programs already existing." The state has required municipalities to have mandatory recycling programs in place by Sept. 1.
The county program should allow communities to establish for themselves what products are marketable, Mr. Tulis said, noting that New Castle has established its own standards and found its own markets. "We'll meet state standards," Mr. Tulis said. "Why should you care how we do it? Why do I need another regulatory environment?"
 
More Meetings Anticipated
 Calling the county the designated planning unit for the state, Marilyn J. Slaatten, the County Attorney, said the county must establish standards but that variances would be given.
"We need the data," added James Hogan, the county's Recycling Coordinator. "Not all communities have programs as good as yours."
Despite some obvious frictions, most participants in last week's meeting agreed that they would get together again soon.
"We have a communality of concerns, and we can share ideas to do better government," Mr. Dwyer said. "That desire hasn't been there before. It was us talking up and them down. It was adversarial, parochial and controlling. This new responsiveness may indicate that it's the desire to serve and not political considerations that motivates this government."

HEADLINE: Competing for the Democratic Primary Voter

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE struggle for the Democratic Presidential nomination came to the county last week in the form of two dramatically different campaigners, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, competing for the New York primary vote on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton, seemingly well financed and backed by the county's Democratic leadership, campaigned as a candidate who could no longer depend on his lead over the insurgent Mr. Brown, whose Westchester backers began to organize only three weeks ago in an effort to influence the county's 151,147 registered Democrats. 
 Supporters of Mr. Clinton, who made up most of the 500 party regulars attending the annual Westchester Democratic dinner on March 26 at the Rye Town Hilton in Rye Brook, seek a decisive primary victory as an effective conclusion to Mr. Brown's uphill effort to capture the party's nomination.
Mr. Brown's backers, by contrast, say the discomfort expressed by many Democrats for Mr. Clinton may well be transformed into support for Mr. Brown; they acknowledge, however, that the former California Governor carries his own negative image for a similarly significant segment of Democrats.
One of Mr. Clinton's local backers, former County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, said: "He has been holding up well under the attacks, showing strength, composure, leadership and control. It's a quality I haven't seen in a candidate for a long time."
Mr. DelBello added: "Most of the attacks against Bill Clinton have been superfluous, although some are serious. Nevertheless, in every case he has kept his campaign on course and kept himself under control. He has a big negative in the polls -- people say they don't trust him -- but I think that is going to disappear when he gets into the election campaign and goes head to head with George Bush."
Mr. Clinton's Westchester campaign is being run by Oren J. Teicher. "Since December, when the Governor's wife, Hillary, came here to organize his campaign," he said, "we have been able to put together a broad coalition of Democrats just as he has done at the national level."
Mr. Teicher, who lost two close races for the House of Representatives in 1984 and 1986, said the Clinton team reflected that diversity. "I had been active in Governor Dukakis's campaign," he said, referring to the 1988 Democratic Presidential candidate, Michael S. Dukakis, while County Legislator Herman Keith "had helped run the Jesse Jackson campaign" and Toby Nussbaum of Scarsdale, a Clinton backer with her husband, Bernard, "had been a Simon delegate," a reference to Senator Paul Simon of Illinois.
Mr. Teicher said other Clinton supporters in the county had in previous years supported Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
He said the county's Clinton campaign had two opponents: "Jerry Brown and an apathy based on the feeling that the Governor has the primary sewed up."
"A number of people at the dinner were asking each other, why vote?" Mr. Teicher added. "There's a greater-than-ever turn-off this year."
As a result, the Clinton campaign strategy has been to "get the public involved." Political advertisements on local radio stations have been geared to getting people to come to Clinton rallies; his message is "Give me an opportunity to be heard." Clinton backers have also been handing out campaign literature.
Eli Vigliano, a Yonkers lawyer, is chairman of the Brown campaign in Westchester. "We started after the Michigan primary" on March 17, he said, in which Mr. Brown came in second with 28 percent of the vote, beating former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. Mr. Tsongas, who got 18 percent of the Michigan vote, withdrew from the primary race a few days later.
The growing uncertainty of the New York Democratic primary and the strong showing by Mr. Tsongas in Connecticut, where he got 20 percent of the vote even after he had withdrawn, put the Westchester Tsongas Committee "back in business" last Wednesday, said Marc S. Oxman, who heads the committee. "Although Paul Tsongas has suspended his campaign," Mr. Oxman said, "many Democrats believe that he is the only candidate who can defeat George Bush in November."
Mr. Tsongas remains on the New York primary ballot, as do Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who also left the race. Also on the ballot are former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota and Lawrence A. Agran, a former mayor of Irvine, Calif.
Mr. Clinton, who won 46 percent in Michigan and an equally decisive victory in Illinois, has nearly half the number of delegates needed to win the nomination and has a 7-to-1 lead over Mr. Brown. Nevertheless, Brown backers were heartened by the Michigan results and found newcomers volunteering to aid his campaign.
"I've been active in many campaigns in Westchester, but what struck me about the first meeting of the Brown campaign was there was not one familiar face," Mary Ann Phillips of Rye said. "These were young and eager people, with a lot of energy, who had been apolitical but who now felt something was seriously wrong but that with Brown, now we're going to have a voice."
Mr. Brown's campaign, which Ms. Phillips described as "strictly grass roots," was represented at one of the 35 tables at the Democratic dinner. "We distributed a lot of literature and attracted a lot of attention," she said.
 
Rally at G.M. Plant
 Mr. Vigliano said that since then the campaign had concentrated on preparing telephone banks and organizing motorcades throughout the county.
Mr. Brown's backers were out in full force last Monday when the candidate, in his first campaign appearance in Westchester, conducted a vigorous rally outside the General Motors assembly plant in North Tarrytown. About 300 supporters from all parts of the county waited in a light drizzle for the candidate to appear.
Timed for a shift change at the sprawling assembly plant, the rally nevertheless failed to attract many automobile workers. The majority of them drove out of the parking lot as usual. For those who stayed, Mr. Brown, wearing a union jacket, was no disappointment.
The nation "needs better housing, better health care, better neighborhood security," he said. "This won't happen if we close down the plants," a reference to General Motors's announced intention to close the Tarrytown assembly plant in 1995.
"They can find millions of dollars to clean up the savings and loan mess," Mr. Brown said, referring to the Federal Government, "but nothing to help modernize industry."
 
Plans for Foreign Plants Criticized
 Taking his cue from signs held by plant workers denouncing General Motors for planning to open assembly plants in Mexico and Europe, Mr. Brown criticized "selfish executives" who would make it possible for G.M. to hire "millions in Mexico willing to do what you do for a buck an hour."
Mr. Brown said that his rival, Mr. Clinton, "is backed by people who will finance your extinction and then run ads saying he's for the working people. It's baloney."
Mr. Brown drew cheers, whistles, shouts of "You got that right" and the chant "Jer-ree, Jer-ree."
In the crowd, Debbie Cooper of Peekskill held a posterboard depicting a broken heart and reading "G.M.: The Heartbreak of America." Her husband is one of the General Motors workers who will lose their jobs when the plant closes.
 
$3 Million Pledged for Brown Race
 Bob McCracken, president of Local 1103 of the Communications Workers of America, with headquarters in Port Chester, said: "I like Brown. He's talking about the issues that affect workers, about jobs leaving the country."
Mr. Brown said $3 million "is now pledged" for his campaign and so "we're still in the race." He spoke vigorously, but with the hoarseness of nonstop campaigning. As his white van pulled away from the rally, a woman broke through a barricade to thrust a box of herbal tea -- Throat Care Tea -- into his hands.
Mr. Clinton also demonstrated a common touch after his speech at the Democratic dinner, in which he covered the spectrum of his positions on economic, social, health, educational and tax issues. He left the ballroom not as he had entered, through a side door, but through the clusters of tables. The audience members were on their feet, eager to shake Mr. Clinton's hand, comment on his campaign or ask a question.
Shane Tierney, a 16-year-old of Rye, introduced himself as an R.O.T.C. cadet and said he was "wondering about your policy on the military and cutbacks because I want to know if I have job security."
Mr. Clinton thought for a moment and then said: "Here's what I think. We need fewer people in Europe, perhaps fewer people in Japan, but more mobility on land, air and sea. So I have come out for cuts greater than the President has recommended, focused mostly on the deployment in Europe where a third of our defense budget is now committed, defending against a Soviet threat which isn't, and where a lot of those nations are richer than we are."
 
'They'll Have a Job for You'
 Mr. Clinton spoke of a need for a "new line of submarines," new aircraft and a continuing need for carrier groups, "although not at the levels the Administration wants."
"So the answer is," he concluded, "if you get through and become an officer, they'll have a job for you. We're still going to have a substantial military, but it should not be as big as it is now."
He paused and the Secret Service agents resumed nudging him along. But Mr. Tierney wasn't finished.
"Are you going to have a plan for the people coming home?" the cadet asked. "Are you going to have jobs for them?"
Mr. Clinton replied, "Absolutely." He said that recycling closed bases into training sites for troubled kids and for other uses would be part of a "careful conversion" over five or six years. He spoke of programs to "redirect the energies and abilities" of military personnel.
"Every serious academic study shows that if you cut defense in the proper way you will create more jobs at home," he said.

HEADLINE: Picking Up Pointers for a Self-Help Clearinghouse in Poland

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
A GROUP of community leaders from Poland received a primer here recently on the care and feeding of volunteers and the steps needed to establish an effective self-help network. Eight representatives of the newly formed Ochota Self-Help Association, from the Ochota district of Warsaw, completed a two-week study tour of the United States with a morning session at the Westchester Self-Help Clearinghouse, a division of Westchester Jewish Community Services.
The Polish leaders, their translators and members of the Delphi International Group, a Washington-based organization that arranged the tour, heard Leslie Borck Jameson describe how a successful self-help association works. Dr. Jameson is a psychologist and director of the clearinghouse and is the assistant executive director of special programs for Westchester Jewish Community Services. 
 The White Plains clearinghouse, which Dr. Jameson founded 13 years ago, coordinates services for about 230 support groups in the county. The Polish group, representing such organizations as homeless shelters, church welfare groups, sobriety clubs and associations for the retired or unemployed, serves an area of 180,000 people in the Ochota district of Warsaw. The tour was financed in part by the United States Agency for International Development.
 
Information on Index Cards
 Dr. Jameson described the basics of her operation. "We are very non-fancy," she told her visitors. "You don't need a lot of money to start a self-help clearinghouse." Holding up a well-worn index card file, she said: "This is our information system. You don't need a computer."
She talked about the core of the system -- the white cards listing mutual support groups, the pink cards listing professional services in the county. She also distributed the organization's directory, now in its eighth edition, noting that the book and card system went hand in hand.
Self-help groups, held together by volunteers, spring up because "I believe few people come to professionals for help in most situations," Dr. Jameson said.
Elise Ginsburg, an associate with the Delphi group who helped lead the tour, said volunteerism in Poland was in its infancy. The church or government used to take care of people's needs, she said, so that volunteer work had never been encouraged. Indeed, one man drew a laugh when he said that "Under Communism, anytime we wanted to do things ourselves the regime took down our names."
Now, Ms. Ginsburg said, a small number of people usually did all the volunteer jobs. But because of growing problems caused by homelessness and unemployment in Poland, she predicted that "once volunteerism is understood, I think it will spread like wildfire."
The Poles were surprised to hear that Americans, through their state and county taxes, were willing to subsidize their more than 60 self-help clearinghouses nationwide, mostly in California and the Northeast. Dr. Jameson explained that because self- help programs had grown into a popular movement, people also contributed funds directly to the clearinghouses as a charity.
A former factory worker in the group who said he wanted to organize the unemployed in Warsaw asked Dr. Jameson "how to start the business in motion." Dr. Jameson outlined the steps: find a place to meet, define whom you want to attend, announce a date and hold the meeting.
Then she spoke about the dynamics of leadership and the importance of group participation. "People are expected to give as well as take," she said. "Long term, this gets people involved in a community, helping each other. In psychological terms, it is important to have the chance to help someone else."
 
From Small Beginnings
 Groups can be formed by people in need -- by parents of disabled children, for example -- or by a professional wishing to help as a volunteer. The problem with professionals, she said, was that people expected them to lead and might not take an active part themselves in the group.
Seated around a long table in a large conference room in a pleasant, modern office, the visitors seemed to need convincing that they, too, could achieve such success. Dr. Jameson repeatedly stressed that her own organization had begun "in a closet," with little money and only a few calls each month. The Westchester Self-Help Clearinghouse had responded to a grass-roots movement, similar to Warsaw's, she said, forming only after 70 mutual-support groups had begun meeting in the county.
"It grew up," she said, spreading her arms.
Before arriving in White Plains, the study group had visited various social-service agencies in Chicago, Washington and upstate New York. Other members of the group also visited the Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Ms. Ginsburg said the Polish leaders had been "impressed that it is prestigious to be a volunteer" in this country. They were also "amazed at how well Americans work together," she said, and "amazed at how efficient we are."
In their travels, the Poles had been especially impressed with a political activist in Chicago, Ms. Ginsburg added. "They loved her -- the way she fought the system for health and welfare rights," Ms. Ginsburg said. "She was angry, determined and stubborn."

HEADLINE: Life Before Gorbachev

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am delighted that Melor Sturua finds my book "What Went Wrong With Perestroika" to be "useful, even successful" (Feb. 2). But he misconstrues several of my arguments. 
 He criticizes me for writing that there were "record-breaking rates of industrial growth in the 1930's" in the Soviet Union, and then notes that "not even one of the five-year plans in the 1930's was fulfilled." Both statements are true -- but the failure to fulfill the plan does not cancel out the fact that there were record rates of growth, even if that growth did not benefit the people. There is a danger that in examining what happened in the Soviet Union, we will ignore the fact that a very impressive industrial and military structure was created. It produced the wrong kinds of goods and collapsed quickly, but it does scholarship a disservice to disavow what in fact did happen in the era before Mikhail Gorbachev.
Mr. Sturua takes several of my statements out of context. For example, I do indeed say that "economic life in the Khrush chev era seemed to be approaching Western standards." But it is clear in context that the emphasis is on "seemed to be." The point is made that the Soviet economy was still a long way from Western equilibrium, and the paragraph that follows makes very clear why the anticipation of an improved economy was unrealistic.
Mr. Sturua also says, "Mr. Goldman . . . writes that Mr. Gorbachev's predecessors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko 'might have adopted a more radical approach [to the economy] if they had lived longer.' " But he does not mention that I devote almost two pages to a discussion of why "it is doubtful that Andropov had in mind anything far-reaching": "His solutions went no further than the old patchwork approach to the Soviet economy." I go on to say that "Andropov's behavior suggests that Gorbachev's actions were instead a discontinuity, not an evolving process, and . . . if he had lived, Andropov might have adhered to very different domestic and international policies from Gorbachev's."
As for Chernenko, I say that "there was never much chance that he would do anything substantial in the way of reform."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Japan's Bubble Is Deflating, But Not Gently

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Nobody has had a tougher job than Yasushi Mieno, the Japanese central banker who set out in 1989 to pierce Japan's "bubble economy," as he called it, without hurting the real economy.
Now, with the Japanese economy reeling -- auto sales have been down for 16 of the last 17 months and industrial production is down 4 percent from a year ago -- Japan is confronting the reality of what John Kenneth Galbraith wrote about Wall Street in 1929: "A bubble can easily be punctured. But to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy." 
 In Tokyo last week, the Japanese market sneered at the Government's caricature of a fiscal-stimulus package and then scorned Mr. Mieno's decision to cut the discount rate by only three-quarters of a percentage point. When the dust cleared, the Nikkei 225 index was down 5.5 percent for the week, despite a small rebound on Friday.
"For the first time in modern history, the Japanese market has not responded to lower interest rates," said Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist. "That is very negative."
For optimists, there was some cheering news. Fundamentals, which Japan used to ignore, actually seem to count now. Such blue-chip stocks as Sony and Matsushita were up for the week, and it is possible to argue with a straight face that, based on cash flow, some Japanese blue chips are not much more expensive than their American counterparts. It is tempting to conclude that any market selling for less than half its high must be a good buy.
On the other side are the fears that there are still many losses yet to be admitted by the banks and insurance companies, some of which placed big bets against falling stock prices a couple of years ago. Maybe some of those bets were hedged. And maybe not.
Unfortunately, it appears that corporate cash flows are destined to drop, and not just because of the economy. No country was a more eager participant than Japan in the easy credit craze of the late 1980's. Companies borrowed trillions of yen at interest rates that were very low or even, as James Lyle, the manager of Fidelity's Overseas Fund, points out, negative. That was because the bonds came with warrants, allowing the buyer to profit if stock prices kept rising. More than $100 billion of such bonds will mature in the next two years, to be refinanced at much higher rates, if they can be refinanced at all.
Japan is not popular in the United States these days, and few tears will be shed if a severe recession does develop. But the world has good reason to hope that does not happen. With imports shrinking, Japan's trade surplus is on the rise again, a fact that will not help America's recovery.
It is far from clear what Mr. Mieno should try now. When bubbles burst, ridiculously high prices have a way of falling to unreasonably low levels. And, in Mr. Biggs's words, "at its peak, the Japanese stock market was the biggest bubble of all time."

HEADLINE: Mellowed by Age, but Still a Tough Boss

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
MINNETONKA, Minn.
When Marilyn Nelson describes her father, 77-year-old Curtis L. Carlson, the founder and sole stockholder of the Carlson Companies, she says this: "If Curt were riding a bicycle, he'd peddle downhill."
The remark helps explain why Mr. Carlson, who started at the height of the Depression what would grow into a hotel, travel and marketing company, became impatient last year when the recession seemed to be taking its toll. "The margins evaporated," Mr. Carlson said, sending profits down substantially. He wanted more from his company, even though the war in the Persian Gulf and the recession had sent the travel industry reeling. 
 "We had too much gloom and doom around here," Mr. Carlson explained in a recent interview in his office here in this Minneapolis suburb. "People were waiting too long for things to turn around."
Mr. Carlson didn't say it directly, but it was clear from the context that what he meant by "people" was largely Edwin C. (Skip) Gage, Mr. Carlson's son-in-law who in 1989 became Carlson's chief executive and heir apparent.
So, with the suddenness of a South American coup, Mr. Gage was out last November. Mr. Gage says he quit, but the shift has all the earmarks of an ouster. And Mr. Carlson, who just 10 months before had quadruple coronary bypass surgery, was back running things day to day. He now seems to be grooming his elder daughter, Marilyn, 52, for the top job. Mrs. Nelson, who is married to a surgeon, and her sister Barbara, 49, who is married to Mr. Gage, are in line to inherit the company when Mr. Carlson dies.
But Curtis Carlson's gloom and doom could easily be considered joyous boom times at many other companies. Systemwide revenues, including sales at Carlson's extensive franchise operations, rose nearly 15 percent last year, to $9.3 billion, from $8.1 billion in 1990. And Carlson properties have continued to multiply at a breakneck pace. The company is now adding almost 30 travel agencies a month to the 2,100 it already has. It is adding one hotel every six days to the 315 it operates under the Radisson and Colony names. And by 1996, it expects to more than double its chain of TGI Friday's restaurants, which now number 200.
 
'Already Major Players'
 Indeed, despite all the bumps of the past year, Carlson still seems to be on a roll, cushioned from any really painful shocks -- at least so far -- by the global nature of its operations, its minimal debt load and Mr. Carlson's hold-their-feet-to-the-fire management style.
"With their global view and the way they have diversified, they are already major players, and well positioned for the future," said Paul E. Wise, director of the hotel, restaurant and institutional management program at the University of Delaware.
Carlson's hotel operation, added Edward Watkins, editor of Lodging Hospitality magazine, "kept its head on straight in the 80's, when everybody else was going overboard."
Many experts now think Carlson is well on its way to becoming the undisputed giant of the travel industry. With a network of 75 companies in 38 countries, Carlson has its hand in virtually every art of the business, posing a vigorous challenge to better-known competitors like American Express and Thomas Cook.
Travelers need never leave the Carlson fold. They can book plane tickets through a Carlson travel agency, stay at a Radisson hotel, eat at any of several kinds of Carlson restaurants and pay for everything with Carlson travelers checks or a Carlson credit card. They will soon be able to book passage on the Radisson Diamond, a futuristic-looking twin-hulled cruise ship that goes into service on May 7.
To be sure, the lingering effects of the recession are probably still pinching profits, although the company will not disclose exact figures. The precise financial condition of Carlson is said to be known only to Mr. Carlson and a few close associates.
And then there is the matter of who will succeed Mr. Carlson. Though his daughters are in line to inherit the company when Mr. Carlson dies, the question remains whether he will turn over the reins before then.
Mrs. Nelson is now serving as vice chairman of Carlson Holdings Inc., the parent not only of the Carlson Companies but also of the family's investment and real estate arms, although she joined the company full time only two years ago.
If Mr. Carlson should again have second thoughts about a successor, he could turn to either of his two chief operating lieutenants: Juergen Bartels, the 51-year-old president of the hospitality group, who has been with the company since 1983, and Charles Schmid, 49, president of the marketing and travel groups. Mr. Schmid, a former senior executive with the Miller Brewing Company, was brought in last summer by Mr. Carlson to prevent any further erosion of profits.
For now, the founding father is being cagey. "I'm going to stay on for an indefinite period," a hale-looking Mr. Carlson said during the recent interview. "I don't want to retire. My daughter is busy learning the business, and she has tremendous capacity. But time will tell where we are."
 
The Long View
 Curtis Carlson has been taking the long view almost from the beginning. At the same time, Mr. Carlson, born in Minneapolis with what he describes as "restless Swedish genes," has never been one to wait for things to happen. "Even now, the idea of coasting just hasn't occurred to him," Mrs. Nelson said about her father.
Mr. Carlson's refusal to coast, for example, led him to give up his job as a top soap salesman for the Procter & Gamble Company and take on the risks of entrepreneurship during the Depression. He was barely out of his teens in 1938 when he formed the Gold Bond Stamp Company, selling trading stamps to retail outlets.
Trading-stamp companies like Gold Bond had swept the nation by the 50's, inspiring consumer loyalty by offering appliances and other premiums to those who saved enough stamps. But by the mid-60's, the stamp companies had reached the saturation point.
Mr. Carlson had seen the handwriting on the wall some years earlier and began to diversify into real estate in Minneapolis' western suburbs. In 1962, he bought the Radisson Hotel in downtown Minneapolis. By 1973, the company had diversified enough to warrant dropping the Gold Bond name. (Gold Bond stamps are still being circulated, primarily at truck stops.)
In 1975, the Carlson Companies bought the Dallas-based TGI Friday's. Three year later, it bought the Ask Mr. Foster travel agency. Each step led to the next step.
"When we diversified into hotels," Mr. Carlson said, "I learned we had people with know-how in the restaurant business, so we went into Friday's. And the hotels are synergistic with our travel agencies."
By 1985, Carlson owned all or part of 22 hotels. "But we were only earning 5 percent on our money," Mr. Carlson said, "and I knew we had to take another approach." Today, the company owns only 10 Radisson hotels, just 3 percent of the total, and a little more than half of the 2,100 retail travel agencies that bear its name. The rest are franchises or are run by Carlson under management contracts.
Carlson is now divided into three operating groups. The biggest by far is travel, which had overall revenues, including sales at franchises, of $6.1 billion last year. The group, known as the Carlson Travel Network, was buoyed last year by the strong performance of its British chain, A. T. Mayes, Mr. Carlson said. But domestic agencies saw profits weaken and some defections occurred.
 
Breaking Away in Utah
 For example, Morris Travel Express of Salt Lake City, which has 23 offices in Utah and Idaho, recently dropped its affiliation with Carlson to join the American Express travel network. "We felt that American Express is a better fit for our marketplace," said Mark G. Flack, Morris's president, who declined to elaborate.
After pointing to the "record growth" of its travel franchise program in 1991, when it added 329 franchises for a total of 902, a spokesman for the Carlson Travel Network said of the Morris defection, "Unfortunately, there will always be those who want to try new affiliations -- it's a business reality."
The hospitality group, with overall revenues of $2.3 billion, is the second biggest. It encompasses both hotels and restaurants, including its jewel, the Radisson chain.
"Radisson appears very well positioned for the 90's," said Mr. Watkins of Lodging Hospitality, citing its relative lack of debt and the business it gets from the Carlson Travel Network. The only negative, he said, is that the Radisson name is not as well known as that of some of its competitors.
The smallest group is marketing, with sales of $900 million. Marketing manages the frequent-flier programs of Northwest, British Airways, SAS, KLM and Swissair. It also puts together incentive programs that companies offer to employees. Sometimes those incentives are trips, which Carlson also puts together. In good times, the Big Three auto companies sponsor lots of incentive programs, but last year they cut back hard -- and that sharply affected the marketing group's bottom line, Mr. Carlson said.
In all, Carlson directly employs 35,000 people, with an additional 63,000 at affiliated and franchise operations. About $6.1 billion, or roughly two-thirds of systemwide revenues, go directly to Carlson.
At the company's annual sales meeting in February, Mr. Carlson said he had decided to abandon his practice of using five-year sales targets in favor of a three-year time frame. "Three years is more realistic going into the 90's and the year 2000," he said. "We will simply examine our progress more often," reflecting his belief that the company needs greater flexibility as competition intensifies.
But while the words are different, Mr. Carlson has not changed his basic tune. Executives are on notice to increase business 15 percent this year, presumably including profits. He insists there is plenty of room for growth even in a weak economy.
Mr. Carlson has mellowed some with age, according to those who have known him for years, so that his public outbursts over what he considers managerial lapses are less frequent. But he remains a tough boss, they say.
"He can tolerate an occasional failure, but not repeated failure and not lack of effort," said Mr. Bartels of the hospitality group.
If Mr. Carlson should find his daughter's leadership abilities wanting, J. B., as Mr. Bartels is known, would clearly be a candidate for the top job. In the respectful tone of one workaholic speaking of another, Mr. Carlson said, "J. B. never flies into any city without having at least four appointments lined up."
For her part, Mrs. Nelson acknowledges that she has yet to master the nuts and bolts of the varied Carlson holdings. "I didn't come up through the business," she said, "so I don't know every single thing. But I feel that I'm continuing to learn." Current and former Carlson employees say she has the intelligence, acumen and drive for the top position.
 
Living by the Lake
 Mrs. Nelson joined Carlson full time in December 1989. An economics major at Smith College, she has owned the Citizens State Bank of Waterville, Minn., with her sister, Barbara Gage, since 1971. She is also on the board of three other companies, including the Exxon Corporation. She is married to Dr. Glen D. Nelson, who is vice chairman of Medtronic Inc., a pacemaker manufacturer. Dr. Nelson is also on the board of Carlson Holdings.
Despite the executive suite shuffle that cost Skip Gage his job last year -- but not his board seat -- the Carlson, Nelson and Gage families are said to remain close. They live side-by-side on lakefront property not far from the company's headquarters, as they have for years, and they still worship together Sundays in the United Methodist Church in downtown Minneapolis.
When Mr. Gage gave up the chief executive's title, he was allowed to buy three marketing companies from Carlson. Operating as the Gage Marketing Group, the three have about 1,500 employees and revenues of $120 million. For the time being, the group is based at the Carlson headquarters.
Mr. Gage said last week that he quit because of pressure building up between Mr. Carlson and himself.
"Curt and I were both trying to do the C.E.O.'s job at the same time," he said. "It wasn't satisfying for either of us, and we had different views of how to approach the problems."
Mrs. Nelson is likely to have a smoother relationship with Mr. Carlson, and not just because she is his daughter.
"She has a lot of Curt's qualities, including his determination to succeed and his salesmanship, but she brings a lot of caring and a lot of concern about relationships," said Peter Davis, academic director of the Family Business Executive Programs at the Wharton School. "She's not at all pretentious, and she's very willing to communicate."
Professor Davis added that those qualities are likely to be more important than hands-on management, once the torch is passed, because the Carlson empire is "substantially professionalized now, with some high-powered managers already in place."
In the long run, what really matters is not whether others think Mrs. Nelson is qualified to run the company, but whether her father thinks so. For after Mr. Gage's departure, few think that Curt Carlson will be guided by sentiment in the matter of his succession.
Mrs. Nelson certainly does not. "I understand to the depths of my being what this company means to Curt," she said in a recent interview. "This is his child, and he couldn't stop being its parent any more than I could stop being my kids' mom."
 
 
 
GROWTH BY FRANCHISING
 Changing its focus in the mid-80's, from owning hotels and travel agencies to franchising and managing them, has enabled the Carlson Companies to expand quickly at a time when money has been tight.
"Other people put up the money, we train them and if they want we put in our own management team until they're ready to take over," said Curtis L. Carlson, the company founder. "We're literally spending millions of dollars on training and advertising."
The company is also making millions in fees and royalties, based on the following formula for its retail travel agency franchises:
Associates, as the franchisees are called, sign a three-year contract and pay a one-time fee of $3,600 for the first office and $1,500 for each additional office. Each year, they pay a royalty of 4.5 percent of the first $300,000 in gross commissions, 3.5 percent of commissions between $300,000 and $500,000 and 2 percent above that.
They also pay a marketing fee of 1.5 percent of gross commissions, up to a maximum of $7,500, for national advertising. And they agree to spend 3 percent of commissions on local advertising and promotion. Finally, the Carlson name must be placed before the agency's own trade name.

 
 
KEEPING BUSINESS ALL IN THE FAMILY
 More than five decades after the Carlson empire was founded, the business remains largely a family affair.
Curtis L. Carlson is chairman, president and chief executive of Carlson Holdings Inc., the umbrella company, and he remains the sole stockholder. Marilyn Nelson, his older daughter, and Edwin C. (Skip) Gage, the husband of his younger daughter, are vice chairmen and directors. Also directors are Mr. Carlson's wife of 54 years, Arleen; their younger daughter, Barbara Gage, and Dr. Glen D. Nelson, their other son-in-law.
The only nonfamily directors are Matthew J. Levitt, a Minneapolis attorney, and Rodney Wilson, the chief financial officer.
The board of the Carlson Companies, parent of the three operating groups, consists of Mr. Carlson, his two daughters, Mr. Gage, Mr. Levitt, Mr. Wilson and one other outsider, Carl R. Pohlad, president of the Marquette Bank Minneapolis and owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball team.
Mr. Carlson's will provides that the business will be left in equal shares to his daughters. In the event they disagree about corporate matters, each will be allowed to choose a lawyer acceptable to the other to try to work things out. If they still disagree, an arbitrator will be named to settle the dispute.
The Nelsons have three adult children and the Gages have four, all of whom will eventually receive stock under terms that will require them to sell the shares back to the company if they decide to cash in.
Only one of Mr. Carlson's grandchildren is involved in the business: Curtis Nelson, a 28-year-old graduate of Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration. Mr. Nelson is director of marketing at the Radisson Mart Plaza Hotel at Miami International Airport.

Bush's Surprise Plan to Help Yeltsin's Government 

When President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany announced that the world's wealthiest nations would give $24 billion to the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, all that was lacking was the vision thing. Though the figure was broken down -- $6 billion to stabilize the ruble, $2.5 billion to reschedule Russia's debt, $4.5 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund and $11 billion in direct aid -- aside from the United States ($4.5 billion), just who would give what was left hanging. When Mr. Bush called a news conference, he failed to notify Japan. That miffed Tokyo. And what would all that direct aid be used for? A quarter of the American aid will be in the form of food credits -- a bad idea some say. "They don't need food, they need food processing equipment and trucks," said Benjamin Weiner, of Probe International, a consulting firm. "Food credits are for the American farmers."
 
Japan -- Bad News and Rice
 
When it afflicted Europe, it was called Euro sclerosis -- a mixture of slow growth and rigid labor markets resulting in rising costs and shrinking profits. Now Japan may have caught the malady. Economists put Japan's growth rate at 1.5 percent this year, lower than the Government's estimate, and the country's no-layoff policy means costs could rise even as growth slows. Profits and investment are starting to sag, the stock market is at 1986 levels and rather than investing overseas, Japan is repatriating funds. Last week Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa proposed a cure: a $37 billion public works program. The Bank of Japan followed by clipping three-quarters of a point from the discount rate, bringing it to 3.75 percent. But economists doubt the efficacy of the remedy. "The party's over," said Paul Summerville, of Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
 
For years, trade negotiators have been pressuring Japan to open its market to American rice. Last week, Tokyo finally agreed, but with a catch: American rice may be displayed at a food fair later this month but "the U.S. may not promote the rice for sale or let the participants taste it during the exhibition," said Masami Tanabu, Japan's Agriculture Minister.

Exit Cresson, Enter Beregovoy
 
Tough-talking Edith Cresson, who resigned last week as France's Prime Minister, managed to offend almost everyone during her 10 months in office. Among other things, she questioned the virility of British men -- Anglo-Saxon men are not interested in women as women, she said -- and called the Japanese, "worker ants." But when she offended French voters it was too much. With an election looming, a recession underway and the popularity of the ruling Socialist party tumbling -- only 31 percent of the voters support it -- Mrs. Cresson had to go. French President Francois Mitterrand appointed Pierre Beregovoy, the Finance Minister, to take her place. It was Mr. Beregovoy who brought France's inflation rate down to 3 percent and liberalized its financial markets.

Beer Attack on Canada
 
Getting American suds into Canada has been difficult at best, even with the free trade pact and pressure from the Bush Administration. Last week, Canada's Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, said Canada would open up its beer market in about three years. But three years is not fast enough to slake the the President's thirst for open markets. The Administration let it be known that it may impose duties on Canadian beer this week.
 
South Carolina, Meet BMW
 
Rumor has it that BMW, which builds its ultimate driving machines only in Germany, is considering placing a plant in the United States, specifically in Anderson, S.C. Last week, Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW's chairman, admitted that Anderson was being considered. He also admitted BMW, which had sales of $18.2 billion last year, more than half from exports, needed more capacity. If built, the new plant would probably be small, analysts say. "It could do well with a volume of 50,000 cars a year," said Philip Ayton, who follows BMW for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
 
The Squeeze on Olympia & York
 
Olympia & York Ltd., the big Canadian developer, owes its creditors $18.5 billion. It owns millions of square feet of vacant space and is strapped for cash. So last week, when $450 million of its loans came due, it tried to get its creditors to extend that debt for another year. The bankers refused to comply. The loan's collateral, the 68-story Scotia Plaza in Toronto's financial district, may now be seized.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Keating Accountants Pay Up
 
Twenty-three thousand investors -- more or less -- were defrauded by Charles H. Keating. They invested in worthless securities sold by Mr. Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and its parent company, the American Continental Corporation, and lost $430 million. The investors argued that they wouldn't have bought those securities if Mr. Keating's auditors had done their job and called attention to irregularities. They also argued that by fending off the regulators, Mr. Keating's lawyers were part of the scam. Last week, in an out-of-court settlement, Ernst & Young, the nation's second-largest accounting firm, agreed to pay $63 million in fines, and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the nation's third-largest law firm, agreed to pay $24 million. Neither firm admitted guilt.

G.E.'s Cameo at the Oscars
 
When the film maker Debra Chasnoff accepted the Oscar for best short-subject documentary, gasps could be heard in Fairfield, Conn. That's where the General Electric Company has its headquarters. In front of an audience of about one billion people, Ms. Chasnoff, who won the award for "Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons and Our Environment," urged consumers to boycott G.E. She mentioned its involvement in the manufacture of nuclear weapons at the contaminated Hanford Nuclear Power Reservation in eastern Washington. G.E., was not amused. "These people's goal is unilateral disarmament, and unilateral disarmament has virtually no support among the American people," said Joyce Hergenhan, a spokeswoman for G.E.

Disney's TV Strategy
 
Last week the deal makers at the Walt Disney Company agreed to an interesting swap. They will trade KCAL-TV in Los Angeles for a 45 percent stake in Pinelands, the company that owns WWOR-TV, Channel 9, in metropolitan New York. The deal, which is worth about $210 million, means Disney gives up full control of one broadcast station but gets partial control of two. It also gives Disney "a wealth of programming opportunities," said Richard Frank, president of Disney's studio division.

G.M. to Part With Allison
 
The General Motors Corporation has had its share of red ink lately. To raise a little cash, it said it will sell its Allison Gas Turbine Division -- which manufactures turbine engines. Allison builds aircraft and helicopter engines and power-generating turbines.

 
 
ECONOMY

 
Tiptoeing Toward Recovery
 
The economy may not be bungee-jumping off the Hollywood sign, or doing one-handed push-ups a la Jack Palance on Oscar night, but it is starting to show a little life. The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent for February, the second rise in a row. "A recovery does seem in place after 18 months of recession and 11 quarters of distinctly sub par economic growth," said Allen Sinai, of the Boston Company Economic Advisors. Mr. Sinai expects first-quarter growth of between 1 percent and 2 percent.

The Consumer Smiles, a Little
 
Consumers, in the doldrums for months, are beginning to get a little more confident, the Conference Board reported last week. The Board's consumer confidence index jumped to 54 in March, from 47.3 in February. The index was 100 in 1985. Consumers are a little less worried about their job prospects, it seems. But they are not yet ready to open up their wallets. The board said just 5.9 percent of those who responded to its survey said they were planning to buy a new car. Even fewer -- just 3.3 percent -- said they were planning to purchase a house. According to Fabian Linden, the survey director, the results should be "assessed with considerable caution."
 
Not Much Hope on Jobs
 
Unemployment remained unchanged for March at 7.3 percent, the Labor Department said last week. "Overall labor market conditions as measured by our data held steady in March," said William Barron, deputy commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Steady or not, what was worrisome to economists was how few jobs were created last month -- just 19,000, well below the consensus forecast of 45,000. "The numbers are not good," said Frank Pusateri, an economist at the Bank of Boston.

In S.&L's, Even the Bailout Stalls
 
Many in Congress feel the Government's bail out of the savings and loan industry has been managed about as badly as the savings and loans themselves. Billions of dollars are unaccounted for, questionable deals abound and the bailout is proceeding slowly. So slowly, in fact, that the Resolution Trust Corporation still has $17 billion left in its till from the $25 billion Congress authorized it to spend in December. The R.T.C. was supposed to dispense that money by April 1. Last week it asked Congress for more time. The Senate said yes, but the House overwhelmingly voted no. The House vote shut down the bailout. The R.T.C. said it would stop arranging sales of troubled institutions. Last week, a bill was introduced in Congress to get things going again.

Is the Forecast Too Good to Be True?

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Fabian Linden says he is known around the Conference Board, the business-research organization, as Mr. Doom and Gloom. For one thing, he is in charge of polling consumer confidence, which has lately been more of an oxymoron than an index. "I can't be accused of being an irrepressible optimist," he said in a recent interview.
Nevertheless, Mr. Linden is author of a report, released late last month by the Conference Board, that seems to contradict the pessimistic figures that cascade across his desk every month as well as the pessimistic prophecies from America's departments of economics. "The Great Income Reshuffle" predicts that the 90's will be a period of economic growth, expanded personal and household income and increased opportunity. "The idea that we are losing the middle class and the American dream is tarnished has no basis in reality," Mr. Linden said. 
 Mr. Linden argues that the United States has demographics on its side: a huge segment of the 78 million-member baby-boom generation is about to hit its so-called peak earning years of 45 to 55, which will expand higher-income brackets; the numbers of women entering the labor force will continue to grow and, as they gain experience, they will achieve wage parity with men. And, Mr. Linden predicts, the young segment of the baby-boom cohort, which hasn't married yet, will soon start to marry in droves, creating multi-paycheck households.
Little is loved more in journalism than the contrarian point of view, and Mr. Linden's study has made the rounds in the last week. Its sudden intrusion into the discussion of the future of the American economy and its workers and businesses infuriates holders of more conventionally downbeat opinions.
"It hurts people because it gets in the way of a constructive discussion of work in America," said Dan Lacey, editor of Workplace Trends, a Westlake, Ohio-based newsletter. "When some high-profile person from a place like the Conference Board throws out a report like this, it sets us back."
The problem seems to be not so much Mr. Linden's data as his interpretation. "The data are not untrue," said Heidi Hartmann, an economist who is director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. "It is just a different way of looking at the same data."
Richard S. Belous, a senior economist at the National Planning Association, also in Washington, was a little blunter about the study: "If you torture data long enough it will testify to anything," he said.
Mr. Belous, who once worked at the Conference Board, says he was amazed at the study's projections. "We have projected that the 90's will be slow growth, with no real increase in the living standard." he said. "I do not see a fast-growing economy. There is no engine to growth and I don't see one coming."
There is some dispute on facts. Ms. Hartmann is dubious about the report's characterization of women's income: "Their earnings contribute more to families at the bottom than families at the top," meaning that their wages are more likely to maintain than expand household income. And the Census Bureau projects nowhere near the huge growth in the marriage rate predicted by the Conference Board.
But the fundamental issue, according to critics, is that the study's focus on demographics misses the point. For example, Mr. Linden argues that the demise of the middle class is greatly exaggerated and that Labor Department figures do not support the "alarmist" thesis that middle-income jobs are vaporizing. "The distribution of occupations per se doesn't say anything about income," said John Bregger, an assistant commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, echoing the sentiments of other experts.
And that seems to be the crux of the criticism: "It's ignoring the key thing people care about -- their wages," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist who said there has been a great polarization of earnings in the last decade. "People with low skills have taken a big beating; people with high skills have had a rise in earnings." He added: "If the study is a marketing guide, it may be exactly what people want to know. Marketers don't care why people have more money."
Because his study is a marketing guide, Mr. Linden, whose official title at the Conference Board is director of the Consumer Research Center, sounds slightly startled by his critics. His intent was to provide information businesses could use to predict consumer behavior in the 90's. He says he has no political agenda and he does not sound like someone who much enjoys spending time reading the entrails of economists: "We shouldn't whip ourselves into the notion that we are going straight to hell."
 
 
 
THE END OF UPWARD MOBILITY?
 Part of the objection Dan Lacey, editor of Workplace Trends newsletter, has to the Conference Board's rosy scenario for the 90's is that he spends a lot of time traveling and talking to people with horror stories about losing jobs, medical benefits, homes, savings, whatever. "It's not as bad as you've heard," he said. "It's worse."
Baby boomers have yet to come to grips with the fact that their parents' expansive access to opportunity, from which their own expectations were derived, was almost certainly anomalous. "The postwar boom was experienced by one generation of American workers," he said. "To extrapolate anything from those decades is foolish."
Is he perhaps confusing an extended recession with the twilight of civilization? "A lot of unhappiness some economists have is that we are in a recession and have some severe social problems," said Fabian Linden, author of the Conference Board report.
But Richard Belous, an economist, says the recession isn't the issue: "It will pass. There are still long-term structural problems that will diminish growth."

HEADLINE: Canada's Mighty Banks on a March to the South

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
A new group has joined the cross-border shopping spree: Canadian banks. Prodded by the drive for free trade between America and Canada and the recent wave of bank mergers in the United States that has threatened their North American standing, Canada's banks are jockeying to acquire American assets.
* Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country's second-largest bank, bought $750 million of secured loans from the failed Bank of New England in 1990 and now has its line out for a full-scale bank. 
 * The National Bank of Canada, the country's sixth-largest, bought secured commercial loans from the Bank of New England and nine branches outside of New England from the New England Financial Corporation, an arm of the Boston Bancorp, giving it 16 offices in the United States, more than any Canadian bank. "Our strategy is to build on what we have in mid-size lending to mid-sized business," said Pierre Paquette, senior executive vice president.
* Since it was acquired seven years ago by the Bank of Montreal, Harris Bancorp of Chicago has bought 13 suburban banks. Anticipating the purchase of at least one more significant financial institution in the United States, Matthew W. Barrett, chairman and chief executive of the Bank of Montreal, said he expects the United States to account for 50 percent of earnings by the year 2000, up from less than 30 percent today.
Canadian banks are foraging to the south in part because they are reaching expansion limits at home. Although Canada has only a handful of banks, compared with 12,400 in the United States, it is perhaps the most overbanked country in the world in terms of branches per customer, with more bank branches than bars, according to Peter C. Newman, a columnist for Mclean's.
"We have 25 percent of the market here," noted Allan R. Taylor, chairman and chief executive of the Royal Bank, Canada's largest. "To achieve 30 percent would take a great deal of doing. The United States is the most logical place for expansion."
And American regulators seem to be welcoming Canadian buyers wholeheartedly, in part because they are more robust and profitable than their cousins to the south. The southern expansion is not likely either to be slowed by the crisis afflicting Canada's richest family, the Reichmann brothers, whose Olympia & York real estate empire, one of the world's largest, recently ran into a liquidity crisis. Bank shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange have fallen about 15 percent since Jan. 1, due to the difficulties of the Reichmanns and profit-taking after setting new highs last year. But the banks seem well postioned to weather any losses.
Analysts say the Olympia & York developments might even provide greater impetus for banks to push into the American consumer market. "Once again, as in the failure of Dome Petroleum or Campeau Corporation, we're finding that corporate banking tends to be high risk," said Alain Tuchmaier, financial services analyst for McLean McCarthy Inc., a subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt. "This will intensify efforts to diversify into retail banking -- clearly one of the potential avenues of growth in the U.S."
Canadian banks are among the most profitable and secure in the world. While loan losses have been rising during the recession, which has hit Canadians far harder than Americans, four of the Big Six banks still reported record profits for last year. Over the past two decades, just 20 thrifts and two small regional banks failed in Canada, compared with hundreds in the United States.
The reasons for their good performance are a savings rate that is two to three times that in the United States and a friendly regulatory environment. Seen as a great unifying force, banks here have been left relatively free to run their own affairs. Nationwide banking is encouraged. Banks even own investment houses, whereas in the United States banks have been largely barred from stock market activities since 1933.
Thanks to the favorable regulatory environment, Canada's Big Six national banks -- Royal, Canadian Imperial, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto Dominion and the National Bank of Canada -- control about half of all Canadian personal deposits, nearly two-thirds of personal loans and one-third of all mortgages outstanding. The rest of the Canadian market is divided by 58 smaller banks, 56 of them foreign owned; 80 trust companies and 3,000 credit union branches.
But some analysts say they need to expand in the United States if only to protect their positions in Canada. As barriers come down under the 1989 Canadian-American free trade agreement, warned James L. Darroch, professor of international business at York University, "Canadian banks risk losing market share in Canada if they can't help their clients in the United States."
The merger wave in the United States has also added a sense of urgency. Since the marriage of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, the Royal Bank has dropped to third place among banks in North America, from second. "The Canadians desperately want to find the right property," said Jeffrey N. Wieser, former president of the Manufacturers Hanover Bank of Canada.
High in the towers above Bay Street overlooking gray-blue expanses of Lake Ontario, senior officers of Canada's top banks sift piles of data on American banks. "What we have in mind is buying something that is really small and then adding to it," said Mr. Taylor of the Royal Bank. "We'll start regional, but of course we have national aspirations because that's what we know best."
The Royal Bank was rumored last year to be interested in linking with the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, which would give it access to a huge retail business. But both banks have stoutly denied any such marriage plans. Royal's chief acknowledges that his special acquisitions committee has looked closely at "maybe 30 or 35" American banks, but will not name prospective candidates.
Yet the name of one candidate came out last fall in a bidding war for Security Bancorp Inc. of Southgate, Mich. Royal faced off with the First American Bank Corporation of Kalamazoo, Mich., which won with a share swap worth $552 million, nearly three times book value. Price rather than country of origin seemed to be the deciding factor. "I think three times book is too much, just way too much of a premium," Mr. Taylor said.
Jeffrey S. Chisholm, vice chairman of the Bank of Montreal, said his institution is also looking hard at the Middle West. "We need a good cultural fit," he said.
Southward expansion is not without pitfalls. Royal Trustco Ltd. for example, talked glowingly about North American prospects in 1989, when it paid $212 million for the Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation. It has since had to write off an unexpected large volume of bad loans.
Misjudgment of cross-border market risks were spotlighted in the collapse of retail empire of Robert Campeau; Peoples Jewellers Ltd., whose Texas-based Zale Corporation recently filed for Chapter 11, and Canadian Tire, which muffed an expansion in Texas a few years ago.
Not all Canadian banks even agree that an American presence is desireable. "You can't buy a bank in the United States that would give you a reasonable amount of market share without spending a huge amount of money, and you can't make money in the United States unless you have a big market share," said R. M. Thomson, chairman and chief executive of the $68.9 billion Toronto Dominion Bank, which has been especially hard hit by the economic downturn in Ontario. "We feel we can build a strong North American position without buying anything."
 
 
 
PREPARED FOR OLYMPIA & YORK
 Noting that assets of the Reichmann family's Olympia & York real estate and natural resources empire still outweigh their debts, many banking analysts here see the crisis as essentially a short-term cash problem that should not impair banks.
Canadian banks' outstanding loans to the Reichmanns are believed to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, representing about 10 percent of the industry's equity base.
Kersi Doodha, a banking analyst at Maison Placements Canada Inc., said the banks over two years might eventually have to write off 20 percent of their Reichmann exposure, or about $600 million. But the industry traditionally makes generous provisions for possible write-offs -- $3.2 billion this year at the Big Six banks. Against such numbers, Mr. Doodha said, "the Olympia and York situation is really quite manageable."
Allan R. Taylor, head of the Royal Bank, said that even if there should be some Olympia & York write-offs, he sees no need to alter the $740 million in loan-loss provisions his bank has set for this fiscal year. Olympia & York's debt restructuring, Mr. Taylor observed, "is not a life-threatening event for the Royal Bank of Canada."

HEADLINE: A Not-So-Unfortunate Career

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The unfortunate story that Webster Brown portrays is not so unfortunate. During his 26-year career, there have been serious recessions that displaced millions of employees throughout America. How unfortunate is it that Mr. Brown, as part of I.B.M.'s financial assistance program, received in his early retirement program two years of full salary, a lifetime pension eligibility, free health care for himself and his spouse plus many other company-paid benefits? 
 How much is employee loyalty supposed to be worth? Mr. Brown should look at the Americans who have lost jobs with little or no severance, no pension, no health care and no financial security.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: Swarthmore;
No Trees Fall in Forest, And 3 Hear Triumph

DATELINE: SWARTHMORE, Pa.

 BODY:
By turning their final project for an ecology class into a legal appeal to the United States Forest Service, three Swarthmore College students have blocked management policies that they said endangered the ecosystem of the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia.
"Rather than fall into the trap of making academia a detached endeavor, we decided to confront the ecological crises of our times directly," said Brendan Kelly, a senior in political science from Locust Valley, L.I. Mr. Kelly, along with another political-science major, B. J. Chisholm, a junior from Manchester, Conn., and David Tecklin, a senior from San Juan Ridge, Calif., majoring in biological anthropology, filed a legal appeal on two issues affecting the Monongahela ecosystem. 
 The students combined their ecological knowledge with the provisions of the National Environmental Protection Act and the National Forest Management Act to make their case. They objected to a plan for Monongahela that would allow oil and gas wells to be drilled in the next 10 to 15 years and call for the construction of new roadways.
They also appealed the sale plan for timber, which grants the highest-bidding private timber company access to more than 1,700 acres of the forest. The winning company is allowed to clear-cut 1,000 acres, removing all timber with a diameter of two or more inches.
 
Preliminary Injunctions
 In addition to destroying the "biological integrity" of the forest, the students said, the propositions would sacrifice the environment to business interests. "The taxpayers' money pays for the assessments and the drawing up of the plans, and private companies reap the profits," Mr. Kelly said. "The Forest Service is creating economic markets that are destroying the natural forests."
The proposals under attack were approved by James Page, the Monongahela Forest Supervisor. He recommended to the regional supervisor that the appeals be dismissed without review because the environmental studies called for would take at least eight years.
The regional director, Floyd Marita, responded to the appeals by granting two out-of-court preliminary injunctions, halting all actions permitted by the propositions until their ecological impact can be re-assessed.
As a result of their successful appeals, the grass-roots environmental group, Preserve Appalachian Wilderness, invited the students to testify before the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee against Forest Service management policies and to lobby members of Congress to encourage support for the Ancient Forest Protection Act and the Forest Biodiversity Protection and Clearcutting Prohibition Act.
 
Technical Skills
 "I was told a number of times by Congressional aides that it was very refreshing not to be sitting with a professional lobbyist, but to talk with someone who was more invested in the issue," Ms. Chisholm said.
"As students, we have access to a lot of information and technical skills," Mr. Tecklin said. "Our role is to provide those to concerned citizen groups to facilitate their own efforts."
Known as the Eastern Forests and Mountains Conservation Project, the group has expanded this semester to more than 20 from the three Swarthmore students, Mr. Tecklin said, allowing them to review in detail policies affecting other national forests. They plan to organize a course on conservation biology and applied ecology to monitor forest management using current environmental research.

HEADLINE: Review/Opera;
2 Rarities From The Young Rossini

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
The Rossini bicentennial celebration this year is not likely to elicit as many performances of early Rossini as the Mozart bicentennial last year did of early Mozart. That is all to the good, for there is less to be learned from the contrast with later works than in Mozart's case: Rossini's early operas already contain most of the elements of the mature composer's work, albeit less fully developed.
Still, there are fresh and individual delights to be had in those youthful creations as well, and it is pleasant to encounter an occasional program like the Rossini double bill the John Brownlee Opera Theater is presenting at the Manhattan School of Music: "L'Occasione Fa il Ladro" ("Opportunity Makes the Thief") and "La Scala di Seta" ("The Silken Ladder"), two one-act comic operas from 1812. Not surprisingly, both plots involve amorous deceits and misadventures, and in each case the pairings shake out properly at the end. 
 Though the "Scala" overture is familiar, the lovely opera as a whole is seldom performed. (The Children's Free Opera of New York staged it in Brooklyn 12 years ago.) Deservedly, "L'Occasione" is an even rarer item; it was reported at the time of its premiere to have been written within 11 days, and alongside "La Scala," it sounds it.
Or at least it did in the second performance, on Friday evening. In widely disparate performances by separate casts, only "Scala" was done justice vocally.
Tamara Hardesty was a particular joy as Giulia, singing with a clear, agile soprano and spinning out the coloratura with ease. But the rest of the cast was reasonably strong as well. As Giulia's secret husband, Dorvil, Matthew Chellis, a tenor, negotiated high florid passages honorably despite constricted tone in his upper register. Keith Spencer made much of relatively unpromising material as the servant Germano. Steven Gaertner, as Giulia's suitor, Blansac, and Belinda Pigeon, as Giulia's cousin, Lucilla, had good moments.
"Occasione" was a sadder affair, salvaged only by fine work from Andrea Wilkomirski, a soprano, as Berenice. Mark Heimbigner sang Berenice's would-be fiance, Don Parmenione, with a presentable baritone, but tended, with flabby articulation, to disappear in patter and ensembles. Jorge Garza, as Berenice's actual fiance, Count Alberto, produced attractive sounds in his middle register but could muster only ineffectual stabs at the top notes.
In both works, but especially "Occasione," the singers seemed to have difficulty at times finding their way into Christopher Larkin's tempos. Erratic orchestral playing reinforced the gloom in "Occasione" but detracted little from "Scala."
Johnathon Pape's stage direction brought out a lot of silly hamminess from several of the men, but the physical production was admirable in its economy. Peter Eastman's set design used the same basic framework for both works. A running theme carried through the decor: an uplifted hand with an orb suspended above it that looked at first like a basketball, at times like the earth and finally like the sun, perhaps grandiosely symbolizing the Enlightenment.
The program will be presented once more, this afternoon with a somewhat different cast, at the Manhattan School, 122d Street and Broadway.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
In Florida, Testing Road to the Future

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
IT used to be that automotive technology had to do with . . . well, with cars. Ultimately, if you were a manufacturer, you went with Cadillac's electric starter. Or with Ford's inexpensive V8. Or with Plymouth's hydraulic brakes.
These days, though, the innards are pretty much alike. To be sure, some cars lack air bags and antilock brakes, but those things will come, dictated by the marketplace. And so, more and more, the technology has to do not with rods and levers and multiple-valve engines, but with the periphery. 
 There are things, for instance, like sound systems with compact-disk changers mounted in the trunk. There are push-button keychains to let you unlock the doors or open the trunk as you approach the car. There are dashboard video screens and radar add-ons that beep if you get too close to the car in front.
Things now work with infrared rays and sonic senders and microwaves, and none of them have a lot to do with the actual mechanical function of the car. But they are where we are -- and, face it, they are kind of neat.
The latest of these peripherals combines Oldsmobile's built-in video screen with a network of "smart" roads in Orlando, Fla., where a yearlong test of TravTek began last week.
The name, short for Travel Technology, designates a $12 million project that, at long last, could make reality of the future that was forecast at the 1939 World's Fair and that kept a lot of us reading Popular Science magazine through the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's.
The idea is a system to help drivers -- through various technologies including triangulation by satellite -- to find out where they are and where they would like to be. TravTek provides instant access to video map displays, gives you audio and visual driving directions, tells you about current traffic conditions, and can even make a reservation at a four-star restaurant. Well, maybe.
Partners in the experiment, among others, are the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Avis Rent a Car System, General Motors, Navigation Technologies Corporation, Etak Incorporated and Motorola. At the announcement in Orlando, Secretary of Transportation Andrew Card said the project was much needed and would explore technologies "to ease traffic congestion and improve travel conditions in many American cities."
The test will involve 100 '92 Olds Toronados whose computers receive information on traffic conditions from Orlando's traffic management center. The information, in turn, comes from highway video cameras, road sensors, emergency vehicles and construction reports. Each car's location is pinpointed by the satellite and through compasses and wheel sensors on a computerized dashboard map that operates with a database provided by the American Automobile Association.
While driving, the map and the audio information, tell you exactly where you are and where to turn. When the car is parked, the dashboard display offers information on hotels, restaurants, attractions and special events in the area.
By all accounts, it works wonderfully well, although the start of the project was less than auspicious. Robert Frosch, a General Motors vice president and one of the first drivers to try it out, got into his Toronado, started the engine, checked the information and put the Olds into gear.
He ran over an orange traffic cone and smashed it flat.
Meanwhile, the University of Michigan has put out a forecast for the automobile industry through the end of the century, and the study notes that electronic components, currently amounting to 10 percent of a car's value, will climb to nearly 20 percent of the total value in the next eight years.
The survey, based on responses from more than 200 engineers, scholars and consultants, also notes that Government regulations rather than fuel prices will force major changes in the design of automobiles. The price of gas, the study said, will increase modestly through the year 2005, rising to about $1.75 per gallon in 1990 dollars.
According to the study, regulations will mandate fuel economy increases from today's level of 27.5 miles per gallon to 30 m.p.g. for 1995, 33 for the year 2000, and 36 m.p.g. for 2005.
In order to meet those standards, the university report said, manufacturers will reduce the weight of vehicles through the use of more plastics, aluminum, magnesium and powdered metals.
Recycling will be a big issue in the future, according to David Cole, director of the school's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, and manufacturers eventually may be required to buy used cars back from their customers.
Not surprisingly, Cole also said that air bags will be standard for the driver and front-seat passenger on all cars produced in America by the end of the decade. But he added that air bags to protect rear occupants and to ward off side impacts will be widely available. And, he said, radar controlled brakes and alarms to prevent collisions are on their way.
Seems to me I read something about that. I think it was in Popular Science. Somewhere around 1948.

HEADLINE: Setting Priorities In Public Education

 BODY:
The article "Public Colleges Face Bitter Economic Lessons" (March 8) prompted me to write this letter.
As a person who grew up in a lower-middle-class household in New York City and is now a resident of Connecticut, I am concerned about the remarkable difference in priority placed on public educational institutions and access to higher education between these two jurisdictions. 
 While growing up in New York City, I attended Stuyvesant High School, a publicly funded school for gifted students. I received an excellent free education, one that can be surpassed by few, if any, private preparatory high schools in the country. New York City, despite its current fiscal problems, is currently putting the finishing touches on a new Stuyvesant High School in downtown Manhattan.
After graduating from high school, New York City residents had, and still have, the opportunity to attend many well-funded high-quality public institutions. Additionally, New York State residents can also be awarded a merit-based New York State Regents scholarship that can be used at any public or private institution of higher learning in their state.
Now that I am living in Connecticut, the most affluent state in the nation, the choices available to my children are not quite as varied. All across the state, programs for all, from elementary through high school, are being curtailed. Connecticut's institutions of higher learning are not adequately funded, even in times of economic prosperity.
Despite a tuition increase of 78 percent in the last four years, the University of Connecticut is not considered to be a first-tier institution, due primarily to a long-term lack of adequate funding. Connecticut does not have a "portable" public scholarship program to assist its students in attending in-state private or public institutions. Additionally, access is now being greatly restricted at all public institutions of higher learning because of recent drastic reductions in funding.
The dichotomy between the many options to students in New York City, with its associated low per-capita income and constant budget problems, and Connecticut, with its high per-capita income and sporadic budgetary problems, is clear.
It appears that the long-term position of the Connecticut legislature is that education to meet the needs of all is not to be provided. Rather, needs at the elementary through high school levels will continue to go unmet because of inadequate funding, while access to institutions of higher learning will be limited by ability to find space available at community colleges and state universities, and by ability to pay at private institutions.
Is this really how the most affluent state in the country wants the educational needs of its residents addressed?

HEADLINE: Growing Black Debate on Racism: When Is It Real, When an Excuse?

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
At church meetings, at social gatherings and in informal conversations across the country, more and more blacks, many for the first time, have become openly critical of apologists for certain members of their race.
They contend that the actions of national figures like Mike Tyson, Marion S. Barry Jr. and Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr. are disgraceful and cannot be excused and that, as role models, their behavior can bring shame to the race. 
 But there are those who still maintain that these individuals are victims of the white establishment and should be defended no matter what.
The emotionally charged debate has prompted blacks, from celebrities to day laborers, to re-examine what it means to be black in America today. Many say they are finding that the old unanimity no longer stands; the historic sense of a communal psychology is slowly dissipating.
"The question that would typify our dilemma is: What happened to the values, attitudes and exemplary personal examples by which we, as African-Americans, defined the civil rights movement and its offspring, the feminist movement?" said Arthur Ashe, the tennis star and author of "A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete" (Amistad-Warner, 1988).
"During the civil rights struggles," he continued, "we definitely laid claim to the high moral ground, and now, by condoning what some of our leaders do and not acting in a manner we would have been proud of in the 60's, we are being seen as no better than anybody else."
The internal conflict among blacks is no more evident than in blacks' responses to three highly publicized cases. In the Tyson rape trial, for example, some saw the conviction as just Yet there were those, including several leading black ministers, who said the odds were stacked against Mr. Tyson right from the start: the jury was predominantly white.
To many black Washingtonians, last year's conviction of Mayor Barry on charges of cocaine possession was a miscarriage of justice. The prosecutors acknowledged that the Barry case was the first time the Federal Government had used sexual enticement to lure a target into criminal behavior. But other blacks said Mr. Barry used charges of racism to defend his brazen personal behavior and political failures.
The recent removal of Dr. Jeffries as head of the black studies department at City College in New York is still another example of black ambivalence. Some blacks contend that racism was a motivating factor in the decision to oust him, but there are also those who say the professor was tempting fate with his incendiary remarks, including those directed at Jews and white historians.
 
Keeping in Mind a Racist Society
 "This is a racist society, and it will be for a long time to come," said Roger Wilkins, a former Assistant Attorney General who is a history professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "That people make racist attacks on certain black people does not absolve those who have been attacked of behaving decently and keeping their human commitments."
Most of the two dozen blacks interviewed say they do not want to give blacks an excuse to be lawless. Nevertheless, they may find themselves in the uncomfortable position of defending other blacks who have been accused of actions they may not condone because of a strong and persistent conviction that there is a double standard for blacks and whites, whether in judging political, criminal or personal behavior.
In an article, "The Rape of Mike Tyson," published in the March issue of Paper magazine, the film maker Spike Lee and the rap star Queen Latifah convey the angst some blacks feel. Both said that although Mr. Tyson's victim was black, one had only to weigh the verdict against those in other headline-grabbing rape cases involving white men to see that the scales of justice were out of balance.
"In the Kennedy case, it was his word against hers, and he was found not guilty," said Queen Latifah, referring to the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith. While Mr. Lee said he did not want to pass judgment on Mr. Tyson, he believed that the system was "trying to demoralize him" because "he was making too much money."
During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings last October, Judge Clarence Thomas was able to turn the tide of public support, especially among blacks, by calling the investigation into Prof. Anita F. Hill's accusation of sexual harassment "a high-tech lynching" of "an uppity black." Many blacks around the country immediately agreed, saying the hearings smacked of an orchestrated setup in which a black woman was being used to destroy a black man.
"Every black official ought to assume that someone is after them because of racism, so they ought to behave the way anyone would if someone was out to get them," said Mary Frances Berry, a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. "Racism is a fact of our lives. You can't be an African-American and not have to deal with racism."
 
The Silence Of Solidarity
 In recent weeks, prominent blacks, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Dr. Alvin Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist, have publicly chastised other members of their race for failing to live up to the moral standards of earlier generations of black Americans.
The issue was the focus of discussion on March 27 at a community forum on violence, morality and values at the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem.
James Goodwin, 20 years old, who abandoned his life as a leader of the Decepticons gang to become a director of the City Kids Foundation's repertory theater, told 150 people gathered in the church's auditorium: "Kids are making decisions for themselves, not for the black community or some black organization. Yeah, we all know racism exists, that it's still a white world. But we also have to take some of the responsibility and blame: kids not respecting each other or Mrs. Jones down the block. Kids killing each other. Racism should make us love one another, not disrespect or murder each other."
In the past such issues were seldom discussed outside private conversations among blacks and sympathetic whites, because blacks feared that any criticism of their community would be used by some whites against the entire race.
"It's almost as if the wish were: 'Gee, I wish I could talk to kids in high school about this, but I don't want whites to listen to it,' " said Andrew Hacker, a white professor of political science at Queens College who has written a new book, "Two Nations" (Scribner's), about race relations. "Blacks feel as if they have no privacy, that whites will quote them out of context or say, 'Hey, even blacks are admitting they're in a bad way.' "
Other blacks said they remained silent out of a sense of commitment to their race, of not wanting to air dirty linen in public, knowing that those who did speak out were often ostracized or "read out of the race."
"A lot of us are afraid that if we aren't intraculturally politically correct, we'll have people coming down on us, and so we just keep quiet," Mr. Ashe said. "Who needs it?"
 
Actions Speak Loudest of All
 Many middle-aged blacks, especially those who are parents, now wonder whether their silence may have been taken by some young blacks as tacit approval of their antisocial behavior, everything from criminal activity to a disregard for others' rights.
"Our young people consider little of what we say and most of what we do," said Robert Woodson, the president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a not-for-profit service group in Washington, who has written extensively on the need for moral consistency among blacks. "When we look at the examples they are following in their unlawfulness, we don't have to look at whites. Many of our black leaders are ignoring the dangers of the precedents they are setting."
During a speech to students at Thomas Jefferson High school in Brooklyn, where on Feb. 26 two black students were shot to death by another student, also black, Mr. Lee said: "We don't need the Ku Klux Klan anymore. We're killing ourselves, and it has to stop."
Mr. Jackson, another of the speakers at the high school, echoed the message, saying: "What difference does it make if it's a white police officer who shoots you down or a brother in a black coat because of some drug thing? You're dead."
Mr. Sharpton, who has been accused of defending questionable behavior by blacks after his involvement in the Tawana Brawley case, conceded that some of the current conduct was inexcusable. But he said he was still cautious about where to draw the line.
"I think that it is becoming difficult to walk the balance between racism and what is not," he said. "For the first time in the movement's recorded history, you have an element of professional apologists who have created a climate of totally excusing the racism. So when you want to discipline the negative elements in your community, you have to worry that you are not feeding into the hands of those who want you to discipline blacks as a way of relieving America and white society of its general racism."
While some blacks have criticized Mr. Sharpton for crying racism before the facts were in, he countered that he was one of the first to speak out about the stampede at City College last December. "I admonished the kids," he said, "by saying a trap may have been set, but just because it was set, you don't have to put your foot in it."
 
The Expansion Of Public Dialogue
 The emergence of an expanded public dialogue in newspaper editorials, rallies and other forums reflects an effort by blacks to focus the discussion from two perspectives: blacks cannot blame everything on racism, and whites cannot deny that race could be a factor.
"We don't want black men going around committing homicide and abusing our people," said Dr. Poussaint, the psychiatrist. "We know that's horrible and bad for blacks. At the same time, we feel, in the face of whites, that we have to put out to them that the institution of racism still exists and allows blacks to be treated differently and more harshly than whites."
Blacks worry that in crying racism too often, much like the boy who cried wolf, legitimate cases in which racism is a factor may be undermined. Even more disturbing, some say, is that age-old values like taking responsibility for one's actions, knowing right from wrong and loving one another, which were the cornerstone of the black creed in the era of racial segregation, seem to have been abandoned.
"Anyone who did not abide by the rules or brought shame to the community was labeled 'a disgrace to the race,' " said Henry Louis Gates Jr., the W. E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Humanities at Harvard. "Those who understood the importance of values and excelled were considered 'a credit to the race.' "
But today, with blacks more than ever separated from each other economically, socially and geographically, many of these messages are muted as young blacks mimic the narcissistic attitudes and values embraced by the Me Generation. Rather than turning the other cheek, many young people are more inclined to respond by striking back at anyone who offends them, much as the Homey the Clown character does on the popular television show "In Living Color": "Homey don't play that."
"I don't think a lot of young people today have that kind of historic sense of communal psychology," Dr. Poussaint said. "They're behaving more individualistically. On one level, they may be right. We shouldn't have to feel we are representing the whole race all the time. That is a burden, but that's the reality of racism."
Audrey Edwards, who with Dr. Craig Polite wrote "Children of the Dream: A Psychology of Black Success" (Doubleday, 1992), said: "As horrible as segregation was, the one thing it provided was a sense of community, a recognition that we are all in this together. Whatever intra-racial conflict we had, the black community understood we were in a depressed state. With integration, you have less of a sense of community, and it grows out of a sense that we are under a state of siege."

HEADLINE: What Japan Knew of Plan On Aid to Russia Is Debated

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Senior Administration officials vigorously asserted today, despite Tokyo's denials, that Japan had agreed with the size and timing of the $24 billion aid package for Russia announced by President Bush on Wednesday.
The officials said Japanese finance ministry officials attended a meeting last weekend in Paris where the Group of Seven industrial nations, according to the Americans, agreed to a vast package to help Russia. 
 "That the Japanese have been on the sidelines is absolutely untrue," a senior American official said. "They were aware of everything that's going on. They were aware of our action."
 
Move to Aid Yeltsin
 American officials also rebuffed the Japanese charge that the announcement had been premature, saying that all the Group of Seven nations knew the importance of unveiling a package that backed President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia before a parliament hostile to his economic changes convened next week.
"The Japanese Deputy Finance Minister was part of the discussions," another senior Administration official said in an interview. "They understand the stakes. They understand the importance of the aid."
Several Japanese officials said on Friday that there was no agreement on an overall aid package. "As far as our Government knows, there has been no agreement on this package," said a Japanese policy maker involved in aid to Russia. "These figures are extremely new to us. It was inappropriate to announce them."
The Japanese criticism has lent support to charges that the Bush Administration timed the announcements to gain advantage in the Presidential campaign.
The package that President Bush announced Wednesday includes $6 billion for a ruble stabilization fund, $2.5 billion in deferred debt payments and $4.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations. The plan also calls for $11 billion in direct aid from individual nations.
The American officials acknowledged that much of this $11 billion in bilateral assistance was announced months ago by individual Group of Seven nations.
 
A Consensus Among the Seven
 Senior Treasury Department officials said Congress would not have to authorize any of the $2 billion that Washington has committed toward this $11 billion, saying the whole $2 billion has already been authorized. The Administration called on Congress to approve a $12 billion contribution to the I.M.F. and to approve some humanitarian aid and export credits for next year.
"The essential point is there is a consensus among the Seven that the $11 billion is committed to and will be provided," said one senior American official. "Each of the countries has indicated what amounts they're prepared to do."
The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada.
Several American officials said it would be presumptuous for Washington to say how much other Group of Seven nations planned to commit. In interviews, officials from Canada, Britain, France and Japan said they had little idea how much their countries were supposed to have committed to the $11 billion in bilateral aid.
"It's all a bit mysterious," said a French official. "There are still discussions going on on the details."
A Canadian official said he thought the White House was including $1.5 billion his country announced in a multiyear aid package, most of which was in agricultual and export credits. But he said perhaps just the $700 million to be disbursed this year was included in the package.
 
Reassuring the Russians
 President Bush's announcement, like the one Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany made the same day, aimed to assure Russia that it would get the aid the I.M.F. said it needed this year.
These officials said the seven nations accepted the I.M.F. estimate that Russia would need $18 billion in aid to finance needed imports and another $6 billion for a ruble fund. Then the seven pieced together a plan that met this $24 billion need, they said.
In an interview today, a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said that the Group of Seven had discussed providing $12 billion to fill an expected gap in Russia's balance of payments this year. He added that the group talked of an additional $6 billion as a contingency if the $12 billion was not enough.
Japanese officials said one of their complaints was that announcing the aid package at this point would reduce the pressure on Russia to pursue a tough reform program because it would think it would receive the aid no matter what. But American and I.M.F. officials say some of the aid can be cut off if Moscow fails to adhere to its I.M.F. program.
"We certainly appreciate Mr. Bush's efforts in supporting democracy and the transition to a free-market economy in Russia," said a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official in an interview today. "But we certainly think it was premature to make an announcement before there was a plan."
American officials suggested that the Japanese Government was complaining partly to appease voters, since Tokyo has long tied large-scale aid to Russia to resolving a dispute over islands in the Kurile chain north of the Japanese archipelago. The chain was seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. One official said the Japanese Government also did not want to appear as if Washington had pushed it into aiding Moscow.
The Japanese criticism that the plan was announced prematurely appeared to fuel the charges that a disorganized Administration rushed to unveil the package before the front-runner in the campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, gave a major foreign policy speech on Wednesday.
Clinton campaign officials have asserted that the White House scheduled the announcement at the exact hour of Mr. Clinton's speech to pre-empt Mr. Clinton's criticisms and to divert attention from his speech. But Administration officials say it was a coincidence that the President's news conference was scheduled at the same time as Governor Clinton's speech.
Administration officials said the speech was timed principally to two events. Because the Group of Seven has decided to let the I.M.F. take the lead in organizing aid to Russia, Administration officials said the aid package was timed to follow the I.M.F.'s endorsement of Russia's economic reforms. On Tuesday, the I.M.F. announced its endorsement of Russia's painful reforms, which include removing price controls and plans to slash its budget deficit.
"The idea that the timing of the package was dictated by some more immediate events is not so," said one official. "It was recognized that the commitment on the package could not get out front of the perceived commitment that the Russians were prepared to make economic reforms."
The second event that President Bush's speech was tied to, Administration officials said, was next week's session of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies. Administration officials said that in recent weeks Mr. Yeltsin has pressed the Group of Seven to come forth with an aid package to bolster his position against the many parliamentarians who oppose rapid free-market reforms.
"The big interest all of us had was to do it in a fashion that would be timely for Yeltsin," one American official said.
American and other Group of Seven officials also said they wanted to unveil a package before the I.M.F.'s April 27 meeting in Washington, when Russia and several other republics are expected to become I.M.F. members.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Brown Opened Doors but Failed to Build Coalitions

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS with KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 4

 BODY:
Edmund G. Brown Jr. left an unmistakable imprint on California in his two terms as Governor, with a record of far-sighted achievement when he could realize his own vision, but grand failure in matters requiring him to cooperate with other branches of government.
There is broad consensus here, where the Brown legacy can still provoke emotional debate, that the Governor's greatest accomplishment was opening the doors of government to women and minorities and truly integrating the state's highest offices, boards, commissions and judiciary. Mr. Brown served from 1975 through 1982, and his appointees have put in motion pioneering air quality standards, energy conservation programs and consumer protections that became models for the rest of the nation. 
 On the other side of the ledger, Mr. Brown is widely criticized for not heading off a taxpayers' revolt that produced Proposition 13, the ballot measure that in 1978 slashed property taxes and sent the state's finances reeling. Had Governor Brown been more attentive to angry citizens whose property taxes were soaring at a time of huge government surplus, critics say, he might have crafted tax relief legislation that was less severe. The loss in revenue from Proposition 13 has been blamed for contributing to crumbling infrastructure, overcrowded schools and understaffed law enforcement and public health departments.
"He was bold and innovative in the areas where he could just do it," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "But he cannot construct a coalition. All he can say is, 'I'm right, follow me,' and that doesn't work in politics."
 
Appointments
Talent for Tapping Diverse Nominees
 Mr. Brown often said as Governor that the power to appoint was the most significant part of his job, and by all accounts he did it well and innovatively, with the dramatic exception of Rose Bird, an obscure lawyer with no judicial experience whom the Governor made Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court. After overturning every death sentence conviction that came before her, Ms. Bird was recalled in 1986, along with two other liberal judges appointed with her. This populist purge opened three seats on the court for the conservative appointees of Gov. George Deukmejian, Mr. Brown's Republican successor in the statehouse.
Overall, Mr. Brown's appointments created what was probably the most diverse administration anywhere in the nation. According to the California Almanac, 49 percent of Mr. Brown's 6,866 executive appointments and 40 percent of his 800 judicial nominations were women or minority members.
Diversity under Mr. Brown was not limited to lowly posts. Half of his Cabinet officers were women, as well as his press secretary, finance director and transportation chief. He appointed a Hispanic secretary of health and welfare and named the first two black state Supreme Court justices.
Besides integrating the government, Mr. Brown brought in fresh (some would say inexperienced) faces and new (some would say crazy) ideas.
In choosing judges, he bypassed the established law firms and instead reached into legal aid offices and public-interest firms. He made a former astronaut his science and technology adviser, an expert on compost toilets the state architect, a quadriplegic the chief of the Department of Rehabilitation and a beat poet the head of the Arts Commission.
Mr. Brown was in his element when such appointees gathered for all-night intellectual salons: government by dialectic, it was called then, with far more questions asked then answered. But the Governor's weakness as a manager and coalition builder became insidious at other times, particularly in budget- making season.
 
Budget and Taxes
Misread, Then Fed Taxpayers' Anger
 In 1978, as Mr. Brown ended his first term, the growing protest over taxes was exploding into a full-fledged taxpayer's revolt. The state budget surplus swelled to nearly $4 billion, fueled in part by the income tax indexing measures of Ronald Reagan's previous administration, which forced workers into ever-higher tax brackets even as their pay raises only kept up with inflation.
Homeowners saw their property tax bills growing up to 50 percent a year as California housing rapidly inflated in value. For many low-income and retired people the huge tax bills threatened their very ability to remain in their homes.
For all his vaunted powers as a prophet, Mr. Brown utterly failed to read the mood of the public accurately and work with the Legislature toward a solution.
As an organized effort grew to place a property tax-cutting measure, Proposition 13, on the June 1978 ballot, Mr. Brown remained convinced it would not pass and proposed more unusual solutions, like a 55 percent tax credit to homeowners who installed solar heating.
Belatedly, Mr. Brown joined in supporting an alternative to Proposition 13 that would have offered partial property tax rebates. The voters defeated it and passed Proposition 13 by 65 percent.
 
Spent Surplus on Schools
 With Proposition 13 a fait accompli, Mr. Brown directed $2.2 billion of the state surplus to the schools and $1.85 million to the counties and cities as emergency relief, actions which make it possible for him to accurately make the campaign claim today that taxes were cut and financing for schools increased in his administration.
But seeing that government's response to their demands for limits was resulting in a handout of the surplus, voters rose up again in 1979. They passed another ballot measure that placed a lid on government spending, tying it to inflation and forcing government to receive voter approval for increased taxes.
Because the state constitution grants the governor the power to veto appropriations, Mr. Brown was eventually able to slash $2 billion from various budgets. But overall, state spending increased by nearly 120 percent during the Brown years after Proposition 13, even as the measure pushed down the individual state taxpayer's burden from $158 per thousand of taxable income in 1978 to $108 per thousand when Mr. Brown left office in 1982.
By that time, Proposition 13 had cut average property tax rates to $1.13 per $100 of assessed valuation in 1982 from $11.24 per $100 in 1972, and forced $7 billion in spending cuts. The budget surplus had evaporated into a deficit of more than $1 billion and the state's general fund reserve had fallen from nearly $2 billion to zero. The unemployment rate, worsened by a national recession, had risen to a record high of 9.9 percent.
Today, over a decade after Mr. Brown left office, the state faces a budget deficit of more than $14 billion, county governments are on the verge of bankruptcy and homeowners face wildly disparate property tax levels, depending on whether they bought their homes before or after Proposition 13 was passed.
 
Policy
Much Innovation, But Some Setbacks
 On policy matters, Mr. Brown's record is quirky, reflective of a man with a pattern of becoming absorbed in one issue to the neglect of all others. He was strongest, experts agree, on environmental and energy matters, far ahead of other states and setting a model for regulation and legislation elsewhere.
During the Brown years, California tightened air quality standards, which cut pollution by 25 percent and forced Detroit automakers to design new exhaust systems for the nation's largest car market.
Also, through tax incentives and tough action by his apointees to the Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commisssion, Mr. Brown encouraged alternative, renewable energy sources, like generating electricity by burning industrial waste and woodchips and by using windmills, which now dot the California landscape. The Energy Commission he created also blocked construction of new nuclear power plants.
One of Mr. Brown's most widely respected monuments is the California Conservation Corps, which put men and women to work, New Deal-style, fighting fires and floods, restoring streambeds and the like.
But Mr. Brown had one notable collision with environmental groups, involving the notorious Mediterranean fruit fly, which infested farms and orchards in the state late in his second term. Pressed from both sides, by environmentalists who predicted disaster if there was aerial pesticide spraying, and by farmers who predicted economic doom, Mr. Brown dragged his feet and the pesky medfly wrecked havoc. Finally, he authorized the spraying, but by then had lost friends on both sides of the issue, and it weighed heavily in his 1982 race for a Senate seat, when Mr. Brown took a thumping at the hands of Pete Wilson.
 
Union for Farm Workers
 Mr. Brown's most heralded legislative success, early in his administration, gave farm workers organizing and bargaining rights for the first time in United States history. Prodded by his friend, Cesar Chavez, leader of the United Farmworkers Union, Mr. Brown ended a decade of boycotts and bloodshed in the lettuce and grape fields by pushing through a bill establishing the Agriculture Labor Relations Board, which supervised union elections.
Analysts suggest that Mr. Brown was weakest in the areas where his father had earlier made his mark as a two-term governor. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, an affable man who led the state from 1959 to 1967, is best known here as the master builder of California's highway, university and water systems. His son, by contrast, preached "small is beautiful" and is widely faulted for letting highways decay and cutting public education budgets early in his administration.
An examination of Mr. Brown's record involving highways and education indicates that he was more hostile in word than in deed, although hardly a champion of either roads or schools.
Consistent with his ideas about the environment and energy, the Governor sought to de-emphasize the automobile. Some new highways were built in Mr. Brown's tenure, apparently on the drawing board from the Reagan Administration, but older highways deteriorated. The Governor focused instead on modest mass transit projects, including a few commuter train lines, a trolley across the Mexican border and a fleet of experimental state cars that ran on methanol.
 
Ahead of His Time
 A major dispute of Mr. Brown's tenure involved a proposal to put car pool lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway, an experiment that was stalled by public protest. As with many ideas, including the proposed launching of a state telecommunications satellite, Mr. Brown was a few years ahead of his time. The so-called diamond lanes, then considered a heretical encroachment on motorists' rights, are now an accepted part of life here.
Public education fared poorly in the Brown years, even before the stringencies of Proposition 13 and a series of court rulings that altered education spending formulas. Mr. Brown threatened early to squeeze school budgets to inspire "reform." When asked what he had in mind, the Governor said, "I don't know yet" and never clarified the issue. California slipped from 18th to 31st nationally in per pupil school financing.
At the university level, Governor Brown froze faculty salaries, arguing that professors were compensated by their "psychic income."
The journalistic record of the Brown administration reveals little about the Governor's health policy, which was not a looming issue then as it is now. So, too, on crime the Brown years were relatively quiescent. The Governor signed several tough bills regarding mandatory prison terms for certain serious crimes. As a result, the number of felons sent to prison each year more than doubled in the Brown years.
 
Political Record
As Popularity Fell, G.O.P. Gained Entry

Some people say the singular contribution Mr. Brown made in state office was a political reorganization measure that was passed by voters here in the same year they elected him Governor. The Political Reform Act of 1974, while far from inclusive, fundamentally changed the nature of politics in the state capitol of Sacramento by limiting the influence of lobbyists.
Mr. Brown, then Secretary of State, was the act's principal author and touted it as the "two hamburgers and a Coke" measure. He rode to victory on a tide of post-Watergate disgust with politics as usual. Political observers here note, with a sense of deja vu, that the passage of the act depended on Mr. Brown's gift for galvanizing angry voters and showed him to be an effective agent for change, outside the confines of executive office.
Much of the criticism of Mr. Brown's tenure as Governor involves style more than substance, although it was style that many people say impeded his ability to govern. People who worked with him say he had a difficult personality.
The citizens of California also lost patience and changed from adoring to bemused to downright unhappy about their Governor. Fourteen months into his first term, according to The California Poll, Mr. Brown's job performance was rated as excellent or fair by 85 percent of those polled. When he left office in 1982, that approval rating had dropped to 58 percent.
Shortly thereafter, with Mr. Brown as the opponent, California voters elected Mr. Wilson to the United States Senate. The governor's chair was filled by Mr. Deukmejian. Mr. Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute said, "Jerry Brown was so disliked in his home state that he elected two Republicans on the same day and singlehandedly created a fashion for boring politicians."

HEADLINE: British Candidates Still Rely on the Hustings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 4

 BODY:
When Britons vote on Thursday in 651 Parliamentary districts, they will be casting ballots for candidates who, in theory, have won their confidence the old-fashioned way.
Barred from buying time on television, and limited by law to spending no more than the equivalent of about $15,000 apiece, anyone who wants a seat in the House of Commons has no alternative but to campaign vigorously at the grass roots, knocking on doors, shaking hands and handing out leaflets. 
 But while British election law scrupulously limits the amount individual candidates themselves may spend, there are virtually no restrictions on how money can be raised or spent at the national level by Britain's political parties. Indeed, British election law does not even require the parties to disclose the names of private donors, no matter how much money they give.
As a result, with Britain's national election less than a week off, the Conservatives, the Labor Party and the Liberal Democrats are busily spending millions of dollars out of their central office election coffers.
While the legal prohibition against paid television advertising eliminates the most costly -- and most powerful -- opportunity for marketing their message, the national parties are buying up billboard space and newspaper ads, running computer data banks and tracking polls, employing marketing consultants and organizing Presidential-style whistlestop tours by the party's national leaders, in the hopes some of their televised glamour will rub off on the Parliamentary candidates.
There are no hard figures on how much the British parties will spend by the time ballots are counted Thursday, although reports in British newspapers estimate that spending by the three major parties will range from $35 million to $50 million for the monthlong campaign.
Traditionally, the Conservatives have outspent Labor by a margin of two to one. In 1987, according to the official records, total central office expenditures on the election alone were about $26 million, with the Tories spending about $15.5 million; Labor, $7.2 million, and the old Alliance Party, the predecessor to the Liberal Democrats, $3.5 million. The 1987 total, in turn, was twice as much as was spent for the 1983 election.
Meanwhile, expenditures at the local level have grown only slightly, as spending limits have been adjusted for inflation. In 1987, candidates for the three parties spent about $12.9 million, in current dollars, compared with $9.5 million in 1983.
Despite the increases in central office spending over the decade, Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, a professor of political science, said the British political system has so far been spared the dizzying financial pressures that have caused American campaign spending to soar because of the ban on candidates' buying television time.
Instead, the Government allots each of the main parties five free political broadcasts in the month-long campaign, in which they may broadcast 5- or 10-minute programs they have produced themselves. The parties also receive free postage on some mailings.
Currently, about two-thirds of national campaign expenses go toward advertising, including newspaper advertisements and the political billboards that dominate the British landscape during campaign season.
As costs have been rising, British political parties have also had to work harder to find contributions, including telephone and direct mail solicitations. Both the Labor and the Conservative parties are running deficits.
Corporate donations, which provide the bulk of Conservative funds, are decreasing. And the Labor Party, which has relied on union contributions, has seen union membership shrink from 12 million to 8 million in the last decade.
But parties are reluctant to discuss the source private contributions, since there is no law requiring disclosure.
Some Conservatives joined Labor and the Liberal Democrats last year in proposing election law changes, including forced disclosure of the names of private donors, as well as public financing of campaign costs. But any election reform will now have to wait for the new Parliament.

HEADLINE: Bracing for Worst in West Coast Salmon Country

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHINOOK, Wash., April 2

 BODY:
Faced for the first time with a possible shutdown of all salmon fishing off the West Coast, the coastal communities dependent on the seasonal returns of the legendary fish are bracing for a season of despair.
Anticipating the worst, owners are boarding up their fresh fish markets instead of preparing to open. Big trolling boats that rolled through a half-century of hook-and-line chases are for sale, and others are being auctioned to pay off bank loans. 
 And charter operators, who usually are already filling in their calendars with bookings for the peak summer months, are telling callers they cannot make a commitment now.
"Who would ever have thought we would be looking at a season with zero salmon?" asked Bob Eaton, executive director of Salmon For All, which represents commercial net fishermen and processors here at the mouth of the Columbia River. "I mean, this is the Pacific Northwest. We are supposed to have these pristine rivers -- and look what's happened."
 
Formula for Disaster
 What has happened is a combination of human degradation of the streams in which salmon spawn -- from excessive logging to development -- and a series of dry years.
On April 10, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, appointed by the Federal Government to control the take of West Coast salmon, will meet in to decide if this year's season will be drastically curtailed or eliminated. The three options range from a massive reduction in the salmon harvest to a coast-wide ban on all salmon fishing by commercial, recreational and American Indian fishermen.
The tribes, which have their own fishing rights based on century-old treaties upheld by the Supreme Court, are likely to see the amount of fish they can take and the length of their season reduced by the Federal council.
 
Alaska Not Affected
 Though the council meets every year to set the limits on what has become an increasingly small catch, never before have such draconian measures been under serious consideration.
"Whether you are a charter boat operator, a restaurant owner or an ocean troller, this is going to hurt real bad," said Phil Anderson, chairman of the 13-member fishing council. "But the other side of this is, if we overfish this year, there may be nothing in coming years."
The economic cost of a coast-wide shutdown has been estimated be as high as $60 million. The market price of chinook, or king salmon, and coho, or silver salmon, is not expected to be affected because fishing in Alaska, which provides most of the nation's Pacific salmon, would continue without restrictions.
But the fleet of fishing boats from Santa Barbara, Calif., to the Canadian border at the Strait of Juan de Fuca are important to the regional economy, and to the cultural and recreational life of the West Coast. Some of the fishermen are making plans to go after cod and rockfish, but that involves changing over their boats for a different type of fishing that pays less because the price of these fish is usually half that of salmon.
It was 200 years ago this spring that Capt. Robert Gray became the first white man to see the Columbia River, the biggest salmon stream in the American West. Captain Gray traded nails for salmon with the Indians who lived here.
More than 50 salmon canneries used to dot the Columbia River. They are all gone. Nearly 16 million salmon used to return to this river, but perhaps only a million will come back this year. Salmon typically spend a year in fresh water, near the spawning grounds where they were born, before going out to sea, traveling vast distances in the ocean, and then returning to the stream of their birth to spawn and die.
 
Salmon Need Clean Water
 Biologists have said that what the fish population needs more than anything to remain stable is free-flowing, clean water.
"If you got salmon coming up your stream, you have clean water. It's that simple," said John Baker, who has been a commercial fisherman for the last 25 years.
The main causes for the decline of the salmon runs can be seen from the bow of Mr. Baker's 38-foot ocean troller, the "Murzy," which is anchored at this small port at the mouth of the Columbia. On both sides of the river, rising to the skyline, the hillsides show the scars from decades of clear-cut logging in which all all the trees are taken. With no trees to hold the soil in place, the sediment clogs and suffocates the salmon spawning streams.
Another problem, salmon-eating sea lions, are within barking distance of his boat. The sea lions are protected by Federal law, but as their numbers have grown, they have become a target of fishermen. "If we had plenty of fish we wouldn't worry about sea lions," Mr. Baker said. "But when you have so few salmon, what the sea lions take makes a big difference."
A third problem, cited by Federal officials as the main killer of salmon, are the dozens of dams that block the downriver passage of young fish. By some estimates, more than 95 percent of all young salmon are killed in the dams' turbines, or in the sluggish water created by the dams, as the fish attempt to move out to sea.
This month, dam operators have been experimenting with a "drawdown," whereby much of the water backed up behind Columbia River dams is released to create a better current for the young fish. The measure is a reponse to a listing of Idaho sockeye salmon under the Endangered Species Act. Two other Columbia River salmon species are expected to be listed under the act this spring.
 
Effort to Save Jobs
 Unlike the fight over the northern spotted owl, which has tied up logging on Federal land in the Northwest, the Federal effort to restore the salmon would, in the long run, save thousands of jobs. The owl is costing logging jobs because its nests mean that forests cannot be cut. In meetings this week in town halls along the coast, fishermen have blamed loggers for many of their problems.
The effort to restore fish runs on the Columbia is expected to cost more than $1 billion. But it will not bring back the fish in Northern California, where the Klamath River coho are at all-time low, or in Hood Canal, a natural arm of Puget Sound, where another coho run is nearing extinction. In the Puget Sound area, experts cite explosive population growth, and the paving of wetlands and the loss of clean water that comes with unrestricted development, for the decline of the fish.
"It's going to take a concerted effort to manage the land and water as well as the fish," said Larry Six, the executive director of the Federal fishery council.
The council, which will make its decision on West Coast restrictions at the end of a three-day meeting, regulates fishing in United States waters from 3 miles to 200 miles offshore. The states control the rivers and the ocean waters closer to the coasts, but usually follow the lead set by the Federal fishery council.
Mr. Six said he hoped the council would find a way to allow for a short fishing season to help those fishermen who are close to bankruptcy. But it may already be too late.
In the harbor at Astoria, on the Oregon side of the mouth of the Columbia, Chuck Thompson prepared a 48-foot troller, "The King," for auction. Mr. Thompson, a former fisherman who was hired to inspect the boat, said the vessel would have been worth $100,000 a year ago. But now, with prospects for the future fishing bleak, the boat's owner will be lucky to get $40,000 at an auction, he said.
"We've had freaks of nature in the past, and bad years that came with it, but what's going on now is no freak of nature -- it's a tragedy," Mr. Thompson said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN WATCH;
Gotti and Good Humor Hone Campaign Focus

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
The Democratic Presidential candidates have seemed a little more likable on television the past few days, and it's possible that most of the credit belongs to John Gotti. His conviction not only distracted the press corps from exploring the candidates' flaws, it also provided perspective: While the background pieces on the candidates' records may not be flattering, at least there's no footage of bullet-riddled bodies.
But the candidates deserve credit, too. They have occasionally lapsed from their programmed promises and invective into moments of spontaneous charm. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas did his Elvis imitation and called himself a control freak. Edmund G. Brown Jr. said he was studying Mr. Clinton's smile in an effort to improve his own, and the former California Governor stopped assailing the corrupt elite long enough to talk about a sense of humor. 
 "If you can't laugh at yourself, if you don't have a good belly laugh, forget it," he said on WNYW's "Good Day New York" on Friday when asked about his attitude toward campaiging. "It's a real test of -- I don't know if it's a test of character, it's a test of psychological balance in the face of the continuing harassment."
The much-harassed Mr. Clinton seemed to start enjoying himself more at week's end. During his Elvis imitation -- a clip from "The Charlie Rose Show" on WNET that made most newscasts -- he collapsed in laughter after losing his voice on the line that he dedicated with open arms to the New York press: "Don't be cruel."
 
Pleased With Each Other
 Yesterday, he and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo both managed to look relatively pleased with each other at an Albany press conference. Mr. Cuomo interceded at one awkward point -- when Mr. Clinton was asked if he would support Mr. Cuomo, should the New York Governor somehow be the nominee -- to explain to Mr. Clinton: "That was a typical New York question. That's our view of graciousness."
The local style of graciousness has engendered sympathy for Mr. Clinton even from his constant tormentor, Johnny Carson. On Friday night, after yet another joke about Mr. Clinton's now-immortal "I didn't inhale" line, Mr. Carson paused to discuss Phil Donahue's interview of Mr. Clinton last week.
"He relentlessly questioned Clinton about his character and his morals," Mr. Carson said. "This questioning from a man who did an entire show wearing a dress."
Mr. Clinton found himself on the defensive again yesterday, apologizing for remarks that his wife, Hillary, made in a Vanity Fair article. Mrs. Clinton complained that the press was unfairly investigating her husband's past while ignoring rumors that President Bush had had a mistress. "Hillary Goes Tabloid," read The New York Post's headline.
 
Rumors Were Discounted
 The rumors about Mr. Bush had been briefly mentioned on television earlier this year in several discussions by Washington insiders. During one discussion, the columnist Jack Germond took pains to point out that the rumors had long ago been investigated and found baseless, but further analysis now seems inevitable. If nothing else, political analysts must ponder whether Mrs. Clinton's remark constitutes a campaign blunder or a brilliant tactic to smear the President by getting analysts like themselves to keep publicizing the rumor.
Mr. Brown had to deal with a CNN report that an operator at his toll-free telephone had given instructions on how a donor could evade Mr. Brown's famous $100 limit on individual campaign contributions. "I will stake my life on it that that didn't happen," Mr. Brown said, and then seemed to put his life in jeopardy by continuing, "And if it did, it was someone who was completely unauthorized."
The CNN recording of the phone call appeared to back up Mr. Brown, since the operator said that she was not supposed to be giving the instructions, but Mr. Brown was not content to let matters rest there. At a press conference, he suggested that the operator might be "some kind of Clinton plant." The theory seemed a particularly hard sell on the evening news, because viewers could also hear the CNN recording of a young woman's voice discussing the $100 limit:
"There's, like, ways around it. I mean, like, if you have, like, family members -- I'm not supposed to tell you that -- but, you know, and each of them gives or something, but, like, $100 per person." At the risk of being unfair to Valley Girls, this did not sound like the voice of a carefully trained double agent.
 
Invitation to Revolution?
 But such inconsistencies often seem unimportant when watching Mr. Brown on television, because he has a quirky sincerity that transcends whatever details the reporters are pestering him about. After he offered his theory about the Clinton plant, the cameras caught him walking out of the press conference and saying to a reporter: "Don't be part of the whole corrupt media game! Be part of the insurgency!"
It was hard not to admire a man who could make such a startlingly quixotic suggestion to a member of the New York press corps -- and make it with such hope and conviction in his eyes. Such moments help explain how Mr. Brown has appealed to such disparate groups as blue-collar workers, intellectuals, unemployed inner-city residents and even, it seemed, the family of John Gotti.
Although the Gotti family has not formally endorsed either candidate, Mr. Gotti's daughter Victoria did go before the cameras with a message that was familier to anyone who has watched Mr. Brown's "Take Back America" campaign commercials. As she complained about her father's conviction, she also issued an appeal to the press corps' higher instincts: "This is your government, all you people. It's about time that you stood up and took it back. Don't you see what's happening? Take it back."

HEADLINE: Paper Says Fitzwater Threatened To Quit Over 'Gridlock' at the Top

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Bush Administration sought today to play down a report that Marlin Fitzwater, dismayed by "gridlock" at top levels of the White House and Mr. Bush's campaign, had threatened to resign as the President's press secretary.
The report, in The Washington Post today, said Mr. Fitzwater had left abruptly for Bermuda last week after complaining at a meeting that he had "just about had enough" of top officials' inability to execute the President's political agenda. 
 The Post reported that Mr. Fitzwater had told associates that he was frustrated and considering quitting his job, but that he took a vacation instead after friends talked him out of it.
 
'Shakedown Problems'
 In a statement issued today from Bermuda, Mr. Fitzwater said his vacation was unrelated to the events described in the article, and he praised the "strong management team" assembled since Mr. Bush's new chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, took over in December. The statement, read by White House aides, did not say whether Mr. Fitzwater had considered resigning.
Other senior Administration officials and political advisers to Mr. Bush described Mr. Fitzwater in interviews today as upset and frustrated by what they called "shakedown problems" in Mr. Skinner's staff. But they said they had not heard him threaten to quit.
One of those officials said Mr. Fitzwater was "pretty vocal in his disappointment" at a recent meeting of about 20 White House aides, convened to discuss the President's long-range political and governmental agenda.
"He said that they have endless meetings, endless planning, replanning and revisiting and that nothing ever gets done, and there's some merit to that," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Others are very frustrated as well."
Besides serving as Mr. Bush's spokesman, Mr. Fitzwater oversees the White House public-relations operations and its communications strategy. He works daily to plan those operations both with Mr. Skinner and with the President's campaign manager, Robert M. Teeter.
 
No Reliable Strategy
 Mr. Fitzwater's frustrations were said to stem from the fact that he has no reliable strategy to work from, because White House and campaign officials have proven unable to agree on an agenda for the President to follow for any length of time. To the contrary, they say, Mr. Bush appears to switch messages and even policies frequently, and Mr. Fitzwater is left with the task of explaining those changes to a skeptical press corps.
Mr. Skinner, who effectively runs the White House staff for Mr. Bush, has endured some obvious and much-discussed problems in melding his four-month-old staff with Mr. Teeter's campaign, in a private building near the White House. Both operations are but four months old and were assembled amid an unexpectedly fierce primary election challenge from the conservative commentator, Patrick J. Buchanan.
Critics have frequently accused Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter of failing to devise a consistent, appealing message for Mr. Bush to deliver on the stump. They also complain that the two men have reacted too slowly to Mr. Buchanan's attacks and to the day-to-day course of national and world events.
Until recent weeks, Mr. Bush's campaign rhetoric and the themes of his appeals to voters seemed to change almost daily, leaving the impression that he held few principles. Within the White House, Mr. Skinner's staff has been accused of failing to set clear policies and to devise events -- political theater -- to back up the President's words.
One frequently cited example is Mr. Bush's warnings to members of Congress, made repeatedly since January, that he would wage political war against them if they did not pass his economic package by March 20. Since that deadline passed, Mr. Bush has proposed a relatively minor series of cuts in the Federal budget and has criticized Congress as inefficient and imperial, but has made no consistent attempt to dramatize his threat.
Criticism of both Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter has faded since Mr. Bush won a string of primaries in convincing fashion last month and Democrats began to stumble under the weight of Congressional scandals and a bloody primary battle. But some Administration officials and political advisers have seen scant improvement in the White House's own bumpy operations.

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Protests Cast a Cloud on Democracy in Venezuela

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 3

 BODY:
Two months after a failed military coup here left dozens dead, rising protests by a middle class galvanized by the military action have cast dark shadows over this country's three-decade-old democratic system, Venezuelan experts and foreign diplomats say.
This city has long been accustomed to confrontational student protests and labor strikes. But these experts and diplomats say raw new displays of anger by the middle class over a patronage-riddled political system and falling living standards threaten the survival of the elected Government of President Carlos Andres Perez as much as continued rumblings in the army. 
 Since March 10, when hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans began banging pots and pans from their windows and balconies and shooting off firearms into the night sky, each week has seen new, widespread expressions of discontent.
On top of angry demands that Mr. Perez step down, two years before the end of his term, have come calls for the prosecution of members of a political class that is almost universally perceived as deeply corrupt. Some protesters have also called for the liberation of the officers arrested in connection with the failed coup.
 
Complaints of Corruption
 With over $117 billion in oil exports during the last 10 years alone, Venezuelans have begun to bitterly insist that hardship is growing among salaried workers who can no longer afford to buy cars, own homes or send their children to good schools primarily because elected leaders have busied themselves robbing state coffers instead of working for the welfare of the country's 20 million citizens.
"None of the politicians are any good," Jose Herrera, a 36-year-old factory worker said during an anti-Government demonstration in downtown Caracas Thursday in which scores of policemen in riot gear fired tear-gas volleys and chased onlookers, striking some with blunt-edged sabers. "They all make us sick. What we need to do is get rid of them and find a whole new generation."
Venezuelan political leaders and ordinary citizens, as well as foreign diplomats, say they fear that if the protests continue to build, the army, riddled with many of the same resentments over perceived corruption among politicians and senior officers, may again be tempted to mount a takeover.
In an attempt to discourage coup plotters, the United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States, Luigi Einaudi, warned army officers in a speech at the War College here last month that a military takeover would plunge Venezuela, South America's oldest democracy, into international isolation.
"There is still a ferment and uncertainty here that is very clear," a Western diplomat said. "We sit around everyday and say, are we up or down."
 
Perez Promises Reforms
 Mr. Perez, who was elected for the second time as President in 1989 after a first five-year term during the economic boom years of the 1970's, has sought to calm civilian cries for his departure by promising an array of reforms that run from creating a more politically independent judiciary to reimposing price controls on some commodities.
Already, in the two months since the coup attempt, the President has twice reshuffled his Cabinet in search of a combination that can help restore credibility to his Government, but the clamor for his resignation has only grown.
As the atmosphere of crisis has mounted, Mr. Perez has faced increasingly insistent calls from newspaper editorialists and members of Parliament, including a minority in his own political party, Accion Democratica, to amend the Constitution or accede to a referendum to curtail his term.
In recent interviews, he has defiantly vowed that he will serve out his mandate and "not one day more or less."
"The dilemma here is as follows: if we blow up the CAP Administration, anarchy will follow," said Eugenio Soler, an adviser to Mr. Perez, calling the President by his initials as is common here. "People who are calling for a change of government want an improvement of the situation in 24 hours, but things cannot be settled in two weeks or two months."
 
Action on 'Thieves' Demanded
 Ordinary Venezuelans who wish to see Mr. Perez serve out his term say he must quickly crack down on high-level corruption to regain their confidence. "If he is going to stay on, he will have to take a hard line against the thieves," said Juan Gustavo Lopez, a 30-year-old auto garage employee, echoing a widespread view.
Seeking to quiet these concerns, Mr. Prez recently named as Interior Minister a former political rival, Luis Pinerua, a stern law-and-order advocate who has long urged a crackdown on official corruption.
Blunting the possible benefits of this move, in the eyes of many, however, have been recent statements by the President that have described large-scale, high-level corruption as mostly a phenomenon of the past.
His views on more recent corruption have provoked widespread repudiation, including one from the politically independent Attorney General, Ramon Escovar Salom, who said in a recent interview: "I have seen no progress in this area. I see no political will power in the fight against corruption, and I must say this with great frustration."
Many Venezuelans and foreign diplomats say the country's political system, dominated by two highly centralized parties, has long tolerated, even encouraged official corruption. The governing party appoints judges who often do its bidding, doles out jobs and lucrative favors, and has traditionally received kickbacks and other emoluments from official business, these analysts say.
"Perez is not to blame so much as the structure of the parties," a presidential adviser said. "The parties see the Government as their thing, a way to make money."
If many Venezuelans complain about corruption, for the agitated middle class the foremost concern remains living standards, which have plummeted in the face of economic liberalization that has won Mr. Perez widespread support abroad.
 
Subsidies Curtailed
 In a surprise for most Venezuelans that inspired heavy rioting shortly after his inauguration in 1989, Mr. Perez, who campaigned with a traditional populist message immediately, initiated a series of free-markets policies aimed at curtailing extensive Government subsidies and price controls.
The changes, which have attracted new foreign investment and reduced fiscal deficits, also quickly brought devaluations and high inflation rates that Venezuelans, unlike many of their neighbors, were unaccustomed to.
For many middle-class Venezuelans, the sudden hardships after years of rising expectations fueled by an oil boom were unpardonable.
"Carlos Andres Perez promised a return to the good old days and the abundance of the past; instead we got 80 percent inflation," said Eduardo Fernandez, the leader of the main opposition party, Copei, which has supported the Government in the current crisis. "We are a modern country, and must find a way to convince the people that we can no longer afford to live by the practices of the past."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues;
Responses of Rivals Cover Up Similarity

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
On a television show in New York last weekend, Gov. Bill Clinton and Edmund G. Brown Jr. were asked where they stood on laws that set aside a specific proportion of Government contracts for blacks.
Mr. Clinton answered at length. Such laws are "on balance" worthwhile, he said, because "in order to change the nature of poverty and the nature of our cities, we have to have an empowerment agenda." 
 Mr. Brown answered the question with one quick sentence: "Sure, I support that."
The exchange typifies how the Democratic Presidential candidates treat the issues of the campaign. Mr. Clinton often talks in think-tank jargon and has mastered nuance like a law student prepared for the bar exam. Mr. Brown talks in sweeping generalities about a corrupt political system and seems impatient with facts and figures.
 
Plans for All Issues
 Before the campaign began last year, the Arkansas Governor published a booklet that set forth his views on everything from the economy to the cold war, from race relations to the environment. In anticipation of the New York primary, he released a 10-page paper on urban policy.
He has a five-point plan for ending the recession and another five-point plan for long-term economic growth. He has three "principles" for invigorating cities, nine ways of "empowering inner-city youth," a four-part "crime strategy" and a four-point health care plan.
Mr. Brown, on the other hand, has little use for detail. He often offers proposals that contradict one another and numbers that do not add, and when this is pointed out to him, he shrugs it off as immaterial. Questioned this week about his urban policy, Mr. Brown referred to a $30 billion wish list he had recently seen that was prepared by the United States Conference of Mayors and said those proposals for grants to the cities were fine with him. He offered no indication he had studied the proposals and no clue how he would pay for them.
Asked in a debate the other day how he would govern the country if he became President, the former California Governor replied: "You can't govern. It's not governable now."
 
Bush on Different Road
 Their opposite styles mask the fact that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown agree on fundamental precepts much more than they disagree, and the views they hold in common are very different from President Bush's. If either Mr. Clinton or Mr. Brown is elected President and fulfills his campaign promises, the country will be run on principles quite unlike those of the last 12 years.
The Democrats believe that the Government should have an active strategy for directing the economy. Mr. Bush takes a basically hands-off position that relies on the markets for economic direction.
The Democrats, unlike the President, support new Federal spending on schools, housing, jobs and a variety of other programs that the Republicans have cut back in the last decade. And while the Democratic candidates do not specifically advocate higher taxes, they do not rule them out.
Both Democrats place greater emphasis on the environment than on development, which Republicans tend to favor. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown have different approaches toward medical care, but both support radical new national health insurance systems. Mr. Bush would only tinker with the current system.
The Democratic candidates favor deeper cuts in military spending than does the President and oppose his position of withholding immigration assistance to Israel until the Israelis stop building settlements on the West Bank. In contrast with many Democratic candidates in past primary campaigns in New York, neither candidate this year is arguing that the American Embassy in Israel should be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
On social issues, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown, in contrast with the President, strongly favor unrestricted abortions, gun control and affirmative action for members of minorities. And while Mr. Bush talks about tightening welfare rules, the Democrats want to increase subsidies to the poor.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown even duck the same basic question: Neither says how he would reduce the budget deficit. And when pressed on the point, they say merely that they would rely on the peace dividend.
Few economists believe the deficit can be reduced to a manageable level just by cutting the military budget, even if no big new spending programs are introduced. And the Democrats are indeed advocating expensive new measures like Mr. Brown's grants to the cities and Mr. Clinton's plans for national service by young people.
To accomplish such goals, the next President would almost certainly have to raise taxes or make significant cuts in what the Government spends on the elderly through Social Security and Medicare. Neither Democratic candidate sees mileage now in endorsing such potentially unpopular steps.
In some cases, the two Democrats agree more or less on policy but stress different aspects. For example, Mr. Brown emphasizes the Government's obligation to care for the poor, while Mr. Clinton stresses the obligation of welfare recipients to behave responsibly.
In his stump speeches, Mr. Brown places greater emphasis on environmental protection than does Mr. Clinton and promotes an ambitious but rather vague plan to cut energy use in half. Mr. Clinton puts his biggest stress on the help he would give the middle class
One specific area where Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton have a basic disagreement is tax policy. Mr. Clinton would retain the existing tax system but modify the rates, deductions and credits so that taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year would pay more and everyone else would owe less.
Mr. Brown would scrap the Federal taxes on income, Social Security, Medicare and gasoline and replace them with a 13 percent flat tax on income and a 13 percent value-added tax, similar to a national sales tax.
His critics maintain that this would be a boon to the rich and would cost the treasury hundreds of billions of dollars. In response, Mr. Brown says that he does not believe the critics are right but that if they turn out to be, he will just modify his plan to make it fairer and raise more revenue.
They also disagree on trade policy. Mr. Clinton generally argues against trade restrictions, taking the view of most economists that the overall economy benefits from free trade among nations.
Mr. Brown says free-trade policies have put American workers at a serious disadvantage. So he opposes a trade agreement with Mexico and supports various protectionist measures.
Mr. Clinton also advocates foreign aid, saying that America must remain a world leader. Mr. Brown maintains that the United States must take care of the immediate needs of its own people before it assists others.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Democrats on the Issues"
 
TAXES
 Brown: Replace the Federal income, Social Security, Medicare and gasoline taxes with a flat, 13 percent tax on income, allowing deductions only for mortgage interest, rent and charitable contributions. Impose a 13 percent value added tax, similar to a national sales tax. Give businesses tax breaks for hiring workers from poor neighborhoods and for investing in equipment and research.
 Clinton: Cut income taxes of most Americans by 10 percent and offset the cost with higher taxes on those with incomes above $200,000. Replace the current $2,100 dependent exemption with a tax credit of $800 per child. Cut capital gains tax for investments held at least five years in new businesses. Give investment tax credits to small and medium sized businesses. Prohibit businesses from writing off the cost of excessive salaries and bonuses for executives.
 
HEALTH
 Brown: Install a national health insurance system, similar to the one in Canada, operating on a fixed national budget, in which patients choose their doctors, fees are set by the states and private insurance companies are bypassed. Vague about how the new system would be financed. Would support more AIDS research.
 Clinton: Require employers to provide private insurance coverage for workers or pay an additional tax into a public fund to cover the uninsured. Establish a Government board to regulate medical-care prices. Vague about how the system would be financed. Would support more AIDS research.
 
TRADE
 Brown: Opposes giving the President authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Supports a variety of measures designed to limit imports into the United States.
 Clinton: Favors the Mexican free-trade agreement but would require stricter environmental and labor standards in Mexico. Says he is basically a free-trader but supports retaliation if Japan keeps out American products.
 
MILITARY SPENDING
 Brown: Cut the military budget in half over the next five years. Remove all troops from Europe. Otherwise not specific about how this deep reduction would be achieved.
 Clinton: Cut the military budget by one-third over the next five years. Stop production of the B-2 bomber and the Star Wars missile defense system but continue production, at least for the time being, of the Sea Wolf nuclear submarine.
 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 Brown: Mostly avoids foreign policy matters, which he says draw attention away from critical problems at home. At times voices support for aid to Israel and Russia but at other time says the country cannot afford foreign assistance while Americans have needs. Says he would have waited longer before taking offensive action against Iraq.
 Clinton: Argues that the United States must be engaged in foreign affairs to remain a world leader. Says he supported President Bush's intervention in Iraq but criticizes the President for failing to get a handle on relations with Japan, for being slow to respond to events in Russia and for not imposing trade sanctions on China. Opposes Israeli settlements in the West Bank but says that should not stop immigration aid to Israel.
 
CITIES
 Brown: Give cities roughly $30 billion in new annual grants and loans for public works, transportation projects, public safety, job training and other programs. Establish urban enterprise zones in poor neighborhoods where businesses could get tax breaks.
 Clinton: Give Federally owned housing and housing on closed military bases to community groups to house the homeless. Encourage resident ownership of low-income housing. Give cities matching grants for crime-control projects.
 
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
 Brown: Cut energy consumption in half over the next 10 years. Phase out all nuclear power plants and emphasize energy sources like solar and wind power. Stop new offshore oil drilling. Increase protection of wetlands. Require public utilities to spend more than $600 billion over the next 15 years for conservation. Otherwise vague about achieving conservation and financing alternative energy.
 Clinton: Reduce energy consumption by at least one-quarter. Through new regulations, encourage utilities to invest in conservation. Stop building new nuclear power plants unless a safe way can be found to dispose of the waste. Emphasize natural gas over oil and promote solar and wind power. Opposes oil drilling in the Arctic refuge. Might support a small increase in Federal gasoline tax.
 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
 Brown: Increase Federal education spending. Replace tuition loans with scholarships and work-study grants. Establish a civilian conservation corps where young people can develop skills.
 Clinton: Double Federal spending on education, aiming the extra money mostly at poor inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas. Give states and communities more direction in education policy. Let college students pay off tuition loans by performing national service. Create apprenticeship program to train high-school students not bound for college and adult-education programs for those without high school diplomas.
 
WELFARE
 Brown: Encourage businesses to hire poor people and supplement their salaries with a welfare check, Medicaid and food stamps. Withdraw those benefits at a rate of 20 percent a year for five years. Vague about what he would provide poor people without jobs.
 Clinton: Provide training and child-care but in most instances require an adult, after two years on welfare, to take a private or public service job or lose benefits. In some cases, allow people to stay on welfare more than two years if they were making progress in education programs. Vague about what he would provide for children if their parents refused to work.
 
ABORTION
 Brown: Supports freedom of choice for women and Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women and opposes laws requiring parents to be notified before their daughters can have abortions.
 Clinton: Supports freedom of choice for women. Would not press for law allowing Medicaid funding of abortions but would sign such a law if Congress passed it. Signed a law in Arkansas requiring a girl under 18 to notify her parents or a judge before she could have an abortion.
 
GUN CONTROL
 Brown: Favors registration of all guns and a ban on assault-type weapons. As Governor, supported and signed a California law requiring a 15-day waiting period before a firearm could be purchased.
 Clinton: Favors legislation now before Congress for a five- or seven-day waiting period before a firearm could be purchased. As Governor, signed a bill supported by the National Rifle Association making harassment of hunters a criminal offense, but vetoed a measure backed by the N.R.A. that would have prevented local governments from regulating guns.
 
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
 Brown: Opposes in all cases.
 Clinton: Favors the death penalty.

HEADLINE: The Candidates, on April 7;
For George Bush and Bill Clinton

 BODY:
The New York Presidential primary election has rarely meant much. Often, all the suspense has been squeezed out by the momentum of prior results. This year, New York counts.
If Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas runs strongly, he will virtually lock up the Democratic nomination. If former Gov. Jerry Brown of California does well, he will strengthen his politics of anti-politics. An ambiguous outcome could encourage dissatisfied voters to keep shopping. 
 The choice Tuesday is thus unusually consequential and unusually complex. That is why The New York Times, which customarily reserves candidate recommendations until the fall, now offers its views of the race so far.
 
THE REPUBLICANS
 Lamentably, there will be no Republican ballot Tuesday. President Bush, prudent player on the stage of a new world order, warrants his party's renomination, and he surely would have won it in New York, as he has elsewhere. But party officials seized on the state's notorious petition rules to keep Patrick Buchanan off the ballot.
We disagree heart and soul with Mr. Buchanan's fearful isolationism and protectionism. He manifests a nativism so harsh it also sounds like anti-Semitism and racism. Even so, the absence of a contest diminishes democracy -- if only because it denies New York Republicans their chance to roundly reject the Buchanan message.
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 Though there are seven names on Tuesday's Democratic ballot, they present only three choices: Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton or Neither. Two names are wishful. The ambitions of former Senator Eugene McCarthy and Larry Agran, former Mayor of Irvine, Calif., still flicker. Two names are vestigial. Senators Tom Harkin and Bob Kerrey, 1992 ambitions dimmed, have withdrawn.
And at the moment, it is hard to tell into which category Paul Tsongas belongs -- wishful, vestigial or both. If he were to re-enter the campaign, a clear choice would become much harder.
Jerry Brown When people describe the former California Governor, adjectives spill out, not many of them friendly: audacious, mercurial, visionary, expedient, self-absorbed, restless -- and reckless, even to the point of being mean.
Critics do not do justice to his 1975-83 record. California introduced auto emission standards, a Conservation Corps, a pioneering right-to-die law. But supporters do not do justice to his record, either. It also includes reduced spending on education, disastrous dithering about a fruit fly epidemic and fiscal management that so infuriated voters they imposed the choke hold of Proposition 13.
Since then, Mr. Brown has changed directions as often as he changes costume -- from Zen reflection to high-roller insider's politics to his present persona as Mr. Outside. He still spins brilliantly, but his visionary optimism seems to have soured. He fluently denounces those he is against. He does less well expressing what he is for.
His program as a whole is sketchy and even its centerpiece, his 13 percent flat tax, turns out to be a careless caricature of the original idea. The hasty Brown version would burden the poor and swell the deficit. Jerry Brown gives voice to the widespread frustration with politics. He gives no evidence of knowing how to relieve it.
 
Bill Clinton

People acquainted with the Governor of Arkansas before this campaign and people who have met him since sometimes make the same observation -- that the Bill Clinton they know is an intelligent, experienced, gregarious politician with powerful ideas for the country. Why does he so often come across as an evasive, philandering ol' Southern pol insensitive to ethical conflicts?
One answer is that he is new to the national stage; many voters got their first impression of him from a string of embarrassing episodes. First came Gennifer Flowers, claiming a long relationship with the Governor . . . Then accusations of escaping the draft in 1969 . . . Then lame answers to questions about his relationship with a savings and loan head subject to state regulation . . . Last Sunday, he admitted trying marijuana in words ("didn't inhale") so grudging as to invite ridicule.
Some of these episodes have been unfair or exaggerated. Together they leave enduring doubts. But what's obscured in all the commotion is a record of accomplishment that gives credibility to the cogent program he proposes. In Arkansas, Governor Clinton has been as good as his words. Last summer, his fellow governors voted him the best in their business.
His domestic agenda rings with sensible priorities. He has yet to define a foreign and defense policy that would free the Federal funds needed for his domestic agenda. But his program aims to fix what's most wrong with the American economy.
He thinks government should invest in people -- notably through education, training, early childhood intervention, national service and welfare reform. What makes that doubly appealing is that as it encouraged economic growth, it would also advance social justice and racial healing.
One day last January, Mr. Clinton was talking to a business group in New York's Regency Hotel. He held up that day's New York Post, whose banner read BLACK KIDS PAINTED WHITE, and asked: "Why did they do that? Because they live in a world in which nobody has told them the truth. That we're all in this together. These white kids [are told] 'Ain't nothing wrong with you. It's always Them . . . Them, them, them. It's time somebody stood up and said there is no Them. There's only Us."
 
Neither
 Some voters, troubled about Bill Clinton and uneasy about Jerry Brown, push for a brokered convention -- that is, one in which Paul Tsongas or someone not yet a candidate could emerge. One way to do that would be to cast a protest vote for Mr. Tsongas.
That would pay deserved respect to a candidate who persevered for long, lonely months on behalf of his sound program for growth. It would be wholly understandable, should Governor Clinton falter, for Mr. Tsongas to contemplate returning for the California and New Jersey primaries June 2. He might win enough delegates to gain bargaining power at a brokered convention.
But even if all that did happen, voters who like the prospect of a brokered convention would need to consider three points:
Americans have worked hard to shift the choice of nominees from pols to voters -- and are not likely to welcome giving it back. Second, not even people close to Mr. Tsongas are confident that the power brokers would choose him. Third, it's far from clear that some compromise choice, untested and unscarred by the primaries, would look like such a savior in an even-rougher fall campaign.
At this time, in this churning primary campaign, Bill Clinton remains the superior choice for Democrats.
These are not endorsements for November. This has already been a bumpy campaign year for both parties -- and is likely to become more so, given the prospect of a formidable independent challenge by Ross Perot, self-made billionaire.
Even so, President Bush stands head and shoulders above the pinched negativism preached by Patrick Buchanan and deserves the renomination his party seems certain to give him.
On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Bill Clinton offers a plausible path to economic growth and racial unity. Jerry Brown appeals to anger. Bill Clinton appeals to hope.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Wreck Or Rescue?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
This is a year of anger in politics. Voters are angry at economic misery, at politicians who give themselves perks, at institutions that do not work. They are in a mood to punish, to destroy.
Jerry Brown fits that mood. He comes on as a Savonarola who would purge an impure system. And if there is a real Jerry Brown underneath the various political masks, it may be something like that: Savonarola. 
 As Governor of California he was a wrecker of institutions. The University of California, the courts, the mental hospitals -- institutions in which the state had taken great pride -- were savaged by Governor Brown. All in the name of profound rethinking, and without regard for the human cost.
Stanley Sheinbaum, an outstanding liberal Democrat, was named to the University of California Board of Regents by Governor Brown and served for 12 years. He remains "grateful" for the appointment, he says, but his memories of what Mr. Brown did to the university are not happy.
"He had a disrespect for the university," Mr. Sheinbaum told me. "He was very rough on the budget, and not just for lack of money. He virtually eliminated extension courses, with the comment, 'Why have courses for housewives?' "
I visited the University of California during the Brown years, doing some teaching, and found that faculty and staff members thought him so contemptuous of the university that they pined for his predecessor as Governor: Ronald Reagan. They thought they were treated more fairly, and more straightforwardly, by Governor Reagan.
"The president of the university tried to get an appointment with Governor Brown for weeks to discuss the financial crisis," Mr. Sheinbaum said. "Finally he was told he could see him late at night just before the Governor submitted his budget. When he got there, he found that the Governor had two students there to take part in the meeting."
Governor Brown left five or six vacancies on the Board of Regents unfilled for an extended time, Mr. Sheinbaum said -- "It crippled us." Mr. Brown did that with many state boards and agencies, saying that he was rethinking their functions.
Governor Brown cut funds for mental hospitals and let conditions in them get so bad that the hospitals were decertified and Federal funding cut off. Interviewing him in 1978, I asked him why he had done that.
"I was not confident that I understood the program," he said. "I've had some doubts about the role of psychiatry and the approach in mental illness."
One may well have intellectual doubts about the treatment of mental illness. But for a governor to let patients go hungry, dirty and neglected while he mulls those doubts is something else.
The institution that suffered most from the Brown years, I think, was the Supreme Court of California. Governor Brown made some good appointments. But he made one fatal one: of Rose Bird, one of his assistants, as Chief Justice.
Rose Bird was a thoughtful and decent person with modest experience in the law. She might have been an appropriate choice as a lower court judge. For Chief Justice of California she was completely inappropriate. Lawyers and judges took the appointment to be an expression of Jerry Brown's contempt for the law.
The end of the Rose Bird story was terrible for her and for the Supreme Court of California. Right-wing forces started a campaign that ended with the voters removing her and two respected colleagues from the court, and with its once high reputation among state courts degraded.
In times of stress there may always be an urge to destroy institutions, to purify and start over. Think of the 1960's. But is that what the United States needs today?
The Reagan and Bush years have seen the weakening of our constitutional institutions. The Federal courts have been stacked with ideological zealots, Government agencies with people who do not believe in their missions. The need is not to destroy but to restore.
Consider just one thing: the President's power to name Supreme Court Justices, for me his single most important duty. Would we want those appointments to be made by Jerry Brown?

HEADLINE: BASEBALL '92: AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST;
Jays Add Morris and Winfield to a Potent Mix

 BODY:
This preview was prepared and written by Murray Chass. Teams are presented in alphabetical order and the starting lineups are his projections. His probable starters for the Yankees appear on page 3. Relief pitchers listed are the closers.
Staff predictions for the teams' order of finish in each division appears on page 6. 

Baltimore Orioles
If the Orioles' M&M's don't melt in the heat of competition, the Orioles could make the longest strides in the division. McDonald, Mussina, Milacki and Mesa -- Ben, Mike, Bob, Jose -- are the pitchers Johnny Oates is counting on, along with veteran Rick Sutcliffe, to add luster to the team's new park.
Mussina, who has a degree in economics from Stanford, showed his pitching credentials as a rookie last year, only his second as a professional, when he allowed no more than two runs in each of his last six starts. The Orioles have been waiting for McDonald to fulfill his promise, and this could be the year he does, if he can avoid injury.
Glenn Davis, plagued last year by a problem with a nerve in his neck, could be poised for an explosive year himself.
KEY ADDITIONS: After two seasons of shoulder ailments, Sutcliffe could be ready to resume his career in earnest. Storm Davis is around in case one of the starters falters.
KEY LOSSES: None.
KEY TO SEASON: It's a long way from 67 victories to a competitive status, but Glenn Davis and the pitchers can make it attainable.
 
Boston Red Sox
 Playing we-can-match-this, the Red Sox snared Frank Viola the day after Jack Morris joined the Blue Jays. But if the Red Sox rotation begins with the inimitable Roger Clemens and Viola, it ends with Matt Young, who has a career 49-77 record and only one winning record in eight seasons.
But Butch Hobson, the new manager, will rely on his hitters as much as his pitchers. The hitter to watch in the collection of good ones is the newest one, Phil Plantier, who in 53 games last year batted .331, hit 11 home runs and drove in 35 runs. Not so impressive was Mo Vaughn (.260, 4 homers and 32 r.b.i. in 74 games).
As good as the collection is, the Red Sox need a resurgence from Ellis Burks, whose medical record (hamstring, knees, back) was more impressive than his hitting record (.251, 56 r.b.i.)
KEY ADDITION: If ailing fingers were really responsible for his 2-10 second-half record with the Mets, Viola should join Clemens in frightening teams that have to face them in the same series.
KEY LOSSES: None.
KEY TO SEASON: The hitters, particularly Jack Clark, have to be consistent throughout the season, while the other pitchers have to share some of the burden with Clemens and Viola.
 
Cleveland Indians
 This could be an interesting team to watch, but its youthfulness will lose games as often as win them. The Indians are not helped by the presence of two promising rookies, first baseman Reggie Jefferson and third baseman Jim Thome, on the disabled list at the start of the season.
Sandy Alomar Jr., once billed as the next great catcher, is back after missing 111 games with shoulder and hip injuries. Albert Belle missed time, too, but for disciplinary reasons. The Indians want him playing full time this season because he had 17 percent of their runs batted in and 35 percent of their home runs.
KEY ADDITIONS: Rookie Kenny Lofton could provide an offensive spark, but Jack Armstrong and Scott Scudder, acquired in a trade for Greg Swindell, have to supply effective pitching.
KEY LOSS: Swindell was a solid pitcher despite his 9-16 record.
KEY TO SEASON: Manager Mike Hargrove can only be patient while his players learn from their mistakes.
 
Detroit Tigers
 In leading the league with 1,185 strikeouts, the Tigers had four of the seven players who had the most strikeouts. That's hitting, not pitching. As a team, they were second in the league in runs scored (817) but were last in batting average (.247). When they made contact, though, they batted .315.
The primary project this season is to reduce the number of strikeouts while increasing the number of runs, which should follow from making contact more frequently.
Bill Gullickson somehow gained 20 victories, but the Tigers can't expect a duplication of that feat.
KEY ADDITIONS: Dan Gladden, the new left fielder, can remind his new teammates what it means to win; he scored the winning run in the World Series.
KEY LOSSES: None.
KEY TO SEASON: Cecil Fielder has a broad, strong back, but asking him to carry the Tigers for a third successive season would be unfair. He needs help.
 
Milwaukee Brewers
 Phil Garner, who has never managed anywhere, can show off his 1979 World Series ring and tell his players how he hit .500 in that Series, but the players have to do more than listen.
This is a team that could go in various directions, meaning they need solid performances from many of Garner's audience. The pitchers especially have to maintain good health, a condition not familiar to the Brewers. Their onetime ace, Ted Higuera, hopes to be back by midseason.
Before the end of the season, Robin Yount hopes to have 122 hits, which would put him at 3,000.
KEY ADDITIONS: Kevin Seitzer, released by Kansas City, would help if he could reverse the trend that has seen his batting average drop every season for the last four seasons, since he batted .323 in his first full season.
KEY LOSS: They might discover that not trying to re-sign Willie Randolph as a free agent was a mistake.
KEY TO SEASON: A strong start could dispel doubts, but the Brewers still aren't ready to match strides with the serious contenders.
 
Toronto Blue Jays
 Like the little engine that could, the Blue Jays always think they can, think they can, think they can win the American League pennant. But they get to a certain level on the mountain and they chug no farther.
That's where Jack Morris and Dave Winfield come in. They were hired to be special engineers, the operators who are expected to nudge the Blue Jays the rest of the way.
Morris, who was a more significant operator for Minnesota last October than the previous six months, joins an already loaded pitching staff. Once Dave Stieb comes off the disabled list, before the end of the month, the Blue Jays, who had the league's lowest earned run average last year, 3.50, should be able to dominate the division with pitching alone.
KEY ADDITIONS: Morris and Winfield will contribute battle-hardened experience, but the Blue Jays are also eager to see their rookie right fielder, Derek Bell.
KEY LOSS: Tom Candiotti took his knuckleball to Los Angeles.
KEY TO SEASON: The pitchers just have to do their jobs, with swing man David Wells moving to the bullpen when Stieb is ready to start but standing ready to return to the rotation if necessary.

HEADLINE: WESTCHESTER GUIDE

BYLINE: By Eleanor Charles

 BODY:

A FAREWELL GALA
 For 21 years Liz Rockwell has guided Westchester's Rondo Dance Theater in Bedford, and for 40 years she ran the Elizabeth Rockwell School of Dance. Now, Ms. Rockwell is retiring, and she will make that announcement during Rondo's gala performance at the State University of New York at Purchase Saturday at 8 P.M. After the performance a reception will be held for her in the Follow-Spot Cafe across from the Performing Arts Center ticket office. 
 Eleanor Bunker, a dancer and rehearsal director with the company for many years, will assume Ms. Rockwell's duties as the new artistic director, and her husband, Addison, will expand his position as part-time manager to full time.
Saturday's performance, to be repeated Sunday at 3 P.M., will include choreography by Jose Limon, Moses Pendleton, Murray Louis, Doug Verone and others, demonstrating Rondo's commitment to preserving and performing the works of great choreographers of the 20th century.
Tickets at $12 for Saturday night and $10 for Sunday afternoon can be reserved by calling 251-6200.
 
WATERSHED CLEANUP
 A massive volunteer cleanup of the Croton Watershed is scheduled from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. Saturday by the local chapter of Trout Unlimited. "Our members know of old tires, refrigerators, washing machines and stoves that were dumped by or into our streams in the dark of night," said Richard Jogodnik, a spokesman for the chapter.
A number of other organizations will join the effort, sending teams of volunteers to one or more of eight designated meeting places. The groups are Hilltop Sports and Conservation, the Kent Rod and Gun Club, Northern Westchester Fish and Game, Patterson Sportsmen, the Putnam County Federation of Sportsmen, the Putnam County Fish and Game Association, the Ossi Sport Club and Bass. New York City has consented to dispose of all the garbage and debris collected.
The cleanup is necessary as a step toward preserving the region's drinking water, threatened by debris thrown into streams and reservoirs that are depleted by a lack of rain.
Volunteers will be supplied with plastic bags and instructions. They should wear sturdy shoes and gloves and rain gear if necessary, because there will be no cancellation for bad weather. For more information or to volunteer, call 666-5727.
 
ADELE MYERS EXHIBITION
 Works by Adele Myers are to be shown at Hopper House in Nyack through the end of the month, opening with a reception for the artist today from 1 to 5 P.M. Adele Myers is a Dominican Sister who founded and directed the Thorpe Intermedia Gallery in Sparkill for 15 years until it closed this year.
The signature component of her work is cement, a material she began using with oils many years ago. In 1986 she switched from cement and oils to cement and fresco, which she calls a more compatible combination. Her pieces are as sculptural as they are painterly, sometimes leaving expanses of lime exposed.
Sister Myers studied painting in Florence, and she is now an adjunct professor of art at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill. She was one of the first recipients of the Rockland County Executive's Arts Awards in 1987, and she has served since then in an appointed position on the Rockland County Art in Public Places Committee.
Hopper House, at 82 North Broadway, is open Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is free although a donation of $1 is suggested.
 
FIGHTING STAGE FRIGHT
 It is no secret that most actors, musicians, lecturers or anyone appearing before the public experiences stage fright. And it has been observed by psychologists that the more accomplished they are, the more nervous they get.
But "nobody need be a victim of stage fright," said Lucy Joffe, a faculty member at the Westchester Conservatory of Music, who will conduct a free program on the subject Tuesday at 8 P.M. at the conservatory.
Methods for dealing with what can be a terrifying ordeal, devised in recent years by psychologists and medical doctors, can help most people, as Ms. Joffe learned after making a study of the subject in response to her own students' fears.
A graduate of Vassar College with master's degrees in music from the Manhattan School of Music and Columbia University, Ms. Joffe has been a member of the voice faculty at the Westchester Conservatory for more than 20 years. The school is at 20 Soundview Avenue in White Plains. Call 762-3715 for more information.
 
IMMIGRANTS AND ART
 These are the final weeks of a monthlong program exploring "The Contemporary American Immigrant Experience in Art," organized by the Westchester Consortium for International Studies, a joint effort of Marymount and Iona Colleges.
Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize poet, Soviet exile and poet laureate of the Library of Congress, will read from his work tomorrow at 7:30 P.M. in the Library Lecture Hall at Marymount College in Tarrytown.
At Iona an exhibition of recent works by first-generation immigrant artists can be seen through Friday in the lobby gallery of the Ryan Library on the North Avenue campus in New Rochelle. Two dimensional works and crafts are included in the show, created by artists from Latin America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The gallery is open Mondays through Fridays from 8:30 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Saturdays from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and Sundays from 1 to 6 P.M.
One of the final events is an artists' panel scheduled on April 14 at 7:30 P.M. in Romita Auditorium at Iona. Christine Choy, a film maker; Miguel Algarin, a playwright; Serdar Arat, a painter, and Anneliese Wagner, a poet and author, will talk about their adjustments to life in the United States on a personal and professional level. Admission to all events is free. For more information, call 694-2200, extension 521.
 
BASICS OF GARDENING
 Assuming that not all Westchester residents have green thumbs and that some might be newcomers to topsoil and trowels, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx will offer a crash course in "Gardening for Beginners" Saturday from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.
The basics will be covered, from soils and tools to plants, vegetables and flowers and plotting the layout. Specific topics include basic plant needs, transplanting and pruning, the dynamics of dirt, outstanding tree and shrub varieties, vegetable gardening for small spaces, annuals and perennials and the end product: a cliffside garden after 40 years.
Participants will also tour the demonstration gardens. The fee is $55, including a box lunch, parking and a program book. Call (212) 220-8720 to register or obtain more information.
 
ECONOMIST'S VIEWPOINT
 Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will discuss the recession and the prospects for recovery tomorrow from 7:30 to 9 P.M. at the Hommocks School in Mamaroneck.
Forecasting economic trends in the region and developing long-range planning strategies are part of her job, and her outlook seems optimistic, judging from her chapter titled "New York City as Global Capital in the 1990's" from "Cities in a Global Society" (Sage Publications, 1989). She has also compiled a regional forecast of population, labor force and jobs to 1995.
Admission is $15, $10 for people 65 and older. Call 698-9126 for more information.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 12, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Guide column last Sunday misstated the site of a panel discussion about "The Contemporary American Immigrant Experience in Art." It will be held on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. at the College of New Rochelle, not Iona College.

HEADLINE: How Big Is Too Big? Township Can't Decide

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE

DATELINE: HOLMDEL TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
WHEN John Wadington started out as clerk and treasurer of this township in 1965, he had a day job as a research chemist. He could handle his municipal duties at meetings held two nights a week and on Saturdays. It was a time when the township's population was 4,000, the State Police patrolled the roads and there was no high school.
Mr. Wadington, now 72 years old, retired last week from his township posts, and it will take two employees working full time to replace him. Holmdel's population has grown to 12,000, with its own police force and high school. New stores and office buildings and other outward signs of prosperity and progress are everywhere. 
 Yet Holmdel is a town divided. At public meetings of the Township Committee that can last until 2 A.M., the five members exchange angry arguments and personal insults. Faced with a shortage of revenue, they fight over what services to curtail, what plans to drop. The tax rate has increased almost 50 percent since 1987.
But more than anything, what they fight over is the future of their community: whether to maintain its semirural character or to approve development plans that would enlarge its base of taxable office and laboratory real estate, commonly referred to as ratables. But increased development would bring more people and traffic in its wake.
For professional planners throughout the state, the Holmdel debate has become all too familiar as corporations and their employees have increasingly moved out of the cities to the countryside.
"Rural is the next frontier," said Tom Stearn, a planner with the Hillier Group, a Princeton-based architectural company. "People want smaller-scale living. Then the tug-of-war erupts over ratables."
Too small a tax base causes municipal services to suffer, he said, while too large a base erodes the quality of life. "Towns don't always strike a balance," he added.
Holmdel has had trouble finding that balance. Last November, a slow-growth coalition of two Republicans and a Democrat, running as independents, won election and the balance of power on the Township Committee. But in this Republican bastion, where the registered Republicans outnumber the Democrats by 2,890 to 810, the struggle is mainly intramural.
A major bone of contention is a proposal from the Chase Manhattan Bank for a one-million-square-foot back-office space at the intersection of Holmdel and Roberts Roads. Chase has offered to pay an estimated $3.2 million for widening the roads. The proposal has received preliminary approval from the Planning Board, but final approval must come from the Township Committee.
Fueling the debate are additional proposals for nearly 1.5 million square feet of offices. All these plans, including that from Chase Manhattan, are for the section of the township that falls in a southerly slope away from the Garden State Parkway and into the lowlands that lead to the Swimming River Reservoir. Under the state's newest master plan, this portion of Holmdel is regarded as environmentally sensitive.
Last fall, two neighboring Monmouth County townships, Colts Neck and Marlboro, filed suits against Holmdel to block final approval of the office proposals until a regional impact study was conducted. Opponents contend that the offices would bring in thousands of workers daily, triggering high volumes of traffic along Routes 520 and 34.
Route 34 is the common boundary of the three towns. Route 520 is also West Main Street in the village of Holmdel, a one-time residential area where business signs now swing from the porches of houses that have been designated as historic.
"My crystal ball tells me we'll see Holmdel in the headlines over more lawsuits," said Peggy Lasky, a two-term Republican member of the Township Committee and the former Mayor, anticipating developers' negative reactions should Holmdel change some of its longstanding zoning for offices and laboratories.
In a nonbinding referendum in November, the township voted for change by a margin of nearly 2 to 1. "All the land was purchased years ago," Ms. Lasky said.
 
Struggling Over Budget
 As the second quarter in the calendar year gets under way, Holmdel is in the unusual circumstance of being without a formalized budget. Last year the budget was $10.4 million, and the committee has been struggling to find a way to finance a similar-sized budget -- but it has been $1 million short.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Labs provide the township with $4 million in annual taxes, and at one time Holmdel could have counted on a special tax of $2.5 million a year paid by the Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, which operates a sprawling office complex in the village.
Under state law, communities receive revenue from a special franchise tax imposed on stock insurance companies whose headquarters are situated in their towns. Prudential continues to operate in Holmdel, but four years ago it moved its official headquarters to Indiana.
Under state law, Holmdel was entitled to a six-year compensatory payment from Prudential. But, Mr. Wadington said, the state wants the money for itself.
Holmdel has been fighting in court to obtain what Mr. Wadington estimates is $5 million, including interest. Two courts have ruled in the township's favor; the state has appealed both rulings, and the matter is now before the State Supreme Court.
 
'The Town Needs Revenue'
 "The town needs revenue," Mr. Wadington said. Residents can absorb a gradual increase in their taxes, he believes, but not an abrupt rise. Indeed, on $100 of assessed valuation, Holmdel's tax rate has gone from about $2 in 1987 to $2.28 in 1988, to $2.58 in 1989, to $2.87 in 1990 and to $2.85 in 1991. Real-estate prices average $340,000 for an acre of wooded land and a four-bedroom home.
The debate over Holmdel's rural and ratables future has created a split among Republicans between aggressive, city-style politics and an old-time, sedate political tradition. The Greater Holmdel Republican Club represents the township's mainline, generally pro-development Republicans; the Holmdel Republican Club, sometimes referred to as the regular Republican Club, espouses no-growth or low-growth sentiments.
"Everybody wants something different," said Adie Holmes Lubkert, whose family founded Holmdel more than 300 years ago, and whose father farmed potatoes under what is now the township's intermediate and high schools.
Jim Ackerson, who at 80 continues to till what is left of what his father called Fruit Acres, said, "They don't want to listen to each other."
 
New Mayor in 'Hot Seat'
 The new Mayor of Holmdel, named by the Township Committee's new majority, is Ernest Cote, a 14-year veteran of the committee and a budget manager with Bell Labs.
Mr. Cote relishes being Mayor. "It's my turn to be in the hot seat," he said. "I've had a lot of practice with fighting uphill battles."
Originally from Edison, Mayor Cote moved to Holmdel 19 years ago. He split with the Greater Holmdel Republican Club -- whose members he refers to as "the dinosaurs" -- over what he said was their "rich town mentality, where all we have to do is get more ratables in to pay for everything."
Ms. Lasky, who moved to Holmdel 22 years ago from Connecticut, is not one of Mr. Cote's admirers. "The kindest thing you can say about Ernie is that he's the Republican Party's black sheep," she said.
Barbs between Ms. Lasky and Mr. Cote are staples of Township Committee meetings. During one long night in February, as she tried to call for a vote, Mayor Cote responded, "Peggy, you can call a cab for all I care."
 
Allies on Committee
 Gary Aumiller, a Republican who is a physicist with Bell Labs, and Carole Balmer, a Democrat who lives on a small farm with her veterinarian husband, are Mayor Cote's allies on the committee.
Mr. Aumiller, a property owner since 1979 who hails from Pennsylvania, got his first taste of political life campaigning door to door last summer. "I have to temper my own feelings now that I'm elected," he said. "I consider myself a nonpolitician. It weighs on my mind that we can't get things done."
Ms. Balmer, who grew up in Union City and moved to Holmdel 17 years ago, is also new to political office. "I guess I'm a masochist," she said with a grin. Commenting on the failure to achieve consensus on the Township Committee, she said: "Sometimes you have to sway a little bit. It's not 'no development,' it's the 'right' development. This is all the land we've got left."
Malcolm Gropper, a Republican, is Ms. Lasky's partner on the committee. He was appointed to fill a post-election vacancy; the independents are contesting his appointment in court. He initially rose to prominence leading a successful five-year fight for public sewer hookups in his neighborhood.
 
'Too Much Politics'
 "There's too much politics and not enough business taking place at the meetings," said Mr. Gropper, a housing developer who moved here from Uniondale, L.I., 17 years ago. But he added: "I've survived corporate politics. I'll survive local politics. There's more than one way to solve a problem."
Construction is scheduled to start soon on the Holmdel Towne Center, a $40 million shopping complex owned by a division of the Sears Financial Network. The 300,000-square-foot complex is in the northern section of the township, across Route 35 from a food and garden emporium operated by Dominic Lucarelli, a second-generation farmer.
"Every few years a new ratable came in to help offset the tax base," said Mr. Lucarelli, a former committeeman. His nearest neighbor is the Harvard Electronics Company, situated in the former Lily Tulip paper cup factory.
Another neighbor in the township's light industrial zone is the former factory for Charles of the Ritz cosmetics. It is now owned by Revco, the Revlon cosmetics maker, and is used as a warehouse.
 
'We're Going to Feel It'
 "We should put aside personality and figure out how to get the economy going," Mr. Lucarelli said. Otherwise, he said, "five years from now we're going to feel it."
As Mr. Wadington, a native of Illinois, looked back on his public career, which included service with the Monmouth County Republican organization and the Holmdel Planning Board, he admitted that the long hours had taken a personal toll. A widower with three grown children, he has remarried and has a new instant family of three small children. "I didn't realize that family is the No. 1 priority one should have in life," he said.
But Mr. Wadington has not given up on politics anymore than he has given up being a Republican. In fact, he is under contract for 100 hours of work as a consultant to the township. One of his fondest hopes, he said, is that the various Republican factions in town can get together to overthrow the independents in November.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Two Waitresses a la Samuel Beckett

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
FOR some 40 years modern playwrights have been beholden to Samuel Beckett, who stripped the theatrical landscape of conventional structure and scenery and got to the essence of being, the void of existence, the meaning of meaninglessness, the hope beyond hopelessness and the implications of words. Like waiting.
Some playwrights apparently feel obliged to keep reminding us of that debt by invoking parallels to such Beckettian concerns as going on amid barrenness and trifling time away with seeming non sequiturs. Borrowing from old masters is confused with developing a new voice for some writers. Like Rachel Sheinkin. 
 Her play, "Loss of Virginia," at Company One Theater in Hartford, is about two waitresses in a diner. With Beckett in mind, it hardly seems necessary to remind one that what waitresses do is wait.
Which is not to say that Beckett is Ms. Sheinkin's sole influence, only the most obvious one and the most prominent in the absurdist school that has, no doubt, provoked Ms. Sheinkin to write ramblingly and repetitiously in a mixed bag of styles.
Including musical comedy. The words from "Shall We Dance?" are excerpted in the program, and two of the six other characters in the diner are formally decked out, sing lyrics rather than speak lines (to original music by Neil Ginsberg) and dance, dance, dance -- tap, tango, pirouette, Yiddish folk. After shuffling off into the kitchen, they stuff themselves with bread and throw it all over the floor. At one point or perhaps another, someone asks, "If I wasn't hungry, how would I know I wasn't happy or dead?"
The recycled banter in "Loss of Virginia" -- Virginia, one of the waitresses, is from Virginia, wants to go back there and does -- brings to mind the sort of semantic meandering that in college days was randomly indulged in by those in an existential, glib or just plain ornery mood, usually after midnight, when pauses, blank stares and parrying were mistaken for depth. Some people write all that down and call it postmodernism. Ms. Sheinkin has poignant, specific things to say about the frustrations of young people, but her vision is blurred by the overkill of the anti-establishment.
Thus, in the playwright's diner, somewhere in limboland, one hears loaded questions like, "Would you like to join me?" and "Are we alone together?" To the observation, "You're new," the retort is, "I am not used," or "I am not old." When Virginia takes the order of the other waitress, Rose, who is not from Roseland and insists that Virginia is not from Virginia either, she is called a thief. Later, Virginia on her way to Virginia, calls from the road. The exchange goes something like this: "I have a flat tire." "No, I'm not a motor vehicle."
Clearly, to the extent that clarity in any form of the word is applicable here, Ms. Sheinkin is concerned with, yes, communication. One of the denizens of the diner, who include Scratch and Sniff, wants to hear the unspoken. The playwright is also expressing the disorientation of young people who are desperately seeking sense in a society that's hiding it. And the reason Virginia has run off to Virginia with Oscar, the diner's owner, is that he has offered her love. She did not expect that Oscar would also be offering her other lovers.
Once Virginia leaves, Rose is left holding the bag -- of garbage. She has been lugging it about all along, and it has gotten bigger throughout the play. At the end, its contents -- a typewriter, a telephone, an application for employment, an application for unemployment, hair curlers, hair straighteners and "every mistake Rose ever made" -- represent the detritus, the clutter, the contradictions of her life, which is now at a standstill or, more accurately, a sit-down. She does not speak, and, in the manner of the classic Beckett stage direction, she does not move. One of the last things she says is, "I don't think I want to be here." From that big plastic bag, Ms. Sheinkin now has to sort out her own materials.
Company One, which begins its 10th year in the fall, produces new experimental works. Most recently, plays by significant new playwrights like Suzan-Lori Parks and Paula Vogel have been done. With "Loss of Virginia," the company, which has had a nomadic existence for several seasons, has taken up residence in the 284-seat Art Deco auditorium (formerly the Avery Theater) at the Wadsworth Atheneum that has been variously but inconsistently used for stage events and film programs but has an indelible claim to music-theater history. The auditorium was the site of the world premiere of the Virgil Thomson-Gertrude Stein opera, "Four Saints in Three Acts," with choreography by Frederick Ashton and direction by John Houseman, on Feb. 7, 1934.
"Loss of Virginia"  at the Aetna Theater of Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. 233-4588.  Performances through next Sunday.

HEADLINE: Free Baby Sitting Fills Tables at Restaurant

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: BEDFORD HILLS

 BODY:
FEW businesses have escaped the pinch of the recession, and for local restaurants things are particularly dismal on the traditionally slow first three nights of the week. But one recent Tuesday evening at Rockwells, in Bedford Hills, a line of customers was backed up to the door.
What is the big draw? It's a novel concept that has struck a nerve with Westchester parents: free baby-sitting at the restaurant. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, from 5 to and 9 o'clock, the management at Rockwells transforms an auxiliary dining room into a nursery school. Doll carts and toy cars are spread across the floor; a toy kitchen is in the corner. There are storybooks on one table and arts and crafts projects on another. 
 "This is incredible," said Elise Glier, who was visiting the restaurant for the first time. "This is heaven." Her son, Sam, almost 2 years old, had run into the baby-sitting room and grabbed a toy. "Tonight when my friend said to me we could go out to dinner at a place where they will take care of your kid, I couldn't believe it," she said. "Then I said, 'Let's go.' " 
If parents wish, their children can be served a children's meal in the baby-sitting room. Children also have the option of eating in the main dining room with their parents and playing in the baby-sitting room before and after the meal. While the baby-sitting service is free, there is a charge of $4.95 for the children's meal.
 
First-Hand Experience
 Rockwells has branches in Tuckahoe and Scarsdale, and all three restaurants offer baby-sitting. Steve Robbins, the owner, said he got the idea while trying to dine out with his own children, who are 5, 4 and 2 years old.
"I knew first-hand how hard it was to go out to a restaurant with your kids," Mr. Robbins said. "Then last year, I went to a furniture store that had a place on-site where they watched your children. It was great. We've always had a family market at the restaurants, and I thought it would probably work."
Based on the reaction of parents at the restaurant, it seems like an idea whose time had come.
"We can actually have a conversation," said Diane Renick of North Salem, who was dining with her husband, Steve, and their two children.
 
A Way to Reduce Boredom
 Eight-year-old Kristin Renick said that dining where there was a place to play "is not so boring" as eating at other places with her parents. She then announced, "I'm done. Can I go back to the room now?" She was joined by her 3-year-old brother, Stephen, who had quickly eaten a grilled-cheese sandwich while bouncing up and down in his chair.
"Kids are just so fidgety. They are on dessert and you are still on your salad," said Michal Winter, who was eating out with her husband, Warren, and their two children. "This is the only place where I can actually have coffee after dinner."
Mr. and Mrs. Winter said they come to Rockwells an average of two times a month. They rarely hire a sitter and prefer the flexibility of being able to come home from work and make a last-minute decision to go out.
"For less than the cost of going out to eat and leaving your kids at home, you can take them along and give them some entertainment, too," Mr. Winter said, adding: "Eating out is a luxury, but this way its affordable and enjoyable. We feel comfortable with them so nearby."
 
Crying Can Set Off a Chain Reaction
 Of course, all is not always rosy in the baby-sitting room. Two-year-old Sam Glier, who had first entered the room enthusiastically, had second thoughts when he realized that his mother was not going to stay with him. And in a group-care situation one crying child will often set off a chain reaction among the others, said Catherine Coughlin, the baby sitter.
"We try to get a crying child out of the room real quickly," Ms. Coughlin said. "It's better that they be with their mother than hanging around the door unhappy." Children running back and forth from the baby-sitting room to the dining room can also be disruptive to the other customers.
On balance, the concept seems to be a success. Recently, Mr. Robbins tested the service with the lunch crowd here in Bedford Hills, offering free baby-sitting from noon to 3 P.M. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. While the management prefers children to be at least 2 years old for evening baby-sitting, infants are accommodated at lunchtime. Earlier this month, a local play group came in to eat. The mothers enjoyed a leisurely lunch while six 14-month-old babies crawled around the playroom.
"This is a place where the grown-ups can be grown-ups and the kids can be kids," said Esmeralda Santiago of Bedford Hills, who had taken her 7-year-old daughter, Ila, in for baby-sitting. "My husband and I get to have a date, and the kids get fed and play. Then we take them home, and everybody's happy."

HEADLINE: Nestle's Move Symbolizes A Competitive Climate

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THE announcement that Nestle is moving its headquarters to California, coming on the heels of General Motors's decision to close its North Tarrytown assembly plant in 1995, may raise the specter of an exodus from Westchester. But corporate and government leaders say the county is resilient enough to recover from the loss of two major employers.
The Nestle Food Company, in fact, can be viewed as a window into a changing economic future. Long the beneficiary of major corporate relocations, Westchester is now experiencing the effect of corporate downsizing, mergers and restructuring. Yet it expects growth in other economic areas. 
 "We believe future growth will come from midsize and smaller companies," said Noreen Preston, an economic-development specialist at the county's Office of Commerce and Economic Development in White Plains. She said these firms "will probably focus on supplying business-support services."
 
10 Years Ago, 1,200 Employees in Purchase
 Ten years ago, Nestle had 1,200 employees at its headquarters in Purchase. In 1989, there were 925. Last month, when Nestle announced that the workers in Purchase would be leaving by the end of this year, there were only 400. About 135 of them have been offered jobs at the company's new home in Glendale, Calif.
"We don't own Nestle; it's not anchored in cement here," said S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group headquartered in White Plains. "Nestle is no different from any other big corporation today that is undergoing major restructuring to make it more competitive."
A major corporate restructuring, in which the 15 Nestle food and beverage companies in the United States were formed into six business units, has taken place since the merger of Nestle with its sibling, the former Carnation Company of Los Angeles.
The company's presence in the county dates from 1952. Nestle USA, part of the world's largest food company, Nestle S.A. in Switzerland, was established in Westchester that year when two United States subsidiaries of Nestle S.A. opened executive offices in White Plains. The company later moved to larger quarters on Bloomingdale Road in White Plains and in 1977 to a new headquarters building on Manhattanville Road in Purchase.
The move to Purchase was made possible only when the town of Harrison rezoned property owned by Manhattanville College, which it did after the state agreed to build a new exit and entrance from Manhattanville Road to Interstate 684 at a cost of $7 million. The road improvement diverted traffic from local Harrison streets and was a concession to keep Nestle in Westchester and in the state. Nestle acted in good faith, said a company spokesman, Linda Gavlick. "At that time, Nestle had no thought of moving from Purchase. No one could foresee future consolidation."
As part of the restructuring, the Nestle Chocolate and Confection Company in Purchase became a part of a merged company called the Nestle Food Company. "The move will unite the Nestle Chocolate and Confection Company in Purchase with the sales and distribution arms in Glendale," Ms. Gavlick said, "so the business will be able to draw upon the resources and support groups of Nestle Food Company and Nestle USA in Glendale."
Mr. Schulman said the move was not surprising. "What usually happens in such cases is that the new merged headquarters is close to the home of the larger sibling, which in this case was the former Carnation Company in Los Angeles," he said.
Even as it departs, Nestle is keeping real estate ties to Westchester. Last December, the company paid $11.5 million for the land on which its 260,000-square-foot headquarters building in Purchase sits, and it has just bought the building from Related Properties of Manhattan.
Ms. Gavlick said the purchase was made after Nestle examined several options. "Because we had a long-term lease on the building, it made the best sense financially for us to buy it as an investment."
 
Some Signs of Growth
 Mr. Schulman said he does not believe that corporate departures and downsizing have dealt Westchester a mortal blow. Nor, in fact, does he think they will continue.
"We recently conducted a survey of major private-sector employers in the county, and it shows that employment at the majority of them is pretty stable," Mr. Schulman said. "What is especially interesting, given the economy, is that some of them are showing a healthy increase in growth."
Citing an example, Mr. Schulman said that under the Philip Morris takeover, General Foods had become relatively stable: "In 1989, they employed 2,750 people in White Plains; this year, employment has risen to 3,050."
Even more encouraging, he added, are the employment figures from Nynex. "Six years ago, Nynex had 800 employees. This year, they have a work force of 2,180."
 
The Worst Could Be Over
 Other companies showing an increase in employment this year, Mr. Schulman said, are Texaco, Pepsico, New York Telephone, Ciba-Geigy, the Bank of New York and Liberty Lines.
"And at I.B.M., still the county's largest private employer, the work force is also relatively stable despite all the negative reports -- 11,000 in 1992 compared with 12,000 in 1989," he said.
Ms. Preston, the economic development specialist with the county, also suggested that the worst of the stagnation that has plagued the county's economy for three years could be over.
"The objective of downsizing and restructuring is to allow companies to operate more efficiently and more competitively," Ms. Preston said. "If you have a company like Nestle, which is national in scope, a proportionately larger reduction in staff makes headlines."
"But I know of many midsize companies in the county that have done the same thing and are now out of that phase and are doing very well," she added. "Of course, we realize that the time is past when Fortune 500 companies move their headquarters into the county at a fast clip."
 
A 20 Percent Vacancy Rate
 Ms. Preston said the Office of Commerce and Economic Development is active in working to attract business and retain companies.
"We not only act as a clearing house, giving out information, but we also assist companies coming into the county to find appropriate space here," Ms. Preston said. "Right now is a good time to relocate because we have a 20 percent vacancy rate for Class A office space available at $23 to $24 a square foot."
Margaret Soter, who is the director of the department, said that although the marketing efforts of the department extend beyond the state, most of the companies coming into the county have been recruited from New York City.
"Companies in New York City don't have to worry too much about relocating employees," Ms. Soter said. "They can come here with their labor force pretty intact because our bus and rail system makes it feasible for their workers to get to the job. Others also benefit from the trained labor force we have here."
 
Competition From Neighbors
 Yet Ms. Soter acknowledged that there is intense competition for every new company from neighboring Connecticut and northern New Jersey. "We're all after business," she said. "But I'm optimistic because the central location of Westchester works to our favor. We've already made the first cut for Unicef's relocation, and that organization has 800 employees. They are considering coming from Manhattan to New Rochelle."
Ms. Soter added that she is also encouraged by the recent restructuring of the Westchester Partnership, a consortium of business and private-sector organizations in the county working together to market the county as a desirable business location.
"The Partnership is now broader based, with representatives from government, business and area developers on the committee," she said. "George Delaney of Consolidated Edison has agreed to become our new president," she added.
Plans call for an aggressive marketing campaign, making use of advertising, public relations, radio and television to woo companies to the county, Ms. Soter said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Millburn

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
MILLBURN TOWNSHIP, one of the wealthiest communities in northern New Jersey, owes much of its character to the inventor of the spring-loaded window shade.
The inventor, Stewart Hartshorn of New York City, bought a 1,550-acre tract called Short Hills in 1877 when he was 37 years old. Short Hills, which today makes up most of the northern half of the township, was named for its hills, which have a maximum elevation of 660 feet. The area offered clear streams, a chestnut forest and the contours that Hartshorn sought to develop an ideal community. 
 Rather than laying out a grid of roads and lots, he followed the terrain and often adjusted roads to avoid felling trees. He built more than 50 houses, on 2- to 5-acre lots, rented and later sold them.
Many of the original Hartshorn Houses, built of wood and blue traprock in several styles, including Greek Revival and Victorian, are still standing. But the original lots have been subdivided into half-acre to one-acre sites. Houses with six to seven bedrooms on one-acre lots are now priced from $1.2 million to $1.8 million, says Harriet Nesbitt, a broker with Burgdorff Realtors in Short Hills.
In keeping with Hartshorn's tree-preservation efforts, the town has a full-time forester. Before trees may be cut down, he must issue a permit, and he also advises residents on tree planting and care. Timothy P. Gordon, the Millburn business administrator, says the township has more than 1,000 trees that are more than 200 years old.
The Morris & Essex Railroad, built in the late 1830's to haul coal from Pennsylvania to New York City, passed through Millburn and spurred its growth. By 1872, when Hartshorn sought his town site, Millburn was already a commuter suburb of New York City with its own train station, which Hartshorn augmented with a second station in Short Hills.
The Wyoming section, on the southeastern side of town, had just been subdivided into 50-foot-wide building lots in a neat grid pattern. The homes there are a mix of styles including Tudors, colonials, historic farmhouses and Victorians. They are priced from $300,000 to $600,000. A four-bedroom neo-Georgian home on Sagamore recently sold for $525,000.
According to Mrs. Nesbitt, a starter home in Millburn would be a three-bedroom split-level for about $300,000. Such homes can be found in the southern part of the township. She said that the housing market in Millburn had suffered no more than a 10 percent price decline because of the economic slump and that sales had been brisk since December, with 27 homes closing in January alone.
Mr. Gordon said the township committee had often debated the lack of affordable housing. "The problem is that the township is all built up," he said. "There is no available land for it."
Among the newer residents are Beth Corrick, her husband, Guillermo, a financial analyst, and their three children, 15 months to 7 years old . Two years ago, they moved to a three-bedroom split-level in Short Hills from a Park Slope co-op.
"WE were concerned about crime in the Brooklyn schools," Ms. Corrick explained. "We wanted a materially successful area with a short commute to New York City, since my husband works in the city. We investigated the school system and found that it has a very low student-teacher ratio and that it was rated as one of the best in the state."
George S. Goffe, a retired executive and 14-year resident of Millburn, concedes that his children would have great difficulty buying a home in the township. However, he said, "in time, I expect that the education they received here will enable them to earn what it takes to buy a home here."
A middle-market area is the Country Club section, next to the Canoe Brook Country Club, which has an 18-hole private golf course. Four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonials there built just after World War II, are priced from $400,000 to $500,000.
Condominiums form the low end of the market. "We hardly notice them," Mrs. Nesbitt said. "They serve mainly young people or senior citizens."
There are 20 apartment complexes in town, some of which have been converted into condominiums. Units are offered at $100,000 to $200,000. The largest condominium complex is the 98-unit Lakeside Village on Main Street, a converted garden-apartment complex.
Vacant rental units are hard to find. The largest apartment complex in town is the 123-unit Short Hills Terrace, where one-bedroom units rent for $920 and two- bedrooms for $1,100.
There are also several blocks of small houses near the business district in the southern section. They were built about 60 years ago for immigrants who were employed at the large houses. Two- to three-bedroom homes on 36-foot-wide lots there are priced as low as $150,000.
Two downtowns, centered around the two ends of Millburn Avenue, have one supermarket each and convenience and service businesses, including ice cream parlors, beauty shops, hardware stores, restaurants and a total of 21 bank branch offices -- one for every 900 people in town.
The million-square-foot Short Hills Mall at Route 24 and JFK Parkway is anchored by Bloomingdale's and A.& S. and has such specialty shops as Gucci, Ralph Lauren and Banana Republic.
Across from the mall is the Hilton at Short Hills, a 300-room hotel that also houses one of the town's best known restaurants, the Dining Room, which has an American menu. Others are 40 Main Street, with American cooking; Sergio's, a Northern Italian restaurant at Millburn Avenue and Main Street, and Sono, a Japanese restaurant on Millburn Avenue. There also are few fast-food outlets.
The most widely used recreational spot in the township is the 36-acre Gero Park off White Oak Ridge Road. It has a par-three, nine-hole golf course, the town pool, four tennis courts and two baseball diamonds.
A POPULAR township area is the 16-acre Cora Hartshorn Arboretum and Bird Sanctuary, developed by the daughter of Stewart Hartshorn on Forest Drive. The Paper Mill Playhouse, on Brookside Drive, one of the country's best-known regional theaters, offers musicals, plays and children's events. Tickets are $24 to $38.
The Millburn Township Public School System has a reputation as one of the finest in New Jersey. It has four K-5 schools, the largest of which is the 335-student Glenwood School on Taylor Road in Short Hills. The students go on to Millburn Middle School on Old Short Hills Road and then to Millburn High School on Millburn Avenue.
Last year, the high school sent 95 percent of its graduates to higher education, according to Dr. Paul W. Rossey, superintendent of schools. The graduating class of '91 included five National Merit scholarship winners and 17 finalists, one Presidential Scholar (a national award) and two Presidential Scholar finalists.
Computer education begins in kindergarten and each of the schools has at least one computer laboratory. After-school programs are offered to gifted students from grade 3 through middle school. The high school offers 15 advanced placement courses in math, science, English, Social Studies and foreign languages.
Dr. Rossey says the quality of the school system reflects the academic and achievement levels of the parents. "It's not surprising that our students are smart," he said. "Most of the parents here have college degrees. And to live here, you have be highly competitive, work hard and be smart."
The larger private schools in town are the nursery-8 Far Brook School, the K-6 Pingry Lower School and the K-8 Roman Catholic St. Rose of Lima School.

Campbell's Mill was followed by several others that made felt and hats. All have closed.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Silicon Egalitarians Scoff at a Private Club

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

DATELINE: LOS ALTOS, Calif.

 BODY:
A few years back, a profile by Tom Wolfe in Esquire of Silicon Valley pioneer Robert Noyce described how, in the early 60's, the employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, one of several companies he founded, gathered at the windows to gawk at a limousine and driver. Limos are no longer an oddity in Silicon Valley, but in this down-to-earth culture any symbol of social stratification still causes squeamishness. That is evident in the periodic failed attempts to establish here that bastion of East Coast urban life, the private club.
"The high-tech community doesn't have much use for things like this," said Paul Franson of the public relations firm of Hagerty & Associates in San Jose. "They don't go out to fancy lunches. You're lucky to have a sandwich at your desk." 
 Exclusive clubs in Silicon Valley have had to open their gates to the rabble to stay in business. Courtside in Los Gatos had to open its restaurant almost immediately to the public. The De Anza Racquet Club, near the Cupertino headquarters of Apple Computer Inc., went broke and is now owned by the City of Cupertino. The Decathlon Club, perhaps the most celebrated of these ventures, quietly opened its dining room to the public, too.
Now comes a new contender for the patronage of patrician-pretenders: the Silicon Valley Capital Club, part of a Dallas-based chain operating in the West. While many of its counterparts bowed to the 80's gestalt by emphasizing fitness and fine dining, the Capital Club, atop the tallest office building in the redeveloping downtown of San Jose, has forgone lockers and racquetball courts in favor of wood paneling and neoclassical furniture. The only people who break into a sweat here are the waiters.
With many of the hot little start-up companies now residing on the Fortune 500, it is betting that aging tycoons are tired of equality and ready for a private club. Since it opened in 1989, the club has grown to 850 members, despite a $2,400 individual initiation fee and dues of $79 a month. But there is not much Silicon Valley in the Silicon Valley Capital Club. Most members are lawyers, accountants and bankers from downtown San Jose. So where are all those powerful electronics tycoons? "Maybe it's the mystique about going to downtown San Jose," said Ellen G. Harris, membership director.
Such organizations are anathema to a place created to contradict the hierarchical East Coast business establishment. Here, entrepreneurship, building one's life from scratch, rules -- and the guy in the Grateful Dead T-shirt sometimes turns out to be the vice president of research and development. The industry's two most important role models, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, were unassuming engineers who ate in the company cafeteria with the rest of the staff. In their wake, even an executive dining room seems unnecessarily plutocratic. Combine this self-conscious commonness with the demands of a 90-hour work week and it is no mystery why executives might rather go for a three-mile run than to an exclusive dining room for a meal bulging with cholesterol.
High expectations may also work against the club's success. "Back East, because there are so many private clubs, many of them around for literally hundreds of years, there is a much greater tolerance of the form," said Tom Fanella, president of the local PBS affiliate, KTEH. "In Silicon Valley, the Capital Club is the first of its kind and people have very high expectations. I personally think it's a nice private club -- if you can call anything with 1,000 members private. It's a good place from which to see and not a bad place to be seen."
Norman C. Hulberg, president of Hulberg & Associates Inc. real estate appraisers, points out a subtler deterrent. "Some clients say, gee, this is a nice place; I'm glad Hulberg is successful enough to take me here," said Mr. Hulberg. "But some will resent that I can afford to belong to such a place, so I have to be careful."
Mr. Franson, a charter member, finds the place fine for press conferences, but otherwise "pretentious." "People with taste giggle about it," he said. "At dinner, there's the clicking of covers, the intrusive service, waiters calling you endlessly by name, frozen forks, giant pepper mills and all the other cliches you've ever heard of. I suppose it's not a bad place to take an out-of-town client -- if you don't mind the waiter being part of your group."
But perhaps the most telling assessment comes from another charter member, Jack Gorry, chief executive of the CXR Corporation, which makes electronic medical instruments in San Jose. "All the Capital Club is is a high-class restaurant," he said. "It wanted to be a club but nobody showed up. That's because you can't do business and socialize at the same time. It's a contradiction in terms -- and that's why most clubs here haven't worked."
Mr. Gorry belongs to the one private club in San Jose that works, the century-old Sainte Claire Club. Tucked into a modest three-story brick building just five blocks from the Capital Club, Sainte Claire is everything the upstart is not: small (120 members), anachronistic (all-male) and expensive ($35,000 initiation). It does not try to meld business and pleasure. Its one fast rule: no papers or briefcases allowed. Mr. Gorry aside, the Sainte Claire Club has not a single member even remotely connected with Silicon Valley.
Meanwhile, the Capital Club becomes less exclusive. A recent letter to members proudly announced that guests would now be allowed to pay for members' meals.

HEADLINE: All About/Acoustic Band Instruments;
The Boom in Soft-Edged Sound

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
When the Canadian Brass, a quintet known for its spirited approach to classical music and jazz, decided about a year ago to design and make its own line of high-quality brass instruments, it faced an obstacle that instrument makers a generation ago never dreamed of: A $265 million market for acoustic band instruments, once made up of dozens of small craftsmen, now dominated by just four companies after decades of consolidation. Acoustic instruments, which include all woodwinds and brass instruments, are the fad of the moment in the $3.5 billion musical instrument market.
Three of the four largest makers of acoustic band instruments are privately held, according to Brian Majeski, editor of the Music Trade, an industry magazine in Englewood, N.J. The G. Leblanc Corporation, had about $40 million in sales last year, the Selmer Ludwig Company, had about $75 million in sales and the United Musical Instruments, had about $50 million worth of sales. The Yamaha Corporation of Japan had about $50 million in sales of acoustical instruments. About 85 percent of the 600,000 instruments sold each year are sold to students. 
 "If you look at instrument sales like a pyramid, only the very tip is professional musicians," said Stan Garber, a spokesman for Selmer Ludwig, the Elkhart, Ind. instrument maker. "The bottom is all student instruments."
Those companies sell their products through 6,000 local music stores around the country which have a virtual lock on the market. "The only way we could see a way into this was to work strictly with dealers," said Chuck Daellenbach, the tuba player for the Canadian Brass. "My father was a bandleader, and I've observed all my life the close relationship between the band and the local music store." But a new trend has emerged that is contrary to the Canadian Brass strategy: mail-order instrument sales.
Industry legend has it that during a slump the market for band instruments inexplicably picks up. "Last year was a record year in terms of sales and profits," said Michael Johnson, a spokesman for Leblanc. "So far it's holding for 1992," he added. Selmer's Mr. Garber said his company also did well during the recession.

 
 
The Fads
Wind Instruments Make a Comeback
 For a market where the products change little from year to year, there are definite consumer fads. Acoustic guitars are selling better than their electric counterparts, many retailers said. According to the Music Trade, woodwinds declined slightly in sales, to about 284,000 units in 1991 from 294,450 in 1990, while brass instruments increased to 153,000 units in 1991 from 146,115 in 1990.
"Three years ago you couldn't sell a horn," said Henry Goldrich, owner of Manny's Music World in New York. "Now people are tired of the electronic sound." Mr. Goldrich estimated that his horn sales -- industry slang for any wind instrument -- have doubled in the last two years.
 
Buying by Mail
New Competition For the Music Store
 From folk singers to heavy metal stars, the instrument-buying public is hearing more acoustic instruments -- and wants them.
Most students buy or lease their instruments from the local mom-and-pop retailer. But many in the industry now say that the aggressive marketing and low prices offered by discount mail-order companies are beginning to threaten the small dealers.
"Most students start on rental instruments," said Denny Senseny, the owner of Senseny Music in Wichita, Kan. "And most grass-roots dealers are willing to do that, but mail order has grown at the expense of full-service dealers."
A half dozen or so mail-order companies compete for a share of the acoustic instrument and market. So far their sales are still small -- about 10 to 15 percent of the market, according to Mr. Majeski. They are mostly more expensive instruments.
Giardinelli Band Instruments Inc., once a renowned New York-based discount store, is now one of two mail-order companies owned by the American Music Group in Liverpool, N.Y. that deal only in acoustic instruments. The other company, LMI of Itasca, Ill. caters to school music programs. According to David Fleming, American's vice president for sales, the two companies have combined sales of about $3 million, he said.
"Mail-order companies are only successful in areas where the local store cannot provide the right instrument or their prices are too high." Mr. Fleming said. He added that the American Music Group also owns seven local music retail stores, opened "because we saw the need, based on the fact that mail order was doing well in those areas."
Nevertheless, many retailers say mail order is beginning to hurt their business. "Customers play 'Watts line roulette,' " said Mr. Senseny, describing what many say is becoming a common phenomenon: Customers go to the local dealer to try out instruments, get information and then call 800-numbers to place an order.
"Mail-order competition is definitely one reason retail stores don't get involved in higher-end instruments," said Bernard Brauns, co-owner of Ingram and Brauns Musik Shoppe in Modesto, Calif., one of the first stores to order the Canadian Brass line. "It's too competitive." Mr. Brauns chose the line because it is not sold by mail.
 
 
VINTAGE GUITARS FOR GROWN-UPS
 Remember the kids in high school who played their guitars -- all day? They've grown up now and are still buying guitars.
"I have a lot of 40-year-olds who now can afford to buy the guitar they wanted when they were 15," said Matt Umanov, who has run Umanov Guitars in New York for the last 22 years. "So, they do."
That is welcome news for the nation's guitar makers. According to the American Music Conference, a nonprofit industry group, sales of all fretted instruments, which includes acoustic and electric guitars, hit $400 million in 1990, almost at their record 1988 levels.
Some of those sales are fueled by a renewed interest in the music of the 1960's. Sales of vintage electric guitars are also increasing, as companies like Gibson Guitar and Fender Inc. re-issue older models.
While sales of electric and acoustic guitars have been growing, "acoustics continue to outpace electrics on the sales floor" according to a survey by Musical Merchandise Review. Retailers also report that custom-built guitars -- a much smaller niche -- are selling well.
Increasingly, the guitar industry is dependent on cheap imports to lift sales. Most of the well-known guitar makers, like the Martin Guitar Company and Gibson, started out as American manufacturers, but now import at least some of their low-end models from Asia. According to the American Music Conference, most guitars sold are now imported. Washburn International Inc., a company that began making guitars around the turn of the century, is now only a distributor. All of its guitars are imported.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Small Travel Magazine Finds World of Readers

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
It may be published in a building that once housed a nursery, standing close to Chuck's Steak and the First Interstate Bank and across from a shopping mall, but Islands magazine takes its readers to the infinitely more alluring locales of the world's exotic and remote islands.
And the magazine's goals are no less romantic. Islands eschews service pieces that counsel readers on where to stay or what airline to fly, instead providing writers' impressions of islands that "give you the sense of being there," said Joan Tapper, the magazine's editor in chief. A recent issue carried features on Prince Edward Island, Canada's smallest province, and islands in the Russian Arctic. 
 Island's ambitions may be big, but its circulation is a mere 171,000, compared with Travel & Leisure's 1.1 million. Indeed, in an era of increasingly large media companies, the 11-year-old bimonthly is emblematic of a handful of small, independent publications that are determined to grow. They are struggling in a particularly perilous economy in which some small publishers have given up and even the Goliaths of the industry, including Hearst and Hachette, have shut down or combined publications.
 
Thriving Enterprise
 Yet Bill Kasch, who bought Islands in 1983, said the once-ailing magazine was now a thriving enterprise, with operating profits of $325,947 last year on revenue of $5.2 million.
Islands faces tough rivals. Not only does it compete against Travel & Leisure, but also Conde Nast Traveler, which has 745,000 subscribers. Publishers at both those magazines said they did not consider Islands, which carried only 504 pages of advertising in 1991, to be competition. Travel & Leisure, for example, carried 1,373 pages of advertising last year at much higher rates.
Still, John Veronis, whose company, Veronis Suhler Associates, acts as an investment banker in the publishing industry, said the magazine had a good editorial and marketing strategy. "It has high renewal rates and is very clearly targeted," he said.
And David Lehmkuhl, a media consultant, said Islands held an audience with strong demographic appeal.
Mendelsohn Media Research Inc. said the magazine's readers had an average household income exceeding $80,000 and a median age of 46 years. Islands' internal research shows that about 60 percent of those readers took a trip abroad last year.
Mr. Kasch said his goal, a difficult one, was to reach a circulation of 250,000 to 500,000 in the next five years.
Islands may never equal the circulation of some broader travel publication because "the magazine's subject matter is more focused than its rivals," Mr. Veronis said. Still, he added, small special-interest publications like Islands can still find profitable niches and can often be more aggressive in raising cover prices than larger rivals. "The person who wants to know is going to pay for the publication," he said.
 
'It Was Real Dicey'
 The story of Islands is not unlike those of other publications built by entrepreneurs. Mr. Kasch, a Wisconsin native who is now 47 years old, became disenchanted with his family's toy business in the early 1980's and moved to Santa Barbara to invest in real estate.
But a chance meeting with David Friston, then the owner of Islands, piqued his interest in the publication. "I thought it would work, but I didn't know anything about the business," Mr. Kasch recalled. "I made projections, but all my sales and circulation figures were wrong. They were much too optimistic."
The magazine ate money. Mr. Kasch took over Islands by assuming its subscription liabilities of about $600,000. (The magazine then had about 40,000 subscribers.) But he found himself investing another $1.4 million from 1983 to 1986. "It was real dicey in 1985 and 1986," he recalled. "I had borrowed more money than I meant, the advertising was not coming and times were tough."
He and Alan Rock, who has handled advertising sales for the magazine since 1983, focused on attracting ads from small car-rental agencies and hotels and sought advertisers in exotic destinations like Tahiti that few other magazines were then chasing.
"It was a typical case of ready, fire, aim," Mr. Kasch said. "I didn't know what I was doing.
Islands did not begin to attract national travel accounts like Hyatt Hotels until 1985. And the magazine has still failed to lure such large tourist-oriented advertisers as Kodak or American Airlines.
Ultimately, however, Islands began to grow, maintaining its editorial strategy of covering islands from those in the highly popular Caribbean to the Spice Islands of Indonesia. In 1987, the magazine managed to earn $3,131 on revenue of $2.5 million.
By 1990, its profits peaked at $518,824 on revenue of $4.9 million, Mr. Kasch said, although they dropped 37 percent the next year because of rising costs.
Islands has no staff writers and gets most of its articles from freelance writers. The magazine does have three editors, in addition to Ms. Tapper, the editor in chief, and each occasionally writes articles.
The magazine has been investing more heavily in writing. Recent issues included an impressionist piece by Jan Morris about travels in Wales. Adam Nicholson has written on the Shiant Islands, three tiny islands held by his father, Nigel Nicholson, author of "Portrait of a Marriage." And Francis Fitzgerald is scheduled to do a piece on the Solomon Islands.
 
What to Do Next?
 The question for Islands is where to go next. Expanding a tightly focused magazine can be difficult because the audience is often limited and many existing readers may resent changes that broaden the publication.
On the other hand, selling a publication like Islands would not necessarily be easy, although Mr. Kasch said he had been approached by potential buyers. None of them, however, were big publishing companies.
For the moment at least, Mr. Kasch seems pleased to remain a publishing island in the heart of Santa Barbara.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Much to Answer For in Iraq

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis provides, in "Who Fed This Caesar?" (column, March 15), substantial evidence that the Reagan and Bush Administrations were instrumental in building Saddam Hussein's military machine since 1982, when Iraq began to show signs of defeat in its war with Iran. Almost right up to the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, Iraq had received secret intelligence, high-technology exports, weapons and economic aid from the United States, despite overwhelming evidence during the last decade of President Hussein's international aggressiveness and atrocious human rights record.
Although it is clear that United States policy toward Iraq was flawed with respect to military and economic aid, it is also important to note that the White House displayed irresponsible behavior on the diplomatic front as well, especially during the months directly preceding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
 A news article last Sept. 25 about the hearings to confirm Robert Gates as Director of Central Intelligence reported that, according to Charles E. Allen, a 32-year C.I.A. veteran, the Bush Administration had been warned as early as January 1990 by the Defense Intelligence Agency, by the military's Central Command, and by the Central Intelligence Agency that Saddam Hussein was very likely considering military action against Kuwait. By July 1990, the intelligence agencies had strong evidence that an invasion was imminent. Mr. Allen stated in his Congressional testimony that these forecasts were ignored by the Bush Administration.
As these details of United States-Iraqi relations continue to surface, it is becoming clear that United States intentions in the Persian Gulf region have been completely self-serving and counterproductive to maintaining peace and promoting human rights.
Indeed, and tragically, the United States is directly or indirectly responsible for much of the recent bloodshed in the gulf region, including, yes, Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Brown;
Players in Familiar Roles as Vote Nears
Brown Spreads Message That the People Must Retake the Nation

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, April 5

 BODY:
From the television studios of Manhattan to the Mall beyond the United States Capitol to a red brick public housing project here, Edmund G. Brown Jr. today spread his message of insurgency, promising voters that as President he would return the country to the people.
At every stop he repeated the theme he has sounded since announcing his candidacy last October: that the Government is in the hands of a corrupt elite that needs to be overtaken. 
 In a scene that was fitting for the former California Governor's portrayal of himself as a born-again populist, Mr. Brown was not permitted to address an abortion-rights rally on the Washington Mall. So he put together a makeshift rally on the sidelines, grabbed a bullhorn and, with the Capitol as the backdrop, implored people to join his crusade.
"The whole point in this election is about democracy," said Mr. Brown, who for the first time since his upset victory in the Connecticut primary two weeks ago, shed his coat and tie and returned to his white turtleneck. "This is a campaign to take it back. Take back our rights. People in Washington don't care."
Asked why people should vote for him in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Brown said, "To overcome the failed and decrepit political leadership that is running the country into the ground."
As he changed from his turtleneck back to his suit on the flight to Buffalo this evening, the candidate spoke of a "newly revitalized insurgent Democratic Party that is building during this campaign," and of "finally achieving a real commitment to revitalizing the national economic and social system."
In advancing his "take back America" message, Mr. Brown pressed on today with his argument that the Democratic front-runner, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, was not fit to be President. "I used to say a scandal a week," he told reporters in Manhattan. "Now, it's a surprise a day."
But Mr. Brown could not escape being confronted with his own set of fresh ethical questions in Sunday newspapers, reports that portrayed him as one of the insiders he rails against.
The Los Angeles Times said that as Governor, Mr. Brown appointed 118 judges from 1979 to 1983 after they or their family members contributed to his campaigns. Those donors made up one-fifth of his judicial nominations in that period. Forty-two of those judges made gifts of $700 or more.
 
On the Defense, He Attacks
 Mr. Brown defended his appointments today, turning reporters' questions into an opportunity to repeat his indictment against the political establishment.
"Look, the problem is the system," he said. "I made my choices based on three factors: quality as determined by the state bar, diversity in terms of philosophy and ethnicity, and third, community service. But I will say this: I really am proud of the judges I appointed. The whole system has to be changed. That is why I am running for President."
The Times said there was "a striking correlation between campaign gifts" and Mr. Brown's appointments to the bench. The newspaper cited several examples, including that of Richard F. Charvat, a lawyer who with his parents, donated $5,750 to Mr. Brown from 1978 to 1980. In 1981 Mr. Brown appointed Mr. Charvat to the Los Angeles Municipal Court.
While most of the judges interviewed said their contributions were not linked to appointments, Mr. Charvat and his father told The Times they felt the contributions were a requirement.
 
Overseas Factory Site
 Mr. Brown also disputed an article in The San Francisco Examiner that said he helped a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Costa Mesa, Calif., search for a factory site in Hong Kong and China in 1989. As a Presidential candidate Mr. Brown has denounced the practice of companies' moving factories overseas where labor is cheaper.
Mr. Brown termed the report "a bunch of baloney," and said he was in Japan seeking investment capital for a Sacramento real estate company.
At the time, Mr. Brown was on the board of the company, ICN Biomedicals Inc., a post for which he was paid $20,000 a year, The Examiner reported. The head of the company, Milan Panic, was a longtime donor to Mr. Brown.
After Mr. Brown's trip to Asia, the company announced that it would begin a joint venture with the Chinese National Medical Corporation to establish a manufacturing center in China, the newspaper said.
 
Questions About Flat Tax
 Campaigning today, Mr. Brown continued to speak in broad terms about corruption in government rather than his programs to change the system. But on television news shows today he was questioned about some of his stands, particularly his support for a 13 percent flat tax on income and a 13 percent value added tax, similar to a national sales tax.
In a debate at WNBC-TV in New York this morning, Mr. Clinton derided the tax as reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's proposals, saying it would benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. "He doesn't tell people the truth," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Brown accused Mr. Clinton of using "funny statistics" to attack his plan.
Referring to Mr. Brown's evolution as a populist, Mr. Clinton talked about "all this born-again business." All that Mr. Brown would concede was that "Bill's got flaws, I've got flaws."
In addition, Mr. Brown found himself on the defensive on the CBS News program "Face The Nation," where he was questioned about his declaration that he wanted the Rev. Jesse Jackson as his Vice President, a move that infuriated Jewish groups. Although he said Mr. Jackson was still his first choice, Mr. Brown backed down slightly, saying, "Look, nothing is written in stone, but I will tell you that I believe he would make an excellent candidate."
 
'Pro Choice All the Way'
 Mr. Brown was also questioned about a statement years ago that he opposed abortion. But at the rally in Washington today he declared himself "pro choice all the way."
From the rally Mr. Brown flew to Buffalo, where he renewed his attack on Washington before a cheering crowd at a United Automobile Worker's hall. Railing against the "failed corrupt status quo," Mr. Brown said: "Down in Washington they are so busy trying to cover up for their bouncing checks and their midnight pay raises."
In his last words to the labor rally here, Mr. Brown repeated the theme he espoused today and throughout his campaign. "There's nothing we can't do if we pull together and replace the failed leadership in Washington," he said. "Send them a message, New York, on April 7. Let's turn this country around."

HEADLINE: Sam Walton Is Dead At 74; the Founder Of Wal-Mart Stores

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the most successful merchant of his time, died yesterday at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Hospital in Little Rock. He was 74 years old.
A spokeswoman at the hospital, where Mr. Walton was admitted a week ago, said that the cause of death was being withheld at the request of the family. Mr. Walton had long struggled against two types of cancer, hairy-cell leukemia, which weakens the immune system by attacking white blood cells, and a bone-marrow cancer called multiple myeloma. 
 Mr. Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962 in Rogers, Ark., a small city in the Ozarks. By 1991 the chain passed Sears, Roebuck & Company to become the nation's largest retailer. On April 1, it had 1,735 stores in 42 states, as well as 2 in Mexico. Mr. Walton assembled a management team that will carry on, and the company said yesterday that it foresaw no changes in corporate policy or control.
Mr. Walton created Wal-Mart with the idea, once mocked by retailers, that large discount stores could thrive in small towns and rural areas. A gifted, homespun orator, he entranced legions of low-paid loyal workers with a simple refrain -- help customers, cut costs and share profits. Wal-Mart's headquarters, in contrast to the 110-story Sears Tower on the edge of Chicago's Loop, remain a box-like warehouse and general office in Bentonville, Ark.
Wal-Mart began to sell its stock to the public in 1970. As Wall Street discovered the company's unbroken pattern of high profits and fast growth, the price of Wal-Mart's stock began to soar in the late 1970's, and the Walton family's wealth with it.
The family fortune includes $23 billion in Wal-Mart stock alone, which provides more than $90 million in annual dividends. The Waltons also own seven banks in Arkansas and Oklahoma and five newspapers in Arkansas. While the Walton name is hardly as well known as Rockefeller or Getty, the family is believed to be the nation's wealthiest.
Investors in Wal-Mart stock also enjoyed a bounty. From 1981 to 1991, the company's shares produced an astounding average yearly return of 46.8 percent, including dividends and increases in the share price. A $3,000 investment in Wal-Mart stock in January 1981 was worth $105,600 in January 1991, the company calculated. By last week, it would have been worth $170,000.
 
High Volume, Low Prices
 Wal-Mart's rapid growth, built on high sales volume and low prices, brought financial ruin to hundreds of small-town merchants on Main Streets across the South and Midwest. And as Wal-Mart's reputation grew, Mr. Walton often faced bitter resistance in communities where he planned to open stores. Yet, his promises to attract shoppers, assist charities and provide jobs almost always prevailed.
Mr. Walton always worked hard at shaping his work force, using cheers, rap songs and payment policies to urge employees to be frugal in their jobs and friendly toward customers. Bonuses were paid to all employees in stores where stealing and other inventory losses were kept below 2 percent of sales. Scholarships were established at colleges in names of employees who crafted better ways to handle merchandise.
Mr. Walton set the tone, often beginning his mornings at 4:30 and working long days from a cramped, spartan office in Bentonville, in northwestern Arkansas.
"This is a man who was at work at 4:30 in the morning, had warmth and charm throughout the day, an interest in his customers, and who treated his associates well as persons, not just as clerks and salespeople," said Walter F. Loeb, a retailing consultant who first met Mr. Walton in 1976. Mr. Walton always referred to Wal-Mart employees as his associates.
 
Born in Oklahoma, Raised in Missouri
 Samuel Moore Walton was born in Kingfisher, Okla., on March 29, 1918, the first child of a rural banker, Thomas Walton, and Nancy Lee Walton. An Eagle Scout, quarterback of the state champion football team and student council president, Mr. Walton was voted "most versatile boy" by his graduating classmates at Hickman High School in Columbia, Mo., in 1936.
Working his way through the University of Missouri at Columbia, he delivered newspapers, waited on tables and clerked at a five-and-dime store while taking classes in the Army's Reserve Officer Training Corps and serving as president of the senior class and the honor society. After graduating in 1940 with a degree in economics, he worked briefly as a management trainee in Des Moines with the J. C. Penney Company, then a small-town retailer with 1,500 stores.
During World War II, Mr. Walton served as an Army captain, working in intelligence. In 1945, he acquired his first store, a Ben Franklin franchise in Newport, Ark., with a $25,000 loan from his father-in-law, Leland Stanford Robson, a small-town Oklahoma banker. By the early 1960's, Mr. Walton and his brother, James L. (Bud) Walton, owned 15 Ben Franklin franchises.
 
Striking Out on His Own
 In 1962, when Ben Franklin executives in Chicago turned down his plan to open bigger stores in rural areas, with discount prices and smaller profit margins, he began to form what eventually became Wal-Mart Stores.
In a 1989 interview with Financial World magazine, Mr. Walton said of his disagreement with Ben Franklin, "They didn't want to give on their end to the degree that it took for the prices to be as low as I felt they should be." Operating costs at Ben Franklin were as much as 25 percent of sales, but Mr. Walton thought they could be much lower.
He said: "If they had been able to sell to me on a 12 percent range, I probably would not have put together the organization that we did. Aren't I glad they didn't accept the idea, because I was forced to build our own team and program?"
 
One Temporary Retirement
 Mr. Walton remained the chairman of Wal-Mart until his death. He relinquished the titles of president and chief executive in 1988. He retired briefly from the chief executive's post in 1974 but reclaimed it two years later.
Last month, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, and hailed as "an American original" who "embodies the entrepreneurial spirit and epitomizes the American dream."
Rejecting occasional advice to sell part of his family's shares and spread his investments, Mr. Walton kept 39 percent of Wal-Mart's common stock under family control in five trusts he established in 1954. Since it became a public company, Wal-Mart has issued more than 1.1 billion shares of common stock.
The five Walton trusts hold Wal-Mart stock collectively valued at $23 billion, about $4.6 billion apiece, at current market value. Annual dividends on the family stock amount to $93.5 million.
 
Hated Distinction As Wealthiest
 In 1985, Forbes magazine declared Mr. Walton the wealthiest person in America, a distinction Mr. Walton often said he hated. "All that hullabaloo about somebody's net worth is just stupid, and it's made my life a lot more complex and difficult," he told Fortune magazine. Although he disliked doing it, he autographed dollar bills for customers and employees and smiled for their cameras.
Mr. Walton displayed scant interest in the social whirl of the fashionably rich. And on business trips that often included visits to six Wal-Mart stores in a day, he rented subcompact cars and spent nights at budget motels, or in the homes of store managers. He was notoriously absent-minded. Driving once, he was distracted by counting cars in a competing store's parking lot and rammed into the rear of a Wal-Mart tractor trailer. No one was hurt.
And Mr. Walton had his business failures. Wal-Mart's ventures into selling discount drugs, do-it-yourself building supplies and arts-and-craft supplies were all abandoned after mixed results. His huge Hypermart stores, which have sold groceries along with Wal-Mart's traditional fare since 1988 under a roof that could cover five football fields, have apparently proved too large to manage. The company is trying a similar formula in scaled-down stores called Supercenters.
On occasion, Mr. Walton sparred with labor unions that tried unsuccessfully to organize clerks in his stores or drivers in his vast trucking fleet. But he mostly avoided labor clashes by placing stores and distribution centers away from cities where unions were powerful.
He also installed profit-sharing plans that enabled hundreds of workers with low wages to retire with comfortable, and occasionally lucrative, pensions because of the rising price of Wal-Mart stock. A cashier who retired in 1989 with $262,000 in retirement benefits, Shirley Cox, earned $7.10 an hour on her last day of work after 24 years with the company, said Vance H. Trimble, author of an unauthorized biography of Mr. Walton published by Dutton in 1990.
Mr. Walton was an avid hunter, particularly of quail, and a frequent patron of local restaurants in Bentonville. He was an active worshiper at the First Presbyterian Church, where he once taught Sunday school. In recent years he drove a red 1985 Ford pickup. Bentonville, which now has a population of 10,825, named the local junior high school after him in 1983 and the local day-care center for his wife, Helen Robson Walton.
Mrs. Walton, 72, controls the trust she shared with Mr. Walton. The other four trusts are controlled by the Waltons' four children: S. Robson, 47, one of three Wal-Mart vice chairmen; John T., 45, owner of a boat-making business in San Diego; James C., 43, president of Walton Enterprises, which includes family-controlled newspapers, banks and other businesses and charitable activities, and Alice, 42, who heads a private investment firm, the Llama Company, in Fayetteville, Ark.
Mr. Walton's brother, James, 70, owns more than 20 million shares and is a senior vice president and director of Wal-Mart. Mr. Walton is also survived by 10 grandchildren.
 
Ideas That Built The No. 1 Retailer
 One of Wal-Mart's biggest strengths was the streamlined, sophisticated logistics it created for replenishing products as its universe of stores expanded, management advisers at the Boston Consulting Group said.
In the early years, Mr. Walton insisted on building stores no more than a day's drive from distribution centers. Now, Wal-Mart fills merchandise orders within two days, compared with an average of two weeks among its rivals.
The company has 19 cavernous distribution centers, with an average of six miles of rack space in each; nearly 2,000 trucks; a satellite video system for relaying sales trends to executives, buyers, store managers and clerks, and a fleet of aircraft -- purchased secondhand -- to ferry managers across the Wal-Mart system.
Eighty-five percent of the merchandise Wal-Mart sells is shipped from its distribution centers, compared with 50 percent at its biggest competitor in discounting, Kmart, which relies on suppliers to ship the rest of its merchandise.
 
Upsetting Conventional Wisdom
 In the March-April 1992 issue of The Harvard Business Review, three officers at Boston Consulting -- George Stalk, Philip Evans and Lawrence E. Shulman -- said Mr. Walton had turned on its ear the conventional retailing approach of having senior executives make purchasing and stocking decisions.
"Instead of the retailer pushing products into the system, customers 'pull' products when and where they need them," they wrote. "The job of senior management at Wal-Mart, then, is not to tell individual store managers what to do but to create an environment where they can learn from the market -- and from each other."
Some executives at the company and consultants said Mr. Walton was a fair-minded leader, but hard-driving and demanding. "He was a man who extracted and expected a great deal from others because he himself always gave 100 percent," said Kurt Barnard, an industry consultant.
 
Unauthorized Biography
 Mr. Trimble wrote that Ron Loveless, former head of the company's wholesale-club division, retired in 1986 at age 42 partly because of job stress.
"If you don't produce, you'll be gone," Mr. Loveless, who did not talk to Mr. Trimble, told The Arkansas Gazette in 1986. David D. Glass, who succeeded Mr. Walton as chief executive in 1988, suffered a heart attack a year after being promoted to president in 1984.
With the economy in recession during 1991, Wal-Mart continued to flex its muscle. Although Mr. Walton was slowed by cancer treatments, he continued piloting himself, often alone, in a twin-engine Cessna to visit dozens of stores each week as he pursued plans to push Wal-Mart's yearly sales beyond $100 billion by the turn of the century.
The company opened more than 150 new and mostly bigger stores, expanded into Northeastern states and accelerated openings of its wholesale subsidiary, known as Sam's Clubs, which in 1991 increased sales by 43 percent, to more than $9 billion. Over all, Wal-Mart's sales rose 35 percent last year, to $43.9 billion, and profits jumped by 24.8 percent, to $1.6 billion.
 
Delighted Crowds As a Showman
 Mr. Walton's enthusiasm knew few bounds. In 1983, after Wal-Mart's profits exceeded expectations, he kept a promise to employees and donned a grass skirt to dance a hula on Wall Street.
At the Wal-Mart annual stockholders' meeting each spring, the charismatic Mr. Walton played barker, preacher, cheerleader and company visionary to ever-larger crowds. On June 7, 1991, more than 10,000 people filled the basketball arena at the University of Arkansas, 30 miles south of Bentonville, for what was Mr. Walton's last performance in a role that began that day at 7 A.M. and continued until noon.
"A lot of believers are here today," he shouted to an approving roar from the crowd of stockholders, executives of Wal-Mart suppliers, and more than 2,000 employees who had traveled to Fayetteville at company expense from stores across the country. Later that day, Sam and Helen Walton held their annual barbecue for the employees on the lawn of the 5,500-square-foot house they built in Bentonville and lived in since 1959.
 
The Spirit of Prosperity
 Mr. Walton orchestrated the annual meeting to underscore his managerial doctrine that the close links among suppliers, shareholders and employees determined Wal-Mart's prosperity.
During the meeting, Mr. Walton urged each of these three constituent groups to stand separately as applause filled the arena. Then he called on employees who served in the military during the Persian Gulf conflict to stand. "Good God, let's get the lights on them," he commanded. Among Wal-Mart's 380,000 employees at the time, 582 reservists and members of the National Guard were activated for the fighting.
A Wal-Mart executive announced that 80,000 jobs had been created in the United States by Wal-Mart merchandise orders since Mr. Walton's "Buy America" campaign began in 1985. The reigning Miss U.S.A., Kelli McCarty, the daughter of a Wal-Mart manager, smiled, posed and exchanged a "high five" with Mr. Walton. Paul Harvey, the radio commentator whose sponsors included Wal-Mart, proclaimed on stage that the Wal-Mart way was "something better than capitalism: enlightened consumerism." Then the entertainer Lee Greenwood sang "God Bless the U.S.A."
 
'High Expectations Are the Key'
 "There is nothing like it in the annals of retailing," Mr. Walton shouted as the spectacle unfolded. "High expectations are the key to everything." When Mr. Glass announced that the value of all Wal-Mart shares had increased to $45 billion from $150 million in 1976, Mr. Walton interrupted him.
"And it's only just begun," he declared. "Do you believe it? Let me hear you say it!" And a chant immediately filled the hot auditorium: "And it's only just begun."
Industry analysts say Mr. Walton gained the edge in sales over other retailers by taking risks, adopting approaches that worked for competitors and getting the most from his employees. In 1988, for instance, Wal-Mart averaged $103,000 in sales for each employee, while Kmart averaged $82,000.
In the 1989 interview with Financial World, which named him chief executive of the decade, Mr. Walton said: "I probably have traveled and walked into more variety stores than anybody in America. I am just trying to get ideas, any kind of ideas that will help our company. Most of us don't invent ideas. We take the best ideas from someone else."
The family has planned a private funeral in Bentonville.

HEADLINE: Iran Strafes Rebels in Iraq; Jet Downed

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Iranian jets bombed an Iranian rebel base in Iraq today in the most serious attack by Iran since a cease-fire ended fighting between the two countries in 1988.
Iraq said that its artillery had shot down one of eight Iranian F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers and that the pilot and navigator had been captured. A senior Pentagon official monitoring intelligence reports confirmed the Iranian attack and the loss of one plane, but could not confirm any other details. 
 The official Iranian press agency said the raid was in response to an attack on Saturday by guerrillas of the People's Mujahedeen, an Iranian rebel group, on two Kurdish settlements in Iran where "several people were killed, injured and kidnapped."
 
Conflict With Hard-Liners
 Iraq's state-operated Baghdad radio immediately denounced the raid, and Iranian rebel leaders in Iraq accused President Hashemi Rafsanjani of trying to whip up public support before Iranian elections on Friday.
Mr. Rafsanjani is seeking to oust fundamentalists in Parliament who oppose his efforts to open the country to the West and institute a free-market economy.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lieut. Col. Kerry Gershaneck of the Marines, said there were no indications that Iraq had ordered aircraft to intercept the Iranian fighter jets. Under terms of the cease-fire imposed by the American-led allies after Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war last year, Baghdad may not fly its fixed-wing aircraft.
Although much of its military was destroyed in the gulf war, Iraq still has surface-to-air missiles and formidable batteries of anti-aircraft guns.
 
Journalists Get a Tour
 The rebels said the attack had killed a technician and wounded several others when the jets fired rockets and showered cluster bombs on the Ashraf base, 50 miles inside Iraq and 40 miles north of Baghdad, The Associated Press reported.
Iraqi and rebel anti-aircraft gunners both said they had downed the F-4, which crashed in an irrigation channel nine miles from the base. The rebels showed foreign journalists bomb damage at Ashraf and the still-burning wreckage of the F-4 Phantom, its wings perforated by bullets, Reuters reported.
The air strike was the first significant clash involving the two countries since April 1991, when Iran's Revolutionary Guards crossed the border during the Shiite and Kurdish rebellions after the Persian Gulf war and fought Iraqi troops and Iranian rebels.
In retaliation for the air raid, exiled opponents of the Iranian Government invaded Iranian diplomatic missions in New York, Ottawa and seven nations of Western Europe today, seizing hostages and wrecking offices in apparently coordinated attacks.
Iran and Iraq have never formally ended their eight-year war, which left an estimated one million people dead, and have engaged in an increasingly strident propaganda war. Teheran has accused President Saddam Hussein of Iraq of backing the Iranian rebels, while Baghdad has criticized Iran for supporting Shiite Muslim and Kurdish insurgencies in Iraq.
Baghdad radio today warned of the "serious consequences" of the raid, and the Iraqi News Agency said Mr. Hussein met with his senior military commanders after the air strike.
But an Iranian military official who requested anonymity said Iran "had succeeded in showing its enemies" that no target was out of reach. "Baghdad is not so far," said the official. "The army may once in a while be put in a position where it has to show its teeth."
The Iranians have about 60 American-made F-4 fighter-bombers, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, but only about 20 are believed to be in working order. The rest have been grounded because of a lack of spare parts, which the United States cut off in 1979.
Iranian officials have frequently stated their desire to see Mr. Hussein replaced by a "democratically elected government." This policy, they say, legitimizes Iran's financial and logistical support for the Shiites and for the new Islamic Party of Kurdistan, which has an office in Teheran.

HEADLINE: March Reflects the Growing Political Clout of a Movement

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The march on Washington yesterday reflected how much the political world has changed since the Supreme Court began restricting abortion rights. It is a change that many political professionals refer to simply as, "Post-Webster."
The 1989 Supreme Court decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, which gave states new latitude to restrict abortion, reopened the political struggle over the issue. The opponents of legalized abortion were organized and active in politics for many years. "Post-Webster," the supporters of abortion rights began to mobilize and join their opposition on the field, no longer counting on the courts to protect their cause.
 
A Political Message
 Yesterday's march, its organizers hoped, was a powerful show of strength for the abortion-rights movement as the nation heads into the 1992 elections. "There is a message, and it's a political one," said Kate Michelman, the head of the National Abortion Rights Action League. "We're not talking to the Court; we don't trust the Court. We're talking to George Bush and every officeholder and every office seeker." 
 The abortion rights movement scored some early electoral victories in 1989, notably in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, but the issue was overshadowed by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the sagging economy in 1990 and 1991. Still, candidates increasingly see support for abortion rights as a net political plus; it was noteworthy that both Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California found time to march in Washington yesterday, two days before the New York primary.
Moreover, several factors could highlight the abortion issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign. The Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on a case from Pennsylvania that could be a vehicle for overturning or severely curtailing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. At the same time, many Republicans who support abortion rights are hoping to push for a change in their party's fiercely anti-abortion platform at the party's national convention in Houston.
 
Debate Also in State Races
 President Bush remains adamantly anti-abortion, and many political professionals do not expect him to change; he already shifted his stance once on the issue in the early 1980's, when he adopted a more hard-line position. Thus, it is likely voters will be offered a clear partisan difference on the issue this fall, since the Democrats are virtually certain to produce a nominee who supports abortion rights.
Abortion-rights supporters will also be paying close attention to Congress, since they are pushing for a bill they call the Freedom of Choice Act, legislation that would codify a Federal right to choose abortion. And since the battle over abortion law is increasingly waged in the states, the issue is likely to be joined in numerous legislative and gubernatorial races as well.
In such a climate, where both sides are struggling to show that they represent the true majority on the issue, muscle-flexing counts. This explains the emphasis on marches such as yesterday's. And it explains the euphoria among abortion-rights supporters over the turnout. "This was an extraordinarily important political statement today," Ms. Michelman said, "And the politicians better be listening."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Uneasy New York -- Assessment;
Fiery Primary Could Propel Clinton Toward the Nomination, or Burn Him

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Almost no one expected this to be an ordinary election year. There was too much anger in the public opinion polls, too much cynicism toward the Government, too much discontent with the way things are. Now, on the eve of the New York primary, the Democrats are taking the full measure of the rough, conflicted and unpredictable politics of 1992.
The unrest can be heard in the voices of New Yorkers who talk in the same breath of their disgust with the politicians and their yearning for a brokered convention, in which politicians would negotiate to choose a nominee. It is there in the re-emergence of a Jesse Jackson, an Edmund G. Brown Jr. and a Patrick J. Caddell, impresarios of discontent sensing the energies of the time. 
 It is there in Paul E. Tsongas's dance on the sidelines, and in the yearnings among some Democrats for a white knight, although few can agree on just who that knight would be. And it is there, most of all, in Gov. Bill Clinton's strange political journey, which seems destined on some days for the nomination and on other days for disaster. The next phase of his journey will be decided, tomorrow, by the voters of New York.
 
Volatile Chemistry
 In a debate yesterday on WNBC-TV, Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, and Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, squared off on a set of issues that have produced much of the volatile chemistry of this race. Mr. Clinton, reaching for the economic populism that served him well in other parts of the country, hammered Mr. Brown for his support of a flat tax to replace the progressive income tax, asserting that it would aid the rich, hurt the poor and imperil the Social Security system.
Mr. Brown pressed his attack on Mr. Clinton as a tribune of the status quo and a political system that is inherently corrupt. The animosity of the past two weeks was on full display. "How dare you call me the prince of sleaze?" Mr. Clinton demanded at one point.
The debate highlighted, as well, the racial and ethnic land mines of this primary campaign, as Mr. Brown defended his preference for the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a running mate. That position has generated considerable criticism in recent days from Jewish leaders, who recall Mr. Jackson's 1984 characterization of the city as "Hymietown."
"I was up in Harlem yesterday, and I saw the faces of despair," said Mr. Brown, who is competing vigorously with Mr. Clinton for the black voters of New York. "I see the Rev. Jackson as a powerful, inspirational leader that could bring some of these people back who are so alienated."
Mr. Clinton was also forced once again to deal with questions about his draft status during the Vietnam War following the revelation that he received a draft notice in 1969. He did not serve in the military.
 
Turning a Corner?
 Clinton campaign officials, who seemed profoundly rattled 10 days ago as they landed in New York after their loss in Connecticut, are now projecting an air of guarded optimism. "It turned a corner earlier in the week, and each poll is looking up, " said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, who declined to furnish details of the campaign's nightly tracking. "I think we created some momentum and it's continuing."
Though New York is not the only state with a primary tomorrow -- Kansas and Wisconsin will also vote -- this state will largely determine Mr. Clinton's fate. If he wins here, he will be back on course to the nomination, which many Democratic leaders thought he had virtually wrapped up after he defeated Mr. Tsongas in Michigan and Illinois.
He will still face considerable jitters from Democratic officeholders and political professionals, so long as the polls show that much of the electorate has doubts and reservations about his character. Anxieties are particularly high on Capitol Hill, where incumbent Democrats are perennially worried about a drag from their Presidential ticket and where they now, in addition, fear the wrath of an anti-incumbent year. But the steady accretion of delegates and primary victories would make Mr. Clinton hard to stop, many Democrats agree.
Ahead lie the Virginia caucuses on April 11-13, followed by the Pennsylvania primary on April 28. The results in New York, many Democrats say, will be the biggest factor in the Pennsylvania campaign, although James Carville, the Clinton strategist, said, "I know enough about Pennsylvania to know you can't go in there and presume anything."
Mr. Carville has run three previous statewide campaigns in Pennsylvania, two for Gov. Robert P. Casey and one for Senator Harris Wofford, who scored an upset victory over former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last year.
If Mr. Clinton loses in New York, it will almost certainly reopen the talk of other candidates entering the race and the possibility of a brokered convention. "His loss would create a vacuum," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. "It's not obvious that someone will step into the vacuum, but Clinton would lose a lot of control at that stage."
Mr. Tsongas continues to flirt with a re-entry. He said yesterday on the ABC News program "This Week" that he would make his decision on the basis of New York's results, and would have announcement on Wednesday. Still, one senior Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said dryly, "He did a lot of losing, and people noticed it."
Many voters seem open to brand new candidacies; two-thirds of the likely Democratic primary voters in last week's national New York Times/CBS News Poll said they wished they had other candidates from which to choose. But the realpolitik of producing those new options, many Democrats worry, would be far less appealing.
 
Brokered Convention
 A new candidate entering the race after New York would have two days to get on the ballot in New Jersey; the filing deadline there is 4 P.M. Thursday. But the candidate would not be able to make the ballot in California, where the deadline passed last Saturday, and where by midweek counties will begin printing millions of ballots, according to the Secretary of State's office in Sacramento. The filing deadlines have passed for every other primary, according to the Democratic National Committee.
This means, Democrats say, that a new candidate would essentially have to be the creation of a brokered convention. Ordinarily, a candidate emerges from the primary season with a nominating majority, or close to it. The last time a candidate required more than one convention ballot to win the nomination was 1952, when Adlai E. Stevenson prevailed on the third ballot.
The party's 772 superdelegates -- composed of party officials, members of Congress and other elected officials -- would play a key role in this. Herein lies the concern of many Democrats about this process in a year when anger at political insiders is running high. One Democrat on Capitol Hill said, "People knew darn well that the last thing people would stand for was a bunch of Congressional superdelegates saying, 'Here's your nominee.' "
Phil Angelides, the Democratic chairman in California, said, "It would take a very compelling set of circumstances and a very compelling personality and a very compelling moment to produce a nominee out of a brokered convention" without "ever having been subjected to the voters' judgment or the level of scrutiny to which any other nominee has been subjected."
Clinton campaign officials brush aside all this talk. They cling to the hope that New York will render such questions moot, although they try not to project the front-runner's arrogance that can prove dangerous in this political climate. It has been, after all, that kind of year.

HEADLINE: In British Campaign, Too, Many Voters Ask: Why Don't Things Get Better?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 5

 BODY:
Mired in the second severe recession in nearly 13 years of Government by Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives, British voters seem to be in a mood to teach them a lesson in the general election on Thursday.
With the opposition Labor Party two to six points ahead of the Conservatives in the latest polls, the only question seems to be how many of the 368 seats that they now hold the Conservatives are going to lose to Labor or to the smaller Liberal Democrats. 
 Both Mr. Major and Labor's leader, Neil Kinnock, pronounced themselves certain of victory in television and radio interviews today.
 
One 'Confident,' One 'Certain'
 "I am confident we will secure a majority," Mr. Kinnock said on BBC radio, promising once again that if Labor wins, "We won't spend more than we can afford," as the Conservatives charge Labor will do.
After polls earlier last week showed Labor surging into the lead, British stock prices and the value of the pound went reeling. The Times of London reported on Saturday that some senior executives were taking bonus payments and salaries in advance or in gold to avoid the higher taxes that they will face if Labor wins.
Mr. Major also tried to reassure his supporters, saying on BBC television today, "I'm absolutely certain we are going to win, and with a sure overall majority." Once again, he denied Labor's charges that the Government had starved public services to cut taxes for the better-off.
But after months of invective about the past failures of both parties, squabbles about tax figures, polls -- and even polls of polls, the electorate seems fed up, not only with the Government but with politicians in general.
"You're the best of a bad lot," Gertrude L. Wills, a shopper in Highgate, told a Conservative canvasser there last week. But watching Mr. Major gladhanding visitors at a home-furnishings exhibition in Earls Court last Thursday, Eva Adnett, a 71-year-old pensioner from Uxbridge, said, "I've voted Conservative all my life, but I'll be voting Labor this time. They're going to increase pension benefits, and I'm going to be looking after myself."
Surveys say the voters are so fragmented and unconvinced about the ability of either Labor or the Conservatives to lead the country out of its problems that no party might win the 326 seats needed for an overall majority in the new 651-member House of Commons. If this happens, there could be months of weak government and instability, with another election almost surely following by autumn, as it did the last time there was a "hung Parliament," in 1974.
As in the United States, foreign policy has hardly been an issue here.
 
Differing Only on Taxes
 Labor's past policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament does not seem to bother the people much, now that the cold war is over. Mr. Kinnock acknowledges, as he did in a television interview Thursday night, that Labor's past opposition to nuclear weapons and to British membership in the European Community may have been "an error of judgment," saying he and his party have moved on to more pragmatic attitudes.
Not even European economic and political unification has played a role, though that was the issue that brought down Mr. Major's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, in November 1990 after she rejected the idea of a federal Europe with a single central bank and a single currency supplanting the pound.
The fact is that there is not a great deal of difference between the two main parties on most issues anymore, except on how much tax the top earners should pay.
Asked on Friday afternoon what his vision of Europe was, for example, Mr. Kinnock sounded almost Thatcherite. "The interests of Europe and of individual countries within it would not be served best by the development of any form of the United States of Europe," he said.
Rather, Mr. Major has taken a beating during this campaign mostly on popular dissatisfaction with the Conservative domestic economic policies that Mrs. Thatcher stood for so vividly.
 
Are the Rich Getting Richer?
 The "poll tax," a per-capita charge for local government services that she introduced in 1988 and 1989, aroused the most dissatisfaction, since rich and poor paid the same amount and payments soared. Mr. Major abandoned the poll tax last year for a system based partly on property values and partly on income, but it will not go into effect until next April if he wins.
"It went wrong in practice," Mr. Major acknowledged today, but he has refused to say the Tories are sorry they introduced it.
Many British voters seem to feel that the rich got richer while public services were left to deteriorate, and that it is time for a shift back from private benefit toward the common weal.
But despite reservations about the Government's performance over the past 13 years, many Conservative voters who now say they will vote for the Liberal Democrats may not do so.
 
Then, There's the 3d Party
 The Liberal Democrats' leader, Paddy Ashdown, has offered to form a coalition Government with either of the other two parties if there is no majority on April 9, but only if the coalition party agrees to support a change in the electoral system to proportional representation. This would give his party, reorganized and renamed in 1988, many more than the 22 seats it won in the last elections, when it had nearly 23 percent of the vote. The Liberal Democrats' stand to win nearly as many votes this year, according to the polls.
Mr. Major has ruled out any change. "There are no circumstances in which I will introduce proportional representation," he said Thursday. Mr. Kinnock has promised only a study of the question, but his party supports proportional voting for the Scottish Parliament that it proposes for local affairs.
The voting system and Scotland's status are both huge constitutional issues. The Scottish National Party is campaigning for secession of Scotland and separate membership in the European Community, an idea derided by both Mr. Major and Mr. Kinnock, whose party now holds most of the Scottish seats in the House of Commons.
Again and again, the 49-year-old Mr. Major and his team have warned against bringing back the chaotic era between 1974 and 1979 when Labor was last in power and strikes by militant unions paralyzed the economy. But that was so long ago that younger voters cannot even dimly remember what it was like.
The Conservatives also tried to scare voters into believing that Labor would dismantle British defenses, a fear that made the party unelectable, in Mr. Kinnock's own words, in the last national vote five years ago. But now, with the cold war over and the Soviet Union a thing of the past, few voters seem to care.
What they do care about, according to all the surveys, are education, the National Health Service and public transport: they seem to think that all three have been allowed to deteriorate because of the Tory philosophy of the less government spending the better.
Thus many voters are undeterred by the tax consequences of Labor's promise to bring about a modest redistribution of wealth, from rich to poor and from private to public hands. Labor has pledged to increase taxes on the top 15 percent of earners (over 21,060, or $36,225, a year), to a maximum marginal rate of 59 percent on incomes over 40,000 ($68,800), but Mr. Kinnock repeated today that there would be no further increases if he won.
 
The Challenger
 Asked a couple of days ago about his fitness to be Prime Minister, Mr. Kinnock, wearing an unproleterian double-breasted dark suit, was perhaps too aggressive in replying: "Apart from a slight cough," he said at a news conference, "it is damn-near perfect." Such cockiness could backfire. And, according to Robert M. Worcester, chairman of the MORI polling organization, Labor's strong showing in opinion surveys could give some voters second thoughts about switching from the Conservatives when they get to the polling booths on Thursday.
But Mr. Kinnock has lost the defensiveness that the party's leader, the son of a Welsh coal miner, showed during a visit to the United States in March 1987, just before his last try at unseating Mrs. Thatcher.
Then, he went to Washington to try to persuade President Ronald Reagan that Labor's policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament would not harm NATO. The White House answered with a blast, saying Labor's position would undermine United States negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Now, asked about his relationship with the United States, Mr. Kinnock says, simply, "It's fine."
But he makes little secret of the fact that he would be delighted if a Democrat defeated President Bush in November. The last time British and American national elections were held in the same year was 1964, when both the Democrats and Labor won.

HEADLINE: At Caterpillar, the Deadline Is Now

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 5

 BODY:
The na tion's most bitter labor dispute between Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of construction equipment, and the United Automobile Workers, one of the country's strongest unions -- reaches a crossroads at 7:30 A.M. Monday, the deadline the company has set for the 12,600 striking workers to either return to work or be permanently replaced.
What the workers decide, after more than five months on strike, is certain to have a profound impact on the future of the U.A.W., which has 900,000 members, and the host of companies for whom its members work. 
 Estimates here on how many Caterpillar workers will return to work run from 10 percent to 20 percent, not enough to break the strike, perhaps, but sufficient to put a noticeable dent in union solidarity. Feelings run high, and union officials have been publicly appealing to their members to abstain from violence.
Both the union and Caterpillar, which is based here and is the largest private employer in Illinois, have been taking a hard line over wages and health benefits, among other issues. While other companies in recent years have hired non-union replacements for strikers -- Greyhound, Eastern Airlines, Phelps-Dodge -- no company has ever tried to oust a union as powerful as the U.A.W.
The average age of the strikers at Caterpillar is 44 years, with an average job tenure of 22.5 years. And most of these workers have teen-age or college-age children. If they forfeit their jobs, these men and women realize there are few other places in this recession-ravaged Midwest where they can earn annual salaries that average $35,000. So the choice of walking or crossing the picket line Monday morning is deeply troublesome.
"This is the hardest decision I've had to make," said Alvin C. Oglesby, a 46-year-old quality-control tester who has worked at Caterpillar for 19 years. "I had back surgery two years ago and who else is going to have me? I have a son in the Marines and a daughter who is a senior in high school. This puts a big question mark on the issue of whether she can go to college."
For the moment, Mr. Oglesby said, he has decided not to go back to Caterpillar Monday morning. "But a month from now, I may feel differently," he said.
Richard L. Thomas, a 40-year-old laborer who has worked for Caterpillar for 19 years, said he had five children and two grandchildren but would not return to the plant because the issue was more important than money.
"They are showing us that they have no respect for the union worker," Mr. Thomas said of Caterpillar. "They talk about being the giant international company. Well, we are the ones who helped make them all of that. And we deserve to have a package that shows that they respect us."
Holding the line on wages and benefits, the company said, is critical to Caterpillar's ability to compete globally. Exports account for a full 59 percent of the company's production, making it second in that category only to the Boeing Company amongthe nation's industrial exporters.
"We had $3.7 billion in exports last year, and we have 19,500 of our jobs that are depending on our ability to export," said Gerald S. Flaherty, a group president at Caterpillar. "We are very dependent on our ability to be competitive on a worldwide basis."
Sean P. McAlinden, an automotive economist at the University of Michigan, observed: "This issue will have enormous consequences for the company, for the union and beyond. The U.A.W. cannot afford to be broken in this matter, because the auto companies are watching closely and they will take their cues from this. And the union realizes that General Motors is watching and may attempt the same thing next."
 
'Pattern Bargaining' May Fade
 A loss here by the union may also be a harbinger of the end of a practice known as pattern bargaining, in which unions use an agreement with one company as a model for other companies in the same industry. These arrangements, which were once common in several industries, including steel and tires, have begun to unravel in the last decade.
The Big Three domestic auto makers, which employ more than 400,000 U.A.W. members, are eager to tailor contracts based on their individual needs rather than in industrywide pattern. Success by Caterpillar would be likely to stiffen the auto makers' resolve.
The decision faced by the U.A.W. members at Caterpillar is made more difficult by the fact that many other workers -- unemployed and otherwise -- are waiting eagerly to seize their jobs.
The company and the state Labor Department's unemployment office say their phones have been ringing almost constantly since the company announced on Wednesday that it would hire replacement workers. The company says that it will begin hiring these new workers on Monday, and that the process of filling all the positions may take several weeks.
 
The Terms on the Table
 Caterpillar has maintained that its contract offer will raise wages by about 13 percent over three years and will cover workers' health care in full if they use specified hospitals and doctors.
But the union says that the company's proposed contract would cause union members to lose some benefits in health care and that the company can afford to be more generous in its labor payouts, which it says account for only a sixth of Caterpillar's costs. The union has also sought to gain a wage and benefits package that calls for gains similar to those reached last year by workers at Deere & Company.
The Deere contract requires the company to fill any positions vacated by attrition with laid-off union members. It also requires that the union be consulted before the company decides to buy any parts or supplies rather than manufacture them itself. The Deere contract also provides more generous health-care benefits than are being offered by Caterpillar.
 
Caterpillar's Losses
 But Caterpillar argues that its product mix and its large export business place it in a competitive position far different from Deere's. It maintains that its labor costs should be compared with those of the international giants against which it competes, principally Komatsu Ltd. of Japan.
Caterpillar is in an arduous position, hard hit by the nation's economic slump. It lost $404 million last year after earning $210 million in 1990.
What is more, it may face the threat of a drop in exports because of the rise in the United States dollar, which could make Caterpillar's tractors, trucks and excavators less attractive to foreign buyers.
 
Assessing Caterpillar's Stategy
 Some industry analysts and labor consider Caterpillar's efforts to break the union to be a foolhardy waste of time and energy, and they say that by hiring replacement workers, the company risks eroding the confidence of its customers, who have always regarded Caterpillar's products as superior.
"I can't see how this strike and breaking this union is worth it to Caterpillar," said Mark E. Erenburg, director of the Labor-Management Relations Center at Cleveland State University. "I really don't think that settling with the union is going to threaten their competitive position in the world."
On the other hand, some industry analysts say Caterpillar's posture makes perfect sense.
"Caterpillar has come up with a darn good offer, and the points of it that are at issue are points that should not matter much to an individual who is out of work and trying to take care of a family," said Alexander M. Blanton, an analyst with Ingalls & Snyder in New York.
 
The Union Perspective
 Union leaders see the matter differently. "This is of vital importance to our union," said Jerry Baker, who heads the bargaining team for Local 974 of the union, which represents about 9,000 workers at seven Caterpillar plants in the Peoria area. He said the union must remain firm in order to dissuade companies in the auto industry and elsewhere from taking a position similar to Caterpillar's.
"If we hold the line, Caterpillar will realize that they have to negotiate with us," Mr. Baker said. "They will have to come back to the table."
But not everyone thinks the Caterpillar strike will have far-reaching implications. "Every strike stands on its own," said Douglas A. Fraser, a former president of the U.A.W. who is now a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. "Some say it will encourage union busting by the Big Three auto companies in 1993, but that's nonsense."
Nonetheless, Mr. Fraser said, the Caterpillar move follows a pattern of union breaking that goes back a decade, to President Reagan's replacement of striking air traffic controllers.
Many union members lament that they are being forced into the present quandary. "It's a shame that we're under such pressure," said Jack Emmons, a machine operator who has worked at Caterpillar for 20 years. "It's a hard decision to make, but I'm going to stick by the union. We can't back down now."

HEADLINE: Florida Expected to Ban Referrals by Doctors to Clinics They Own

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Over vigorous objections of many physicians, the Governor of Florida is expected to sign a bill this week prohibiting doctors from referring patients to clinics in which the doctors have a financial interest.
The new restrictions, intended to curb conflicts of interest and control health costs, are likely to cause upheaval in the state's health-care industry, forcing at least 40 percent of the state's doctors to sell their interests in clinics or send their patients elsewhere. 
 In Florida, as in many other states, doctors' investments in laboratories, diagnostic imaging centers and clinics have proliferated in the last few years, for a variety of economic and medical reasons. Doctors say they make such investments so new health-care technology will be readily available to their patients, and they argue that they can control the quality of care when they own the business.
Critics say doctors also have an economic incentive to refer patients to clinics in which they have a financial interest. Studies in Florida and other states have found that when doctors invest in laboratories, diagnostic imaging equipment, physical therapy centers and medical equipment supply companies, they tend to order those services more often for their patients, increasing outlays for health care. Such clinics often charge higher fees than similar businesses not owned by doctors, the studies have found.
 
Part of a National Trend
 The Florida bill is the latest in a flurry of measures aimed at putting an end to the practice. Many states, including New York, New Jersey and California, are considering or already impose similar restrictions.
For years, the American Medical Association defended such investments. But in December it adopted a new policy stating that, "in general, physicians should not refer patients" to health-care businesses in which the doctors have invested. The association did not specify penalties for violations.
But many doctors contend that such investments benefit patients by speeding access to costly new medical technology, which might otherwise be unavailable. "Physician investment in health-care facilities has a long tradition and has indisputably benefited patients in respect to access, cost and quality of care," said Dr. Robert Windom, a spokesman for the Florida Medical Association. The association opposed the bill as a form of "punitive legislation" and said the need for it had not been proved.
At least 40 percent of Florida doctors have invested in clinics and other health-care businesses, and 93 percent of the diagnostic imaging centers are owned by physicians, according to a study by a state agency, the Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board.
 
Governor Will Sign
 The Florida bill, which was approved by the Legislature last month, is to be signed in the next few days by Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. The Governor's press secretary, Julie Anbender, said he viewed the bill as "a positive step to protect patients from paying for medical services that they may not need."
Under the Florida measure, doctors will be subject to a $15,000 fine if they send patients to a medical business in which they have invested. This ban applies to the ordering of laboratory services, X-rays, CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, physical therapy, rehabilitation services and radiation therapy.
The bill also sets limits on what doctors may charge patients for these services. The limits, calculated at 15 percent above rates established by Medicare for the same procedures, are often far below doctors' customary charges to patients with private health insurance. Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal programs for the elderly and the poor, regulate doctors' fees, but it is highly unusual for a state to adopt a fee schedule for doctors' services outside those programs.
Not all Florida physicians oppose the measure, primarily because the joint ventures enrich some doctors at the expense of others. For example, radiologists must depend on other doctors for referrals, and some say their business has dried up because doctors preferred to send patients to clinics where they could make a profit.
The American College of Radiology, a professional organization, contends that doctors "should not have a direct or indirect financial interest in diagnostic or therapeutic facilities to which they refer patients," and it supports legislation to ban such ownership arrangements.
 
'Good for Consumers'
 Dr. Michael B. Isikoff, a radiologist in Titusville, Fla., said the bill was "very, very good for consumers," and he predicted that the fee schedule would substantially reduce rates now charged by doctor-owned clinics.
Under the bill, doctors have until October 1995 to stop referring patients to clinics in which they have invested. But Dr. Isikoff said, "The fee schedule will decrease the profit in joint ventures, and that will drive many of them out of business before 1995."
The Florida bill was sponsored by State Representative Charlie Roberts, a Democrat, who said: "This is truly a nationwide trend. Physician joint ventures will cease to be attractive or economically feasible over the next few years. That will improve competition in the medical marketplace and will prevent the type of overutilization we have seen in every study of these investments."
 
Other States, Other Versions
 In California, doctors are resisting parts of a similar bill, which has been approved by the State Assembly and is pending before the State Senate.
In July, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey signed a bill that generally prohibits doctors from referring patients to health-care services in which the doctors have "a significant beneficial interest." But under the law, doctors may still send patients to clinics in which they invested before July 1991 if the doctors disclose their financial interest to the patient.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has also recommended legislation that would generally prohibit New York doctors from referring patients to services in which they have financial interest.
Legislators in Colorado, Hawaii, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, among other states, have been working on legislation to restrict doctor referrals.
 
Federal Ban Coinsidered
 The Federal Government prohibits doctors from referring Medicare patients to laboratories in which the doctors have invested. But the Federal law, which took effect Jan. 1, does not apply to other medical services nor does it apply outside Medicare.
On Feb. 6, President Bush proposed measures to slow the growth of health costs and to assist people who have no health insurance. He endorsed the idea that Medicare should not pay when doctors send patients to get goods or services from businesses in which the doctors have invested.
Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, is trying to persuade his colleagues in Congress to impose such a ban.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans To Sell HomeFed

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 5

 BODY:
Federal regulators have decided to sell Home Fed Bank of San Diego, one of the nation's largest troubled savings and loan institutions, after determining that the company stands little chance of regaining its financial health.
Regulators said they were stopping short of formally seizing HomeFed from its parent, the HomeFed Corporation. But in a statement issued late on Friday, the company said the regulators would sell the institution, probably with Federal financial assistance, and that shareholders and bondholders would probably lose their entire investments, as they would if the institution were seized. 
 HomeFed's share price closed on Friday at 75 cents, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement of the sale came after the close of trading.
 
Potential Acquirers
 HomeFed has 201 branches in California and is particularly prominent in the San Diego area. Its branch network is likely to be highly attractive to other big savings and loan companies in the state. The company, which has assets of $13.9 billion, said it had already received expressions of interest from a number of potential acquirers, including some from outside the savings and loan industry.
Executives of HomeFed identified two potential bidders as Home Savings of America, a unit of H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles, and Great Western Bank, a subsidiary of the Great Western Financial Corporation of Beverly Hills, Calif. The regulators could sell HomeFed as a whole or in pieces.
 
Reducing Bad Publicity
 In deciding to sell HomeFed, regulators placed the institution into what the Government calls the Accelerated Resolution Program. Under the program, the institution continues to be run by its current managers until a sale is completed. Operations will continue as normal, and Federal deposit insurance remains in place.
The program is intended to prevent troubled institutions from losing their value to possible buyers, by avoiding the stigma of a Government seizure and reducing the bad publicity that often leads to large withdrawals of deposits. HomeFed is the largest institution to be placed in the program.
The regulators' decision to sell HomeFed comes as operations of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout of the savings industry, have been slowed by a lack of financing. The House failed last week to pass legislation to continue financing for savings and loan bailouts.
The decision by the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision effectively ends a long-shot turnaround effort undertaken last year by the institution's chief executive, Thomas J. Wageman. Mr. Wageman, who was brought in to run the company at the behest of regulators, had been trying to persuade outside investors and the Government to put up more financing and let HomeFed earn its way out of its problems.
 
GlenFed and CalFed Ailing, Too
 But outside investors clearly remained wary of sinking money into HomeFed as the company's losses continued to grow on real estate loans and investments around the country. In Washington, regulators and Congress could not decide whether it would be good policy to invest taxpayer money into ailing savings institutions in the hopes of averting costly Government takeovers.
HomeFed is the most financially distressed of three large savings and loan companies in California that have been struggling to regain their financial health. The two others, GlenFed Inc. and CalFed Inc., face increasingly strict regulatory standards for financial health that could leave them short of capital this year, and they continue to be battered by weak real estate markets and the state's economic recession.
The decision to sell HomeFed came just three days after the company failed to meet a Government deadline to raise new capital on its own. On Tuesday, HomeFed reported a fourth-quarter loss of $35.6 million and a loss for all of 1991 of $807.7 million.

HEADLINE: Inquiries Are Growing on Payments to McDonnell Douglas

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Congressional investigators and Pentagon auditors are stepping up inquiries into whether the military took actions in the last several years to bail out the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the nation's largest weapons maker, when the company faced a severe financial crisis.
The investigators said the evidence they had assembled suggested that the Pentagon was trying to provide financial aid to McDonnell Douglas without public debate or notification. The period they are studying encompasses the months immediately before the start of the war against Iraq, where McDonnell fighter planes, missiles and helicopters played an important role. 
 Investigators for two House subcomittees and the Pentagon's Inspector General are studying newly uncovered details of several cases where McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, benefited from accelerated payments or other financial transactions that the investigators said were highly unusual.
McDonnell Douglas executives said they never requested a bailout or received any payments that were unusual or improper. They have said privately that much of the problem stems from confusion or disagreements within the Pentagon regarding the proper methods of paying contractors.
Top Pentagon officials have said repeatedly that they had no plan to bail out McDonnell Douglas and that the payments to the company fell within the bounds of complex Federal acquisition regulations.
McDonnell's financial condition has improved substantially in the last year, largely because of increased profits in its commercial aircraft business. But the Congressional investigators have been looking into the Pentagon's handling of McDonnell for the last year, and they said they see a pattern of financial concessions to the company that suggests the possibility of an effort by the military to aid the company just when it was facing a severe shortage of cash.
The conclusions of the Congressional investigators appear to be supported by a recent report from the office of the Pentagon's Inspector General. The report, which Government officials have provided to a number of news organizations in recent weeks, said payment decisions made by the Air Force in late 1990 on McDonnell Douglas's contract to develop the C-17 transport plane "appeared to be part of an overall plan to provide additional financing to McDonnell Douglas Corporation."
The Congressional investigators began studying the Pentagon's dealings with McDonnell last year, after the Pentagon decided not to demand immediate repayment from the company of $650 million the Government said it was owed from the cancellation of the Navy's A-12 bomber program. McDonnell has contended that it is owed money by the Government on the A-12 program, and that the dispute over the $650 million has not been decided.
The investigators, from subcommittees of the House Government Operations Committee, subsequently discovered that McDonnell Douglas requested expedited payment of $1 billion owed by the Pentagon early last year. McDonnell later withdrew the request as its finances improved.
The Congressional and Pentagon investigations, details of which have been reported over the last several weeks by The Los Angeles Times and other publications, are centering on the payments made on the C-17 program during the fall of 1990.
In one case, McDonnell received $148 million for work done under the development portion of the contract, even though the company had exhausted its Government budget for the work, after the Air Force agreed to finance the work out of the program's production budgets, the report and Congressional investigators said.
If the Air Force had not been willing to shift the cost of the work to the production budgets, the investigators said, McDonnell Douglas would have had to pay the costs itself, something it might have been unable to do given its shortage of cash at the time.
In a second case, the Air Force agreed to make an unusually large payment to McDonnell Douglas for work done on the C-17 immediately after being told by John F. McDonnell, its chairman and chief executive, that McDonnell Douglas had an "urgent and pressing financial need" that if not addressed could harm the company's ability to continue work on the C-17, the inspector general's report said. The payment amounted to $72.1 million more than McDonnell would otherwise have received, the report said.
 
Army Billing Dispute
 The Congressional investigators said the effect of the two actions was to give McDonnell Douglas immediate payments that it would otherwise have had to wait months or years for.
Pete Sloan, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said the company believed all the payments were proper and routine in both cases.
"We submitted bills in accordance with the extensive Federal regulations that cover billing, and we were paid," Mr. Sloan said.
Congressional investigators are also looking into a billing dispute over McDonnell's work on the Army's Apache helicopter that was settled in late 1990 in the company's favor. The Army had filed reimbursement claims against McDonnell for $50.3 million on the program. The claims were later cut to $20 million to $30 million, the investigators said, and subsequently settled for $2.4 million.
The settlement was made without the knowledge of the Pentagon's top auditors, the investigators said, adding that they were trying to determine whether the settlement was part of an effort to provide McDonnell with financial breaks.
Mr. Sloan said McDonnell Douglas felt the contract dispute was "settled on its merits." He said the suggestion that the Apache dispute and C-17 payments were somehow linked as part of a bailout plan was ludicrous.

HEADLINE: Fingerprints Used to Cut Welfare Fraud

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 5

 BODY:
When Matthew Dunlap walked into a Los Angeles County welfare office on Friday, he found that he had to give before he could get.
The price was an optical image of his fingerprints, which was sent to a central computer for matching against the fingerprints of everyone on the general welfare rolls. 
 Two minutes later, the word came back: Mr. Dunlap, 37 years old, had not applied for welfare at any other county office and his application could go forward. By the end of the day, he was approved to receive $341 a month until he finds work.
Los Angeles is the first county in the nation to install an automatic fingerprint-identification system for ferreting out welfare cheats. Since the program was put in place last July, officials say, the county has saved more than $5.4 million, primarily from people dropping out of the system because they refused to be fingerprinted.
"The fingerprint system prevents fraudulent duplicate claims and allows us to deliver services faster," said Eddy Tanaka, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services.
 
Concerns Over Privacy
 But though county officials say they will not share the fingerprints with the police or any other government agency, the program has raised a host of questions about individual rights and government intrusion in an information age. And it has raised fears that honest people, particularly illegal immigrants, will be deterred from asking for welfare benefits because they are afraid they will be turned over to immigration officials or other authorities.
"I don't know if we've deterred honest people," Mr. Tanaka said. "But we do have the right to know that people are who they say they are."
Intrigued by Los Angeles County's program, the New York Legislature on Wednesday authorized an identical fingerprint-identification program, a pilot project, in Onondaga and Rockland Counties.
"We'll check for duplications on the home relief, welfare and Medicaid rolls," said Robert Penna, an aide to Senator Tarky Lombardi Jr. of Syracuse, the chairman of the State Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Penna estimated that New York taxpayers could save $72 million a year by deterring fraud if the program was expanded statewide.
 
Fraud a 'Cottage Industry'?
 He said fears about immigration authorities or other agencies were much less in New York than in California because of New York's relatively liberal welfare policies. While there are some illegal immigrants who may fear to apply, he said, in general "all you have to do is have a pulse and you qualify."
"Welfare fraud is a cottage industry in New York," Mr. Penna said. In November, police arrested 117 people in New York City for using false documents to illegally collect welfare, he said.
Fraud costs taxpayers more than $25 billion a year, said Thomas F. Wilson, vice president of Resource Management Laboratories Ltd. in Nevada City, Calif., a company that develops personal-identification systems. Passports, birth certificates, Social Security cards, drivers licenses and other documents are routinely counterfeited, he said.
The automated fingerprint system is attractive to state and county welfare officials who face a rising demand for services amid budget cuts in a severe recession. In New York City, one in six residents is on welfare, Mr. Penna said. In Los Angeles County, one in seven residents is on welfare, Mr. Tanaka said, and each month there are 18,000 new applicants for general relief.
"We've always known that some people cheat but not how many," Mr. Tanaka said. "It may be 1 to 2 percent of all applicants, or it could be higher."
 
An Immediate Change
 In 1990, he said, Los Angeles County decided to try to find out. It invited computer vendors to design a system that would take optical images of fingerprints, store them in a data base and rapidly compare a single set of prints against all those stored. The $9.6 million five-year contract was awarded to the E.D.S. Corporation of Herndon, Va., and the Cogent Matching Software Company of Sunnyvale, Calif.
The system was installed last June in three of 14 offices that dispense county money to indigent men and women, Mr. Tanaka said. "Almost immediately, the application rate at those three offices went down while the application rate at the other 11 offices went up," he said, "so we rushed to put the program into all offices quickly."
From July on, Mr. Tanaka said, each person on welfare was asked to come in and give his or her fingerprints. They put each index finger on an optical scanning device, which took an image of the print and stored it in the computer, he said. The computer then created a mathematical representation of the unique physical characteristics contained in the bifurcations, ridges and endings, called minutiae, of each fingerprint.
By October, 90,000 fingerprints were stored in the data base, Mr. Tanaka said. Inactive cases are purged daily. The system is designed to handle up to one million fingerprints, he said.
Now, when new applicants come into the welfare office, they are asked to give their fingerprints, which are sent to the main computer for analysis. If the prints do not match, the applicant proceeds through the system, Mr. Tanaka said. If a print matches, the person is confronted immediately; most withdraw their applications at once. Only one applicant pressed his case; he lost, Mr. Tanaka said.
After the system went into effect, 3,021 people refused to be fingerprinted and dropped out of the welfare system in the first four months, said Lisa Nunez, chief of computer services at the welfare department. Another 242 people were denied benefits because they had applied at more than one office, she said. This saved taxpayers $5.4 million in the first six months of the program.
In January of this year, Ms. Nunez said, 26 people were caught cheating and 59 refused to be fingerprinted, so the savings continue.
Mr. Tanaka said he hoped to extend the program to other services in his department, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children and the food stamps program. About 300,000 adults who receive such benefits would be fingerprinted, he said.
Most clients do not mind the system, said Shirley Christensen, director of the Rancho Park Social Services office, where Mr. Dunlap applied for assistance on Friday. "Anyway, honest people have nothing to worry, about so it's not an intrusion," he said.
 
Says Data Are Not Shared
 But Jennifer W., a young woman who asked that her last name not be used, thought differently. "I think it's kind of scary to be fingerprinted," she said. "Like government gets closer and closer. I'm wondering, if someone wanted to hunt me down, could they use this fingerprint? Could they get it without my permission?"
Mr. Tanaka said: "So far, we have not gotten any legal challenges. My system is to prevent duplicate services and fraud. The data are not shared."
But that is a promise that Mr. Tanaka may not be able to keep, said Janlori Goldman, director of the American Civil Liberties Union privacy and technology project in Washington. "Once a data base like this is created, the temptation to use it for other purposes is irresistible," she said. "People are right to be afraid."
Meanwhile, some welfare applicants are already looking for ways to foil the fingerprint system, Mr. Tanaka said. They put glue on their fingers to blur the prints, he said. Others come in dressed as a woman one week and as a man the next week, hoping that male and female prints are processed separately. But as far as he knows, Mr. Tanaka said, such tricks have not worked.

HEADLINE: Farmers in West May Sell Something More Valuable Than Any Crop: Water

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLYTHE, Calif.

 BODY:
Even as six years of drought turned lawns brown and forced urban Californians to take shorter showers, the farmers in the Palo Verde Valley had plenty of water to go on irrigating such thirsty crops as alfalfa and cotton. And they jealously guarded their rights to cheap Federal water from the Colorado River.
But some profound changes are about to come to this valley between the McCoy and the Dome Rock mountains along the rugged Arizona border. If all goes as planned, nearly a quarter of the valley's acreage will go fallow starting Aug. 1, and, in a two-year experiment, the water saved will be sold to people in urban areas hundreds of miles away. 
 Slowly, with some reluctance, farmers are beginning to loosen their historic grip on water in the West, transferring some of their supplies to the fast-growing cities and industries -- for a price. Such transfers are expected to be an important element of a broad long-range water plan for California to be unveiled April 6 by Gov. Pete Wilson.
The trend has been promoted by an odd twist of Reagan-era deregulation, which has made allies of environmental and urban interests in creating a partial free market in water so that it flows to where it has the most value.
 
Seeds of Unease
 If the trend builds, it could have profound implications, accelerating the already rapid urbanization of agricultural lands that in California produce half the nation's fruits and vegetables. The prospect is stirring unease among farm towns, farm laborers and sellers of seeds, insecticides, tractors and other agricultural needs.
"There's a fairly dramatic change taking place -- broad support has developed quickly for agricultural water transfers," said Duane L. Georgeson, assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the powerful agency that plans to buy the water from Blythe. The Met, as it is called, sells water to utilities and communities that are home to 15 million people from Ventura to the Mexican border.
The reasons for the shift are rooted in several factors, including mounting political pressure for more urban water, rising public perception that farmers squander water it on low-value surplus crops, concern over damage to chinook salmon fisheries and other environmental harm from years of drought, and low crop prices. Farmers now use more than 80 percent of the available surface water in California that is not set aside for natural resources or does not flow to the ocean.
These are among the many signs of an emerging new water policy:
*Bills are pending in Congress and the California Legislature to permit or encourage such transfers and revise Federal allocation policy in California.
*Governor Wilson recently called on the Federal Government to cede control of the vast Central Valley Project, which provides 20 percent of the state's water, so that it could be merged with the State Water Project. Nearly everyone, including Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., agrees that this is a sensible idea, but the financial and other details of such a transfer will be difficult to negotiate.
*Top leaders of California agricultural, municipal and environmental groups have been meeting in recent months in what is widely called the "Three-Way Dialogue," trying to reach a new consensus. Participants say it has thus far produced more dialogue than consensus.
Just where all this comes out is uncertain at this point, but, Governor Wilson said in a recent interview, "Agricultural users will undoubtedly get a smaller slice of the pie." The Governor is at the focal point of a bitter political battle. He has said that he does not want a plan that will result in decades of lawsuits, but environmentalists have said that the Republican Governor has been too beholden to wealthy farm interests and has tried to derail Congressional action that would substantially reduce agricultural water rights.
 
Drought Loosens Grip
 Paradoxically, all this happens as winter and spring storms have swept the West. The once-dun countryside from Sacramento to the deserts has turned green with chapparal and grasses. The drought appears to have ended around Santa Barbara on the once-parched central coast, and Los Angeles and other cities are relaxing water-use restrictions.
But even without drought, pressures persist, both because of a fast-growing population and the demands of environmental laws governing clean water and endangered species. California's population is expected to grow from 30 million today to 41 million within 20 years. If current use patterns remain unchanged, California faces a water shortage of four to six million acre-feet a year for the next 20 years. (An acre-foot is 325,900 gallons, or roughly enough to supply two typical households for a year.)
California will have to meet this demand without additional supplies because there is little money for dams, and neighboring states fiercely resist efforts to take their water.
A result is a breakdown of the historic alliance between urban and agricultural interests in pressing for more dams and reservoirs. On the other side have been the environmentalists, who have long charged that excessive irrigation has caused environmental damage to the Sacramento Delta, San Francisco Bay and other wetlands.
 
'An Unholy Alliance'
 "Throughout history, agricultural and urban interests have been in an unholy alliance to insure everybody got what they wanted, at the expense of the environment; that alliance is starting to break down," said David Behar, executive director of the Bay Institute of San Francisco, one of 23 environmental and fishing-industry groups in Share the Water, a coalition to bring pressure to revamp the laws governing the Central Valley Project.
Though resistant, farm interests have recognized the new political realities. "Change is inevitable," said Jerald Butchert, general manager of the Westlands Water District. The largest irrigation agency in California, the district supplies Federal water to 600,000 acres of farmland on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley near Fresno.
The fight is over how far change will go. Farmers won a skirmish on March 19, when the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported out an omnibus water bill. It was stripped of a far-reaching overhaul of the Central Valley Project advocated by the committee chairman, Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, both Democrats. Their proposal would have set aside 1.5 million acre-feet a year to repair ecological damage and encourage irrigators to sell a certain amount of water to cities or other areas of need.
Instead, the committee adopted a bill offered by Senator John Seymour of California, a Republican. His plan, backed by farmers and Governor Wilson, allows for such transfers, subject to veto of local water districts. It also provided no special allocation for fisheries, proposing instead to address ecological problems with new diversion dams and other construction.
 
Two Houses, Two Versions
 Senator Bradley plans to try to restore his version when the bill reaches the Senate floor this month or goes to a conference to resolve differences with a House version passed last year. The House version also encourages liberal water transfers under a plan devised by Representative George Miller, a Democrat who represents the rapidly growing counties east of Oakland. The bills would not eliminate water subsidies to farmers but would permit them to sell surplus water.
Any change is difficult because it involves revamping half a century of rights rooted in an earlier rural era. A system of 20 dams and 500 miles of aqueducts that harness the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, the 57-year-old Central Valley Project delivers about eight million acre-feet of water, 85 percent of it to nearly 25,000 farms, in normal years. Depending on their contracts, the farms pay as little as $15 an acre-foot under 40-year contracts. Urban users elsewhere in the state pay $200 to $1,900 an acre-foot.
Environmentalists say the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the project, has caused enormous damage. For example, only 191 chinook salmon returned to spawn in the Sacramento River for the winter run in 1991, compared with 2,422 in 1986 and 118,000 in 1968, contributing to a disastrous collapse of the Pacific salmon industry.
Certain environmentalists, notably Thomas J. Graff and John Kraut kraemer of the Environmental Defense Fund, have long championed water marketing to encourage conservation to make more water available for ecological protection. "Why have a low-value crop in a state where there's an increasing premium on water?" Mr. Krautkraemer said. "It doesn't make sense to allot water to irrigated pastures, which don't contribute a lot to the overall economy. If alfalfa is really that valuable, then they should be willing to pay more for water."
Urban interests have joined the chorus. Last September, the Bay Area Economic Forum, representing such companies as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and water-needy computer and semiconductor makers in Silicon Valley, called for a regulated, market-based water-allocation system, similar to that of utilities which distribute natural gas or electricity. A report by the forum said the area's economic growth was threatened by water policies that have "undermined reliability, availability and quality."
Senator Bradley, chairman of the subcommittee on Water and Power, agrees. "California is a giant sponge," he said in an interview on a recent visit to Los Angeles. "Every year, the equivalent of the City of San Francisco moves to California. The state has a $760 billion economy, of which agriculture contributes only $20 billion. You cannot have 85 percent of the water continue to go to agriculture."
But others argue that water marketing is fraught with dangers. "Who holds the most money potentially controls the water," Dennis B. Underwood, Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, said in a telephone interview from Washington. "First you take away from farmers, then small cities. Where does it stop?"
Farm interests argue that, indirectly, farming represents a much larger proportion of the economy than Mr. Bradley says. Stephen K. Hall, executive director of the California Farm Water Coalition, agreed that all water users will pay more but said that many farmers would be put out of business, with ripple effects on local economies. "There's a misguided notion that if farmers were forced to pay more for water, they'd use it more efficiently and California's water problems would disappear," he said.
Water transfers are not entirely untried. In the winter of 1991, at the height of the drought, the California Department of Water Resources created a "water bank" that bought water from farmers and resold it to urban users. But the heavy rains and snows of March 1991 depressed demand, and the bank cost taxpayers about $30 million.
Still, such efforts are the future, argues one top water expert, Lyle N. Hoag, director of California Urban Water Agencies, a trade group of the 11 largest urban-water providers. "We've got to get rid of the constraint 'Thou shall not sell water outside of a project area,' " he said. "The progressive farmers see the winds are changing."

HEADLINE: In Politics of Water, New Pioneers in West Are Vendors

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLYTHE, Calif.

 BODY:
Dana Fisher and Virgil Jones are pioneers in the new West. The two gray-haired farmers will soon find out whether they can do better by selling some of their water to Los Angeles and other cities than by growing crops.
The Palo Verde Valley illustrates the odd economics and the law of water in the arid West. The 300 farmers in the sparsely populated valley use about 400,000 acre-feet of water a year, roughly enough to supply a city of 250,000 people. 
 The water cannot be taken away from them. Water rights here date to 1873, when an Englishman, Thomas Blythe, brought commercial farming to a region that gets only an inch or two of rain a year, by diverting water from the Colorado River. When the Federal Bureau of Reclamation created the Lake Mead reservoir upriver in Nevada in 1936, the farmers in this valley, who are served by the Palo Verde Irrigation District, were first in line for water.
For several years, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has coveted some of this water for the 15 million people in the 300 communities it serves. The district already gets some Colorado River water, but under law enjoys a much lower priority than the farmers. And it stands to lose about half that under a 1963 United States Supreme Court ruling that allocated more water from the Colorado River to Arizona.
When Metropolitan officials first approached farmers here about selling some of their water, they demurred, fearing that their valley would suffer the fate of the Owens Valley along the eastern slope of the Sierra to the north. The City of Los Angeles bought up nearly all the farmland there for the water 70 years ago, then pumped it south to the city, turning the valley into a dust bowl.
But starting a few year ago, the farmers here began to sense that the politics of water were shifting. "We were concerned that as the urban areas' population grew, while they could not take our water away, they might dictate crops," Mr. Fisher said. "So we felt it would be better to work with them, to take some crops out for a while while we installed water-saving drip irrigation."
Each farmer would get $620 a year for each fallowed acre, up to a quarter of his land, in a two-year experiment. "That's better than what we could get now for most any crop," Mr. Jones said. Farmland here normally rents for about $250 an acre a year.
The farmers pay $45 to $50 an acre-foot for water, actually not for the water but for the cost of moving it. Since each acre uses about 4.6 acre-feet a year, the water district's offer amounts to about $135 an acre-foot, a good profit.

HEADLINE: Car-Insurance Reform Bill Steers Claims Out of Court

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
A campaign to revise Connecticut's auto-insurance system is provoking debate across the state, especially in this city where insurance is king and its palaces line the roads to the statehouse.
Automobile-insurance reform is difficult at best, as other states have found. In New Jersey, sweeping changes enacted in 1990 by Gov. Jim Florio have had mixed results. The Governor says he has cut rates for good drivers, but insurers complain that the state has imposed unreasonable restrictions that make it hardly worthwhile to do business. 
 In Connecticut, changes intended to rein in rising premiums have pitted two influential groups against each other: the insurance industry, which dominates Hartford's business scene, and the state's lawyers. The groups have exchanged insults, with the lawyers accusing the insurers of trying to recoup losses suffered in 1980's real-estate investments that went sour, and the insurers claiming that lawyers have an obvious interest in fanning the flames of litigation, auto-related or otherwise.
The latest attempt at reform, which some lawyers insist on calling deform, made it through one legislative committee late last month only to be gutted by another. It is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives later this month.
 
Revision of 1974 Code
 The bill seeks to control costs through a revision of the no-fault coverage for injury liability that the state adopted in 1974. In return for that and other changes, insurance companies would be required to reduce premiums for two and a half years, beginning in 1995. Last year, a similar bill died in committee.
Connecticut is one of 12 states with no-fault insurance, in which a person surrenders the right to sue for injury and lost wages in exchange for prompt compensation of medical costs that do not exceed a set limit. No-fault coverage applies to both personal injury and property damage, but claims for personal injury have been escalating far faster than claims for property damage. Before no-fault insurance, in disputed cases, the parties had to go to court to determine which driver was at fault and to collect on injury claims.
The primary argument is over the appropriate limit, or threshold, beyond which a personal-injury lawsuit can be filed. That limit has not changed since Connecticut's no-fault law was passed, when the limit was set at $400. That means a person must have more than $400 in medical expenses after an accident before being able to sue.
"It means that even a minor accident, with minor injury, is able to get into court," said Ross Brown, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Association of Connecticut, a trade group based in Hartford. "We think that's one reason rates are going up."
Figures provided by the association show average rates have risen by 10 to 15 percent every year since 1984. The American Insurance Association, a national trade group, says that every insured car in Connecticut costs insurers an average of $196 because of injury-liability claims, compared with a national average of $116.
The bill under consideration, which was written by the new Insurance Commissioner, Robert Googins, originally proposed raising the threshold to $5,000. That is a figure many consider far too high. The latest version of the bill proposes a $2,250 threshold, which has won support in some quarters, but the Insurance Association of Connecticut, for one, no longer favors the bill because of the smaller figure..
Jay B. Levin, a lawyer representing the Coalition for Fairness in Auto Insurance Rates, cited other problems with the legislation. "This bill has been referred to in some quarters as a consumer-choice bill," he said, "but I think it is more accurately characterized as a consumer scam.
"To tell folks they can save on something that is a required part of their daily living, and then start whispering in their ear that all you have to do is surrender some of your critical rights that you have as a matter of law, then the economic exigencies are going to compel people to save those few dollars."
Mr. Googins said his bill was "designed to be a bill in the interests of the consumer," not intended to please the insurance industry or trial lawyers. "Obviously, I've done neither," he said.
Connecticut's premiums would be lowered by raising the threshold, said David Snyder, senior counsel with the American Insurance Association in Washington. With a $5,000 threshold, the savings would be about 17 percent, he said, compared with about 8 percent if it were $2,200.
The most effective way to keep claims out of court is to specify what kinds of injuries warrant litigation, rather than setting a monetary threshold, said Renee Carter, a no-fault insurance expert with the association in Washington. "New York is one state where no-fault works well," she said, because that is how the lines are drawn. Michigan and Florida have similar laws.
John Miletti, counsel to the Insurance Association of Connecticut, said he did not think such specificity would be possible, "given the current structure of this legislature."
 
Claims on Multiple Policies
 Another issue is whether to continue the practice known as "stacking," in which insurance policies held on several automobiles can be tapped by the policyholder after an accident with an uninsured driver involving only one of those automobiles.
For instance, suppose an owner of two cars has $100,000 of uninsured-motorist coverage on each. He is involved in an accident in one of the cars, and the driver of the other vehicle has no insurance. The owner is allowed to collect from the insurance on both of his cars.
"We are potentially exposed for recoveries up to the entire stacked amount," Ms. Brown said. The Googins bill proposes an end to stacking -- a proposal that is anathema to many lawyers.

HEADLINE: 2 Big Banks Settle Suit

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 5

 BODY:
Two of the biggest Western banks, Wells Fargo & Company and the First Interstate Bancorp, have agreed to settle a credit-card price-fixing lawsuit to avoid the cost of a trial. 
 The bank holding companies said Friday that they had agreed to pay $55 million to settle the class-action suit, dating from 1986, that contended they had agreed to fix interest rates on credit cards. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, was brought on behalf of four million consumers who had credit cards from the banks between 1982 and 1986. The agreement will go to a judge for approval on Monday.
Another bank, the BankAmerica Corporation, based in San Francisco, was also charged and has decided to go to trial, a spokesman for the bank said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Banks Still Face Loan Problems

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
THE rally in bank stocks, with the share price of many companies doubling last year, has stalled in the last month, as investors wait for first-quarter earnings reports to be issued this week. They hope to see evidence that banks' losses from commercial real estate loans are abating.
But the problems of Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the giant Canadian real estate developer negotiating new terms for $12 billion it owes banks, are a reminder that the commercial real estate market remains depressed and is still claiming victims. 
 While many banks reported declines late last year in badly delinquent loans or real estate acquired through foreclosure, that improvement does not necessarily mean profits will improve.
"Bank losses from bad loans will stay high," said John D. Leonard, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, "though not so high as the past few years when banks were still catching up" to the weakening real estate market.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that nonperforming loans plus real estate acquired through foreclosure fell by nearly $2.9 billion for all banks in the fourth quarter of 1991, but remained higher than in any period before 1991. Despite that improvement, profits excluding gains on securities declined steadily, as loan demand remained weak and banks charged off $9.4 billion of loans as losses, a record for any quarter.
John B. McCoy, chairman of the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and Hugh L. McColl, chairman of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., both said recently that there were signs of a rise in loan demand. Banc One stock ended last week at $46, compared with a 52-week low of $31 and a high of $50. Nationsbank ended at $44.125, near its yearly high of $48.125 but off its low of $33.
Still, banking analysts do not expect the benefits of growth from issuing new loans to overshadow the pain of continued high loan losses.
"The bear market in commercial real estate continues," said David G. Shulman, an equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. At a meeting of banking analysts on March 26, he said it would be several years before there was an appreciable decline in vacancy rates, even if the economy strengthened and grew at a 2.5 or 3 percent rate after inflation.
Because of the danger that real estate values could continue to fall, or that developers who are now paying their loans could default, Salomon Brothers is limiting its recommended bank stocks to companies that offer prospects for earnings growth even without a drop in loan losses.
Recommended companies are typically those that avoided making bad loans in the first place, like Norwest of Minneapolis, which ended last week at $35.50 a share, near its yearly high of $38.125 and off its low of $24.875; NBD Bancorp, owner of the National Bank of Detroit, $27.875 compared with $31.625 and $22.75; Comerica, also in Detroit, $55 compared with $60.50 and $35.125; BankAmerica, San Francisco, $41 compared with $46.25 and $30.625; Republic New York, $40.625 compared with $49.25 and $37.125, and Bankers Trust, $52.625 compared with $68 and $41.50.
Although losses on commercial real estate loans have already been severe, Mr. Shulman said more losses are ahead. Charles L. Coltman, chief credit officer at Corestates Financial, owner of the Philadelphia National Bank, estimated that in many cases, commercial real estate loans were worth as little as 50 cents on the dollar if a bank wanted to sell loans or buildings quickly.
Many analysts agree that banks still have a way to go in recognizing their losses. "In almost every situation I have worked, the bank has underestimated the reserve that is required for a bad loan or the amount by which the price of the property must be reduced if it is to be sold," said Robert C. MacPhee, president of Real Estate Asset Specialists, a San Francisco bank advisory concern.
While the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency in charge of selling assets of failed savings and loans, still holds hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, and tenants will be demanding lower rents when their leases expire, Mr. MacPhee said, "The commercial real estate market remains very muddled, and it is hard for banks to have any real understanding of their losses."
The problem of additional loans turning sour as banks solve their problems is another difficulty.
At MNC Financial in Baltimore, owner of the Maryland National Bank, a 150-person department was created to handle bad real estate loans and was able to sell or reorganize an average of $200 million of loans or buildings a quarter during 1991. But almost as fast as it solved problems, others emerged, so that by the end of 1991, the company had reduced its holdings of badly delinquent loans or real estate acquired by foreclosure by only $110 million from a year earlier, to $1.77 billion.
The new problems "are cropping up at a slower rate," said Daniel G. Finney, senior vice president at MNC, which ended last week at $7 a share, compared with a yearly high of $9.125 and a low of $3. "But we are not confident enough about the market to say the slowdown will continue."

HEADLINE: Brown and Clinton And Their Pursuit Of the Arts World

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The manner in which Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Gov. Bill Clinton courted New York's arts world is hardly likely to be the deciding issue in tomorrow's turbulent and vitriolic Democratic Presidential primary here, but it does provide an illuminating contrast between the two major candidates and their views of the arts.
Last Tuesday night, Mr. Brown, whose impromptu campaign has itself become an issue, visited a group of artists at a Brooklyn loft. The meeting might as well have been clandestine. No one at Brown headquarters, in New York or in California, seemed to know who the artists were or what had been discussed. No "Artists for Brown" committee was announced, and no one connected with him seemed to know whether anything so formal was even contemplated. 
Asked about the nonevent, Susan Bunn, Mr. Brown's New York press secretary, said: "If something's already integrated and in place, why do you need a committee to organize it? This is a visionary campaign."
 
Gathering at the Harvard Club
 In contrast, back in January, well before Governor Clinton's campaign became an exercise in damage control, several of his top aides launched a conventional and well-planned drive to capture New York's intellectuals and artists. They held an all-day seminar at the Harvard Club, where prominent local Democrats were formed into panels and asked to enlighten the Clinton staff on issues ranging from the economy and health care to the arts.
Afterward, Bruce Reed, who holds the title of deputy campaign manager for policy for the Clinton campaign, asked Donald Blinken, a former chairman of the State University of New York who had participated in the arts panel, to help the campaign formulate an arts policy.
Mr. Blinken, an investment banker who helped develop an arts policy for the Dukakis campaign four years ago, immediately began a confidential survey of arts leaders around the East Coast, and on the basis of the returns made his recommendations to Governor Clinton. Whatever comes of his report, a host of cultural leaders were flattered by having had their opinions respectfully solicited.
As the campaign has grown more clamorous, Governor Clinton has often seemed like a camel caught in tent ropes, and Mr. Brown like a rider on a runaway horse. But the basic character of their campaigns, like their attitude toward the arts, has remained unchanged. Governor Clinton has been measured in his approach, while Mr. Brown has gone all-out.
 
Differ Over the Endowment
 They differ, for instance, in their support for the National Endowment for the Arts, which has become a political flashpoint since February, when President Bush dismissed its chairman, John E. Frohnmayer.
Mr. Brown believes in giving the arts endowment "full support independent of the content of the art it supports," said Tom Pier, Mr. Brown's national press secretary.
Governor Clinton said in a statement released by his campaign headquarters, "While I believe that publicly funded projects should strive to reflect the values that most Americans share, I strongly support and will defend freedom of speech and artistic expression."
Mr. Reed explained that while Governor Clinton "would never allow outside pressure to infringe the basic freedom of artists," he conceded that finding a way to protect both the rights of artists and of the public is "one of the toughest issues we face today."
 
The Brown Record
 Governor Brown's reputation as both a miracle worker and an eccentric arose in large part because of his involvement with the arts during his two terms as Governor of California. Shortly after his election in 1974, Governor Brown persuaded the State Legislature to abolish the California Arts Commission, which had been created in 1963 when his father was Governor. In its place, they created the California Arts Council with a broad legislative mandate and a $3.7 million budget, nearly four times that of its predecessor.
Governor Brown shaped the agency by appointing artists, many of them black, Asian or Hispanic, to the council's grants-making body. A result, said Peter Coyote, an actor who served as a member of the council and later its chairman, was the awarding of many pioneering grants, and "the activation of the whole state so that each county worked out a plan for its own cultural development."
But the arts council drew criticism, both for its public image and specific grants. "I had six rings in my ear and lived in a truck when Jerry Brown picked me," said Mr. Coyote. "We created a lot of divisiveness."
 
The Whale-Whistle Episode
 One of the grants widely criticized as frivolous, especially as the Proposition 13 tax revolt gathered steam in the spring of 1978, subsidized the "whale whistle," a device thought to be capable of warning porpoises to steer clear of tuna nets. For a time, a prototype was displayed in the Governor's office.
Such targets of ridicule, together with mockery of Governor Brown's interest in such matters as the possibility of communication with dolphins, prompted the State Legislature in 1978 to slash the art council's budget to $2 million from $4 million.
Only months after suffering the backlash of Proposition 13, however, he asked the Legislature to sextuple the appropriation for the arts council, to $12 million. Surprisingly, he got $8.7 million, and by 1981 nearly $13 million, which made California second only to New York in the amount it spent on the arts.
Then and now, Mr. Brown's friends say, he is more interested in the ideas than the objects or occasions of art. "He's not the kind who buys paintings or goes to a ballet opening," said William B. Cook, who became director of the California Arts Council in 1979. "You're more likely to find Jerry at a North Beach coffee house in San Francisco talking to a poet."
Other admirers point to his efforts to secure passage of the Resale Royalties Act, which provides that artists receive a 5 percent royalty on the re-sale of their work, and the Art in Public Buildings Act, which requires builders to dedicate 1 percent of the capital cost of a state project to art.
If Mr. Brown emphasizes the arts as a source of ideas for government and society, to Governor Clinton they have economic utility. Both he and his wife, Hillary, have sought to promote Arkansas crafts such as the making of quilts, split-oak baskets and dulcimers as a means of economic development for the state.
Joan W. Baldridge, a Clinton appointee who is director of the Department of Arkansas Heritage, credits Governor Clinton with having been the driving force behind the successful expansion of an annual blues festival in Helena into a multi-disciplinary arts festival based at the Delta Cultural Center in a restored Union Pacific railroad depot.
 
Increase Amid the Decreases
 Governor Clinton, also, has pressed his State Legislature to increase the arts budget. William Puppione, the present director of the council, said: "He gave us an increase of $9,000 this year specifically for grants to artists. That doesn't sound like much, but when 30 to 40 percent decreases were common for other agencies, it shows you where his heart is."
Other supporters applaud Governor Clinton's insistence that his revision of the state's school system include making the study of the arts a graduation requirement. Since 1983, the budget for music and arts teachers in the public school system has increased 35 percent.
His personal taste in the arts is decidedly middle-of-the-road. His friends say he enjoys dropping in on a high school band concert and playing along on the saxophone, and curling up with a murder mystery by P. D. James. His favorite book, friends say, is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
Before the campaign, the Clintons were frequently seen at performances of Ballet Arkansas in Little Rock. Hillary Clinton serves on the company's advisory board, and their daughter, Chelsea, is a member of the junior company. "They're very supportive," said Phillip Quick, the executive director of Ballet Arkansas. "Like all of our parents, they want the best for their kid."

Union Cuts Demand on Contract

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
On the fifth day of a potentially destructive strike, the National Hockey League's civil war of words changed battlegrounds yesterday, from Toronto to New York, as team owners gathered for today's critical board of governors meeting at the Plaza Hotel and the union offered another proposal for settlement of a deadlock that threatens the Stanley Cup playoffs.
The N.H.L.'s president, John A. Ziegler Jr., and the executive director of the Players Association, Bob Goodenow, met into the evening. Goodenow said afterward that he had offered the owners a contract that would meet one of their major demands. 
 The new offer, Goodenow said, would cover the current season, plus the next two, with the possibility for a "re-opener clause based on economic conditions" after next season.
 
Owners Want 1-Year Deal
 The owners have been demanding only a one-year deal, for the season of 1992-93, because, they say, they are losing money and must form a closer economic partnership with the players.
"We need to form a study group to look at the business of hockey in great detail," Goodenow said, without being specific about what circumstances would trigger a re-opening of the contract after one more season. "The re-opener is based on a review of what the study group from either side might find. We've made a proposal in a key area."
Another key area is that of licensing for revenue from trading cards. The players now get about $10 million per season for this and they use it to finance the union. Although such revenue has gone to the players for more than 20 years, the owners now want the players to negotiate for it. Some players have said they view this as an attempt to break the union. Goodenow said yesterday that the owners "have been unresponsive to our positioning on licensing."
Mike Gartner of the Rangers, a member of the union's bargaining committee, said the revenue from the hockey cards "is probably the single most important issue."
 
'Not Weakening
 The players have also made concessions on the issue of free-agent mobility and equalization between teams that sign them. For months, the players have said this was their top issue. Asked if the union seems to backing off, Goodenow replied: "Our position isn't weakening. We're trying to be responsible to the areas of concern for the owners."
In a statement released by his office, Ziegler said, "I am duty-bound to take whatever new ideas" -- to the board -- "and will do so in this case but I will do so without endorsement."
The strike began last Wednesday, when the players voted by 560-4 to begin the first walkout in the 75-year history of the league.
The regular season was to have ended yesterday and the playoffs were to have begun on Wednesday. If no settlement is reached soon, both sides agree that it will be difficult to salvage the full two months of the post-season playoffs, which begin with 16 teams and generate gross revenues of between $50 million and $100 million.
The owners say they will lose $9 million this season after making a $125 million profit in the previous three. The players say the owners will make $24 million this season.
Barry Shenkarow, the owner of the Winnipeg Jets, who also is a member of the negotiating committee, said Goodenow "took a calculated gamble" by leading a strike when he did.
"Well, you play roulette, that's what happens," Shenkarow said. "You put your coin down on number 24 and, well, your number didn't come up, but you spent your wife's last dollar.
"Whoever fed the players this thing of leverage has led them astray. If they had the leverage, why isn't it working? We're in a big dilemma. It's a really sad situation."

The Culture of Contentment
By John Kenneth Galbraith
 195 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $22.95. 
 At the opening of his elliptically acerbic critique of America's current economic state, "The Culture of Contentment," John Kenneth Galbraith observes that one of the most enduring lessons of history "is that individuals and communities that are favored in their economic, social and political condition attribute social virtue and political durability to that which they themselves enjoy."
For the past decade or so, Mr. Galbraith argues, the majority of voting Americans have enjoyed a prosperity based on government nonintervention in the form of diminished regulation and reduced income taxes, particularly for the wealthy. We have attributed virtue to that nonintervention and idealized it as a turning away from the welfare state and a return to a purer form of laissez-faire capitalism.
But in fact, says Mr. Galbraith, the state's nonintervention has been highly selective. Washington may have cut back on rebuilding the nation's public works and decreased its investment in the poor and unemployed, but it has continued to create jobs for those connected with the military sector, and it has happily seen to the welfare of the scandal-ridden savings-and-loan associations.
Moreover, Mr. Galbraith insists, to the extent that we have unleashed capitalism we have also set free its inherently self-destructive tendencies, as demonstrated by the frenzy of wasteful corporate takeover activity in the 1980's and by what he sees as the catastrophic deregulation of the airline industry. In the short run, a community of contented grasshoppers continues to frolic. In the long run, winter is likely to set in.
It is difficult to capture in this space the scope of Mr. Galbraith's deadpan wit. One tiny sample: on why high interest rates favor the rich, he writes: "It is an indubitably inescapable fact that those who have money to lend are likely to have more money than those who do not have money to lend -- an economic truth that stands on a par with the unimpeachable observation attributed to Calvin Coolidge that when many people are out of work, unemployment results."
Yet his highly oblique prose, which rolls by like the thunder of a distant storm, makes everything seem of a piece. Part of what enables him to fit it all together so compactly is his compression of ideas he developed at length in such previous books of his as "The Great Crash, 1929," "The Affluent Society" and "The New Industrial State." In "The Culture of Contentment," he has summed up a lifetime's ballet in a single soft-shoe dance.
Indeed so streamlined is his analysis here that it rounds the edges off such jagged controversies as the true menace of Communism during the past half-century, which he appears to dismiss as inconsequential (though paradoxically he celebrates the collapse of the Soviet bloc as "the greatest transformation on the world scene in the last half century and more"), or the role of the New Deal in terminating the Great Depression, which he unquestioningly affirms (though in general he believes that complex forces of history, not single figures like Franklin D. Roosevelt, are what intervene to alter the destinies of nations).
And then having set the reader up for an apocalyptic bang, his book ends with something of a whimper. What does he see as likely to bring to an end this country's present debilitating state of contentment, and to make it possible once again to regulate the economy through Keynesian fiscal policy in general and in particular higher taxes?
"The present age of contentment will come to an end only when and if the adverse developments that it fosters challenge the sense of comfortable well-being." As well as a strong and successful political appeal to the discontented who now don't bother to vote in national elections, Mr. Galbraith sees three plausible possibilities for change to happen. "They are: widespread economic disaster, adverse military action that is associated with international misadventure, and eruption of an angry underclass."
He continues: "All could, in fact, come together. A deep recession could cause stronger discontent in the areas of urban disaster in the aftermath of some military misadventure in which, in the nature of the modern armed forces, the unfortunate were disproportionately engaged. This could, indeed, be at grave cost to contentment."
Yet having pointed out such dangers, he seems to throw up his hands in weariness: "But, as sufficiently established, it is not in the nature of contentment that such eventualities, however persuasively described, be other than ignored. Contentment sets aside that which, in the longer view, disturbs contentment; it holds firmly to the thought that the long run may never come."
As for the future of the American economy: the probability "is more gradual but more definitive stasis. This is already well under way as American manufacturing industry and the economy generally concede to the superior economic performance of other nations, principally Japan, Germany and the countries of the Pacific Rim."
So Mr. Galbraith concludes that it is most unlikely that from the power of his prose "must proceed the remedial action." That may well be the case. But the pessimistic vision of "The Culture of Contentment" must certainly give its readers pause. And if gloom can ever be mitigated by the exercise of wit, then Mr. Galbraith has us smile at the dismalness of our prospects.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
It Isn't Dollars, the Players Maintain

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
Top-ranking members of the striking Players Association, gathered in New York to monitor today's pivotal meeting of the National Hockey League board of governors, told reporters yesterday that they felt their strike was no longer about dollars, but about dignity.
"All the economic issues have been agreed to," was the assessment of Mike Gartner, the Ranger forward and a member of the union's negotiating committee. "We want to have a wedding. We just don't want it to be a shotgun wedding." 
 Five players appeared for a small news conference yesterday at a midtown hotel, at the urging of Ranger star Mark Messier, who said there had been too much "player-bashing" by the public since the strike began last Wednesday. The players insisted that they had been more than reasonable with their latest compromise proposal, which will be discussed by the owners today at the Plaza Hotel.
If this deal fails, they said, there is not much more they can do.
"If it's not decided now, then will it be never?" said Mike Liut of the Capitals. "Everybody's a little afraid. We are close enough to either do it or not do it. That's why we haven't considered a mediator. A mediator isn't going to volley any new issues around."
 
Two Issues
 At this stage of the negotiations, there appear to be only two issues remaining as obstacles between the two sides: percentage of licensing fees and length of the new collective bargaining agreement. But the players wondered aloud yesterday whether the owners weren't trying to invent new issues to replace those that already had been settled, in order to weaken or break the union.
"At times it has felt like the c.b.a. wasn't the issue," Bruin Andy Moog said of the collective bargaining agreement. "It felt like something else was up not related at all to the c.b.a. There was always another stumbling block, but maybe that was just the nature of the agreement."
The issue of free agency appears to have been all but settled in discussions between the N.H.L.'s president, John A. Ziegler Jr., and the executive director of the Players Association, Bob Goodenow. The only changes between the players' proposed free-agency rules and the ones in effect under the old agreement involve relatively minor compensation technicalities.
 
Concern About Rank and File
 Liut said there was a question as to whether the rank-and-file players would approve the free-agency proposal as submitted by the union's leadership.
"They weren't thrilled with the package to start with," Liut said, "and we haven't made any improvements."
The players remained steadfast on the issue of licensing and trading-card revenues, which Liut called "the lifeblood of the Players Association."
"It shouldn't even be an issue," said Bryan Trottier, the president of the Players Association. "The players understand the money is ours."
Any new collective bargaining agreement would be retroactive to the start of this season, when the old agreement expired. The players are seeking a three-year deal instead of the two-year deal offered by the owners.
"The owners say they're looking to revamp the business of hockey, but that's vague," Liut said. "Twelve months is not long enough to come up with a new model."
Goodenow, and the union's negotiating committee, will be available today in New York if the owners at the board of governors meeting invite them to discuss the proposals. If talks fall through, the players said, it could possibly mark the beginning of the end of hope for a settlement.
"We're not trying to destroy the owners," Trottier said. "But something has to give."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Clinton: Challenges on Taxes

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ


GRAPHIC: Television script: "You have to wonder about Jerry Brown. First, he didn't tell the truth about his tax plan. It will triple taxes on the poor and raise taxes on the middle class. Senator Moynihan said it would put a silver bullet through the heart of Social Security.
Chart: "Clinton: Challenges on Taxes"
"Now Brown's not telling the truth about his own record. CNN found his ad claim is just plain wrong. He raised taxes in California and left the state with a huge deficit.
"And he's not telling the truth about Bill Clinton's civil rights record. An outstanding record of fighting against bigotry and hatred of any kind.
"Now you know the truth, and the truth is, we just can't believe Jerry Brown." (Producer: Great American Media Inc., Washington.)
On the screen: Photo of Edmund G. Brown Jr., then words repeating and emphasizing passages from the script, including, "left the state with a $1.5 billion deficit." Images of Gov. Bill Clinton shaking hands with people, talking with mothers and children.
Accuracy: The claim of a tripling taxes on the poor and increased taxes for the middle class under Mr. Brown's plan is based on a study by Citizens for Tax Justice. Analyses by the Brown campaign and by some other economists dispute the conclusion. It is true that California had a budget deficit exceeding $1 billion by the time Mr. Brown left office.
Whether Mr. Clinton has an "outstanding" civil rights record is arguable. He has made strides on civil rights, but by most measures his achievements are no better than those of many other governors. More blacks and women have been appointed to boards, commissions and departments than under any other Arkansas governor. But Arkansas is one of only nine states with no law against discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, and one of only two states with no civil rights bill. Mr. Clinton supported such a bill in last year's Legislature, but it lost despite his backing.
 Scorecard: The victim of character issues himself throughout the campaign, Mr. Clinton in this advertisement is trying to counter that by raising a character question against Mr. Brown, in effect accusing him of deceit. At the same time, he is attempting to plant doubts about Mr. Brown's economic stewardship.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Clinton's Promise

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
New Yorkers have the power to destroy one of the most promising Presidential candidates in decades. Or they can give Bill Clinton a chance to be heard fully and clearly for the remainder of this campaign.
More than anyone now on the national scene, the Governor from Arkansas could be what we most need: a Great Experimenter in foreign and domestic policy. 
 No one has good answers for the kind of world descending on us, nor for the complexities of health and education in post-industrial societies.
A leader through this haze and maze must be committed to solutions, as are Democrats, and possessed of a practical skepticism about means, as are Republicans. Such a leader has to be a bleeding-heart conservative, a bold experimenter like Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy.
To get a sense of these qualities in Mr. Clinton, just compare the world he talked about in his foreign policy speech last week with the worlds of Jerry Brown and George Bush.
The world sketched, stingily, by Mr. Brown seems to be a very simple place inhabited by destructive environmental Martians -- and little else.
Mr. Bush's world seems still peopled by dictators like the Chinese whom he wants to protect and tyrants like President Assad of Syria whom he seeks to befriend. It is an old, crumbling chessboard where kings play with each other and are indifferent to their subjects.
Mr. Clinton does not pretend to understand or describe the world of the 21st century. Instead, he concentrates on what he does know and on what really matters -- on people, their problems and aspirations.
Unlike Mr. Bush, he is committed to doing something dramatic to combat global warming. But he is not bound to particular actions regardless of cost and before clearer remedies are at hand, unlike Mr. Brown.
Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton still worries about U.S. energy security and dependence on Persian Gulf oil. But he is still searching for politically palatable solutions like increased gas taxes, unlike Mr. Brown, who never seems troubled by political realities.
Unlike Mr. Bush, who would keep U.S. military spending near current levels and have Americans police the world alone, Mr. Clinton would make significant cuts in the Pentagon budget and stress the need for collective military action against aggression. Unlike Mr. Brown, he would do so with a scalpel, not with a meat cleaver.
Above all, Mr. Clinton's pronouncements center on the new and profound connections between foreign and domestic affairs. This connection is at the heart of modern diplomacy, and Mr. Clinton understands this. No nation, even one as mighty as the U.S., will be able to exercise sustained influence abroad unless it is economically strong at home, and Mr. Clinton understands this, too.
So Mr. Clinton speaks of America first, but never of America only.
In his treatment of domestic issues, he also brings commitment to ends and flexibility about means.
He accepts the necessity of a new national health care plan. But given the massive disagreements about means and costs, he talks about trying different approaches, about experimenting. He presses for reform in education. And while he highlights the idea of giving parents a choice of schools as a way to generate quality, he is open to other ideas as well.
Jerry Brown talks as if he really had all the answers -- and they are all simple. But mostly it seems that he has returned from his latest deep space probe as Jack D. Ripper, full of anger and nastiness. Mr. Bush, by contrast, seems to have no ideas and offers gimmicky slogans like "family values" and "Congressional reform." His new "change thing" is every bit as convincing as his "vision thing."
Bill Clinton may not have vision either. We do not yet know. But he does have energy, drive, ideas and an incredible fund of knowledge about domestic policy issues, second only to Senator Pat Moynihan of New York.
Yes, we all have questions and doubts about somebody labeled Slick Willie. And we should have lots of questions and doubts about Turnstile Jerry, No New Taxes Bush and a Paul Tsongas who so abruptly quit the campaign.
But Bill Clinton could be special, a bold experimenter in a world searching for answers. New Yorkers could defeat him or they could work through the tabloid garbage to glimpse that promise -- and put it to a further test.

HEADLINE: Don't Let the Campaign Stop You From Voting;
Clinton and Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The problem of racism in this country, and solutions to it, is more complicated than "Bill Clinton, in Black and White" (editorial, March 11) suggests. In my view, Gov. Bill Clinton's ability to win 75 percent of the black vote in Florida reflects massive outreach by him and his supporters through networks of black churches and community organizations -- shrewd traditional organizing, more than innovative approaches.
I agree with Mr. Clinton's observation that, in harsh times, the reactionary right wing preys on the fears of "the most economically insecure white people." I also agree that Americans "want to be part of a nation that's coming together, not coming apart." This untapped yearning for a leader who will make racial unity a priority has existed for a long time. But to state that dream is not to achieve it. A leader does more. 
 I urge Mr. Clinton to identify publicly the obstacles that keep us from unity -- lack of cultural understanding, the departure of major industries from our central cities, stereotype portrayals of people of color by the mass media and de facto segregation of most residential communities.
Mr. Clinton, having grown up in the South through the crucible of the civil rights era, and having toured the country during this campaign, could address us as no President has about the linkage between race and class, the distinction between institutional and personal racism, and about what his youth and later travels have taught him about race relations.
Frank talk brings political risk. Mr. Clinton will be urged to play it safe, to repeat the harmony cliches that have left us in conflict. But failure to speak the truth and support it with policies and programs would make him a timid nominee unable to win in November or a President unable to govern a polarized nation.
Governor Clinton has the potential to achieve much more. This voter awaits words of courage and commitment.
