HEADLINE: Show Tunes and Sinatra, With a Russian Accent

BYLINE: By JOHN OTIS

 BODY:
Their voices -- hoarse from age, but jubilant -- coalesce in song for one hour every week, issuing tunes that include Broadway hits and Frank Sinatra classics, and patriotic fare like ''God Bless America.''
And even as the music fades between songs, mouths keep moving, reverting to smiles or shouting requests for encores. 
The chorus is made up of Russian-speaking immigrants, from age 64 to 82, who moved to the United States in recent years from a smattering of republics in the former Soviet Union.
For the members of the chorus, the Learning English Through Singing Group, these sessions are a much-anticipated bright spot in lives that, at their ages, can be darkened by illness or loneliness.
''If an immigrant comes to the tunnel and doesn't see the light, it's very difficult,'' says Valentina Kharenko, a trained musician who teaches English as a second language and who leads the singing group. She said her primary goal was not to teach English, but to unite friends.
''I have been observing adaptation of immigrants for many years and I can say that it's very difficult to adapt,'' said Ms. Kharenko, who grew up and attended a university in Ukraine. ''Even if the person becomes a citizen and passes the exam, sometimes, many people are too shy to adapt into their environment, and they have several problems.''
The group is one of numerous programs supported by the Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The mission of Marks JCH is to address the needs of the neighborhood's large immigrant population, offering programs for young children and teenagers, providing job training and placement for the unemployed, and fostering a welcoming environment for older adults.
Last year, the director of administration at Marks JCH, Inna Kuznetsova, created the singing group, which usually draws 17 to 20 people per session. ''I found that some seniors have difficulty learning language,'' Ms. Kuznetsova said. ''I just wanted to find a creative way to help them learn and have fun.''
Ms. Kuznetsova created a DVD of 60 songs, complete with on-screen lyrics, which the group listens to first, before singing to the accompaniment of Ms. Kharenko's piano. The group is also provided with lyric sheets and members are encouraged to study the words on their own, in conjunction with English classes offered through Marks JCH.
One of the choristers, Nailya Derzhimanova, said she had a profoundly emotional moment when she discovered the message of ''Sunrise, Sunset'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.''
''I'd heard it lots of times before, but never knew what it was about,'' Ms. Derzhimanova said. ''The lyrics are very intellectual. After it was translated, I applied everything to my family, and began to cry.''
Connections within families are another of the program's goals. ''Our singing class is the bridge between the elder generation and the younger generation, through music, through words, through communication,'' Ms. Kharenko said.
She said the generational misunderstandings that can result from not speaking the same language and not having the same topics for discussion created a tragic gap.
''Through the songs, we speak about the problems that occur,'' Ms. Kharenko said. ''And the elder generation understands better what is happening with their grandchildren, and they adapt to the behavior of grandchildren.''
Recently, the New York City Council's discretionary funds, which supported the cultural programs for elderly people at Marks JCH, were drastically reduced, threatening the future of the singing group. So that the group could continue, $500 in Neediest Cases funds were used to pay for 12 weekly sessions, which Ms. Kharenko says are invaluable to the health and well-being of the participants.
''The environment is very warm, very flexible,'' she says. ''It is rehabilitation after disease, after illness. Many of them are very ill -- diabetes, cancer -- but they leave that in the hall. One woman was in the hospital and told me she thought she'd come to the class and 'Valentina will cure me.' I was so touched.''
Ms. Kharenko says she tries to bring out a person's inner child, so sometimes she encourages people to dance.
Sofiya Babakhodjaeva, usually one of the first to leap to her feet, seizes the opportunity.
''We are all very young,'' she says. ''Here, we say we are 18, not 80.''

HEADLINE: His Last Race, Win or Lose

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
BRISTOW, Va. -- President Obama looked out at the sea of shivering supporters at a chilly late-night rally here and soaked in the wave of blue campaign placards and the flashing of a thousand smartphone cameras.
It was 37 degrees, and he warmed his left hand in his pocket even as he jabbed at the air with his right. Midnight was approaching. It was the last rally of the last Saturday of his last campaign, and he drifted off script.
''I was backstage with David Plouffe,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd, referring to his political guru, who looked surprised as he stood offstage. ''And we were talking about how, as the campaign goes on, we've become less relevant. I'm sort of a prop in the campaign. He's just bothering a bunch of folks, calling, asking what's going on.''
Indeed, for Mr. Obama, the campaign is effectively over. Oh, there will be a final round of rallies on Monday, a final frenetic swing through swing states and plenty of Plouffe phone calls asking what is going on. But the machinery they have assiduously put in place over four years is now on remote control. The campaign is out of their hands, and so is the fate of the 44th president. 
Win, and he has a chance to secure a legacy as a president who made a mark not simply by virtue of his original barrier-breaking election but also by transforming America in his image -- for the better, he hopes; for the worse, his critics fear. Lose, and he becomes an avatar of hope and change who could not fulfill his own promise and whose programs might not survive his remarkable rise and fall.
It is in moments like these that nostalgia takes hold for a president on the precipice. With each passing day, aides said, Mr. Obama has taken note every time he passes a milestone.
''This is my last debate prep practice,'' he said at Camp David.
''This is my last walk-through,'' he said, touring a debate stage.
''This is my last debate,'' he said after squaring off a third time with Mitt Romney.
The ''lasts'' piled up on a bone-weary final weekend as he raced from Ohio to Wisconsin, Iowa to Virginia, New Hampshire to Florida and back to Ohio, then Colorado and Wisconsin again. What he hopes most is that these are not the last days of his presidency.
''You can see the nostalgia, the wistfulness, setting in,'' observed Dan Pfeiffer, one of his longest-serving advisers and now the White House communications director. ''The focus here is winning and making the case, but the last campaign of a man's life -- you every once in a while pause and think about that.''
Other than a brief interlude for Hurricane Sandy, the White House has been relocated to Air Force One for months. Mr. Obama half-jogs off the plane and half-jogs onto the stage, his coat off, his sleeves rolled up, his tie usually gone. He has grown hoarse arguing his case. Between stops, he huddles in the plane's conference room, nursing his throat with tea and scratching out his speech in longhand.
His daily routine has been upended, but he tries to keep up his workout regimen in hotel fitness centers. He eats whenever he can, usually whatever the Air Force stewards are serving aboard the plane or something brought in before a speech. Occasionally, when he stops to glad-hand at a pizza place or a doughnut shop, he may snack in the motorcade to the next campaign rally; at a Cleveland meat shop, he bought barbecue jerky.
He is happier whenever he gets time with Michelle Obama, but she has largely kept a separate schedule. Like any father on the road, he makes sure to call his wife and children every evening. To keep him company in recent weeks, friends like Marty Nesbitt and Mike Ramos have accompanied him aboard Air Force One. Between conference calls on storm recovery on Sunday, he checked out the Chicago Bears football game on the Air Force One television.
The other day, Mr. Obama landed in Chicago to vote and spotted his former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, now the city's mayor, waiting on the tarmac. A huge grin appeared on the president's face, and he pointed at Mr. Emanuel. The mayor grinned and pointed back. The two embraced like long-lost brothers and chatted happily before walking, arm in arm, to shake hands with bystanders.
''He's got his goal in eyesight, and he's driving to the basket,'' Mr. Emanuel said later. ''He's a happy warrior, I'd say.''
Happier with the debates over. He considered preparations for the first one ''a drag,'' as he put it, and got walloped. It was an eye-opener for a president who has never lacked confidence, a moment when he ''faced his own political mortality,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ''The first debate turned a switch for him. He came out of that very focused on ensuring that would never happen again.'' By his own reckoning, Mr. Obama had failed to ''communicate why he wants a second term,'' said another adviser.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who played Mr. Romney during debate rehearsals, said Mr. Obama recognized the peril. ''He just decided in his mind that he needed to bear down and win, period,'' Mr. Kerry said in an interview. ''He's a competitive guy. He's very analytical. He knows exactly what he had not done and exactly what he wanted to do.''
After coming out stronger in the later debates, Mr. Obama could finally return to the trail, where the affirmation of the crowd beats the pounding of the pundits. The crowds are smaller -- he drew 24,000 here in Bristow, compared with 60,000 and 80,000 in his final days in 2008 -- but they are enthusiastic, and he draws energy from them.
''The president seemed relaxed,'' said former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, who campaigned with him in that state. ''You don't see a lot of anxiety or frenetic behavior.''
Mr. Obama seems to enjoy his unannounced stops even more, allowing a tiny peek into his interior life. At the Common Man restaurant in Merrimack, N.H., he met a woman with two daughters. ''You can't beat daughters,'' he said, reflecting on his own, who were, he added, still at a good age: ''They still love you. They're still cute. They don't talk back too much.''
One of his favorite stops was the employee cafeteria at the Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas, where he greeted kitchen workers and room cleaners. ''For him, that was the people he's fighting for,'' Mr. Plouffe said later. ''He loves stuff like that. That was a unique one.''
It made such an impression that Mr. Obama was still talking about it a day later. ''That thing at the Bellagio yesterday was great,'' he told reporters on Air Force One. Then, recalling that his press secretary's van broke down, he joked, ''I think every trip we're going to find at least one occasion to ditch Jay Carney.''
Very rarely does Mr. Obama confront the nearly half of America that polls say do not support him, those who blame him for the economic troubles still afflicting the country. He seemed taken aback at Cleveland's West Side Market when he asked a chicken vendor how business was going.
''Terrible since you got here,'' the man said.
The vendor later told his local newspaper he had meant only that the president's party had blocked his business that day. But he inadvertently voiced the frustrations of many Americans.
Nor has Mr. Obama faced many tough questions lately, like those about the response to the attack in Benghazi, Libya, since he generally does not take questions from the reporters who trail him everywhere.
Instead, he sticks to generally friendlier broadcast interviews, sometimes giving seven minutes to a local television station or calling in to drive-time radio disc jockeys with nicknames like Roadkill.
With Michael Yo, a Miami radio host, he revealed his first job -- Baskin-Robbins, ''paid minimum wage'' -- and addressed a feud between Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj: ''I'm all about bringing people together,'' he said.
He relishes rare moments away from politics. He had dinner one night at a Washington restaurant with several swing-state Democrats who had won a contest to meet the president. He had done his homework; he knew their names and their children's names. But as he tucked into a dinner of salmon, asparagus and potatoes -- he left most of the potatoes -- he was eager not to dwell on the campaign.
''We didn't really talk about politics very much,'' said Kimberley Cathey, 41, a speech language pathologist from North Carolina. ''I don't recall really in the hour and a half we talked anything major about the election,'' said her husband, Ron, also 41. ''It was pretty much a night away from that.''
The president did contemplate the possibility of defeat, but said he and his family ''would be fine no matter what the outcome,'' Ms. Cathey said. Mario Orosa, 44, a technical specialist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, said he had asked Mr. Obama, ''What was the last thing that made you really nervous?'' The president replied, ''I don't remember.''
He is not a nervous man. But even his famous cool may be challenged on Tuesday night. For the ''prop,'' it is all over but the waiting, while Mr. Plouffe makes some calls and bothers some more folks.

HEADLINE: The Permanent Militarization of America

BYLINE: By AARON B. O'CONNELL. 
Aaron B. O'Connell, an assistant professor of history at the United States Naval Academy and a Marine reserve officer, is the author of ''Underdogs: The Making of the Modern Marine Corps.''

 BODY:
Annapolis, Md.
IN 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower left office warning of the growing power of the military-industrial complex in American life. Most people know the term the president popularized, but few remember his argument.
In his farewell address, Eisenhower called for a better equilibrium between military and domestic affairs in our economy, politics and culture. He worried that the defense industry's search for profits would warp foreign policy and, conversely, that too much state control of the private sector would cause economic stagnation. He warned that unending preparations for war were incongruous with the nation's history. He cautioned that war and warmaking took up too large a proportion of national life, with grave ramifications for our spiritual health. 
The military-industrial complex has not emerged in quite the way Eisenhower envisioned. The United States spends an enormous sum on defense -- over $700 billion last year, about half of all military spending in the world -- but in terms of our total economy, it has steadily declined to less than 5 percent of gross domestic product from 14 percent in 1953. Defense-related research has not produced an ossified garrison state; in fact, it has yielded a host of beneficial technologies, from the Internet to civilian nuclear power to GPS navigation. The United States has an enormous armaments industry, but it has not hampered employment and economic growth. In fact, Congress's favorite argument against reducing defense spending is the job loss such cuts would entail.
Nor has the private sector infected foreign policy in the way that Eisenhower warned. Foreign policy has become increasingly reliant on military solutions since World War II, but we are a long way from the Marines' repeated occupations of Haiti, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic in the early 20th century, when commercial interests influenced military action. Of all the criticisms of the 2003 Iraq war, the idea that it was done to somehow magically decrease the cost of oil is the least credible. Though it's true that mercenaries and contractors have exploited the wars of the past decade, hard decisions about the use of military force are made today much as they were in Eisenhower's day: by the president, advised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council, and then more or less rubber-stamped by Congress. Corporations do not get a vote, at least not yet.
But Eisenhower's least heeded warning -- concerning the spiritual effects of permanent preparations for war -- is more important now than ever. Our culture has militarized considerably since Eisenhower's era, and civilians, not the armed services, have been the principal cause. From lawmakers' constant use of ''support our troops'' to justify defense spending, to TV programs and video games like ''NCIS,'' ''Homeland'' and ''Call of Duty,'' to NBC's shameful and unreal reality show ''Stars Earn Stripes,'' Americans are subjected to a daily diet of stories that valorize the military while the storytellers pursue their own opportunistic political and commercial agendas. Of course, veterans should be thanked for serving their country, as should police officers, emergency workers and teachers. But no institution -- particularly one financed by the taxpayers -- should be immune from thoughtful criticism.
Like all institutions, the military works to enhance its public image, but this is just one element of militarization. Most of the political discourse on military matters comes from civilians, who are more vocal about ''supporting our troops'' than the troops themselves. It doesn't help that there are fewer veterans in Congress today than at any previous point since World War II. Those who have served are less likely to offer unvarnished praise for the military, for it, like all institutions, has its own frustrations and failings. But for non-veterans -- including about four-fifths of all members of Congress -- there is only unequivocal, unhesitating adulation. The political costs of anything else are just too high.
For proof of this phenomenon, one need look no further than the continuing furor over sequestration -- the automatic cuts, evenly divided between Pentagon and nonsecurity spending, that will go into effect in January if a deal on the debt and deficits isn't reached. As Bob Woodward's latest book reveals, the Obama administration devised the measure last year to include across-the-board defense cuts because it believed that slashing defense was so unthinkable that it would make compromise inevitable.
But after a grand budget deal collapsed, in large part because of resistance from House Republicans, both parties reframed sequestration as an attack on the troops (even though it has provisions that would protect military pay). The fact that sequestration would also devastate education, health and programs for children has not had the same impact.
Eisenhower understood the trade-offs between guns and butter. ''Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed,'' he warned in 1953, early in his presidency. ''The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.''
He also knew that Congress was a big part of the problem. (In earlier drafts, he referred to the ''military-industrial-Congressional'' complex, but decided against alienating the legislature in his last days in office.) Today, there are just a select few in public life who are willing to question the military or its spending, and those who do -- from the libertarian Ron Paul to the leftist Dennis J. Kucinich -- are dismissed as unrealistic.
The fact that both President Obama and Mitt Romney are calling for increases to the defense budget (in the latter case, above what the military has asked for) is further proof that the military is the true ''third rail'' of American politics. In this strange universe where those without military credentials can't endorse defense cuts, it took a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. Mike Mullen, to make the obvious point that the nation's ballooning debt was the biggest threat to national security.
Uncritical support of all things martial is quickly becoming the new normal for our youth. Hardly any of my students at the Naval Academy remember a time when their nation wasn't at war. Almost all think it ordinary to hear of drone strikes in Yemen or Taliban attacks in Afghanistan. The recent revelation of counterterrorism bases in Africa elicits no surprise in them, nor do the military ceremonies that are now regular features at sporting events. That which is left unexamined eventually becomes invisible, and as a result, few Americans today are giving sufficient consideration to the full range of violent activities the government undertakes in their names.
Were Eisenhower alive, he'd be aghast at our debt, deficits and still expanding military-industrial complex. And he would certainly be critical of the ''insidious penetration of our minds'' by video game companies and television networks, the news media and the partisan pundits. With so little knowledge of what Eisenhower called the ''lingering sadness of war'' and the ''certain agony of the battlefield,'' they have done as much as anyone to turn the hard work of national security into the crass business of politics and entertainment.

HEADLINE: Challenger at the Crossroads

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
DENVER -- As he ponders two futures, one in the White House, the other back home in Belmont, Mass., Mitt Romney is juggling two books: ''Mornings on Horseback,'' a biography of President Theodore Roosevelt, and ''The Faithful Spy,'' an escapist thriller about a daring C.I.A. agent.
He wakes up around 5 a.m. for a workout and a conference call with his senior staff members, as he has all year, but he is adjusting to one of the new burdens of a would-be president: a widening security bubble that keeps him from popping into McDonald's to grab his favorite Fruit and Maple Oatmeal and from regularly hitting the hotel gym. (An elliptical machine now awaits him in most hotel rooms.)
And although supporters have started to call Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, ''Mr. President'' wherever he goes, he returns several times a day to an airplane seat whose custom-made headrest reminds him, in bright red and white stitching, that for now he remains just ''The Gov.'' 
In the frenzied, final days of a roller-coaster two-year run for president, Mr. Romney, the Republican nominee, has arrived at a strange and unfamiliar moment. The political prize that eluded him in 2008, and his father, George, four decades before that, is suddenly within agonizingly close reach, despite it all: an ugly and seemingly endless primary, wall-to-wall attacks by Democrats on the private equity firm he founded, a botched foreign trip and, not infrequently, gaffes.
All around him, aides who as recently as a month ago had been steeling themselves for defeat, murmuring that they had never really envisioned a job in the White House anyway, are now allowing themselves to privately muse about what life in Washington would be like.
Their boss is doing the same.
At a rally on Friday night, Mr. Romney stood before more than 20,000 cheering Ohioans, with his five sons sitting off to the side in red or navy ''Romney-Ryan'' fleeces. ''Tonight we entered the final weekend of the campaign,'' Mr. Romney told supporters in West Chester. ''At Obama rallies, they're saying, 'Four more years.' We have a different cry, of course. What is it?''
The crowd began chanting: ''Four more days! Four more days!''
''Exactly right,'' Mr. Romney said.
He knows, of course, that it could all end for him on Tuesday inside a ballroom at the Boston Convention Center, a prospect that would snuff a decade's climb through the ranks of American politics. He is 65, and it is hard to imagine a third presidential campaign. But for now, he seems to be willing himself into the presidency, as much for the confidence of his staff as for motivating the undecided voters who may glimpse him on television.
On Friday, he started to read the line of a speech loaded into his teleprompter for a rally at a warehouse in West Allis, Ohio. ''I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers,'' the prepared text had him saying. ''I will.''
He decided to tweak the wording. ''When I am president,'' he added, his voice rising, ''I will.''
He has pushed for a closing campaign message that outlines his plans for ''Day One'' in the White House -- a phrase that now appears on his signs and podiums and in his stump speech. In private conversations with staff members, he has begun dropping references to ''January,'' as he envisions how he might govern.
''This is a person who realizes that the presidency is within his grasp,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser who has worked with Mr. Romney for the past decade.
The changes in Mr. Romney's mood and demeanor over the past few weeks are subtle, those close him to say. Mr. Romney has never been known for Clintonian eruptions of emotion. But he now exudes a new and unmistakable confidence.
At the end of a giant rally, held a few days ago at a high school football field in Land O' Lakes, Fla., Mr. Romney did something unusual for him. He raced through an open corridor on the field, both arms extended as he high-fived the eager voters, celebrity style. ''You don't see Mitt walk into a donor meeting slapping high fives,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''It's just a very different mood and feel.''
Mr. Romney started the fall with an unhurried public schedule of just a few events a week, bogged down with fund-raising commitments and reluctant to plunge too quickly into the sleepless, barnstorming phase of the race. Now, he is cramming three or four events into each day, a wearying regimen that has occasionally become apparent in his hoarse voice and verbal slips.
At a rally in Des Moines on Sunday, Mr. Romney flubbed one of his signature stump speech lines: ''Employment is higher today than when Barack Obama took office,'' he said, accidentally substituting ''employment'' for ''unemployment.''
Recalling his visit late last week with the owner of a struggling barbecue restaurant in Richmond, Va., he blanked on the company's age. ''She said, 'We're closing down for good after 82 years' -- was it 62 or 82?'' he said. ''Well, it's one of the two. After 62 or 82 years, she's closing down.'' To limit exhaustion-induced errors, Mr. Romney is increasing his use of teleprompters in the last days of the race, aides said.
The disciplined candidate is also letting down his guard in unexpected ways. In Ohio last week, he broke from his usual script to reflect on the exhausting work of running for president. ''This job,'' he said, ''is quite an undertaking.''
Later, he talked about the difficulty of relaxing after hectic hours of campaigning. ''I get so much energy from you, by the way, that at the end of the day, it takes me a long time to slow down and fall asleep,'' he told thousands of people on a field in Davenport, Iowa.
Two years into the race, Mr. Romney's interior life remains something of a mystery -- not just to voters but even to some of his aides. He seems capable of truly unwinding only in the company of his family. He eschews the raucous staff dinners and late-night strategy huddles that are a staple of campaign life. At night, he sometimes eats alone in his hotel room, savoring his solitude over takeout that aides order from nearby restaurants.
Aboard his plane, he devotes little time to chitchat. ''He just goes right to his seat, takes out his iPad and gets to work,'' said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser.
He makes a point of talking to his wife, Ann -- who is keeping her own slightly less demanding schedule of rallies and talks -- every day in conversations squeezed in on the plane just before takeoff, in his sport-utility vehicle between events or at night back in his hotel room. On Sundays, he calls each of his five sons -- all of whom have been campaigning with him recently -- to check in, sometimes patching them into a conference call.
He is a careful student of the race that has enveloped his life. When he boards the front cabin of his campaign plane each morning, aides have already arranged the local and national newspapers on the table before him. He is a scanner of headlines and photos, not a cover-to-cover reader, they said. (''Four Days to Seal the Deal,'' was the first headline he saw Friday, on the cover of USA Today.)
On the plane that now doubles as his home on the road, he stocks peanut butter, honey and whole wheat bread, the components of his go-to sandwich. Hidden away, in an overhead bin or a nearby fridge, are his guilty pleasures: granola bars, pita chips, Kit Kats, Snickers and Greek yogurt with honey. (''The Greek yogurt industry has got to have a boost, just from the front of the plane,'' Mr. Madden said.)
In the waning days of the race, Mr. Romney's world has become smaller and ever more tightly controlled. He no longer ventures to the press cabin of his plane, as he used to, apparently fearing an encounter that could change the contours of the race.
After the third presidential debate, reporters asked Mr. Madden if Mr. Romney might hold a news conference to talk about the last days of the campaign. Mr. Madden scoffed: if you want to know what the candidate thinks, he said, listen to his speeches.
''The door to a brighter future is there, it's open, it's waiting for us,'' Mr. Romney likes to say at the end of his speeches now. ''I need your vote, I need your help. Walk with me, walk together.''
On Saturday, he surrounded himself with his entire team of top advisers, who made a rare joint appearance on his plane for the closing 72 hours of the race. Many of them have worked with him since his days in the Massachusetts Statehouse, and he wanted them by his side.
Over the weekend, he took out his iPhone and began to surreptitiously record video of his aides asleep in their seats. As he prowled the cabin, laughing quietly to himself, he seemed to understand that come Tuesday, win or lose, this chapter of his life would be over.

HEADLINE: Increase Seen In Suicide Rate Since Recession

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
The rate of suicide in the United States rose sharply during the first few years since the start of the recession, a new analysis has found.
In the report, which appeared Sunday on the Web site of The Lancet, a medical journal, researchers found that the rate between 2008 and 2010 increased four times faster than it did in the eight years before the recession. The rate had been increasing by an average of 0.12 deaths per 100,000 people from 1999 through 2007. In 2008, the rate began increasing by an average of 0.51 deaths per 100,000 people a year. Without the increase in the rate, the total deaths from suicide each year in the United States would have been lower by about 1,500, the study said. 
The finding was not unexpected. Suicide rates often spike during economic downturns, and recent studies of rates in Greece, Spain and Italy have found similar trends. The new study is the first to analyze the rate of change in the United States state by state, using suicide and unemployment data through 2010.
''The magnitude of these effects is slightly larger than for those previously estimated in the United States,'' the authors wrote. That might mean that this economic downturn has been harder on mental health than previous ones, the authors concluded.
The research team linked the suicide rate to unemployment, using numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Every rise of 1 percent in unemployment was accompanied by an increase in the suicide rate of roughly 1 percent, it found. A similar correlation has been found in some European countries since the recession.
The analysis found that the link between unemployment and suicide was about the same in all regions of the country.
The study was conducted by Aaron Reeves of the University of Cambridge and Sanjay Basu of Stanford, and included researchers from the University of Bristol, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Crippled Supply Chain Puts Holiday Shopping at Risk

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The economic effects of Hurricane Sandy are reverberating beyond areas hit by the storm as businesses warn customers of delays, try to get merchandise out of closed ports and face canceled orders.
In addition to shutting down shipping terminals and submerging warehouses, the storm also tangled up deliveries because of downed power lines, closed roads and scarce gasoline in parts of New York and New Jersey.
The supply chain is backing up at a crucial time, just as retailers normally bring their final shipments into stores for the holiday shopping season, which retailers depend on for annual profitability.
''Things are slowing down,'' said Chris Merritt, vice president for retail supply chain solutions at the trucking company Ryder. ''This whole part of the supply chain is clogged up.'' 
FedEx, for example, has rented fuel tankers to supply its delivery trucks as commercial gas stations run dry. Ryder has been hunting down rental trucks to add capacity. CSX, the major railroad company, was continuing to advise customers to expect delays of at least 72 hours on shipments. And retailers ranging from Amazon to Diane von Furstenberg have told customers to expect delays on shipments.
Many economists expect the storm to shave up to half a percentage point from growth in the fourth quarter. That is a big reduction, with growth estimated to reach an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent before the storm, and the economy facing other significant headwinds, including fiscal uncertainty in Washington.
While economic losses from the storm are expected to be significantly lower than those from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, this storm's impact has been intensified because the Northeast is densely populated.
The region is responsible for about $3 trillion in output, or roughly 20 percent of the country's total gross domestic product, said Gregory Daco, a senior economist with IHS Global Insight. ''Part of what was lost will be delayed, but part is lost forever,'' Mr. Daco said.
Last week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that all of its major marine terminals were closed by the storm. While parts of the system have started to reopen, delays persist. The New York area's port system is the largest on the East Coast, and the third largest in the nation. Last year, it handled $208 billion in cargo.
As a result of the closings, delays may ripple through the holiday season, according to Paul Tsui, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics. As of Sunday, almost all rail service from the ports was suspended, terminals were damaged and much of the ports' equipment was being reviewed to see if it still worked.
Several customers with facilities in the New York area told him ''their warehouses are totally damaged, and presume the merchandise inside will have to be reported lost to insurance companies,'' Mr. Tsui said.
''We are now coming into the cutoff for seasonal orders for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays,'' he added, and companies that missed shipment deadlines must either send products by expensive air freight, pay a penalty to retailers for late shipments or face canceled orders.
Mr. Merritt of Ryder said he expected that some items that have already been advertised for sales on the day after Thanksgiving -- traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year -- would not get to stores in time.
The delays are hitting smaller merchants like Robert Van Sickle particularly hard.
His pet supply company, Polka Dog Bakery, was relying on a shipment of cardboard tubes from China with a merry design, intended to hold popular holiday dog treats. The products represent about 15 percent of sales at the company. But the New York Container Terminal in Staten Island, where the tubes arrived shortly before the storm, was devastated, and Mr. Van Sickle's freight forwarder has been unable to track down the containers.
It is too late to reorder the tubes from China in time for the holidays, and Mr. Van Sickle has tens of thousands of baked dog treats piled up at his Boston headquarters. Insurance will cover the cost of the cardboard tubes, but not the finished products, and those payments will not come close to making up for lost revenue.
Last week, he was forced to call customers like L.L. Bean and tell them he probably could not fulfill their orders. ''Without this product, we're in trouble,'' Mr. Van Sickle said. ''I am a business owner and this is pretty much my year.''
In Cape May, N.J., Rich Layton's six-week-old start-up, Layton Sports Cards, was supposed to be shipping sports card orders all week. But his apartment partially flooded, his Allentown distributor could not find clear roads to get to him, and U.P.S. held his other deliveries during the storm.
''It's thousands of dollars worth of cards that people were already paying for,'' Mr. Layton said.
As the days passed, Mr. Layton spent $1,000 on cards at a local shop, and gave most of them away on a live webcam feed to try to pacify customers. ''It pushed my entire business back five days, and I've been begging and pleading with my customers to please be understanding,'' he said. He ordered replacement cards on Friday, paying $170 for overnight delivery so he could start distributing them to customers.
Wayfair.com, an online home-goods retailer, said about 1,300 of its 4,000 suppliers were hit by everything from loss of power to flooding. Niraj Shah, Wayfair's chief executive, said his site adjusted, removing two-day shipping offers for affected products and taking some merchandise off the site.
For suppliers who cannot get up and running soon, Mr. Shah said, ''at this point, it is too late to get more inventory in for the holidays. If inventory's gotten ruined because of flooding or they're closed for two weeks, to be honest, it's a tough time of year for that.''
Retailers are facing smaller headaches, too. At REI, whose SoHo store lost power last Monday night, employees took groups of customers around in the dark last week, aided by headlamps and flashlights. While the store was able to accept payments, its regular flow of merchandise was thrown off. Once power was restored on Friday, employees had to manually count and order merchandise, said Les Hatton, northeast retail director for REI.
Grocery stores and others that depend on perishable items are facing trouble, as delays of several days in meat or produce deliveries can mean ruined products. ''They get impacted by the ability to access the stores because the roads are not repaired yet, the traffic, the ability to get even a truck driver to drive to the stores,'' said Kumar Venkataraman, a partner at the consulting firm A.T. Kearney.
As for Mr. Van Sickle of Polka Dog Bakery, he has been struggling with a sense of guilt for worrying about his dog food containers at a time when the storm has destroyed homes and killed people. He is considering repackaging the biscuits and donating proceeds to storm relief efforts.
''It's been really difficult to take stock of what's happening on the ground in New York and New Jersey,'' he said, ''versus what's happening in my little office in Boston, where I'm calling my important customers and saying, 'I'm sorry, guys, I don't think you're going to get any product'.''

HEADLINE: Candidates Make Last Pleas As Legal Skirmishes Begin

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Des Moines, Lizette Alvarez from Miami, and Michael Barbaro from Morrisville, Pa.

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- President Obama and Mitt Romney hunted for last-minute support on Sunday in a frenetic sprint across battleground states, even as their parties faced off in the first of what could be a growing number of legal disputes over presidential ballots and how they are counted.
In Florida, the state's Democratic Party filed a lawsuit on Sunday morning that would force the Republican-led government to extend early voting in South Florida after complaints that extremely long lines on Saturday had prevented some people from casting their ballots. The Republican-controlled Legislature cut back early voting, which ended Saturday, from 14 days to eight.
The lawsuit was followed by a chaotic day in the Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade County, which opened one of its election offices for two hours to accept completed absentee ballots and then shut down only to reopen again on Sunday afternoon. Three counties said they would open again on Monday, but Democratic lawyers will continue to argue in court that in-person early voting should continue through Tuesday in Broward County. 
In Ohio, Republican election officials will go to court on Monday to defend an 11th-hour directive to local election officials that critics say could invalidate thousands of provisional ballots by forcing voters to attest to the type of identification they provide.
Together, the pre-election legal skirmishes were a potential preview of the clashes that could emerge in as many as a half-dozen swing states over Tuesday's voting. The closeness of the races in those states has intensified the stakes of voter turnout, smooth operations at polling places, ballot problems and recounts.
In the battles, Republicans are mobilizing to defend against what they say is the potential for voter fraud, and Democrats are preparing to protect against what they say are efforts to suppress voting rights.
''The larger issue, in my view, is the scale of the effort that is required to have Election Day run smoothly,'' said Robert Bauer, the chief counsel for Mr. Obama's campaign. ''Any number of things can go wrong, not by anybody's fault or intention, but we are fully prepared and so, we believe, are election officials around the country.''
On the campaign trail, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney presented themselves as agents of change while painting the other as an obstacle -- final arguments in a nip-and-tuck race that may hinge on the success of the campaigns' elaborate turnout operations.
''The question of this election comes down to this,'' Mr. Romney told a crowd of about 4,500 on Sunday morning in Des Moines. ''Do you want four more years like the last four years, or do you want real change? President Obama promised change, but he couldn't deliver it.''
Speaking to 23,000 people on a high school football field in Hollywood, Fla., Mr. Obama scoffed at Mr. Romney's bid to claim the mantle of change, deriding him as a political quick-change artist who is repackaging the failed policies of previous Republican administrations.
''When you make this choice, part of what you're choosing is who do you trust,'' Mr. Obama said. ''After four years as president, you know me by now. You know I mean what I say and I say what I mean.''
Racing the sun as well as the clock, both campaigns brimmed with confidence about their chances on Tuesday, though polls showed Mr. Obama holding a slender lead in several of the battleground states he needs to win the Electoral College. That advantage was evident in the itineraries of the two men on Sunday.
While each covered familiar ground from New Hampshire to Ohio, Mr. Romney sought to open a new front with a rally in Pennsylvania. Tightening polls have given him hope that he can take the state from Mr. Obama, who won there by a double-digit margin in 2008. But the president's advisers dismissed the foray as a desperate move by a challenger running out of other paths to victory.
At the rally in Morrisville on Sunday, Mr. Romney made a point of mentioning a high-profile supporter, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose lavish praise of Mr. Obama's leadership after Hurricane Sandy has raised Republican eyebrows.
''He's giving it all of his heart and his passion to help the people of his state,'' Mr. Romney said of the governor.
In Hollywood, Fla., Mr. Obama was endorsed by Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop artist, one of many celebrities lined up by the campaigns to help draw crowds. In Pennsylvania, the Marshall Tucker Band warmed up the audience for Mr. Romney, while Stevie Wonder played ''Signed, Sealed, Delivered'' for Mr. Obama at a rally in Cincinnati.
Hours earlier in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama spoke to 14,000 people beneath the gold dome of the State House in Concord on a bright, chilly day that recalled any number of days that he and other hopefuls had walked the streets in their quest for a victory in the nation's first presidential primaries.
Nearby was a reminder of how the state almost dashed his dreams in 2008. On a line of paving stones in front of the New Hampshire State Library are chiseled the names of winners in the state's primary, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose victory there halted, for a time, Mr. Obama's surge after he won the Iowa caucus.
On this Sunday, however, Mr. Obama had the fortifying presence of former President Bill Clinton, who noted approvingly in his introductory speech that Mr. Obama wanted to accomplish many of the same things that Mr. Clinton had during his two terms in office.
''The test should be: What did the president do? What are the results? And compared to what?'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Compared to what could have happened, Barack Obama has done a good job.''
Savoring the moment, his voice not yet raw from too many speeches, Mr. Clinton gleefully accused Mr. Romney of shifting his position on the bailout of the automakers so many times that he could find work as ''chief contortionist in Cirque du Soleil.''
Moments earlier, in Des Moines, Mr. Romney told his supporters that the clock had nearly run out on the president's time in office, and he promised to usher in a new era of economic hope for families who are struggling across the country.
''Instead of building bridges, he's made the divide wider,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Let me tell you why it is he's fallen so short of what he promised: it's because he cared more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the economy.''
Mr. Romney led the crowd in a call and response: ''I mean, do you think Obamacare created jobs? Did his war on coal, oil and gas create jobs? Did Dodd-Frank regulations help banks make more loans? Does raising taxes put people to work?''
''No,'' the crowd cried out in response to each question.
Iowa was also the scene of skirmishing over voting, as Republicans on Sunday night accused Democratic operatives of encouraging older voters to illegally fill out absentee ballots for their family members. A letter to the state's top election official from the chief counsel of the Republican National Committee said that a news report of ''the alleged conduct of Democratic and Obama operatives, if true, is highly disconcerting.''
With the election being waged most intensely in fewer than a dozen states, the candidates seemed to be shadowboxing each other, with one arriving in a state just hours after the other left.
After Iowa, Mr. Romney held rallies in Ohio and Virginia. He planned events in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and New Hampshire on Monday.
Mr. Obama went from Concord to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Cincinnati. He then headed for Aurora, Colo., and was scheduled to arrive in Madison, Wis., not long before dawn on Monday.

HEADLINE: Iowa Farmers Could Give Romney a Lift, Despite President's Stance on Agriculture

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
HAMBURG, Iowa -- In the four years since he voted for President Obama, Ivan Woltemath has expanded his farm operation here, updated his equipment and paid down his debt. Business, and life, are good.
Yet to him, personal success takes a back seat to another nagging concern: the swelling national debt.
''That's a big thing to farmers,'' said Mr. Woltemath, 71. ''You cannot run a business that way, and I just don't see how you can run a government that way. If you're $16 trillion in debt, my, isn't it time to stop spending and address that?''
Mr. Woltemath, a registered Democrat, said he would probably vote for Mitt Romney this year. 
Mr. Obama won this battleground state four years ago in part by making mammoth gains among voters in the rural, agriculture-centric regions in the west. In Adams County, for instance, he flipped a 15-point Democratic loss in 2004 into a three-point victory in 2008.
But that was against Senator John McCain, a Republican, who provoked the agricultural community in Iowa with a hostile stance toward ethanol and the farm bill, which provided a federal safety net for farmers but expired on Sept. 30 this year. Mr. Romney has adopted a friendlier tack with farmers, as both sides scrape for the support of rural voters -- a group that makes up about a third of the state's electorate and could sway the tight race for Iowa's six electoral votes.
''The rural vote's going to be very important,'' said Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican who supports Mr. Romney. ''That's kind of been the backbone of the Republican strength in Iowa.''
Nationwide, Mr. Obama lost the rural vote to Mr. McCain, 53 percent to 45 percent, according to exit polls. But that was a significant improvement over Senator John Kerry's 19-point loss to President George W. Bush among rural voters in 2004. Here in Iowa, Mr. Obama cut the Democratic deficit among rural voters to 3 percentage points in 2008 from 12 in the previous election.
Mr. Romney unveiled his agricultural agenda at an event last month on an Iowa farm, proposing a plan that he said would reduce tax and regulatory burdens on farmers, bring down energy costs and increase their financial strength through trade.
He has been supportive of the renewable fuel standard, which mandates the use of ethanol in gasoline, and says he supports the passage of a federal farm bill, though he has not said whether he favors the legislation that stalled this fall in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
The Romney campaign has run advertisements in the agricultural media and has started a coalition called Farmers for Romney, whose co-director is Bill Northey, Iowa's elected agriculture secretary.
The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has made its own assertive efforts to appeal to rural voters, setting up offices in 27 small towns throughout the state and deploying volunteers to talk to neighbors and emphasize issues like the president's support of the wind energy tax credit -- and Mr. Romney's opposition to it.
They tell voters that Mr. Obama wants to make sure rural Iowans are not paying higher tax rates than upper-income earners. In August, Mr. Obama spent three days touring rural parts of the state and rallying voters.
Several farmers said the issues they cared most about this election stretched beyond agriculture.
''They're going to tax the hell out of everybody,'' said Jim Gregory, 73, a Romney supporter who runs a grain and cattle feeding operation in southwest Iowa. ''The small-business guy, he's going to get hit too.''
Mr. Gregory also raised concerns about the estate tax, saying that ''when a farmer works all his life and tries to accumulate enough for retirement'' and then the government takes a large percentage ''on the death tax, that is not right.''
The current estate tax rate of 35 percent, applied only to portions of estates that exceed $10 million in value for couples, is scheduled to expire next year. If it does, the rate will jump to 55 percent and be applied to portions of estates exceeding $2 million for couples. Mr. Romney has proposed repealing the estate tax. Mr. Obama has proposed returning it to the rate that was in place when he took office: 45 percent, with a $7 million exemption for couples.
Jon Schaben, a crop and livestock farmer in western Iowa, said Mr. Obama's approach was fair. ''I hope that I make enough money that I'm one of them that gets to give more,'' he said, adding that he worried that the Romney tax plan would hurt farmers because Mr. Romney has pledged to eliminate tax deductions.
''I can name 100 deductions that are beneficial to farmers and ranchers that could potentially be cut with a Romney plan,'' Mr. Schaben said.
He also said Mr. Obama deserved credit for the strong agricultural economy -- record revenues are expected this year -- citing as an example the benefits of the ethanol fuel standard, which the president supports.
Mr. Obama has championed the farm bill, said Kelly Tobin, 81, who farms about 450 acres of corn and soybeans in southwestern Iowa. Mr. Tobin blamed House Republicans for its expiration.
But Romney supporters say that Mr. Obama did not show leadership in farm bill negotiations and that the agricultural economy's strength was due more to market forces than to anything the president had done.
The agricultural economy cannot be sustained with the president's fiscal habits, said Randy Euken, a Romney supporter who farms 2,400 acres of crops and has 150 cows in southwestern Iowa.
''If you spend like a fool, you're going to look like a fool someday,'' he said.
If anything, Mr. Obama's detractors say, the administration has threatened agriculture by proposing expensive regulations. But Mr. Tobin said some of the regulations were necessary because farmers did not do enough to police themselves and prevent environmental hazards like soil erosion.
For Dan Sturm, who farms 700 acres of corn and soybeans here in Hamburg, Mr. Obama's health care law is an example of the government control he dislikes.
''Should I pay for somebody's abortion or pay for somebody's pill?'' Mr. Sturm asked. ''No, I don't believe I should.''
The president also faces cultural challenges in rural Iowa, where there is a strong Christian base that opposes same-sex marriage and abortion.
Glen Stenzel, a crop farmer here, said that even though Mr. Obama is a Christian, he had reservations.
''His religious background really concerns me, or lack of,'' Mr. Stenzel said. ''There's a lot of things in his background, where he came from and what his family ties -- one thing or another -- are.''

HEADLINE: The Republican Id

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Oxford, Ohio
This patch of southern Ohio between Cincinnati and Dayton is not the up-for-grabs Ohio you've read so much about. This is decided country, where House Speaker John Boehner is running for re-election unopposed, where ''Defeat Obama'' and ''Romney/Ryan'' lawn signs glisten in the chilly drizzle.
At the heart of it is a university whose students, according to a poll by the campus paper, favor Romney by 49 percent to 40 percent, and tend to think, as one senior half-joked, ''that Sean Hannity is the news.'' This is clearly not the place to gauge the last-minute mood swings of a state that many consider decisive. 
It is, however, an interesting place to ponder the governing mentality of a Romney/Ryan administration, if that is what voters deliver on Tuesday. Miami University, a pretty grid of red brick, lawns and autumn foliage, is the place where Paul Ryan's view of the world jelled, under the tutelage of an economist he describes as his mentor. I decided to spend my last column before the election peeking through this little window into the Republican id. If Mitt Romney is our next president, many in the party hope Ryan will play the role of chief ideologist. And if Romney loses, Ryan starts the 2016 campaign for his party's nomination near the front of the line.
Ryan's alma mater draws mostly white, upper-middle-class students from Midwest Republican families that are attracted to Miami as a place unlikely to turn their children against them. A well-endowed business school (Ryan majored in economics and political science) and a robust frat culture (Ryan was an enthusiastic Delta Tau Delta) tend to reinforce the conservative values represented by the Republican ticket -- with one important asterisk we'll get to later. In 2008, many Miami students veered out of character, thrilled by the historic Obama campaign, but now that enthusiasm has given way to disappointment and to something few of these kids have ever experienced: economic anxiety.
The macroeconomics professor who helped shape Paul Ryan is a voluble, passionate supply-sider and self-described ''hard-core libertarian'' named William R. Hart, known as Rich. Listening to him, you can imagine that you are hearing what Paul Ryan would say if he were not inhibited by the demands of electoral politics. Hart is the opposite of politic -- to the point of regularly, publicly denouncing Miami University for what he regards as declining academic rigor and coddling of students, all in the university's pursuit of ''money, money, money.'' Hart is not a coddler. He proudly reports that of the 112 students who took his latest Principles of Macroeconomics exam, 56 failed and 27 got D's.
Rich Hart does not speak for Paul Ryan, but he spent many hours talking to Ryan, his eager student, and regards the candidate as a good friend and kindred spirit. What they share is an enduring and astringent kind of Republicanism that rests on a reverence for self-reliance, a conviction that government assistance leads to crippling dependency.
Hart sees the election not as a difference of approaches but a clash of philosophies. ''Do we want to become a sort of European socialist welfare state?'' he asked when we chatted in his office, decorated with Elvis and Nascar memorabilia, with Paul Krugman's economics textbook demoted to a doorstop. ''Or do we want to be a free-market capitalist economy where people who are productive get rewarded for working hard and creating wealth? What happens with these European welfare states is, everybody's equally poor. I much prefer a little income inequality.''
Hart's policy expectations for a Romney/Ryan regime are familiar from the campaign. They include rolling back environmental regulations that slow development of natural gas and coal. (''Not green energy,'' he said with disgust. ''Fossil fuel energy.'') They include entrusting health care for the poor, and as much else as possible, to the mercies of the states; requiring that Medicare compete in a voucher market; cutting marginal tax rates, of course. What is striking, talking to Ryan's mentor, is not the policies but the fervor and the deep suspicion of the other side's motives.
''My liberal friends say, well, Paul Ryan doesn't care about the poor,'' Hart said. ''I would argue it's the Democrats who don't care about the poor. They're the ones that make them wards of the state. And just write them welfare checks.''
This enslavement, as Hart sees it, is not well-intentioned nannying gone wrong, but cynical self-interest by liberal groups: ''My view of the N.A.A.C.P. is, you can't represent a group of downtrodden if you don't have a permanent group of downtrodden to represent.''
Ryan, his former professor says, wants to ''make these people productive members of society, where they can lift themselves up. Maybe others think along these lines, but he's the only one that would actually try to implement policies.''
In his infamous 47-percent video and in some of his primary-season rhetoric, Mitt Romney leaned toward this view -- that programs like food stamps and welfare and jobless benefits and the minimum wage had produced a parasite class. But in Romney, that feels like a casual attitude born of lifelong privilege. In Ryan, I think, it is bedrock. It's not just a belief that austerity works, but an embrace of austerity as a moral imperative.
''I don't know how I would have handled the 47 percent comment, if only because I would never have said such a thing,'' Hart told me. ''Although I understand the context of the remark given the dependency state that government policies have created for so many. Instead, I would have stressed from the outset the need for policies to end long-term dependency by so many on government handouts, policies that wean them off the taxpayer dole and make them productive elements of society -- make them givers rather than takers.''
The vision of hands-off government will strike many -- strikes me -- as harsh, and particularly harsh now, against the backdrop of the storm's ravages. Romney spent last week avoiding his earlier suggestion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency be disbanded, and you aren't hearing anything of the kind from Ryan. When I put that to Hart in a follow-up e-mail, he replied, a little grudgingly, that it was ''not inappropriate to have a federal agency to 'coordinate' relief efforts after national disasters. Having said that, my bet is FEMA, like most government agencies, is too big/bloated and could coordinate relief efforts with (far) fewer resources than it currently receives from taxpayers.''
It is possible that Romney's inherent pragmatism, the moderation that emerged late in his campaign, could drive his presidency. I hope so. But that would require the cooperation of Ryan's fellow House Republicans, who revere Ryan more than Romney and who seem unlikely to regard a Republican victory as a mandate for compromise.
''I just don't think Paul would have gotten on the ticket if he didn't get some kind of firm commitment,'' Hart told me.
The one area where Ryan's libertarian mentor is utterly out of sync with the Republican ticket is on social issues like abortion rights and gay marriage. ''I want the Democrats out of my damn pocketbook,'' he said, ''and I want the Republicans out of my bedroom.''
This is also where Miami University's student body is about as liberal as the rest of its generation, according to the university's own research. Ryan's no-exceptions opposition to abortion and embrace of the Defense of Marriage Act are such anathema here that the campus Republican chairman, Baylor Myers, told me his executive committee voted to avoid social issues altogether.
''We won't discuss it this election,'' he said. ''Our entire focus is economic.'' He added that he wished the national Republican Party would drop abortion from its platform and ''reform its position'' on gay rights. Because if the economy revives and questions of jobs and growth no longer overshadow issues of personal liberty, Paul Ryan can no longer count on being the big man on this campus.

HEADLINE: Unions Recruit New Allies To Fight for the President

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
MILWAUKEE -- Dressed in a ski jacket to protect her from the morning chill, Sandy Jacobs, an occupational therapist, arrived at a fading, nearly century-old two-family home and knocked on one of the doors.
When no one answered within a few seconds, she knocked on the second one, and suddenly Kimberly Montgomery answered the first door. Ms. Jacobs, a member of the American Federation of Teachers, asked, ''Are you going to vote?'' Ms. Montgomery responded, ''I've already voted -- for Barack Obama of course.''
Suddenly the adjacent door opened -- it was Ms. Montgomery's sister, Angela. She said she had not voted yet, but she promised she would -- also for Mr. Obama. 
Theirs were among the 69,176 doors that union leaders said were part of a statewide labor canvass in Wisconsin on Saturday. In labor's last-minute campaign efforts, canvassers in Eau Claire, Kenosha, La Crosse, Racine, Green Bay and other communities carried the same message: Do not forget to vote, and when you do, cast ballots for President Obama and Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate for Senate.
With labor's political influence having fallen short in the 2010 elections and with membership declining, unions are hoping that two new strategies will strengthen their efforts this time around. They have welcomed members of outside groups like MoveOn.org, the N.A.A.C.P. and Planned Parenthood to join their canvasses and phone banks. And for the first time, union members -- as a result of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision -- can call and visit not just union households, but nonunion ones too.
With just 12 percent of American workers in unions, canvassers had often knocked on one door and then skipped 10 others before reaching another union household. Now they can knock on every door.
''In 2000, canvassers might be able to reach only 20 doors in a two-hour shift, but now they can knock on 40 or 45 doors,'' said Sasha Bruce, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s national campaigns manager. ''And when we get people from other groups to join in, we're literally knocking on hundreds of thousands more doors than we have the capacity to do on our own.''
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, said on Thursday that labor's ''final four-day push'' would see people knock on 5.5 million doors and make 5.2 million phone calls. He said the effort would help Mr. Obama capture Wisconsin and Ohio.
But Sara Fagen, the White House political director under President George W. Bush, said labor's effort would be smaller and less enthusiastic than in 2008 because so many unionized workers were feeling squeezed economically and were disappointed that Mr. Obama did not enact measures like the ''card check'' bill that would make it easier to unionize workers, which was blocked by Republicans.
''While unions are doing a lot and spending a lot, members are hurting and a little disillusioned, so we won't see as much on their part as in 2008,'' Ms. Fagen said.
Labor leaders say union members in Wisconsin and Ohio are invigorated, rather than disillusioned, because they are angry about laws pushed by those states' governors to curb the bargaining rights of government employees. Unions mounted a successful effort to repeal the Ohio law through a referendum last November, but they failed in their bid to oust the governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, in a vote in June.
''Unions have basically been in campaign mode for two years,'' said William Powell Jones, a University of Wisconsin labor historian. ''They're stronger as a result.''
On Saturday in Kenosha, eight MoveOn volunteers joined about 30 union members, including a dozen teachers from the Chicago area, to knock on doors. Ryan Canney of MoveOn expressed frustration that no one answered at two-thirds of the homes, although he left fliers as reminders to vote.
Mr. Canney had planned to canvass again on Sunday, but not until after the Green Bay Packers game. ''The last thing you want to do is knock on someone's door during a Packers game,'' he said.
Adam Ruben, MoveOn's political director, said he saw considerable benefit in teaming up his group's seven million members with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s more than 10 million members and retirees. MoveOn has repeatedly sent e-mails urging members to report to union halls nearby for canvasses.
''They have the physical infrastructure you need, the expertise, the resources,'' Mr. Ruben said. ''We bring online organizing expertise.''
Phil Neuenfeldt, the president of the Wisconsin A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he was delighted to see union halls become centers of political activity for union and nonunion members.
''It's about building a movement,'' he said. ''It's not about just one win or loss. It's about the long haul.''
The Service Employees International Union has helped establish a community-labor coalition called Wisconsin Jobs Now, which has pushed to raise the minimum wage and stop cuts to Medicaid. The group has enlisted 130 block captains, many in Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods, to distribute campaign literature and drive hundreds of residents to the polls.
Greg Lewis, a minister at St. Gabriel's Church of God and Christ, has recruited 207 pastors to join the coalition's get-out-the-vote effort.
''We feel it's important to work with Wisconsin Jobs Now to help get people out of their doldrums and get them excited about the campaign,'' he said.
Scott Furlong, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, said labor's new cooperation with other groups might be an acknowledgment of weakness.
''It might be a realization,'' he said, ''that they're not powerful enough to do things on their own anymore.''

HEADLINE: Marathon Stumbled Along a Route of Indecision on Its Way Toward Cancellation

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and DAVID W. CHEN; Michael Grynbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The marathon directors from Berlin, Boston, Chicago and London gathered at Tavern on the Green on Friday morning to celebrate Tokyo's becoming the sixth Marathon Major. But the executives grew uneasy as they nibbled on bagels in a large heated tent, because the host, Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners, was late.
In fact, Wittenberg never showed. While George Hirsch, the chairman of Road Runners, filled in for her, she was frantically negotiating with city officials about how to salvage the New York City Marathon. Less than 48 hours before the race, the list of politicians calling for it to be canceled was growing. Online petitions were ballooning and protests were being planned. Reports circulated that volunteers setting up equipment had been pelted with eggs. 
With millions of residents struggling as a result of Hurricane Sandy, the marathon had turned into a magnet for ill will. Why, many asked, should resources like generators, bottled water and police officers be used for runners when so many were in need?
Wittenberg and her staff grappled with this even before the storm passed on Tuesday. But after a year of planning a 26.2-mile race for nearly 50,000 runners and 2 million spectators, their inclination was to proceed. If nothing else, the race could provide financial and psychic relief.
Yet every year, Road Runners took its cue from the city, which not only issued permits but also provided thousands of police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and sanitation workers. Privately, some of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's advisers, including Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, opposed holding the race. But on Tuesday, Bloomberg said it would go on.
''It's a great event for New York, and I think for those who were lost, you know, you've got to believe they would want us to have an economy and have a city go on for those that they left behind,'' Bloomberg said at a briefing.
On Wednesday, Wittenberg appeared at an event for elite athletes and surprised many there when she said that despite the mayor's comments, Road Runners had not received final approval to hold the race. She hinted that the race was in doubt, and she underscored who would make the ultimate decision.
''If it is to run the marathon, the marathon will run,'' Wittenberg said. ''If it's not, it won't. But I remain confident as ever that the mayor will make the right decision for the city at this time, and that is solely in his hands.''
A few hours later, the mayor repeated that the race was on. To alleviate the strain on the city, Wittenberg canceled several prerace events, but the Javits Convention Center would open as planned on Thursday so runners could pick up their numbers.
On Thursday night, as the mayor stood firm, those in his inner circle had deep concerns about the growing criticism. Some advisers believed it threatened to steal the focus from Bloomberg's performance during and after the storm, which had generally been well received. With his third term already marred by a botched blizzard response in December 2010, another major misstep during a crisis could damage the mayor's legacy.
The opposition to the race from residents on Staten Island had also shaken many marathon supporters, according to people briefed on the discussions between the city and Road Runners. Wittenberg, who makes virtually every major decision for her group, said that Road Runners would contribute $1 million to relief efforts. The gesture did little to stem the anger and the prospect of runners racing past hostile crowds on Sunday.
By 6:30 a.m. Friday, hours after she and her staff inspected the course, Wittenberg decided the five-borough race had to be scrapped.
''We got a little vibe from her that this was still open for a discussion, that it wasn't a done deal,'' said one person who talked to Wittenberg.
In talks with city officials, she and her staff fished for alternatives, including running the race entirely in Central Park, as was done in the 1970s, or on the last 10 miles of the course through the Bronx, Upper Manhattan and the park, according to people briefed on the discussions.
Wittenberg and Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson, who was central to the negotiations, rejected the ideas because any version of the race would still provoke animosity.
''The conversations around it had become caustic,'' one mayoral adviser said.
The mayor, however, told reporters Friday afternoon that he had talked that morning to the former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who encouraged him to stick with his plan. He betrayed no hint that the marathon would be canceled.
The discussions went on all day in the mayor's City Hall bullpen, and included Wolfson and Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris. The topic also came up Friday in south Brooklyn, where Bloomberg met with residents whose homes had been destroyed or damaged.
Besides discussing insurance claims and rebuilding, some residents asked the mayor why the marathon was still going to be held, aides said.
But persuading the mayor to change his mind was difficult. Aides and friends said Bloomberg was not one to wallow, and he saw value in urging residents to move past the storm.
''It goes back to his earliest days in office,'' said one person familiar with the mayor's thinking. ''He is an engineer, not a political science student.''
Without a good alternative, however, Wolfson and Wittenberg decided it would be best for her to speak to Bloomberg. The mayor was unhappy to back down, but said that if the race had to be canceled it needed to be done immediately, according to people briefed on the discussions. Wolfson and Wittenberg then began drafting a statement, released at 5:21 p.m. Eastern, that the race was off.

HEADLINE: State Senate Races Tighter After the Storm

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
The fight for control of the New York State Senate has grown unexpectedly competitive in the final moments of this year's campaign, with Hurricane Sandy adding a large dose of uncertainty to the vote on Tuesday.
All 213 state legislative seats are up for grabs, and the outcome of the Senate races is critical to shaping the balance of power in Albany, where Democrats hold the governor's office and the Assembly, but have had to compromise or abandon elements of their agenda because Republicans control the State Senate.
Republicans have long been favored to keep control of the Senate, but recent polls have shown Democratic candidates performing well in a number of critical contests.
The fallout from the storm has introduced another variable to the election, threatening to depress turnout in two downstate districts where Republicans had hoped to pick up Senate seats and fortify their majority. 
''There's no precedent; there's no way to predict,'' said Steven A. Greenberg, a pollster at Siena College. ''I think that the final outcome for the Senate is very much an open question.''
Both parties believe it may not be possible to determine on election night which party has won control of the chamber. And the presence of a four-member breakaway faction within the Senate Democrats complicates matters further, raising the specter of a leadership dispute akin to the one that roiled Albany after the 2008 elections.
Republicans, who are outnumbered by Democrats in the state's electorate, hold a 33-to-29 majority in the Senate, and through redistricting that favored their incumbents this year, they added a seat to the Senate.
In their campaigns, Republicans have stressed their economic bona fides, pointing to their work with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, to pass a cap on increases in local property taxes and improve the state's job climate. They have also drawn attention to the relative tranquillity in the state capital since Republicans regained the majority in the Senate in the 2010 elections.
''I would hope that voters would look at the stability of the last two years and understand that we work better with Andrew Cuomo than the Democrats do,'' said State Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican from Binghamton and the leader of his party's campaign efforts.
Mr. Libous said the election was ''harder for me to predict'' because of the storm, but he added, ''At the end of the day, even if it's close, we're still going to be in the majority.''
Democrats are counting on President Obama's popularity in the state to help their candidates. They have tried to focus attention on areas where they say the Senate Republicans have blocked progress in Albany, including measures to protect women's rights, raise the minimum wage, tighten gun laws and overhaul campaign-finance laws.
''All we've done, and we've done it successfully to this point, is peel the onion back and let the voters and the people of the state see what damage the Senate Republicans are doing on the issues they care about,'' said State Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat and the chief of his caucus's campaign committee. ''In the final days,'' he said, ''we're seeing that our path to the majority is a lot wider than anyone gave us credit for.''
Both parties are focusing on a relatively small number of competitive races. In the Rochester area, Ted O'Brien, a Democrat, is favored to defeat Assemblyman Sean T. Hanna, a Republican, in a contest to succeed James S. Alesi, a Republican senator who is not seeking re-election. Republicans are hoping to win a new Senate seat in the Hudson Valley that they created through redistricting, although a Siena poll conducted last week showed the race, between Assemblyman George Amedore, a Republican, and Cecilia Tkaczyk, a Democrat, to be too close to predict.
Downstate, the only door-knocking in recent days has focused on distributing food and water, not trying to solicit votes. The New York City Board of Elections said on Sunday that it would relocate or combine more than 60 polling places because of the storm, most of them in Brooklyn and Queens.
The hurricane disrupted two of the most competitive races in the state: one in Westchester County, where Bob Cohen, a Republican, is battling Assemblyman George S. Latimer, a Democrat, to fill the seat represented by Senator Suzi Oppenheimer, a Democrat who is retiring; the other in Queens, where Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., a Democrat, is facing a tough challenge from a Republican city councilman, Eric A. Ulrich.
Some of the more conservative areas of the Queens Senate district -- which gained much of the Rockaway Peninsula through redistricting -- were hit particularly hard by the hurricane. That could hurt Mr. Ulrich's chances on Tuesday if turnout in those areas is low.
Mr. Ulrich spent Sunday in Breezy Point, Queens, which was devastated by the storm and a raging fire that consumed scores of homes. Mr. Addabbo coordinated deliveries of food, pajamas and blankets from his district office in Howard Beach, which flooded during the storm and has now been turned into a 24-hour distribution point for donated goods.
''I have never had so many grown men cry on my shoulder,'' Mr. Addabbo said. ''Some of them have no homes. They need to rebuild. They're not thinking of voting. And I, personally, haven't either.''

HEADLINE: HSBC May Face Charges in a Laundering Inquiry

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The British bank HSBC has set aside an additional $800 million connected to a money laundering investigation in the United States and says it may face criminal charges in the United States. 

 BODY:
 9:28 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON - The British bank HSBC Holdings acknowledged on Monday that its exposure to an industrywide money laundering investigation had swelled as it disclosed that it could face criminal charges in the United States.
With its legal liabilities rising, HSBC set aside an additional $800 million to cover potential fines stemming from the case, bringing its total to $1.5 billion. The bank, which is negotiating a settlement with United States authorities, is expected to pay the largest fine on record for money laundering and related actions.
The trouble at HSBC coincides with a widespread crackdown by federal and state authorities into the illegal movement of money. Officials are moving to choke off the supply of American dollars to drug cartels and terrorist organizations.
 Regulators and prosecutors are looking into whether foreign banks failed to monitor cash transactions at their American subsidiaries, allowing drug dealers and terrorists to move tainted money. In addition to scrutinizing money laundering activities, they are also investigating whether institutions skirted rules by transferring money for nations subject to sanctions, like Iran, Sudan and North Korea.
Over the last few years, most of the cases have focused on those so-called sanction violations. The Treasury Department reached a $619 million settlement with ING Group in June over such accusations. A couple of months later, the British bank Standard Chartered agreed to pay $340 million to New York's top banking regulator, which claimed the bank had laundered hundreds of billions of dollars for Iran for nearly a decade.
HSBC faces harsher scrutiny. Besides sanction violations, prosecutors are considering criminal charges related to money laundering, according to several law enforcement officials with knowledge of the matter. It would be the first such case stemming from the broad investigation.
"A lot of banks will likely have to respond if U.S. authorities impose criminal sanctions on HSBC," said Jimmy Gurulé, an expert on money laundering practices at the University of Notre Dame. "It could send shock waves through the financial services industry."
This year, HSBC was thrust into the spotlight when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused the bank of exposing the United States "financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks." The subcommittee claimed that some bank executives had been complicit in the activity, ignoring warning signs and allowing illegal behavior to continue unchecked from 2001 to 2010.
For example, an HSBC executive pushed the firm to continue dealings with Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, even though some of the owners of the firm were linked to the financing of terrorism, according to the report. The Senate report found that HSBC's American operations had provided at least $1 billion in financing to Al Rajhi.
Senate investigators said that HSBC had also failed to effectively monitor the bulk-cash businesses in Mexico even after federal officials warned that drug cartels could harness those operations to move illegal money.
Instead of heightening security precautions in a country rife with drug crime and violence, HSBC officials assigned Mexico the bank's lowest risk rating for years, according to the Senate report. From 2007 to 2008, HSBC's Mexican businesses funneled at least $7 billion to the United States, a volume that law enforcement officials warned must have included "drug proceeds."
At Congressional hearings in July, HSBC executives apologized for any past problems and vowed reforms. David Bagley, who served as head of compliance at the British bank since 2002, announced his resignation at the hearings.
In an effort to fortify its safeguards, the bank has doubled its spending on compliance functions and revamped its oversight. In January, HSBC brought in Stuart A. Levey as chief legal officer. Mr. Levey, a former under secretary at the Treasury Department who focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, has been hashing out new internal standards for thwarting the illegal flow of money. In August, the bank hired Robert Werner, who formerly oversaw the group at the Treasury Department that enforces sanctions.
"We deeply regret what took place" in the United States and Mexico, HSBC's chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, told reporters in a conference call on Monday. "A number of people have left the bank and have had clawbacks against their compensation."
The bank's legal woes have weighed on its earnings.
On Monday, the bank announced that net profit had dropped by nearly 50 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30, to $2.8 billion, compared with $5.5 billion the previous year. Along with the additional legal provisions, HSBC added that it incurred a quarterly charge of $1.7 billion on the value of its own debt during the quarter.
Shares in HSBC fell 1.3 percent in London on Monday.
Excluding the adjustments, the bank said pretax profit in the third quarter more than doubled, to $5 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates. Despite the weak global economy, HSBC's pretax profit in its global banking and markets division, which includes its investment banking operations, more than doubled to $2.2 billion. Pretax profit at its commercial banking unit increased 16 percent, to $2.2 billion.
HSBC is benefiting in part from fast-growing markets like Asia and Latin America. While the bank reported a pretax loss in its European and North American operations, it posted a $1.8 billion pretax profit in its Hong Kong business, an increase of almost 40 percent from the third quarter of 2011.
Still, the legal problems could crimp profits for a while.
On Monday, the bank indicated that a resolution of the money laundering investigation would probably include corporate criminal and civil charges, as well as large fines. In the end, the bank, which has already set aside $1.5 billion to cover the potential fines, said its total costs could be even higher.
 Mark Scott reported from London, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.

HEADLINE: When Have You Spoken Out About Something You Felt Had to Change?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: When have you used your words or actions to make a change at school, at home, in your community or group? 

 BODY:
 In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, many called for the New York City Marathon, scheduled to take place on Sunday, to be cancelled. On Friday afternoon, the race was called off. 
Have you ever complained about or protested something? Did you achieve the results you wanted?
In "After Days of Pressure, Marathon Is Off," Ken Belson writes:
After days of intensifying pressure from runners, politicians and the general public to call off the New York City Marathon in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, city officials and the event's organizers decided Friday afternoon to cancel the race.
The move was historic - the marathon has taken place every year since 1970, including the race in 2001 held two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks - but seemed inevitable as opposition to the marathon swelled. Critics said that it would be in poor taste to hold a foot race through the five boroughs while so many people in the area were still suffering from the storm's damage, and that city services should focus on storm relief, not the marathon. Proponents of the race - notably Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mary Wittenberg, director of the marathon - said the event would provide a needed morale boost, as well as an economic one.
... For days, online forums sparked with outrage against politicians and race organizers, a tone that turned to vitriol against runners, even from some other runners who accused them of being selfish.
The city was divided so bitterly that it became clear to marathon organizers that to hold the race would defeat the very purpose of it.
... "This is always a race that unites the entire city," said Howard Wolfson, the deputy mayor. "It's something that 100 percent of the people who live here can agree on every year. When you have a significant number of people voicing real pain and unhappiness over its running, you have to hear that and take that into consideration. Something that is a celebration of the best of New York can't become divisive."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Good News for the Next President

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Even with the storm, confidence rises and the jobs numbers improve. Does your start-up need a public-relations firm? Is the iPhone financially irresponsible? And what will you do differently before the next storm? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 In Case You Forgot 
There's an election Tuesday, and this little girl can't wait for it be over.
 The Big Story: Storm Pummels Small Businesses 
What could be the most damaging storm ever wreaks havoc on small businesses on the East Coast (this was the most accurate forecast of them all). In New York, big businesses shut while small businesses stayed open. For some small businesses there are costs, but for others there are opportunities. Subway-dependent businesses saw their traffic slow. The storm could cost more than $50 billion and help the economy but others believe it will not help. Jared Bernstein offered some cold, wet comfort. In the middle of it all, American Apparel made an odd advertising choice and a model picked a poor time to model. The storm caused a disturbance in the airline force. The cloud took a beating. Office Depot offered free office space and services to affected businesses. Brooklyn got smug. Mayor Bloomberg's interpreter stole hearts online. And a biker toured the damage.
 The Economy: Greece Is the Word 
Thelatest unemployment report is good news for Tuesday's winner. As the United States approaches its borrowing ceiling by year end, Ezra Klein believes the "fiscal cliff" will bring on a faster contraction than Greece's. Edward Hadas says economists should just admit their ignorance. Consumer spending jumps. Home prices continue to increase. Gallup's economic confidence and the Conference Board's consumer confidence are the best since 2008. But growth in the Texas region slows and manufacturing in the Chicago region drops. General Motors' profit falls. October's factory activity hits a 37-month low. Intuit reports a decline in small-business employment and revenue. Did ADP grossly overstate job growth over the past 12 months? Online labor demand (pdf) falls. The Restaurant Performance Index declines. SurePayroll's Small Business Scorecard shows a 15-point drop in optimism. 
 Your People: Digital Literacy Is Essential
Sarah Rowson has some tips for running a multicultural work environment, including: "Even if asking questions reveals ignorance on your part, taking steps to correct that ignorance is still better than continuing to grope about blindly." Lars Lofgren explains how to recruit a world-class marketer to your start-up. Silicon Valley employers go wild with lavish benefits for their employees. These are five out-of-the-box ideas from Zappos for keeping employees engaged. This business wants to keep solicitors away unless they're selling Girl Scout cookies. Here are seven reasons people hate being in meetings with you, but don't worry - this company is working on a way to beam you up. Rick Broida tests another teleconference solution. A new report finds most small businesses consider digital literacy essential for new hires.

Here's how to manage disruptions when working from home. Jim Smith lists six questions a small business should ask itself, including: "Are we spending enough time studying our customer needs?" Here are some things to consider when buying or selling a business.
 Online Marketing: Finding Early Adopters 
This is how to use photo-sharing apps to increase your online presence. Adrian Aoun thinks the future of search may look more like Yahoo than Google. Twenty-four percent of consumers who conduct "local" searches, according to a new white paper, are tech-savvy early adopters who own multiple mobile devices, use mobile shopping apps, purchase daily deals and post reviews of businesses more than the average population. A small-business study finds a disconnect between mobile device use and mobile security preparedness. Jeff Bullas asks if your business is right for Pinterest and lists his top 10 Pinterest boards. A new survey finds most small-business owners are not capitalizing on social media while another shows that small businesses are investing more in social media but juggling resources. Zachary Knight thinks being online has become so common that some people no longer identify it as being online (kind of like these people). Facebook now enables advertisers to target specific mobile devices.
 Marketing: Ruining Your Proposals 
Jim Connolly learns some lessons from Jo Average. Jeff Korhan shares three ways content marketing can make every business better. Sydni Craig-Hart has some ideas for getting prospects to sign up for your teleseminars and webinars. These are 10 small daily habits to help you manage and build your network.

 Tweets of the Week 
[#x200f]@jasonillian: Entrepreneurs don't see the glass as half-full or half-empty. They see the glass as completely full in the future.
@ConsistencyKing: Why survey customers if you are not going to follow-up? This is a great question that 100% of your customers are asking under their breath.
@KingAndJames:Ok when you have to put your cell phone call on hold so you can open your Trick or Treat bag, you're too old for #Halloween
 The Week's Bests 
 Donna Maria shares advice for picking yourself up when you're discouraged: "Run toward something. Maybe things didn't work out the way you thought they would. You didn't win the competition. You didn't get the sale. If you are an entrepreneur, set some new business goals. More money won't solve all of your problems, but it will make them easier to deal with. Use your business to create new ways to generate more excitement, enthusiasm and income in your life. As you do this, your confidence will increase. As your confidence increases, so will your ability to deal with the next gobsmack."
 Matthew Torn says to let people work for you and "offer a high commission even if you may feel a little uncomfortable doing so. Put yourself in the position of somebody looking for a product or service to sell. Obviously, their time is as important to them as yours is to you. They want to receive the most reward for their investment, and they're drawn to high commissions. Of course, the best and brightest marketers are not making decisions solely on commission rates. But if you've taken care of the first step and created something of true value, your offer will have a dual shine."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Adam Davidson on the Surprising Truth About Manufacturing Jobs

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover essay discusses the local economies between New York and D.C. and whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney actually suffers from "manufacturing nostalgia." 

 BODY:
 Adam Davidson, who writes the It's the Economy column for the magazine, wrote this week's cover article to accompany a photo essay by Pieter Hugo on the spaces between Washington and New York along the Amtrak line. Davidson is a founder of NPR's "Planet Money," a podcast and blog. His last cover article was a profile of Edward Conard. 
 How did you come to focus on the area between New York and Washington? 
It was an assignment, but one that forced me to actually study something I had a lot of semi-formed thoughts about. I used to commute from New York to D.C., every week. I had noticed the deep urban poverty and the carcasses of century-old industrial buildings along the way. When Hugo, the editor of the magazine, asked me to write this, I assumed I would be describing the decline of a once-important region with the occasional residual sprinkling of wealth. I found something like the opposite, though. Nearly everywhere I saw signs of economic vibrancy - newly built factories, active refineries, office blocks. The places that had made the strongest impression on me before, especially the extremely poor parts of Philadelphia and Baltimore, made up much less of the journey. This shouldn't have surprised me. The story of the U.S. economy, over the past few decades (leaving aside the current downturn), is one of lots of areas of health and growth and pockets of misery where people haven't benefited.

Can you pinpoint a time when manufacturing began to decline and New York and Washington began to rise in importance? 
It's been such a long, steady transition that you could arbitrarily pick almost any moment in the last many decades. Manufacturing jobs were leaving the Northeast for the South in the 1920s. Manufacturing employment overall peaked in the late 1970s and has been declining since. But the real hollowing out of manufacturing jobs is really a 21st-century phenomenon. Government exploded in size in the 1930s and has grown fairly steadily since. But the point I tried to make is that the standard narrative, that government has pulled back from business since the early 1980s, isn't quite right. The whole process of deregulation has allowed companies to negotiate favorable and profitable terms in ways that benefit a small number of companies and a lot of politicians. That has sped up and has been especially noticeable over the past, say, 15 years. 
 Can you tell me a little more about the "Acela strategy"? How does taking advantage of deregulation relate to high-speed trains between our capitals of finance and government? 
I made up the phrase the "Acela strategy" when I saw Peter Orszag one day on the Acela, the high-speed train that links New York and D.C. He embodies the trend I'm describing. He worked in D.C., running first the Congressional Budget Office then the Office of Management and Budget as Obama's budget director. Then he was hired to be vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup. Why would Citigroup hire someone with no experience as a banker for such a major job? Well, presumably, it's because they saw him as a great bridge between their private interests and the power centers in Washington. It occurred to me that the Acela (which many find a more comfortable commute than the air shuttles) is probably filled with people like him doing the things that many economists - and especially Matthew Richardson and Viral Acharya at N.Y.U. - have highlighted. 
It's amazing to me that among economists and finance professors - who, generally, are fairly pro-market and pro-bank - almost all agree that far too much of the profits that banks make comes not from competing to make better products and services for their customers but from exploiting complex regulations to benefit their own private interests. Every time a New York banker finds it profitable to get on the Acela and go to D.C. for meetings with regulators or elected officials, the fair and free market dies a little. 
 Wouldn't you think that powerful people like Orszag would push for improvements in Amtrak service, which is often criticized for being slow and expensive, even if only for selfish reasons? 
Amtrak is a perfect example of something like the Acela strategy: what happens when there's an unhealthy mix of government and private interest. There are great arguments for allowing transportation to be largely a private-sector activity, in which companies compete to offer better service. There are also compelling arguments to make it a publicly provided service in some cases. But it seems economically nonsensical to force Amtrak to act, in many ways, like a private company but to restrict its activities in all sorts of ways by government fiat. It's a lot like health care, education, and so many other controversial parts of our economy: rather than picking one - government or private sector - or sensibly combining the two, we have different interests battling it out and the result is a mix that makes little sense for anybody. 
 Are there other areas in the U.S. that look similar, economically, to this stretch between Washington and New York? 
There are tons of similar places. I've spent a lot of time in Greenville, S.C., and along another corridor, the I-85 corridor from southern Virginia to Montgomery, Ala. You have tons of high-tech manufacturers, big auto plants, really thriving businesses. And you have lots and lots of desperately poor laid-off textile workers. The truly poor places in America, though, are those areas that are nowhere near major economic growth sectors. Places in Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, South Texas or many Native American reservations. In material terms, it is better to be poor and near wealth than to be poor and hours from the nearest thriving industry. 
 Do you think that both presidential candidates suffer equally from what you call "manufacturing nostalgia"? 
I doubt either candidate truly has manufacturing nostalgia. I assume their political operatives have determined that talking about "real jobs making real stuff" and that sort of thing strikes a chord, especially among a certain type of swing voter. But I'm sure they know that America is not likely to see a massive increase in the number of manufacturing jobs and to the extent that there will be growth in manufacturing employment it will be among highly skilled workers. The old world of lots and lots of decent factory jobs for people without a lot of education but a strong work ethic - that world is nearly dead and ain't coming back and the candidates know that. Or, if they don't, they shouldn't be president.

HEADLINE: Two Sensible Decisions: A Call to Race, Then a Call to Cancel

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: For many, sports can be a communal camp fire, a place to gather for assurance that we will be safe. Yet the New York Marathon runners, for some reason, were scorned. 

 BODY:
 Among the many decisions that Hurricane Sandy forced upon Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, two difficult ones stand out as having been sensible at the time they were made, even if many New Yorkers may not agree.
 The first was the call to go ahead with the ING New York City Marathon, in recognition of its role as an uplifting and unifying event that is woven into the fabric of the city.
 Many critics of that directive heaped abuse not only on the mayor but also on the runners as being somehow selfish for hoping to preserve the race. Totally, even willfully, ignored was the spirit of togetherness that the race has long brought to the many neighborhoods where people line sidewalks to cheer the marathoners, be it in Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Fort Greene, Williamsburg, Long Island City, the Upper East Side or Mott Haven.
 The second sensible decision was the one on Friday to cancel the race after it had become obvious that the voices of negativism had grown so loud as to drown out all others. As mayoral aides said, once the marathon lost its power to unify, it lost its reason for being.
 Still, the necessity of the second decision did not negate the validity of the first.
 It seems that this city's mettle has been altered. For all the usual New York chest-thumping about how nothing gets us down, we've now shown that our knees can buckle. Compare this anti-marathon sentiment with the reactions after past ordeals.
 A mere two days after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, the National Football League went ahead with its scheduled Sunday games.
 That action was criticized. The league commissioner back then, Pete Rozelle, later called it his biggest mistake. But not everyone saw it that way. Pierre Salinger, Kennedy's press secretary, said he had "absolutely" endorsed the Rozelle decision. "This country needed some normalcy," Salinger recalled for Sports Illustrated in 1993, "and football, which is a very important game in our society, helped provide it."
 Six days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, put normal life on hold, baseball resumed. The Mets were the first New York team to play, in Pittsburgh. They gave all of us as emotionally gripping a sports moment as we've ever experienced when they took the field wearing caps emblazoned with N.Y.P.D., F.D.N.Y. and P.A.P.D. They made every New Yorker proud and more determined than ever to soldier on, even as the fires smoldered in Lower Manhattan.
 Just this weekend, the New York Giants played a scheduled game in New Jersey, a state devastated by the storm. The New York Knicks were at home and so were the new Brooklyn Nets. But there were few complaints, if any, about their having played games that were trivial when stacked against the agony in afflicted parts of the region.
 To extend Pierre Salinger's point about football to athletics in general, sports is often our communal camp fire. It is where many of us gather for warmth and assurance that we will be safe, that everything will be O.K.
 Yet the marathon runners, for some reason, were scorned as self-centered elitists while millionaire ballplayers were lionized. One explanation offered by some for their hostility was that the race commanded resources that they said should have gone to those suffering on Staten Island and in the Rockaways. But the vituperation had an emotional component that went beyond such logistical considerations. A hard-to-fathom hatred of these athletes emerged, even though they are in the main well-meaning amateurs who, in many instances, spent thousands of dollars out of pocket to come here.
 To give you an idea of how over the top some of the attacks became, a Brooklyn woman wrote on a Web site called Change.org that the initial desire to hold the marathon was "the personification of greed and evil."
 Really now, evil? As for greed, the mayor has been roughed up for pointing out the importance of the race to the city's economy, valued at about $340 million. Taxes on that money help pay the salaries of police officers, firefighters and other city workers. That hardly qualifies as avarice, let alone as a reason to pounce on Mr. Bloomberg.
 If the mayor had a notable failing, it was in not living up to his own standards. "Leadership," he said in a recent interview , "is about doing what you think is right and then building a constituency behind it."
 When it came to the 2012 marathon in Hurricane Sandy's wake, that constituency was wanting. And so by his yardstick, Mr. Bloomberg as leader landed out of the running.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Fuel Thrift in U.S. Vehicles and Driving at All-Time High

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A fresh look at rising fuel thrift in American vehicles and driving habits. 

 BODY:
Here's a quick note on driving and fuel trends from one of my go-to analysts of transportation and energy issues (as well asair conditioning trends!), Michael Sivak, who directs the project on sustainable worldwide transportation of the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute: 
The average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in the U.S. in October was 24.1 miles per gallon -- the highest level yet, and up 4.0 miles per gallon from October 2007 (the first month of our monitoring). This 20-percent improvement in fuel economy corresponds to a 17-percent reduction in fuel consumption (gallons per mile). For the description of the calculations and the recent mpg values, please visit [this link].
The University of Michigan Eco-Driving Index (EDI)--an index that estimates the average monthly emissions of greenhouse gases generated by an individual U.S. driver--stood at 0.81 in August, an improvement of 19% since October 2007. The EDI takes into account both vehicle fuel economy and distance driven (the latter relying on data that are published with a two-month lag). Please visit [this link] for a brief description of what the EDI is, how it is calculated, and the current and recent values of the EDI.
 Note: All of our values are now corrected for the changes in the EPA ratings for the Hyundai/Kia vehicles that were issued on November 2. 
Please revisit my March post, "An Online Tool For Gauging the Relative Value of Efficient Cars," for a practical tool with which consumers can compare vehicle's energy and environmental performance.

HEADLINE: An Almost-Sure Winner: The Ranks of House Service Veterans

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: Regardless of what happens in the presidential election on Tuesday, more veterans are likely to be elected to the House of Representatives. 

 BODY:
Regardless of what happens in the presidential election on Tuesday, more veterans are likely to be elected to the House of Representatives, according to a new analysis by George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.
The report by the school'sCenter for Second Service concludes that, barring a major surprise on Tuesday, there will be a net gain of as many as eight veterans in the House. The Senate, however, seems almost certain to have fewer veterans. 
A gain of even just one veteran in the House would reverse a 40-year trend in which the number has dropped in every election except one since 1971, said Seth Lynn, a Marine Corps veteran who is the center's director. 
There are 92 veterans in the House and 26 in the Senate, the lowest number in a century or more, Mr. Lynn said. 
Mr. Lynn said the analysis was drawn from the number of veterans nominated by the two major parties and then determining through various sources, including The New York Times, whether they were running in closely contested, heavily Democratic or heavily Republican districts. 
The researchers found that 189 veterans were running from the two parties, about the same as in every other Congressional election since 2002. A larger number are Republicans: 120, compared with 69 Democrats. In 2006, the two parties nominated roughly equal numbers of veterans in House races.
Unless there is a tidal wave of support for Democrats running in heavily Republican districts, which is not predicted by polls, 92 to 100 veterans are expected to win, with a strong likelihood that the number will be more than 92, he said. 
"I'm fairly confident we'll see more veterans in the House after the election than we do now," Mr. Lynn said. 
One reason for the anticipated increase, Mr. Lynn said, is that the Republicans nominated many veterans to run in safe districts. That was less often the case in past elections, and was less often the case this year among Democrats.
Mr. Lynn found that only 15 percent of the Democratic veterans who were challenging incumbents this year were running in what he considered winnable districts. That was half the percentage of Republican challengers running in such races.
The center is a new venture created by the university and Mr. Lynn, the founder of a nonprofit group called Veterans Campaign, to train veterans to become involved in politics through lectures, courses and fellowships.

HEADLINE: A Triple Whammy for Barclays

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Just months after settling a rate-rigging investigation, Barclays now finds itself caught in two more inquiries - one related to energy price manipulation and the other involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

 BODY:
Barclays seems to be facing the wrath of several regulatory agencies in the United States. 
Four months after reaching a $453 million settlement with American and British regulators over manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionis seeking a $435 million civil penalty over accusations that the bank manipulated energy prices in and around California.
The bank has also disclosed that the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are examining whether payments related to raising capital from investors in the Middle East during the height of the financial crisis violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order involves complex transactions from 2006 to 2009 in which Barclays traders are accused of taking losses in the market for delivering electricity in order to manipulate the price of an index that effectively bolstered the value of financial swaps held by the bank. 
That summary hardly does justice to the detailed description of the accusations against the bank. Reading it should cure any case of insomnia almost instantly.
The $435 million proposed penalty is the largest ever sought by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, exceeding the previous record $135 million fine imposed against Constellation Energy in April and .
The commission is also seeking to have Barclays disgorge approximately $35 million in profit. , the bank asserted its "trading was legitimate and above board," adding that it intended "to vigorously defend this matter."
How can the government seek a civil penalty more than 10 times greater than the claimed profit from the actions? It relates to the starting point for the penalty calculation.
Under guidelines issued by the energy commission, the process for determining the appropriate civil penalty can be based on the loss caused by the violations along with certain factors that can increase the fine.
The important point here is the conclusion that "Barclays engaged in this activity for 655 product days for 35 monthly products and caused losses to market participants estimated at $139.3 million." The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to seek a civil penalty of up to $1 million for each day in which there was a violation of the rules intended to prevent manipulation of the energy market. In the case of Barclays, therefore, the maximum could be $655 million.
There are several factors in the case that work against Barclays. For one, the commission noted that one of the traders involved was a senior manager. The order also concludes that the bank's internal compliance program was "inadequate" because it "did not have systems in place to detect" manipulative trading. In fact, the commission asserts, responsibility for compliance in the power trading operation was put in the hands of one the senior manager accused of the violations. 
Another factor is previous misconduct by the bank. Here the Libor settlement has come back to haunt Barclays. The energy commission noted that the bank was involved in manipulation during the same period, even though it was in another part of the company and involved a far different financial issue. That shows the problem every multinational company faces when distinct violations can be aggregated to paint a picture of an organization that appears to be unable to prevent misconduct by its employees.
Taken together, these factors led to the decision to seek about a triple penalty against the bank, based on the claimed losses it inflicted on others trading in the financials swaps contracts. The commission's calculation is sure to be challenged by Barclays if it decides not to pursue a settlement and seeks a hearing. 
The foreign bribery investigation by the Justice Department and the S.E.C. may be an even bigger headache because the amounts involved are significant. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays raised over £11 billion from Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari government, and made payments totaling £400 million to facilitate the investments. Those payments are at the center of the bribery inquiry, which is also being scrutinized by the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Services Authority in Britain.
Coming on top of the Libor settlement and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission charges, at a minimum the American government may try to extract a significant financial penalty from Barclays to settle any violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The bank would be, in effect, a three-time loser, making it hard to reach a favorable resolution.
Barclays was praised by the Justice Department for its "extraordinary cooperation" in the Libor inquiry, and continued cooperation would be a point in its favor. But the investigations of energy price manipulation and overseas bribery cover the same period of time as the Libor manipulation involving the bank's senior management. 
At some point, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. may be unwilling to go easy when the bank's culture seemingly reflected the attitude of a teenager: "If we don't get caught, then why bring it to anyone's attention?"
I think it is unlikely that prosecutors will take any action that threatens the bank's authority to conduct business in the United States, but that is the threat hanging over its head. That may prompt Barclays to settle the bribery investigation as quickly as possible. Any settlement is likely to include continued monitoring of the bank's compliance program, a potentially onerous cost given its size.
Barclays is certainly hoping that there are no more investigations lurking out there that could cause more pain. The last few months have been bad enough for its reputation and bottom line.

HEADLINE: How Natural Gas Kept Some Spots Bright and Warm as Sandy Blasted New York City

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's other grid, natural gas lines, allowed some places to stay warm and bright despite Sandy. 

 BODY:
As New York City and other communities buffeted, flooded or darkened by the remains of Hurricane Sandy consider steps beyond the immediate recovery, officials, business owners and residents would be wise to spend time examining places where the power did not fail. That's the essence of the approach to post-disaster review suggested last week by the meteorologist William Hooke, a senior policy fellow at the American Meteorological Society.
If they do, they'll realize that there's a reliable energy grid in much of the region -- composed of natural gas lines -- that parallels the one using wires to carry electricity. This separate energy system allows businesses to produce electricity themselves in small, highly efficient gas-powered generators at their facilities (and cut urban air pollution and greenhouse gases at the same time). This gas grid helped at least two large energy users -- New York University and Co-op City (a vast high-rise housing complex in the Bronx) -- stay warm and bright because, to a significant extent, they can generate their own electricity and heat.
Matthew Wald, in a Green Blog post today, nicely explains the success at N.Y.U., which went into "island mode," in the words of one university official:
When much of Manhattan south of Midtown was blacked out, the lights were on at most of New York University, as was the heat and hot water. As I wrote in January 2011, N.Y.U. installed a small network of its own, burning natural gas in a unit that not only made electricity but also delivered the heat that would otherwise go to waste for use in heating and cooling. That process is known as cogeneration.
"Our cogen is up and running," said John J. Bradley, the university's assistant vice president for sustainability, energy and technical services, said last week. The system does not cover the entire campus but rather all of the larger buildings and the core of the Washington Square campus....
Of course, the failure of a backup generator at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center drew far more attention. The hospital had to evacuate all of its patients after Hurricane Sandy made landfall a week ago, and Langone drew some criticism for not moving them out beforehand.
The university's impetus for installing the cogeneration network was to save money and reduce its carbon footprint, but a side benefit is reliability.
In two posts in the last few days on Forbes.com, William Pentland, a writer who is also involved in a business developing such combined heat and power systems (he declares this interest up front), described the Co-op City storm response and, more generally, the merits of the gas distribution system as a means to creating a robust, distributed electricity supply: 
Today's electric grid was not designed to survive strong winds, storm surges, falling trees and flying debris and seems ludicrously inadequate for the demands of America's increasingly digital and connected economy. The costs of hardening the electric grid will be vast. One widely cited study by the Brattle Group estimated that the electric utility industry will need to invest a $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion in infrastructure upgrades by 2030.
Despite spending epic sums of money on the so-called "smart grid," the electric power grid seems as stupid as it was before spending billions in federal stimulus dollars.
Why throw good money after bad if we have a compelling alternative? And make no mistake about it, we have a compelling alternative to the conventional electric grid. It is commonly called the North American natural gas infrastructure.
I was in an e-mail conversation over the weekend with Pentland and Thomas G. Bourgeois, the deputy director of Pace University's Energy and Climate Center, who's a big fan of cogeneration of both heat and electricity at sites where it is used. He noted other instances around the region affected by the intense storm where so-called "combined heat and power" units kept lights on (I've cleaned up some e-mail shorthand):
One Penn Plaza's co-generation system kept running. Princeton powered dorms and preserved research facilities, whereas N.Y.U.'s research center, served with emergency generators, suffered inestimable losses [read "Hurricane Sandy's Lesser-Known Victims: Lab Rats"].
Next Friday New York City kicks off their 80 x 50 process [ a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 ] . We need a new vision of the electric generation, transmission and distribution system rather than one that moves electricity generated at remote locations, arriving at the point of end use... with a loss of 67 percent of otherwise valuable thermal energy. We need some pilots of operating micro-grids and district systems with combined heat and power that ought to represent the energy system of the future. Go beyond thinking of individual building efficiency to zero-energy blocks or neighborhoods. A vision of optimally creating a suite of resources, Efficiency, photovoltaics, clean distributed generation, demand response, storage, all managed in synch with the larger transmission and distribution system.
As I was mulling this over, I had two thoughts. One was that this vision of a resilient urban energy system integrating existing natural gas distribution lines could easily integrate sources of renewably generated electricity, as well -- for instance, from rooftop solar panels in the boroughs where they make sense. I asked Bourgeois if that made sense to him.
He said yes, emphatically.
Bourgeois is on the run, like lots of people right now, so his full reply, as he explained apologetically, is somewhat "stream of consciousness." But, to me, it's worth reading in full. I've posted it as a standalone Slideshare document: "A Systems Approach to Resilient and Sustainable Urban Energy Supply."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had already expressed strong support for expanding natural gas supplies to the city, mainly to reduce the use of heavy oil in heating. (Read this report on natural gas and city air pollution prepared for the mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability for more.)
Of course, as I've written repeatedly, natural gas should be harvested responsibly. And urban gas lines and the larger pipelines from national supplies to New York City need to be carefully built and maintained. [*There were natural gas leaks in some flooded areas in the aftermath of the storm, and some coastal communities saw gas distribution systems disrupted.]
But given the role natural gas played in keeping the lights on in otherwise darkened parts of the city after this storm, it's clear that this resource can play an important part in building a robust, resilient and flexible electricity and energy grid for the city and region.

HEADLINE: Speed King of Queens Breaks a Record

BYLINE: LOUISE ANN NOETH


HIGHLIGHT: Eric Ritter of Queens broke the Class C speed record by running 338 miles an hour at the Bonneville Salt Flats. 

 BODY:
When Queens native Eric Ritter tripped the timing lights last month at the Southern California Timing Association's World Finals at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats, setting a record for its engine class at 339 miles an hour, he also earned a lifetime membership in the exclusive 300 m.p.h. chapter of Bonneville's prestigious "200 MPH Club." In the process he became the first New Yorker to earn that distinction, according to S.C.T.A. records. 
Mr. Ritter, a 50-year-old auto mechanic and former motorcycle racer, was driving the Team Vesco 444 yellow-and-white streamliner, a 26-foot-long purpose-built speed machine that rips along a nine-mile course with a scant two inches of ground clearance.
"Eric earned his ride by being a good team member for more than 20 years," said the car's owner, Rick Vesco, referring to the 15-member volunteer crew. "He's very meticulous and conscientious, things you count on when people's lives are on the line."
After performing double-digit hours of physically demanding mechanical labor as the car's crew chief, Mr. Ritter quickly assumes a tranquil "Zen state" to drive at vision-blurring speeds. He has cultivated a routine to control his heart rate, breathing and nerves that he terms "slowing down the fuel flow" to develop quick, riveting concentration - a necessity when driving at 300 miles an hour.
Ritter, who made 17 runs in excess of 300 m.p.h. before setting a Class C national record of 339 m.p.h. on Oct. 5, said that he drove mostly by seat-of-the-pants feel. "Your butt is the best steering mechanism around. It will tell you everything that vehicle is doing and it will know it before your head does."
The new record came after an oil line fitting burst, necessitating an engine swap. Mr. Ritter and his teammates completed the work in 10 hours, leaving him physically spent even before he put on his fire suit. At that point his task was to "drive like you stole it," as Mr. Ritter said. 
Speeds from two separate runs are averaged to earn the top spot in each class. But during the first of Mr. Ritter's two record-setting runs, a giant mosquito appeared, flying around the cockpit to land dead center on the Plexiglas windscreen. Goodbye life-sustaining concentration.
"It was him or me," said Ritter, who took his right hand off the steering wheel to backhand the bug while moving at almost 340 m.p.h. "I had to take him out."
Ritter's second run, at 338 m.p.h., was uneventful -- if you can call such speed mundane. 
"Our safety rules are very strict," said Miriam Macmillan, chairwoman of Bonneville Nationals, speaking with mock sternness. "No one but the driver can be in the car. We will need to review the validity of Mr Ritter's record since he admits to having a passenger."
Lee Kennedy, S.C.T.A.'s car technical chairman, was more straightforward in his praise. "The 444 is always very well prepared, very few teams have more racing experience than they in dealing with salt conditions," he said. "They make setting a record look easy, but it would take rookies a lifetime to do the same thing."

HEADLINE: Has Hong Kong Reached Its 'Tipping Point' as a World City?

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER


HIGHLIGHT: Hong Kong's standing as a key Asian location for foreign firms is under threat, analysts say, due to skyrocketing rents and a shortage of commercial and residential space. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - With home prices at record highs, and retail and office rents topping those in New York, Tokyo and London, it was, perhaps, only a matter of time before someone sounded the alarm that Hong Kong is now too crowded and expensive for its own good.
Hong Kong's standing as a key location within Asia is "under threat," said Craig Shute, senior managing director for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan at the real estate services firm CBRE. "We have reached a tipping point."
The stark warning was referring to the worsening shortfall of office space in the city, which has driven rents to stratospheric levels, sent vacancy rates to record lows (despite the shrinking workforces in the finance sector), and prompted some companies to mull alternatives.
International business is the lifeblood of this Asian trading and financial center, so this is serious stuff. In Mr. Shute's opinion, Hong Kong's long-term prosperity could be "in danger" unless more is done to beef up the supply of space. And fast.
As I explained in this recent story, an influx of cash from mainland China along with overseas companies that want a base at China's doorstep have helped push property prices and rents ever higher.
Office space in the main business district of Central, for example, is by far the most expensive in the world, according to a CBRE report. Rents in Kowloon, across Victoria Harbor, are lower than on Hong Kong island, but they're still pricier than in the City of London.
Some companies have responded by squeezing more people into the space they have. Others are moving to less desirable parts of the city. 
An upscale restaurant called Culinart took up residency earlier this year in a somewhat down-at-the-heels industrial building in Wong Chuk Hang, an anything-but-fashionable neighborhood that is not on Hong Kong's efficient subway system. An art gallery in Central will soon open in Wong Chuk Hang, too. The downtown area, the gallery's founder, Meg Maggio, told the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, has become "too expensive." 
But even companies prepared to pay top dollar for prime space are hitting a buffer: There is simply not enough space available.
In a report published last week, CBRE and Daiwa Capital Markets estimated that projects currently in the pipeline will add 8 million square feet of Grade A office space by 2020, or about 743,000 square meters - less than half what will be needed (based on current projections of economic growth) by the end of the decade. The shortfall could be relieved by accelerating some developments, but even that would take time and money.
Moreover, said Mr. Shute, the "crisis of supply" extends to other areas, too - residential property, retail space, hospital beds, school spaces. Hong Kong's airport, too, will soon max out if air traffic keeps growing the way it has been.
The shortage of school spaces, in particular, has become a major problem for expatriates with kids - and for the companies that want to base them in Hong Kong.
"The crunch for space in Hong Kong's international primary schools is a near constant complaint in my circle of young expat families," Kate Malin, editor-in-chief at Sassy Media Group, which runs three English-language web sites aimed at women in Hong Kong, wrote in an e-mail to me.
Applications for places at the international schools - the only realistic option for most non-local children - far exceed the places available, leading to long waiting lists. Huge debentures "might help you skip to the front of the line, but are not realistic for most families these days - especially since many expats are not on expat packages anymore," Ms. Malin said.
To be sure, Hong Kong still exerts a strong magnetism, and the number of foreign companies with a presence here is at an all-time high, according to InvestHK, a government body that works to attract foreign investment. 
Leaving outright or moving individual teams or back-office functions to less pricey cities is not an option for many companies and organizations. Similarly, retailers who want to cater to the many mainland Chinese who flock to Hong Kong every month have no choice but to pay the excruciating rents that landlords are demanding.
So we're not talking about an imminent mass exodus. As Nick Axford, head of Asia Pacific research at CBRE puts it: "It's not about businesses upping and leaving Hong Kong."
But Mr. Axford and his colleagues say the pressures and costs of being in Hong Kong are now increasingly prompting companies to think very seriously about how to lower their cost bases.
It's gradual, below-the-radar stuff -a relocation here and there, perhaps, or decisions to bolster teams in other parts of Asia - but it could certainly intensify if the pressures on space do not ease up.

HEADLINE: Socialist Party Candidate Calls His Platform Not So Radical

BYLINE: DANIEL A. MEDINA


HIGHLIGHT: "I'm a Socialist, but I'm just like everybody else," a United States Senate candidate says. 

 BODY:
"I'm a Socialist, but I'm just like everybody else," the Senate candidate said. "The only difference is I believe in universal health care, a more fair public education system and in a living-wage amendment. I wouldn't exactly call those ideas crazy or nuanced." 
Greg Pason, 45, the national secretary and only full-time employee of the Socialist Party USA and the party's candidate for United States Senate in New Jersey, sat in the unassuming office in a run-down building in SoHo that serves as party headquarters one recent afternoon, discussing his chances.
"I'll be the first to tell you that we don't have a chance to win any race that we're competing in," he said with a sly grin. "Getting in the political process is not just about winning the next election. It's about reclaiming the process and making it more democratic."
Mr. Pason, whose stocky build and buzz haircut make him look more like Joe the Plumber than a Washington insider, is a former house cleaner who joined the Socialist Party more than two decades ago, after, he said, he found himself working two jobs but still homeless.
"I had privately thought to myself before, 'something is wrong with the economy when you're working your butt off and you can barely get by,'" he said, "and now I found a group of like-minded individuals and it changed my life."
The party's office on Lafayette Street is decorated with old placards and photos of party rallies that drew hundreds of thousands to Union Square a century ago. 
The past appears more glorious than the present. Today, the party apparatus, which accounts for roughly 1,500 paying members nationwide, appears ragtag on the surface. But this election year, it has gained some support from left-leaning Democrats, college students and Occupy protesters, groups that overlap considerably. 
While Occupy has helped raise the issue of socioeconomic inequality in this election, another Socialist Party official, Stephanie Gussin, co-chairwoman of the national committee, said, "The Socialist Party has a defined set of alternatives, whereas Occupy still doesn't."
 Ms. Gussin said that while she was not involved with Occupy, "I think it reflects the sentiment of my generation who have become disillusioned with the American dream."
In recent months, Mr. Pason has used the party's limited resources to tap into this growing resentment. He has canvassed in neighborhoods in cities up and down New Jersey; stumped at street fairs in suburban Montclair, N.J., where he lives; and stood in solidarity at Occupy rallies and labor union marches from Newark to Camden.
His platform includes tax hikes for the rich and stronger federal regulation of private enterprise, ideas that have common ground with those advanced in campaign speeches by President Obama, who has been derided as a "socialist" by conservatives. But Mr. Pason laughs at the suggestion that the president may be on his side.
" He's not a socialist, that's ridiculous to suggest," said Mr. Pason. "To call him a socialist is more about Republicans vilifying him on what they think has a negative stigma in the American psyche." The Socialists are also running a presidential ticket, led by Stewart Alexander and Alejandro Mendoza. 
Mr. Pason said that he does not foresee an American Socialist revival anytime soon, but said that a lot of people were paying attention to third parties in this election year, because of partisan gridlock and negative TV ads bought by Super Pacs.
"It won't be easy," he said, "but when has it ever been easy for us?"

HEADLINE: Storm Aftermath: Continuing Coverage

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A northeaster knocked out power to homes in New York and New Jersey and interrupted train service, setting back recovery after Hurricane Sandy, but several utilities said they had already brought back most of their customers. 

 BODY:
Odd-even gas rationing went into effect Friday in New York City and Long Island as officials moved to shorten the hours-long lines that have become an exasperating feature of daily life for drivers since last week's storm. Lines seemed to be a bit shorter, and though some people with even-numbered plates flouted the law with apparent impunity, there was little reported chaos.
Join us for continued coverage of Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath on Monday, or as news happens. 
 6:13 P.M. | New Jersey and New York Start to Address Price Gouging 
As complaints about post-storm price-gouging continue to pile up, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa filed complaints against seven gas stations and a hotel on Friday, accusing them of "exploiting people's misery to make a quick profit."
One of the gas stations, a Lukoil in Paterson, increased its price by more than $2 a gallon, to $5.49 from $3.45, after the storm, Mr. Chiesa said. The hotel, a Howard Johnson Express Inn in Parsippany, increased its room rate to $119 from $90, Mr. Chiesa said. 
The merchants face penalties of $10,000 for a first offense if found guilty. Price gouging is defined as increasing prices by more than 10 percent during an emergency, beyond covering any additional costs brought on by the emergency itself.
The attorney general's office has received 2,000 complaints from people in five counties in the wake of the storm, Mr. Chiesa said. Four percent of the state's gas stations have been the subject of complaints.
In New York, the office of Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said that it had received 600 complaints so far including one that a grocery in Battery Park City charged $10 for a box of matches and another that a Waldbaum's in Carle Place on Long Island charged $6.99 for a small bag of potatoes that was $2.99 before the storm.
The attorney general has also subpoenaed Craigslist for information about people who have been offering non-bargains like an empty five-gallon gas container for $500 or a $700 generator for $1,200.
Last year after Tropical Storm Irene, the office received only about a dozen complaints. Two of them led to fines of several thousand dollars against gas stations, including one in Yonkers that charged 97 cents more per gallon after the storm, and another in Farmingdale on Long Island that increased its price by 84 cents a gallon.
In Brooklyn, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes announced Thursday that he would impanel a grand jury to investigate price-gouging.

 5:34 P.M. | A New York City Program to Repair Damaged Houses 
Looking to streamline the daunting process for homeowners of getting storm-damaged homes fixed up, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled a program Friday in which homeowners can simply register and contractors will perform and oversee the repairs, with homeowners not having to reach into their pockets.
With contractors, electricians, plumbers and other tradesmen suddenly inundated with work, many homeowners have been finding it next to impossible to get workers to their houses. And though their insurers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency may eventually reimburse them, paying for the work up front is another hurdle.
Under the new program called NYC Rapid Repairs, said the mayor, "Once you've signed up, a contractor will come to your home, asses the damage, create a work order and within a short time the work will be done." 
There will be caps on how much work will be covered, however. Currently, FEMA offers $10,000 in housing-repair reimbursement. The city hopes to set the cap considerably higher for this program, an official said. 
Teams of contractors will be assigned to each affected neighborhood and "will be able to work on multiple buildings at once, not just one at a time," the mayor said.
He said that homes that need the least work will be dealt with first.
Homeowners can register for the program starting on Tuesday at DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-3362.

 5:05 P.M. | For the Rockaways, a Ferry and Some Subway Service 
The A train's causeway over Jamaica Bay to the Rockaways, swamped and ripped up by Hurricane Sandy, remains out of service, a work in progress.
But residents of the Rockaways received two pieces of good transportation news on Friday. One is that A train service within the Rockaway peninsula will resume on Sunday, with a shuttle bus connection across Jamaica Bay to subway service at Howard Beach, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said.
The other is that ferry service to Manhattan will begin on Monday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. 
Seastreak, a company that runs ferries to Atlantic Highlands, N.J., among other places, will operate the ferries, which will run from Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive and stop at Pier 11 near South Street Seaport, with free transfers between Pier 11 and East 34th Street in Midtown. 
There will be five morning boats to Manhattan, from 5:45 a.m. to 9:20 a.m., and three in the evening. The fare will be $2 each way. The trip to Pier 11 will take 50 minutes. 
- Andy Newman 
 4:44 P.M. | Some Light Will Come to the Statue of Liberty 
The Statue of Liberty's torch has been snuffed for a while. But the statue itself will be visible in the dark again beginning tonight, the National Park Service said.
Using three small diesel generators fueled from a tank on Liberty Island, a lighting company has devised a makeshift system for illuminating the statue until power is restored on the island, said David Barna, a spokesman for the park service in Washington.
The monument, including its iconic torch, and the museum on nearby Ellis Island have been without power since Hurricane Sandy hit on Oct. 29. The islands suffered significant damage and will be closed to visitors indefinitely, the park service said.
The lighting system was donated to the National Park Foundation, which raises private funds for national parks, by Musco Lighting. Mr. Barna said the value of Musco's donation would be about $140,000.

 2:26 P.M. | Obama Coming to New York City on Thursday 
President Obama is coming to New York City on Thursday to see the damage from Hurricane Sandy firsthand, a White House official said this afternoon.
The president will "view storm damage, talk with citizens who are recovering from the storm and thank first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities," the official said.

 2:08 P.M. | Zero May Be a Strange Number, but It's Not Odd 
In dealing with New York's worst gasoline crisis since the 1970s, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg waded Thursday into a problem that has stumped people for years: Is the number zero odd, even or neither?
"Those with license plates ending in an even number, or the number zero, will be able to buy gas or diesel only on even-numbered days, such as Saturday, Nov. 10," the mayor said as he announced the imposition of odd-even gas rationing. Those with license plates ending in odd numbers or a letter can buy gas on only odd-numbered dates.
To mathematicians, it was a little astonishing that zero had to be singled out at all. (Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said nothing regarding zero in his gas-rationing announcement last week.)
"It's absolutely not a matter of debate," said Walter Neumann, the chairman of Barnard College's mathematics department.
He explained that even integers, or whole numbers, are defined as numbers that can be divided by two without producing nonwhole numbers. Dividing three by two produces 1.5, making it odd; dividing four by two produces two, making it even. Zero divided by two equals zero - no fraction or nonwhole number results. So zero is even.
"It's very clear," said Marc Masdeu, an assistant professor at Columbia University who specializes in number theory, sounding puzzled at the question.
But tell that to the Parisian police officers who, during a smog alarm in 1977, were assigned to enforce a system under which cars with odd license plates could be driven on odd days, and even plates on even. Those with license plates ending in zero drove with impunity, because the police did not know what to do about zero, according to a paper by Prof. Hossein Arsham of the University of Baltimore, who has written about the concept of zero.
If anything, the mayor's decision to single out zero underscores just how tricky a place it occupies in the pantheon of numbers. Until Europeans adopted Arabic numerals in the Middle Ages, the concept of nothing, or none, had no numerical representation in the Western world. And any elementary school student can reel off a litany of arithmetic rules that mark off zero as special and strange.
 "Treating zero as a number is already interesting," said Jonathan Goodman, a professor of mathematics at New York University. "If people don't think that zero's a number, the question of whether zero's even or odd doesn't occur."
Befuddlement over which way zero swings persists on the Internet. Last month, phrases like "is zero odd or even" were searched via Google more than 6,000 times globally.
And that is why Mr. Bloomberg singled out the number for mention, Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for the mayor, said. "Zero can be a point of confusion, so we wanted to be absolutely clear in the rule."

 1:17 P.M. | And at Some Pumps Just Beyond Rationing's Limits ... 
Meanwhile, just across the New York City line in Westchester County, where there is no odd-even rule in effect, were the gas stations inundated with Bronx refugees driving cars with even-numbered plates, desperate to fill their tanks today?
They were not, at least if a phone survey of 10 stations in Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Pelham Manor and New Rochelle was any indication.
Five of the stations were out of gas. But the other five were selling gas and reported no significant waits. 
 "Last week we had lines that were miles long here," said Chris Kraft, co-owner of the 76 station at 920 McLean Avenue in Yonkers, barely two blocks from Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Today, he said at noon, "maybe eight cars." 
There did seem to be a fair number of out-of-towners, though, Mr. Kraft said. "I see a lot of people that I've never seen before, and they look like they're from New York," he said. He was asked to elaborate. "People that look like they're from the Bronx."
At U.S. Petroleum on Main Street in New Rochelle, two miles up Boston Post Road from the Bronx border, the man on the phone reported all was well.
"No lines," the man said. "You can get all day, no problem."

 12:27 P.M. | Some Drivers in City and on Long Island Report Short Lines 
The big question on Day 1 of gas rationing, at least in drivers' minds, is whether it is leading to shorter lines. There was no overview immediately available from the mayor or the Police Department in New York City, but there was anecdotal evidence on Twitter of short lines, in Fort Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and on Queens Boulevard in Queens

With at least half the cars on the road suddenly ineligible to buy gas, the lines certainly should have been shorter. Though there were plenty of exceptions, the vast majority of drivers with even-numbered plates knew to stay away from the pumps. 
At a busy Hess station at 10th Avenue and West 45th Street, a police officer stood in the street, checking license plates and waving away cars with even plates. The officer, who would not give his name, said that only about one in 50 cars had an even number.
But there were still plenty of long lines. The queue at a Hess station on Fourth Avenue in Gowanus, Brooklyn, wound far around the corner onto Sackett Street and nearly out of sight. More dispatches from the waiting line came in from Ditmas Park, Brooklyn .

 9:25 A.M. | Bloomberg Urges Patience on Gas Rationing 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, resuming his weekly radio show for the first time since Hurricane Sandy pounded the region, urged New York City drivers to be patient as they get accustomed to a mandatory gas-rationing system that began Friday morning.
He also cautioned that the waits at gas stations, where often apoplectic drivers have routinely waited for hours to fill their tanks since the storm hit, would not necessarily be drastically shorter as a result of the new rules, which restrict refilling to cars with even-number license plates on even-number days and odd-number plates on odd-number days. And that is because the chief problem remained the extensive damage sustained by distribution terminals.
"There's no guarantee that odd-even is going to make a big difference," the mayor said, calling in for a shorter-than-usual interview with John Gambling on WOR-AM. "The real answer - all the experts believe - is just with time. They really thought that the damage to some of these small distribution terminals was not anywhere near as extensive as it was when they finally got electricity back and then tried to get it going."
Mr. Bloomberg also said, in response to a question about how it would seem logical for gas station owners, as businessmen, to try to be open for business: "I assume that that's the case, so there's got to be some reason why." 
He added: "And I think part of it really is they just don't think that these terminals can fill the trucks anyway near fast enough, and so they wouldn't get gas, they'd only be open for a couple of hours, and maybe pay have to pay their employees full-day. I don't know."
New York City's rationing effort coincided with one that began Friday morning in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and followed odd-even rules imposed for 12 New Jersey counties last Saturday. The gas shortage was also exacerbated by the northeaster on Wednesday, which interrupted work to repair petroleum terminals and slowed barges carrying fuel from reaching their docks.
To make the rationing system go as smoothly as possible, Mr. Bloomberg said Friday that the city had "put a police officer at every gas station."
But he also suggested that city residents appreciated the efforts that companies and city agencies had put in during the last two weeks to helping the region recover more quickly. He said that his own respect for companies and city agencies had "doubled or tripled."
He also said that his primary focus was not on gas, but rather on helping tens of thousands of people - about half of whom live in public housing - "get power back" so they can "get back to much more normal life."
Mr. Bloomberg said that he hoped that all public housing developments would have electricity by Friday night, and heat by early next week.
"Then we can worry about lost belongings, things like that," he said.

 8:28 A.M. | In Brooklyn, Shorter Lines and the Odd (Even) Scofflaw 
At the Hess station at McGuinness Boulevard and Greenpoint Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the wait for gas this morning was only about 20 minutes - far shorter than it had been in recent days, said Tony Dazzo, 35, an engineer who lives in Queens and was filling his car.
"They should have done it sooner," he said. "It gets half the people off the line and moves it a lot more quickly."
Most of those in line had odd-numbered plates or plates that ended in letters, in keeping with the new rule. But not all of them. Around 8 a.m., Cynthia Quiles, 42, a janitor for the Department of Education, filled up her Chevy Tahoe with an even-numbered plate even as 10 police officers stood by. 
She said her job gave her an exception to the rule, even though those officially exempt from it include only cabs and liveries, buses and paratransit vehicles, emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles and those with M.D. plates. 
"I think it's a fair rule," she said. "Because the lines are ridiculous."
Ms. Quiles added that twice in the past two weeks she had gotten in line for gas at 10 p.m. with a half tank and slept in her idling car until she could get gas at 7 a.m.
A block away, at a Gulf station at 176 McGuinness, Angel Perez, 34, who packages artwork, was turned away. He would have been welcome despite his even-numbered license plate if only he had a corporate account, but he did not. The station accepted all drivers with accounts, regardless of their plate numbers, as well as other drivers with odd-numbered plates. There were no police officers there, even though there were 10 nearby at the Hess station. 
Mr. Perez, who drove to Brooklyn from Staten Island, said it was the third time he was turned away by 8 a.m.
"I didn't know about it until this morning, and look at me, I'm on empty," he said, pointing at his dashboard. "I understand he's trying to keep things organized, I just wish I had a little more notice."

 6:28 A.M. | Gas Rule in Effect, if Not Yet Enforced at the Pump 
Jasmin Espinao, 34, who works at a construction company, went out of her way to get gasoline on Friday morning because she has an odd-numbered license plate and heard on the radio that only cars with odd plates could fill up on Friday (Nov. 9) under a rule announced Thursday by the mayor. She hoped the line might be shorter. But she was too early.
At 5:45 a.m., 15 minutes before the rule would take effect, Ms. Espinao got in line at the BP station on the corner of Flushing and Bushwick Avenues in Brooklyn behind a slew of cars with even-numbered plates. Many of them were presumably trying to beat the deadline, as drivers were apparently doing across the city.
#bp on #woodhavenblvd longggg line w/ even number plates filling up before the gas rationing rule kicks in at 6am #pix11news
- Dan Mannarino (@Pix11Dan) November 9, 2012
"I think it's a good idea, but the fact that you're in line with evens, it's like, what?" Ms. Espinao said. "It makes no sense. I hope it works, but it should be clear."
Benson Flemming, 39, an information technologist who lives in Queens, waited in line for 45 minutes sometime around 4 a.m. at a gas station in Brooklyn, only to have the station run dry just as he got to the pumps. He had gone there, the BP at Flushing and Bushwick, in desperation and frustration. He said he hoped the mayor's odd-even rationing could cut the lines.
"If there's something he can do to improve the situation, he needs to do it," Mr. Flemming said.
As the clock struck 6, Jose Dominguez, 36, a truck driver, waited in line to fill up his personal vehicle, a Honda sedan with an even-numbered plate. He said more patience was needed.
"We just have to cope with it," he said. "We just have to cooperate."
As of 6:25, there were 10 cars at the station's pumps, two of them with even-numbered plates. Drivers who violated the rule (doing so is a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail) were not being told to go away by station attendants, and there were no police officers visible.
Nor did enforcement of the rule seem to be immediate at a station in Old Westbury on Long Island, where a radio reporter from WINS said, "I haven't seen the police turn any even-numbered plates away."
At the BP on Flushing and Bushwick, Raj Singh, 23, a station attendant, said he didn't know about the mayor's order.
"I have no idea about that," he said. 
When asked if the police were helping to enforce the rule, he replied, "there are no police."
At 6:35, with the line stretching four blocks down Flushing Avenue, the station ran out of gas. 
One by one, frustrated drivers peeled off to continue their search.

 3:31 P.M. | Odd-Even Gas Limits Set for City and Long Island 
 10:23 p.m. | Updated A revised version of this article is available here.
With gas lines in New York City still stubbornly long and no relief for gas shortages in sight, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg imposed an odd-even gas rationing rule Thursday that goes into effect at 6 a.m. tomorrow. Identical rules are going into effect in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island at 5 a.m. tomorrow.
The mayor said the measure, imposed by emergency order and similar to one put in place in 12 New Jersey counties by Gov. Chris Christie on Saturday that has been considered effective, should cut down lines and allow gas stations to stay open later. 
"This is not a step that we take lightly," he said, "but given the shortage that we will face for the next few weeks and the growing frustrations of New Yorkers, we believe it is the right step."
The gas rule applies to most private cars. Buses, taxis and livery cabs, emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, paratransit vehicles and cars with MD plates are all exempt.
Under the rule, motorists whose license plates end in an odd number or any letter or other character will be able to buy gas only on odd-numbered dates of the month. 
Drivers with even-numbered plates (0 counts as an even number) will be able to buy gas only on even-numbered dates.
Violations of the gas rule are class B misdemeanors, punishable by up to three months in jail.
Only about 25 percent of the city's 800 gas stations are open at a given time during the day, the mayor's press office said (the vast majority of city stations reported by users of the crowd-sourced site GasBuddy are also out of gas). But AAA and the federal Energy Information Administration provided higher, and different, figures, saying that their surveys of stations show that about 70 percent of stations in the city sold gas at some point today. The reasons for the size of the discrepancy were not clear.
Lines of several hours to buy gas, fed in part by panic buying and hoarding, have become the norm in New York City. Fights have broken out on many lines, and the Police Department, already stretched thin dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, has been deployed to maintain order at gas stations all over the city.
In New Jersey, by comparison, Governor Christie said Thursday morning, "I've driven around the state the last two days and I've barely seen any fuel lines any more. There's order, there's plenty of gas."
New Jersey has an advantage over New York in that it is higher in the supply chain, with many refineries operating in New Jersey. In New York City, many gas stations rely on distribution terminals in Brooklyn and Queens that were damaged by the storm, or lost power, and have not come back fully.
 Mayor Bloomberg was asked how long the restriction would remain in place. He said he did not know. 
"We'll keep it in for a while," he said. "You know, if you think about it, it's no great imposition once you get used to it.
"We have to do something," the mayor added, "and this is something that is practical and enforceable and understandable, and doing something is much better than doing nothing."

 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post misstated the odd-even rationing system planned for New York. Qualification for gas will be based on the final character on license plates, not simply the final number. 
 3:25 P.M. | Odd-Even Gas Rationing to Be Imposed on Long Island 
Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island are imposing an odd-even gas rationing system tomorrow morning at 5 a.m., similar to the system going into effect in New York City, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday. 
Governor Cuomo said that Wednesday night's storm and the power failures it cause had led to longer lines in Long Island, especially in Nassau County, today.
"A partial failure of a terminal served by the Buckeye Pipeline, which pumps approximately 4.5 million gallons of gas per day into the New York City and Long Island area, occurred due to power failures late last night," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. " While power was restored this morning, there was an interruption in the fuel supply chain to those regions."
Under the rules announced by the governor, drivers of cars with plates that end in even numbers can buy gas only even-numbered dates, and drivers of cars with plates that end in odd numbers can buy gas only on odd-numbered dates. 
License plates that end in letters or other characters will be considered odd-numbered plates. Out of state plates will be subject to the same rules.
The restriction does not apply to filling of fuel cans, commercial vehicles, taxi or limousine fleets, or emergency fleets, nor does it apply to hand held gas cans.
An odd-even rationing rule in New Jersey, imposed in 12 counties by Gov. Chris Christie on Saturday, is credited with helping reduce gas lines there.

 2:58 P.M. | New Jersey Judge Extends Voting for Displaced Residents 
A New Jersey judge has ruled that displaced voters who could not get through when they requested ballots by fax or e-mail Tuesday can still vote.
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey announced on Thursday that Superior Court Judge Walter Koprowski of Essex County had signed the order extending voting for some people.
The state had said voters displaced by Hurricane Sandy could take until Friday to cast ballots by e-mail or fax, as long as they had applied for the special ballots by 5 p.m. on Election Day. The new order [PDF] applies to people who can prove they tried to apply for electronic ballots on time but could not get them because fax lines were busy or e-mail in-boxes were overflowing.
It was not clear how many voters the order applied to.

 2:11 P.M. | Recovery Could Cost New York $1 Billion, Cuomo Says 
The cost to New York's state government of storm recovery could top $1 billion, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Thursday. 
"I've worked for two years to close deficits, $10 billion deficits, which was all the money in the world," the governor said at an afternoon news conference. "Now we're looking at an additional $1 billion on the state side, maybe higher after what's happened." 
Mr. Cuomo cited an estimate released last week that the entire cost to the region of Hurricane Sandy, in damage and economic loss, could hit $50 billion, $33 billion of it in New York. "That is a staggering number," he said.
The governor also reiterated his insistence that the nation's taxpayers, not the state's, foot the entire bill for damage to the power-delivery system. He was asked whether he would consent to the Long Island Power Authority raising rates if the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid only 75 percent of the utility's damage costs.
"If FEMA only thinks they're going to pay 75 percent of damages, I'm going to oppose that," he said. "If they think any local government or any taxpayer in this state can pay any more for this storm, they are wrong. One hundred percent reimbursement is what we deserve and what we're going to fight for."

 2:10 P.M. | Temporary Housing Bound for New York Area 
Federal officials said on Thursday that they had started moving temporary housing toward the New York region, where tens of thousands of people are in need of housing in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is moving mobile homes or manufactured housing toward areas, including Staten Island, that were the most severely damaged by the storm, W. Craig Fugate, the administrator of FEMA, told reporters in a teleconference. He did not know yet exactly where the housing would be located or when people could move in.
In New York City, the estimates of people in need of housing range from 20,000 to 40,000.
Mr. Fugate said some people affected by the storm were staying as far away as Albany.

 2:01 P.M. | Queens-Midtown Tunnel to Reopen Friday 
The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, which had been flooded by Hurricane Sandy, will reopen to passenger vehicles on Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Thursday.
The tunnel will reopen at 6 a.m. with two inbound and two outbound lanes. No trucks will be permitted to use the tunnel.
The closing of the tunnel had made for difficult travels for drivers from Queens and Long Island and had caused worse-than-usual congestion on the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge.
"Bringing back the Queens-Midtown Tunnel seemed like an impossible job after the storm, but M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels workers have done the impossible," said Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the tunnel.
The tunnel's reopening leaves the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel as the last major New York City crossing still closed. There is no time frame for reopening it.

 12:29 P.M. | Snow Was Better Than Rain, Christie Says 
Yesterday's northeaster set the recovery effort back only about 24 or 36 hours in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie said Thursday morning, striking a relatively hopeful tone.
"'Believe it or not, the snow was helpful," Mr. Christie said. "Because it wasn't rain, it helped on the flooding side." Virtually no significant flooding was reported in the state.
The governor, speaking at a National Guard armory in Somerset, said that while 167,000 of the 390,000 homes without power lost their lights in the northeaster, utility companies were working quickly.
Outside of the most ruined areas, like the barrier islands, where both the infrastructure and many of the individual homes that survived are in tatters, Mr. Christie said he expected that virtually everyone in the state would have power by Saturday.
 Other highlights from his news conference:
*Evacuations: He expects to allow residents of coastal communities from Brick Township to Berkeley Township back into their towns for "controlled visits" by this weekend.
*Gasoline: "I've driven around the state the last two days and I've barely seen any fuel lines any more," Mr. Christie said. He said he hoped to re-evaluate the odd-even rationing rule over the weekend with an eye toward shelving it.
*Mass transit: New Jersey Transit, whose operations across the state remain badly hobbled, did not sustain any new damage in yesterday's storm. The state has also added another commuting option: free bus-plus-ferry service from the Meadowlands park-and-ride to Weehawken to West 39th Street in Midtown. "Come to the Meadowlands and get on a bus," the governor said invitingly.
*Drinking water: The state suffered "a bit of a backslide" yesterday, and there are now boil-water advisories in 11 communities scattered across Sussex, Monmouth and Ocean Counties.
*Schools: 77 percent of the state's schools are open, the same as yesterday but up from a figure in the 40s on Monday.
Unlike his counterparts across the river in New York, Mr. Christie declined to criticize the state's utility companies for the pace of power restoration and in fact praised them and their work crews.
While the utilities might have been able to move more quickly, he said, "I would really caution, for political advantage, elected officials from trying to make villains out of people working 18-hour days trying to help the people of New Jersey." The villain "in this instance," he said, "is Hurricane Sandy."

 9:13 A.M. | Milder Storm Caused at Least 375,000 Homes to Go Dark 
Wednesday's northeaster might not have brought the flooding that was predicted, but thanks to up to a foot of heavy, wet snow and stiff winds, it still knocked out power to at least 375,000 homes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, utility companies said, dealing a setback to the region's slow recovery from Hurricane Sandy.
But utility companies said that their crews - supplemented by thousands of reinforcements from across the country - were working quickly and had already restored power to many or most of their customers that lost it yesterday. With good weather forecast for the next few days, the recovery is expected to move forward. Over all in the tristate area, about 683,000 homes remain in the dark, down from a peak of 5.3 million last week, according to federal figures.
National Weather Service offices covering the three states said that they received virtually no reports of coastal flooding. "Other than in Sandy Hook, where there was minor coastal flooding, we didn't get any reports," said Mitchell Gaines, a meteorologist in the Mount Holly, N.J., office. "But that doesn't necessarily mean that it didn't happen." 
In New Jersey, parts of which got hit with a foot of snow, at least 230,000 homes lost power. But crews were working quickly to restore it. Public Service Electric & Gas said that it had already restored power to 50,000 of the 90,000 customers who went dark yesterday.
In New York, the Long Island Power Authority reported that 60,000 customers lost power. Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and Westchester County, reported that 55,000 homes lost power, about half of which have already been restored. 
Orange and Rockland Utilities, which serves a swath of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, said that 10,000 of its customers lost power but that more than 9,000 had been restored. And Atlantic City Electric, which had finally brought back on line all its customers who lost power in Hurricane Sandy, lost 21,000 more last night but has restored 14,000 of them.
The highest snowfall totals from the storm were seen in Connecticut, with 13.5 inches in Clintonville and 12 inches in nearby North Haven. United Illuminating, which serves those towns and much of the state's coastline, said that about 14,000 of its customers lost power, but that all but a few hundred had been restored as of this morning. 
Other snowfall totals around the region:
*Manchester Township, Ocean County, N.J: 12 inches.
*Danbury, Conn.: 10 inches.
*Cheesequake, N.J.: 8 inches.
*North Valley Stream on Long Island: 7 inches.
*Flushing, Queens: 7 inches.
*Scarsdale, N.Y.: 7 inches.
*Newark and Jersey City: 6 inches.
*Central Park: 4.7 inches.

 9:29 P.M. | Storm Blankets New York Region in Snow 
A powerful northeaster pushing through the New York area has blanketed the region with a thick layer of snow that is more than seven inches deep in some places. 
As of Wednesday evening, parts of Westchester County had received five to seven inches of snow, the National Weather Service said in a statement. The service said that close to three inches had fallen in Central Park in New York City. 
Strong winds have also lashed the region, knocking down power lines and cutting electricity to areas where it had only recently been restored in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The weather service clocked gusts of 40 to 50 miles an hour in coastal regions of New York City and Long Island. 
 8:19 P.M. | L.I.R.R. Resumes Limited Departures 
The Long Island Rail Road resumed limited departures out of Penn Station in Manhattan and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn around 7:50 Wednesday night after suspending service completely earlier in the evening because of the wintry storm moving through the area, Sam Zambuto, a railroad spokesman, said. Despite heavy snow and strong winds, trains will proceed slowly along their appointed routes, though the weather could continue to cause delays, Mr. Zambuto said.

 7:18 P.M. | L.I.R.R. Suspends Departures as Storm Woes Cascade 
The Long Island Rail Road suspended all departures out of Penn Station in Manhattan and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn around 6:40 Wednesday night after a series of storm-related problems developed on several branches, railroad officials said. A spokesman, Sal Arena, said it was not clear when service would resume, though he said the railroad was hopeful that the trains would begin running again Wednesday evening.
All trains that had already left Penn Station and Atlantic Terminal would eventually reach their destinations, railroad officials said.
A railroad spokeswoman, Marjorie Anders, described a litany of woes. "We had a power pole that came down on Little Neck, had to hold four trains," she said. "Then we had mechanical problems at Bethpage. A crossing gate failure on the West Hempstead branch. We have a third-rail fire at Far Rockaway - the train is backing up to the nearest station in Inwood."
Penn Station itself was closed after the shutdown was announced, and masses of commuters stood outside at barricades in the falling snow. Mr. Arena said at 7:10 p.m. that the railroad hoped to reopen Penn Station soon and begin running trains.

 6:59 P.M. | Man Found in Darkened Stairwell Is Latest Storm Victim 
Hurricane Sandy continued to take a deadly toll more than a week after striking the region, as the police raised to 41 the number of New Yorkers whose deaths were connected to storm. 
The latest came on Election Day. 
That is when someone found William McKeon, 78, lying at the bottom of a darkened staircase in a building along Shore Front Parkway in the Rockaways, the police said. Bleeding from the head, he was unresponsive and unconscious. The stairs were wet and covered with sand, the police said.
Mr. McKeon, who was found around 9 a.m., died late Tuesday at Jamaica Hospital from "injuries sustained as a result of the storm," the police said, citing a determination made by the city medical examiner. 
Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, said the death had been deemed "Hurricane Sandy-related" after it was found that Mr. McKeon suffered blunt trauma to the head after falling down in a stairwell that was blacked out by a power failure. 
"If there's a power outage because it was caused by the storm, it's storm-related," she said, adding that "it's still going to be ruled an accident either way."

 6:05 P.M. | New Storm Knocks Out Power to 11,000 Con Ed Customers 
Just when Consolidated Edison's customers thought it was safe to put away the flashlights, Athena blew into town.
 The northeaster called Athena (by the Weather Channel) started tearing down power lines on Wednesday faster than an army of repair crews could put them back up. By about 5 p.m., the storm had knocked out electricity to about 11,000 Con Edison customers in New York City and Westchester County, at least a few of whom had just gotten it back after Hurricane Sandy tore through the region last week.
 Between the storms, the number of Con Ed customers who have lost power in the last 10 days passed the one million mark, or nearly one-third of the company's 3.3 million customers, said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operations at Con Edison.
 By nightfall, the new storm's winds and blowing snow were threatening to drive the crews off the jobs. "At some point," Mr. Miksad said, "when the winds get too severe, we'll be pulling back, either just working on the ground or pulling back entirely and hunkering down until we can get back out there."
 All told, about 75,000 Con Edison customers had no power on Wednesday evening, up from about 64,000 earlier in the day, he said.
 He added that the company planned to have Russian translators accompany some workers in neighborhoods like Brighton Beach that were hit hard by Hurricane Sandy's floodwaters to explain to customers that they must repair their electrical equipment before their power can be restored.

 4:40 P.M. | Site Links Displaced New Yorkers to Donated Housing 
New Yorkers displaced by Hurricane Sandy have another option for free housing: Airbnb, an online clearinghouse for renting out your place - or renting someone else's - has created a special page for people with homes to volunteer and those who need them.
Airbnb announced the plan with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Wednesday, and on its blog.
So far, Airbnb says it's gotten nearly 2,500 last-minute bookings for affected areas, with more than 4,000 people taking advantage of the free housing. The company says it will provide its standard customer service and insurance for hosts.

 4:13 P.M. | High Tide Comes and Goes, but No Major Flooding 
The afternoon tide has come and gone in New York, with no reports of significant flooding, the National Weather Service said. 
While storm surges causing moderate and localized major flooding had been forecast for this afternoon, "It seems to have come in under what we had initially expected, which is a good thing," said David Stark, a meteorologist with the Weather Service's Upton, N.Y., office. 
Some minor flooding was reported in Nassau County. A Newsday reporter posted a photo on Twitter of a flooded street in Freeport.
Street flooding in #Freeport near Nautical Mile. Weren't we just doing this? #LongIslandinstagr.am/p/RvdOCQx0Pk/
- Patrick Whittle (@pxwhittle) November 7, 2012
And some areas on the North Shore of Long Island, around Kings Point, "might touch moderate" flooding this evening, Mr. Stark said. But over all, he said of the flooding, "It looks like it's going to be more of a minor situation." The next high tide, after midnight, should not bring as big a surge, Mr. Stark said.
High winds, rain and snow are still expected, though, and hamper recovery efforts. "This is still a significant system," said Brian Ciemnecki, another Weather Service meteorologist.
In New Jersey, where coastal evacuations were ordered in several towns, the peak concern for coastal flooding is tonight's high tide, around 2 a.m., The Weather Channel said.

 3:53 P.M. | Federal Disaster Centers Close for Storm 
The northeaster now battering the New York region has snarled FEMA's efforts to help residents recover from last week's storm, leading the agency to shut 10 mobile centers.
"We had to close them," said Mike Byrne, the Federal Emergency Management Agency official overseeing the relief work. "We would really be putting them at risk if we kept them open. The minute the weather clears, they'll be back open."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was asked at his afternoon news conference Wednesday why the city was not ordering evacuations if the meteorological threat was dire enough to drive out FEMA. "We do not believe it's necessary to evacuate people," he said.
The closings of the FEMA centers left some residents fuming. "They didn't want to get their precious van wet," a church volunteer in Coney Island told the news site DNAInfo, which reported the closings on Wednesday morning.
Mr. Byrne described them as a minor setback and said the agency's larger efforts in the region were still under way.
He met Wednesday with 400 employees from agencies across the federal Department of Homeland Security who had volunteered to help with the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. They are staying aboard a merchant marine ship stationed off Staten Island's north shore. They had eschewed accommodations on land, he said, to keep hotel rooms available for people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed. Another 400 people were expected to arrive Thursday.
"It's certainly not the Ritz," Mr. Byrne said. "It's certainly enough, and the people and the morale are just great."
The volunteers include information-technology experts, Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees and airport security staff members. They are supplementing the roughly 2,000 FEMA employees in the region for the relief effort, which Mr. Byrne described as "The Four P's: People, Power, Pumps and Picking up Debris."
He said FEMA had already provided more than two million meals to hungry people; helped pump out the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (officially called the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel); and provided rental assistance to families hit by the storm.

 2:03 P.M. | Video: Transit Crews Working to Restore L Line 
Frustrated L-train riders: here's something to keep you entertained as you wait for your beloved, accursed subway line to reopen: seven minutes of video from the M.T.A. of transit hard-hats working down in the tunnel at Bedford Avenue yesterday.
Highlights include a steampunk-looking blue machine [0:48 of the video], a sweet tunnel shot straight out of Hitchcock [1:09], a lingering close-up of rusty electrical panels [3:25] , some good jargon ("I got AC and float on both units, all right, center module... power to the WRPS on all three lights") [4:35] and a great industrial-noise soundtrack throughout. 
Unfortunately, the agency cannot say yet when L service will be restored. Joseph J. Lhota, the M.T.A. chairman, said yesterday that L service had a "lower probability of happening" today than service on the G line, which did in fact resume this morning, and a transit spokesman said this afternoon that not much had changed.
But the video is practically the next best thing to riding the train. Almost.

 12:18 P.M. | Prepare for Setbacks, Christie Warns 
With a storm surge heading toward New Jersey's battered coast and three to six inches of heavy, wet snow possible inland, Gov. Chris Christie warned Wednesday morning that many residents who have gotten their power back since the storm may lose it again.
"I can see us actually moving backwards," Mr. Christie said at a news conference at a firehouse in Harvey Cedars on Long Beach Island, the barrier island that suffered some of the heaviest damage in last week's storm. 
Long Beach Island had been reopened to residents, but the governor said he was cutting off access again, "in consultation with elected officials, for the next day or so, because of this nor'easter."
Mr. Christie said that he had advised officials on the island to reinforce the protective dunes that are credited with limiting damage from Hurricane Sandy. 
"While we're doing what we can to increase the dunes," he said, "we don't know how well they'll hold."
Mr. Christie said that 369,000 homes in the state were still without power, down from a peak of 2.76 million. While power crews are still at work, Mr. Christie said that if winds reach 40 miles an hour today, as they are predicted to do, the crews will have to stop work, per federal safety law. 
Inland, Mr. Christie said, the forecast wet snow would fall on trees that have been weakened by the storm and still have leaves on them that would catch the snow, presenting a threat of downed branches and power lines. As of noon, snow was already falling in northern New Jersey, while sleet pelted the southern half of the state.

- tara laracuente (@taracl87) November 7, 2012
In general, Mr. Christie said, the state is ready for the storm. Shelters are prepared to take in a surge of people, and 20 truckloads of water were on the way to parts of Middlesex County that already have a boil-water advisory in effect. [Update: the advisory was lifted on Wednesday.]
He said that the odd-even gas rationing rule he put into effect on Saturday had been relatively effective and that he would decide over the weekend whether to keep it in place next week.
But nearly a quarter of the state's school systems are not fully operating, 10 percent of residents still lack power, and the governor said he had had just about enough from Mother Nature.
"When I got the final forecast last night," he said, "I'm waiting for the locusts and pestilence next."

 10:19 A.M. | 'Consider Taking Shelter,' Mayor Tells Some Residents 
With the northeaster closing in on the city, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg advised residents of some low-lying neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens to "consider taking shelter with family or friends, or at a city-run shelter," based on "analysis of the erosion caused by Hurricane Sandy."
The mayor specifically cited Gerritsen Beach in Brooklyn, Hamilton Beach near Howard Beach in Queens, and Breezy Point in the Rockaways. But he added that the police would be making similar announcements over loudspeakers in "other areas that saw significant flooding."
The storm surge accompanying this afternoon's high tide is expected to be the highest of the storm. High tide at the Battery in Manhattan is at 1:37 p.m.

The G train is back, mostly. The train, the only line that connects Queens and Brooklyn without traveling through Manhattan, resumed limited service on Wednesday morning, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.
"G trains resumed service at 8:55 a.m. along their full route from Church Avenue in Brooklyn to Court Square in Queens," according to an M.T.A. news release. "The restoration is possible after M.T.A. crews worked around the clock to pump water from the Greenpoint tube under Newtown Creek, which flooded during the storm. The tube suffered severe damage to its signaling and communications systems and requires extensive repairs.

 9:26 A.M. | First Day Back, at a New School 
Wednesday was the first day back at school for many students and faculty affected by Hurricane Sandy.
Franklin K. Lane in Brooklyn, which already houses four high schools under one roof, is absorbing two schools that are normally in one building on Broad Channel.
That campus, called Beach Channel, was flooded, according to students and teachers. It is unclear when the building will be safe for use.
So on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m., students and faculty from hurricane-torn areas hopped off buses and out of family members' cars to head into their new school.
"We made it," said one teacher as she trekked up a small hill toward the campus.
Beach Channel teachers high-fived students and asked about their families. Nearly everyone passing through the school gates seemed relieved to return to a semblance of normality.
"I'm sort of in limbo now," said Liza Sklar, 45, a librarian from the Beach Channel campus. The storm flooded the basement, den and first floor of her house in Oceanside on Long Island, and she has been living in one room with her husband, two children and a dog. The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied them any assistance, she said.
At the entrance to Franklin K. Lane, the three-member social studies team from the Channel View School for Research, one of the two displaced schools, served as the welcome committee. "Oh my God, there is more of our kids, dude," said Craig Dorsi, a world history teacher, as he hugged Brianna Stevens, 14.
"We're trying to make it as emotionally normal as possible," said Mr. Dorsi.
There are 664 students at his school, and many of them are still spread around the area because they evacuated during the storm. Others are at home in storm-affected areas and are without power or Internet. Some may not even realize that school is back in session. "We're expecting anywhere from 40 to 664," said Mr. Dorsi.
With unfamiliar faces coming in, there is always a risk of fights or scuffles. But several students and faculty members from both campuses said they were not overly concerned about conflict among students. The scene outside school on Wednesday was peaceful. "Honestly, I think our kids will be happy to help," said Adrian Constant, 42, an English teacher at one of the high schools on the Franklin K. Lane campus.

 7:54 A.M. | FEMA to Increase Housing Aid for Displaced Families 
Victims of Hurricane Sandy will get a bit of extra help from the federal government to find a temporary place to live.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is announcing Wednesday morning that it is increasing its assistance to displaced families to 125 percent of the normal federal rental subsidy.
This means that Hurricane Sandy victims will get $1,843 a month in assistance for a two-bedroom apartment in New York City, compared with the standard federal subsidy of $1,474.
Even with the extra money, it is far below what many New Yorkers pay in rent. But FEMA officials estimate that this change, which also applies in New Jersey, will allow people displaced by the storm to afford apartments currently out of reach.

 6:43 P.M. | Warnings of Flooding and Strong Winds Starting Wednesday 
The National Weather service issued a coastal flood warning Tuesday afternoon as a northeaster advanced toward the East Coast, predicting moderate flooding Wednesday in most of coastal New York and New Jersey, but possible localized major flooding on the south shore of Long Island.
The area at highest risk for major flooding is from Lindenhurst to Freeport in Nassau County, several towns east of Long Beach and the Rockaways, which were devastated in last week's storm.
The latest Weather Service forecast calls for a storm surge Wednesday of 2.5 to 5 feet, with New York Harbor likely to have a surge on the lower end of that range, said David Stark, a meteorologist in the Upton, N.Y., office. The storm surge from Hurricane Sandy at the Battery at the bottom of Manhattan by comparison was 9.23 feet. The highest surge Wednesday, closer to 5 feet, will be on the south and north shores of Long Island, Mr. Stark said.
The flood warning is in effect from 11 a.m. Wednesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. That period includes the high tides at 1:37 p.m. Wednesday and 2:40 a.m. Thursday in the Battery.
"Locally major flooding could occur in places due to changes to underwater slopes and/or loss of protective dunes, both caused by Sandy," the flood warning reads. "Widespread flooding of vulnerable shore roads and/or basements will hamper recovery efforts."
The strongest winds, too, will be on Long Island, with gusts up to 70 miles an hour possible, Mr. Stark said. Sustained winds across the region will be in the range of 25 to 40 miles an hour - enough to bring down weakened trees and lead to another round of power failures.
"With the wind and the potential coastal flooding," Mr. Stark said, "it is shaping up to have a significant impact on our area." 
The Weather Service is also predicting moderate coastal flooding in New Jersey, which could lead to closings of flood-prone road like Routes 35 and 36 and other roads that are being used by crews working on storm response. "They many not be able to do much work tomorrow," said Dean Iovino, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's Mount Holly, N.J., office.
The storm is expected to bring one to two inches of rain, with the figure in New York City being near the low end. There is little chance of snow in the city, the Weather Service said, but the northern suburbs could see some wet flakes, and Orange County and the lower Hudson Valley could see an inch or more.

 5:00 P.M. | National Guard Truck Kills Pedestrian, 82, on Canal St. 
 A National Guard truck carrying Guard members involved in the storm relief effort struck and killed an 82-year-old man on Canal Street in Chinatown on Tuesday afternoon, the authorities said.
 The man, who was not immediately identified by the police, suffered "severe body trauma" from the impact with the large, green-camouflage-color truck, one of more than 600 vehicles that the New York National Guard has deployed to carry food, water and other relief to storm-struck areas of the state.
 He was pronounced dead at New York Downtown Hospital shortly after the accident, which occurred around 1:25 p.m. near the intersection with Centre Street, the police said.
"They were conducting a resupply mission when this unfortunate accident occurred," said Eric Durr, a spokesman for the National Guard. He said the vehicle belonged to the 369th Sustainment Brigade, based out of the Harlem armory, and was part of a convoy.
 The police said the truck, a personnel carrier, was traveling west on Canal Street when it struck the man, who was crossing Canal from north to south. It was not clear whether the man or the truck's driver was disobeying a traffic signal; no summons was immediately issued and the police said the investigation was continuing. The driver was not publicly identified.
Mr. Durr said the convoy had been involved in carting supplies and was en route to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to pick up items donated by Wal-Mart and then take them to a relief staging area at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn for distribution.
"There was a police escort in front," Mr. Durr said. "The truck that struck the gentleman was the last vehicle in the convoy."
He added, "Apparently, the gentleman stepped off into traffic."

 1:57 P.M. | Thieves Hit Polling Site but Voters' Resolve Is Intact 
In the storm-battered Rockaways, already beset with huge problems from Hurricane Sandy, more of them cropped up before dawn Tuesday at one of the biggest polling sites.
Poll workers arrived in the dark to find that the portable toilets and the main generator to power the site had been stolen, after being delivered hours earlier by federal emergency workers.
The thieves did leave a smaller generator behind, but siphoned out all of its gas, said John Luisi, a Board of Elections official helping to run the site.
"I guess they didn't realize Rockaway is a war zone right now," said Estel Lyons, a registered nurse who lives on 123rd Street and was working as a poll worker. Ms. Lyons said she voted and decided to work at the polling site because "you want to feel like your voice is being heard."
Poll workers scrambled to get gas to run the remaining generator and open the site, in the outdoor playground of Public School 180, which overlooks Jamaica Bay at Beach 104th Street in Queens and has views of the Manhattan skyline. Voters arrived and flooded into the dimly lighted, low-slung tents set up for them to cast ballots.
Most of the voters were local residents whose homes had suffered damage from the storm and who have been living without power for more than a week. Others had evacuated the Rockaways and had returned to vote.
"I wasn't going to let no hurricane stop me from voting," said Amos Eberhardt, 61, who left his room in a halfway house on Beach 116th Street and moved into a halfway house in Brooklyn, from which it took him 90 minutes to travel by bus back to the Rockaways to cast his vote.
Nicole McCormick, 35, a medical administrator, had ridden out the hurricane in her upper-floor apartment and then moved to a friend's home in Jamaica, Queens. But Ms. McCormick - with two children, Tyler Frazier, 14, and Cheniya Sanford, 12 - spent several hours driving back and forth Tuesday so she could vote for President Obama.
"This is how we can get the word out, that despite the devastation, we can still make an effort to have our voice heard," she said, standing with other voters in the inch-deep dried silt on the blacktop, residue from seawater that flooded head-high through this area a week ago, leaving scores of houses flooded and cars ruined, and causing fires that destroyed more than 120 houses.
Regarding the storm, the cleanup and the election, Ms. McCormick said: "It's all connected. We feel like we've lost so much, so we're making an effort to vote because we don't want to lose our voice, too."

 2:06 P.M. | Parks, Playgrounds and Beaches Will Close Before New Storm 
New York City mobilized in preparation for the northeaster expected to hit the city tomorrow, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that parks, playgrounds and beaches would close for 24 hours beginning at noon Wednesday.
Mr. Bloomberg said that the northeaster was expected to bring a surge in the water level of two to four-and-a-half feet at tomorrow's high tides, roughly at 1 p.m. and midnight - far less than Hurricane Sandy brought ashore, but enough to re-flood low-lying areas. 
The new storm, the mayor said, will carry winds of 25 to 35 miles an hour to the city, with gusts up to 55 miles an hour late Wednesday afternoon, as well as an inch of rain that may mix with sleet.
"We could have some snow on the ground and certainly snow on the trees," the mayor said at a briefing at City Hall on Tuesday afternoon. "That makes the trees that already have their bases flooded more likely to fall over."
Earlier Tuesday, the mayor announced that recycling was being discontinued temporarily to free up sanitation crews to work in the neighborhoods hit hardest by last week's storm. 
Garbage pickup, too, in areas not badly storm damaged, may be reduced, from three times a week to two or from two times a week to one, the mayor said.
"Just put your garbage out," the mayor said, "and we'll get to it."

 1:00 P.M. | In Bay Head, Making the Most of a Fought-For Polling Place 
BAY HEAD, N.J. - Just after daybreak, under a pink-hued sky, Shelly Coleman and her husband, Terrance, bundled up in winter jackets, left their sodden, water-damaged home and headed to the Bay Head firehouse, where a makeshift polling place had sprouted - literally overnight.
The couple walked through the sand-blown and mucky streets, sidestepping the occasional dead fish that lay on its side, a lifeless eye staring up at them. The firehouse, powered by an industrial-size generator that rumbled like the engine of a jetliner, was one of the few places with heat in this tiny seaside borough, just below Point Pleasant Beach.
"I'm going to vote in here all day long - it's nice and warm," declared Brent Wentz, 72, as he walked into the firehouse Tuesday about 7:30 a.m.
Ms. Coleman approached the borough's clerk and exclaimed: "Guess what? We got water back on Friday. It was soooo exciting."
"It's the little things," the municipal clerk, Patricia Applegate, 60, said and nodded. "You don't realize these little things that you take for granted until they are gone."
And so it went all morning at the Bay Head polling place, where residents of the 0.7-square-mile borough and poll workers provided one another with storm-recovery updates: Who has water? Hot water? A heat source? Propane?
Until Monday afternoon, state and county election officials were telling Bay Head residents that this pocket of Ocean County would have no local polling place. Most of the roughly 800 registered voters in Bay Head had evacuated and not returned, officials said. Instead, Bay Head voters would be sent inland, over the Lovelandtown Bridge, into Point Pleasant.
On Monday afternoon, however, Mayor William Curtis mounted a resistance. 
"It was a fight. They didn't want to deliver voting booths down here," Mayor Curtis said, as voters streamed into the firehouse Tuesday. "They wanted us to go across the bridge because they didn't think there was going to be enough people here to vote. I just said: 'No, no, no. We have enough people here in town that will vote.' This is us. This is our home and people are pulling together and we want to be here."
The mayor and other residents pointed out that many of their cars were destroyed in the storm and driving out of town, through a National Guard checkpoint and back, was a hardship. They also cited the lack of available gas.
In the days leading to the election, several residents, their homes destroyed by a torrent of ocean and lake water, said they felt forgotten by the federal government, particularly FEMA.
Leslie Wentz, 58, said she had no heat and had not showered in days. She was using baby wipes to stay clean, she said. The election, she said, was not her top priority.
"I think everybody is just in survival mode," she said. "Everybody is trying to survive. The town is doing a great job. The church is doing a great job, but I feel like the federal government is not coming in and doing anything. I can't get anybody to help me."
She said she voted for Mitt Romney. When asked about her choice for Congress, Ms. Wentz said: "I am so brain-dead right now. I don't even know those people. I just want a new president. We have no heat."
Ms. Coleman emerged from the voting booth and stopped to show a reporter her hands, blistered and raw from hours spent ripping up wet carpet in her home. 
She also confided a worry, speaking in a low, almost secretive, tone, even though she stood outside and no one was around:
"Someone went and wrote Romney on the beach and we think we are going to get in trouble because they went and wrote Romney on the beach and Obama is going to stick it to us," she said. "We were like, who is the person that did that because now if Obama wins, then we are not going to get aid. I think they saw it from the helicopter when Obama flew over. Is that terrible? I don't know who did it. But it made some people nervous."

 1:01 P.M. | Virus Outbreak Spurs Removal of Storm Refugees From School 
Almost 170 evacuees and homeless people are being moved from the John Jay High School campus, an imposing building in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that houses four schools, because of the outbreak of norovirus, a common and highly contagious intestinal bug that has hit 13 children since Friday, a Homeless Services Department spokeswoman said Tuesday.
The evacuees will be moved all together, and the school cleaned so that students can return on Thursday, a Department of Education spokeswoman said.
The building has been used as a shelter for evacuees of Hurricane Sandy and homeless people. Students returning to eight city school buildings being used as shelters were slated to go back on Wednesday, in some cases sharing the building with the shelter population.
The additional day's delay at John Jay frustrated parents of children who attend school there.
"The D.O.E. should not be responsible for temporary housing," said Loretta Redmond, a parent at Millennium Brooklyn High School, one of the schools, in an e-mail to Dennis Walcott, the chancellor of the Department of Education. "There are no health screenings being done at the shelter - never mind any other kind of screenings."
The 13 children who were affected by the virus have been separated, with their families, from the healthy population in the shelter, said Jay Varma, deputy commissioner for disease control at the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He said the outbreak was not surprising considering the time of year and the fact that "these are schools and there wasn't an expectation that they would be long-term facilities for the homeless."
He said the virus could not live long after the school was disinfected and cleaned. "We don't think there is a risk to students after they get back to school," he said. If they do get sick, they will probably have acquired the virus in the community or from somebody else, he said.
It was unclear where the evacuees would be sent and whether that facility would also be a school. Citing privacy, officials said only that they were being sent to the Bronx. "Evacuees will be moved to another facility this afternoon, where those who are ill will receive necessary treatment and be placed in separate space while they recover," said a health department spokeswoman.
The Department of Education relocated its staff out of the building as soon as it learned about the "common but contagious stomach virus," said Erin Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Education Department.
Ms. Redmond, the parent, was dubious that school would actually start on Thursday.
"I hope to really see that happen," she said. "I am not convinced since we've been given so many stories."

 12:46 P.M. | 350,000 New York Homes Still Lack Power 
Though power has been restored to more than 1.7 million homes in New York since the storm hit, about 350,000 homes are still dark, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday.
"That's down from what it was, about 2.1 million, but it's still not O.K.," he said. "It's nice that other people have their power on, but it doesn't mean much to you until you have your power on." 
More than 103,000 customers in Nassau County, 89,000 in Suffolk County, 66,000 in New York City and 63,000 in Westchester County are still waiting for their lights to go back on. Mr. Cuomo reiterated his annoyance with Consolidated Edison and the Long Island Power Authority for the pace of restorations, though the utilities have said they are working as fast as they possibly can.
"I don't believe that their performance has been adequate, period," Mr. Cuomo said.

 12:43 P.M. | Cuomo Asks Corporations to Contribute to Recovery Effort 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called on American corporations Tuesday to contribute to the storm cleanup effort.
"We're going to need home furnishings," the governor said at a news conference. "We're going to need lumber. We're going to need furnaces."
The governor thanked many companies, including Wal-Mart and PepsiCo, for having stepped forward already, but warned that he would come knocking at the doors of others.
Mr. Cuomo was joined at the news conference by a regional vice president at Home Depot, Tony Lemma, who announced that the chain was donating ten truckloads of cleaning products to be split between New York and New Jersey, containing cleaning supplies, chemicals, mops, brooms, shovels, dust masks and batteries.
Mr. Cuomo said he had been asked by a corporate leader what the state needed.
"I said, 'We need everything,'" the governor said. "Entire households were lost. We appreciate, we need, and we request corporate America to come forward and be helpful."

 12:10 P.M. | After a Gas Station Runs Dry, Cabbies Park and Wait 
At a Hess station on 10th Avenue and 44th Street, a long line of taxis and sedans had come to a standstill on Tuesday morning. After two tankers refueled the station at 6 a.m., the supply was depleted by 8:40 a.m. Another tanker was said to be coming, so drivers parked their cars and waited under the watchful gaze of police officers. A half-dozen men toting empty gasoline containers stood on the sidewalk.
Fritz Petit-Homme, a Brooklyn cabdriver, said he had no choice but to sit and wait since his yellow cab was down to the last quarter tank. "It's better to stay in line than to go," he said. "Even if they deliver at 5, I wait."
Mr. Petit-Homme, 54, said that he loses $30 to $35 every hour that he is parked instead of driving. He said that he tried to fill up in Brooklyn but that stations there were closed, or the lines were worse than in Manhattan. He said his friend, also a cabdriver, waited in line for five hours on Saturday at a Brooklyn gas station, only to find that the pump was tapped out when he got to the front. "It was so bad I didn't even try," said Mr. Petit-Homme, who opted instead to stay home.
Another driver, John Solomon, was third in the line but had to leave after two hours to pick up a client at Rockefeller Center at 11 a.m. There was still no tanker in sight. "What did I accomplish for two hours?" he said. "That's a disappointment."
Mr. Solomon, 50, who lives in Washington Heights, said he planned to conserve gas by turning off the heat, and keeping his foot off the gas pedal as much as possible. He said he would return to the Hess station tonight and if there was still no gas, he might even drive out to New Jersey. 
"You know when you're so close, but so far?" he said before driving away. "I'm like, 'Really, no more gas?'"

 11:54 A.M. | Some Displaced Voters Run Into Problems in New Jersey 
In New Jersey, state-mandated rules to enable displaced voters and emergency workers to vote apparently are being thwarted by uninformed local election officials and by technology.
Catherine Weiss, who runs the pro bono program at Lowenstein Sandler, a law firm and partner in the national Election Protection network, said late Tuesday morning that while the state rules allowed provisional voting outside voters' home districts, "we are having issues with local polling places not permitting this to happen."
She also said that while another state directive allows displaced voters to cast their ballots by e-mail or fax, local servers "have been overwhelmed by requests and produced backlogs of a couple of thousand emails that cannot be processed by the deadline."

 11:53 A.M. | Bellevue Hospital Is on Lockdown 
Bellevue Hospital Center, which evacuated hundreds of patients after Hurricane Sandy struck, is now on lockdown because of possible structural damage from the storm, according to hospital employees, who were informed of the decision on Tuesday morning. The hospital administration told employees that the lockdown was ordered so that the structural safety of the building could be assessed.
No one is being allowed into the building, on First Avenue and 27th Street in Manhattan, to retrieve possessions or to carry out work. But liquid nitrogen is being delivered to a number of laboratories. It was not clear from the announcement what the liquid nitrogen was supposed to protect.
But doctors said that Bellevue labs contained many perishable research projects and patient tests, including blood and urine tests. It is not clear whether those tests have been compromised. Ian Michaels, a spokesman for Bellevue, said he was checking.
The administration said it was not yet known how long the structural assessment would take or when people would be permitted back in the building.
Bellevue, the city's flagship public hospital and major trauma center, housed 725 patients when the storm hit last week. It had to be evacuated after the rising waters of the East River gushed into its cavernous basement at the height of the storm. The hospital lost power and went to backup generators. When the basement fuel pumps failed, nurses, administrators and medical residents passed buckets of fuel up 13 flights of stairs to feed the generators through the night Monday until the National Guard was called in to relieve them. Critically ill patients had to be dragged down many flights of stairs on sleds. The last two patients, who were too sick to be carried, were taken out over the weekend, as some elevator service was restored.

 11:40 A.M. | In Storm-Battered Red Hook, Determined to Vote 
Susan Mugo, 36, an information technologist who had to evacuate from her home in Red Hook, Brooklyn, returned Tuesday morning to vote.
It was not easy. Her usual polling place in a public school was closed because of storm damage. There were no directions there to the alternate site. "I had to ask around," she said. But eventually, she found herself standing in the line in the bright sunshine outside P.S. 27, waiting to cast her ballot.

- Jessica Lee (@jessicalee27) November 6, 2012
The school lies in a largely powerless area a few blocks from a blacked-out public-housing complex, the Red Hook Houses. A young woman stood outside the school beside a Volkswagen Passat decorated with Obama bumper stickers and held up a sign that read "shuttle," offering residents of the Red Hook Houses rides to and from the polls.
Patrick Carroll, 30, an actor who lives in Red Hook, said that while he was not hit hard by the storm, it did motivate him politically.
"The storm made me start wanting to do more to make other people know what's at risk," he said. "With the storm, things are seeming more at risk than they were a couple weeks ago."
He had worked a phone bank, making calls to voters in Nevada, Florida and Ohio. 
"I really believe Obama's the guy for the job," he said.

 11:11 A.M. | Wrapped Around the Corner, a Line Inches Along 
The line to vote at the Theater for the New City on First Avenue in the East Village wound around the corner onto Ninth Street. By 8:40 a.m., at least 175 people were patiently reading newspapers, manipulating smartphones and drinking coffee, advancing not even a foot a minute. 
Alex Schroder, 23, said she hoped it would be no longer than an hour, because she had to get to her job as a preschool teacher. "I am really excited to vote," she said, "so I don't mind waiting."

 10:51 A.M. | Rejected Ballots and Talk of the Economy in the East Village 
At the Sirovich Senior Center on East 12th Street, the voters who arrived at 8:10 a.m. finished a little after 9 am. Several voters were given ballots that weren't neatly torn from the book, so the scanner rejected them.
Maura Green, 30, a jewelry designer who had waited an hour in line, was one of them. When she returned to the poll workers' table for a new ballot, they kept her standing there for another 15 or 20 minutes while they blamed each other for the problem (several other voters had returned to the table with rejected ballots as well) or attended to other voters in the growing line.
"It seemed the poll workers were not very organized or didn't prepare," Ms. Green said. "It was very chaotic. They didn't seem to have a plan."
Ms. Green said what was on her mind was "the economy. Things have gotten better for me over the last four years. I don't know if it has to do with Obama." Four years ago, she said, she was "underemployed" and working retail. Now she has a job as a designer and also sells her designs independently.
Paula Zanger, 49, who runs Orange Howell, a small company that makes silver ornaments, said that as a 15th generation American, she wanted to say something positive about the election and its outcome, but she could not. "Money and work are on my mind, definitely picking up work post-Sandy," she said. "I think a lot's going to open up psychologically after the election. Everyone's on hold in some form or another."
She added: "It's about movement. It's been very stalled out. I'm really good at what I do and I have a lot of experience, and I've never seen it like this. And I hate being that negative, because it's not American and everybody knows it's not good for business."
Ms. Zanger supported President Obama and, because she pays for her own health insurance - and has some pre-existing conditions - she is counting on AFA. But she said she was more passionate about the Senate races than the presidential race. 
"I have a very hard time understanding Obama vs. Mitt," she said, "because it's as if the majority of the population expects the pedagogy, one person, to change their lives after eight years of Bush, which on the scale of the country is quite impossible. Like big daddy's gonna save us. It doesn't work that way."

 10:44 A.M. | Mr. Ma Attempts to Vote 
On the third floor of a New York University building on East 13th Street, lines of voters snaked around corners and through hallways. Workers said residents would have to fill out ballots by hand, then have them scanned. But by a little after 9 a.m., workers said the scanner had stopped working.
Residents deposited their sheets in a box instead - if they could obtain one at all. Voters in the 59th election district were told to separate into two lines, one for last names beginning with A through L and another for M through Z.
"Ma," one man said, as he reached the front of the M through Z line. A poll worker said she could not find his name, showing him her first page of entries, which began with a list of "Mac" names. He was not in the A through L book, either.
Mr. Ma, who did not give his first name, was instructed to vote by affidavit. He said he would, but was concerned that others in the city might also become lost in this alphabetical Bermuda Triangle.
"It's O.K.," the worker said. "There aren't a lot of Asians in this district."

 10:14 A.M. | At 2 Polling Sites, Problems With Vote-Scanning Machines 
There were reports on Tuesday morning of problems with the vote-scanning machines that were being used in New York City for a presidential election for the first time. At Riverside Church in Manhattan, all three scanners were down, having jammed not long after voting began at 6 a.m. Poll workers said they expected to be counting "emergency ballots" manually until 4 a.m. Wednesday.
At a polling site on 80th Street on the East Side the story was much the same with all the scanning machines not functioning. Poll workers said that they were aware of the problem but that no one had arrived to repair the machines. Instead workers were relying on absentee ballots.

A spokeswoman for the utility said this morning that because the damage in the 11-mile-long peninsula was so extensive, restoring power on a "case-by-case basis" was the best LIPA could offer now. She said there was no timetable for full restoration.

At Public School 163, on the Upper West Side, hundreds of voters waited on the sidewalk and packed into a gym for what turned out to be a chaotic voting situation. Voters had to wait in four lines - to determine which election district they lived in, to get a ballot, to fill out the ballot, and to get the ballot scanned. The process took an hour, there was no help for the disabled, the font on the ballot was tiny, and people became increasingly upset and were trying to advise election workers on how it might run better.

 8:24 A.M. | A Frustrated Voter in Westchester County 
Randy Harter, 66, an artist and designer, voted in New Rochelle, in Westchester County, at 6 a.m. and said his frustrating experience was symptomatic of incompetence in government. It was an issue that was on his mind because of what he described as an incompetent response to Hurricane Sandy in an area where thousands of houses still have no power more than a week after the storm struck. 
He asked an election worker how to fill out a paper ballot he'd never seen before and was told: "Just fill it out." When his ballot was inserted, the machine jammed. A second worker came over and brought another machine, and it too jammed. He eventually was given an envelope in which to place a ballot that would be hand-counted. The entire voting experience took 45 minutes, Mr. Harter said.
"Morons are running things, and nobody's in charge," he said afterward.
Still, he voted for President Obama, even though he is running the federal government.
"He inherited a government that's incompetent, and he's trying to fix it," Mr. Harter said.

 8:21 A.M. | At a Brooklyn Polling Place, Just the Usual Chaos 
Susan Edgerley, editor of The New York Times's Dining section, sent this dispatch from her polling place in Brooklyn. 
At Public School 29 in Cobble Hill, the line was short at 6 a.m., but it took me 45 minutes to vote because I was sent to the wrong place twice (or rather, two different wrong places) and my district location was read incorrectly three times. Finally, a poll worker used an envelope to better read across the line and tell me my election district.
Poll workers were the usual mix - one tried to look me up by my first name, Susan, rather than my last name, Edgerley. Another was listing the date on voter ID cards as 2002. I overheard one worker telling another to go help out at a table because "they don't know what they're doing over there." The same worker told another - the one who had twice told me the wrong district for my address - to sit down and stop yelling.
On my side of the school gymnasium, only one of two ballot scanners was working. Oh well.

For New Jersey commuters seeking a way into Manhattan, options on Monday were few and unappealing. 
But that has started to change today with the restoration of some PATH service. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said that limited PATH service would be reinstated, with fares waived, between Journal Square in Jersey City and 33rd Street in Manhattan, though stops would not be made at Christopher and Ninth Streets.
The flow of commuters started as a trickle early on Tuesday, judging from the Port Authority's Twitter feed, which posted a picture of the Journal Square station.

 12:03 A.M. | Evacuation Ordered in New Jersey Town Ahead of Storm 
Authorities in Brick Township, a coastal town in New Jersey that was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, have ordered residents in low-lying waterfront areas to evacuate ahead of a northeaster forecast to hit the region this week. 
The storm "has the potential to strongly impact our town with high winds, storm surge and flooding," a statement posted on the town's Web site said Monday. 
Residents in areas prone to flooding must evacuate by 6 p.m. Tuesday, the statement said. 
The storm is expected to move into the region on Wednesday evening, producing torrential rain, high seas and wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.

 8:32 P.M. | Police Pitch In on Relief Effort 
Officer Matthew Youssef rapped several times on the glass door of a darkened single-family home in Howard Beach, Queens, on Monday afternoon before cracking it slightly and leaning inside.
"Anyone home?" he called out.
"Downstairs!" a man's voice responded.
He and another officer, Santo Collardo, entered and descended into a wrecked basement to find out what food, water or other supplies the man, a 59-year-old school bus driver named Richard Eaton, might need.
The officers were a small part of a sprawling relief effort joined by the New York Police Department to assist those still reeling from Hurricane Sandy, bringing food to corners of the city without power and going door to door to inform residents huddled in their homes of the relief supplies nearby.
Deputy Inspector James Klein, directing the department's effort from a parking lot at Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, Queens, said the donations had poured in. By 2:30 p.m. Monday, he said, the police there had loaded two panel trucks, 10 police vans and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus full of supplies, including boxes of Cheerios, blankets and cleaning supplies.
"Transportation is at a premium - sometimes we have to use our imagination," Inspector Klein said. 
Among the items most in demand a week after the storm hit, he said, were garbage bags and baby diapers as well as items that might not seem as obvious, such as garden hoses and dehumidifiers. "For getting the moisture out of homes," he said. 
That afternoon, Officers Youssef and Collardo were part of a group sent to the desolate corner of Cross Bay Boulevard and 164th Avenue near a Staples store. There, they popped out the legs on a small gray table and began stacking boxes of baby food, dog snacks and water among myriad other items - matzos, milk - across from the boarded-up hulk of a 7-Eleven store and a pizza parlor, where green graffiti read, "We are open OPEN."
No sooner had the officers arrived on the corner, with no power to light the signals and not a pedestrian in sight, than residents began to emerge.
"Ma'am, do you need water?"
"Yes," said Concetta Napolitano, 68, emerging from a black Mercedes with her husband, Neil. She said they had no power in their home nearby since the storm and had lost one car. She left with sterile cleaning wipes, a big bottle of water and a large package of Q-tips.
Another man, Santo Bonnano, also took water as well as two boxes of cereal and some dog food for the miniature schnauzer that he said had become the family's only source of heat in their bone-cold home.
As in other hard-hit neighborhood, residents were attempting to keep up with life's routines.
"I worked today," said Mr. Eaton, the school bus driver. But, he added, "most of the kids weren't going to school today." A yellow minibus that he drove to public schools around the Upper West Side that morning sat in his driveway. He said the storm had destroyed three of his cars and a school bus.
A water line could be seen on a Pontiac parked across the street; it stopped just below the door handles.
Like many New Yorkers, members of the Police Department have faced their own storm-related hardships. Some are still without power or struggling to repair heavily damaged homes. The department has said the homes of more than 500 officers sustained "catastrophic damage" from the storm.
Five police unions, representing patrolmen up to captains, announced the creation of a fund to assist officers directly affected by the storm, a number they put at 1,500 officers. "They've lost the clothes off their backs" in some cases, said Roy T. Richter, president of the Captain's Endowment Association. "And they still got to go to work."
But among those coordinating relief, there were few complaints about the long hours or the difficulties they faced once home.
"Everybody's got a story," Inspector Klein said. "That's what drives them to do what they're doing."

A conference for New York politicians scheduled for later this week in Puerto Rico was canceled on Monday in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

But several prominent elected officials, reluctant to lounge poolside while their constituents search for food and shelter, said earlier Monday that they would stay home this year because of the devastation from the storm.

 7:43 P.M. | 9/11 Memorial to Reopen 
The National September 11 Memorial, which has been closed because of flooding during Hurricane Sandy, will reopen on Tuesday, Joseph C. Daniels, president and chief executive of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, said in a statement on Monday evening. 
A deluge of at least seven feet of seawater flooded the main floor of the museum during last week's storm, nearly immersing two fire trucks. Construction of the museum, which is 70 feet below the memorial plaza downtown, has been plagued by delays amid a financing dispute between the memorial foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The floodwaters have been "substantially removed" and crews are now working to dry out the site, Mr. Daniels said. 
The memorial will temporarily operate under limited hours, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the statement said. The number of visitors will also be limited. Tickets that were reserved before the storm will be honored. 
The 9/11 Memorial Visitor Center at 90 West Street will remain closed for now.

 7:30 P.M. | In Coney Island, Waiting in Line for Food and Supplies 
It was crowded in the parking lot beside MCU Park in Coney Island all day on Monday, but there were not many cars. 
Instead, crowds of people outside the minor-league baseball stadium lined up to register for federal assistance or emergency supplies like blankets, water and dry ice; to charge their phones; or just to eat a warm meal, namely a hot dog, appropriate for the locale - Coney Island hosts a famous hot dog eating contest every year.
Seagulls circled above the lines, occasionally swooping down to grab a discarded bun. City buses converted to heating shelters also idled in the lot, where the elderly warmed up and children played while their parents inched forward in line. 
"We have nothing," said Ali King, 55, who added that he had been walking up 15 flights of stairs daily to bring his son blankets. "We come here on this line every day trying to ascertain something that can assist us to get through the night."
A week had passed since Hurricane Sandy hit, depositing great amounts of sand several blocks inland, and leaving the streets blocked by rising piles of debris. In Coney Island, as in many other areas devastated by the storm, people had stayed in their apartments, despite plummeting temperatures and diminishing stores of food. 
The reasons were several: Some were afraid of what would happen to their homes if they left; others were worried about losing their public-housing benefits like Section 8 if they went to shelters. Some people were undocumented immigrants and had no friends to call on, and feared any contact with the system. 
After a week without services, though, the collective resolve had begun to break down, and people descended on the parking lot and other relief stations around Coney Island in greater numbers. The line was as diverse as the census findings for these tracts: there were elderly Russians, young African-Americans, families from Central America. They were now united in a common plight, holding empty cardboard boxes and turning their backs to a bitter wind.

 6:21 P.M. | Con Ed Defends Itself 
Consolidated Edison responded to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's criticism on Monday evening by saying that the company had already restored four times as many customers as it ever had to restore after a storm.
"The 800,000 or so we've restored is equivalent to four Hurricane Irenes," said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operations at Con Edison. "We still have one hurricane to restore. It's been a massive undertaking."
The company still had 140,000 customers lacking power, down from 960,000, a total that was nearly five times the 200,000 Con Ed customers who lost power when Hurricane Irene swept through the region last year.
"I don't know of a way we could have done this any faster," Mr. Miksad said. "I think we're doing well. I think we have a very efficient operation going. I can't imagine a more efficient operation, but I'm always open to suggestions. I think we're moving as fast as humanly possible."
He said the number of customers in Westchester County without power had been pared to 62,000 from more than 210,000 at the peak. In Manhattan, the company had to reduce voltage by 5 percent to three networks downtown that have had power flowing again since the end of last week.

 6:01 P.M. | Displaced New Yorkers Can Vote Anywhere in State 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday that he had signed an executive order allowing voters living in areas most affected by Hurricane Sandy to vote by affidavit ballot at any polling place in the state. 
"Just because you're displaced doesn't mean you should be disenfranchised," Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference. He added, "Compared to what we have had to deal with the past week, this will be a walk in the park, going out and voting."
New Jersey had taken a similar step, and good-government groups and some local elected officials had urged Mr. Cuomo to follow suit. Mr. Cuomo said displaced voters would receive the ballot specific to the area to which they had evacuated, meaning that in many cases, they would not be able to vote for candidates in local, legislative and Congressional races, but only for the two statewide contests on the ballot, president and United States Senate. 
The executive order applies to voters in New York City and in Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester Counties. Because the affidavit ballots will not be good for local races, Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Josh Vlasto, said, "we strongly urge only displaced people to utilize the affidavit ballot."
Each polling place that was rendered unusable by the storm has been replaced with an alternate location, and voters who want to participate in their full slate of races can do so at the alternate location. Mr. Cuomo's step was intended largely for people who have moved so far from their homes that voting Tuesday at their neighborhood's temporary polling place would not be possible.
Several groups and public officials praised Mr. Cuomo's action, including the New York City public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who described it as "exactly the kind of flexible problem solving we need from government as we recover from this storm."
But one good-government group, Citizens Union, said it was concerned that a large number of voters would now seek to cast affidavit ballots without realizing that they would not be able to vote in local races, which in many cases are far more competitive than the two statewide contests.
"It's just going to cause greater confusion in an already chaotic election and hurt down-ballot races where turnout will be very low," said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union. "It's a well-intentioned move, but its consequences are not ultimately helpful."
Mr. Cuomo, asked about the difficulty of voting for those whose communities had been evacuated or whose polling places had changed, said, "It is what it is. You have people who are displaced. We're trying to do the best we can. We want everyone to vote. We want to make it as easy as possible."

 5:35 P.M. | Gas Supply Is Slowly Improving 
The gasoline supply was slowly improving in the New York City region on Monday, according to AAA.
Here is the organization's updated estimates of the number of gas stations that are open in areas damaged by Hurricane Sandy:

        
New York City: 60 to 65 percent are open (compared with 40 to 45 percent open on Friday)
        
New Jersey: 55 to 60 percent are open (compared with 45 to 50 percent open on Friday)
        
Long Island: 50 to 55 percent are open (compared with 35 to 40 percent open on Friday)
Still, long lines continue in parts of northern New Jersey, New York City and Long Island. The primary problem remains a lack of electricity rather than low supplies. Many gas stations remain without power, which results in increased demand at the limited number of pumps that are open. There also have been logistical challenges in delivering gasoline to open stations, but these problems are expected to diminish now that pipelines, distribution terminals and harbors have reopened in many areas.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking at a briefing on Monday afternoon, said that he was concerned about a strong Northeaster forecast to hit the area on Wednesday and that it could complicate recovery efforts from Hurricane Sandy. He said he was concerned about the quantity of debris now on streets and sidewalks as people have discarded items damaged by flooding. As a result, he was ordering local communities to collect it before the new storm hit and said they would be reimbursed for any additional costs.

 5:12 P.M. | Napolitano Warns of Threat From Approaching Northeaster 
As Coney Island residents lined up on Monday afternoon for emergency supplies in a parking lot in the shadow of the famous parachute ride, not far away, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, talked to reporters next to a trailer belonging to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Her message was equal parts reassurance and caution. 
The reassurance was that federal resources would continue to be distributed where they were most needed and that the gasoline shortage that had left thousands in the region waiting in long lines would soon ease.
The caution concerned the storm predicted for the region later this week. "We know that there's a nor'easter coming our way and it's going to bring with it some more wind, some more rain, and possibly some more flooding and some more surge," Ms. Napolitano said. "Everything that people did to get ready for Sandy, we need to do for the nor'easter."
"Please listen to your local officials," she added. "If they advise you to evacuate again, please evacuate." She warned that some residents might lose power again and emphasized that the federal government would continue to bring in crews from around the country to help Consolidated Edison and other utility companies restore power.
She said that Sandy had hit public housing buildings particularly hard and that for their residents and others displaced by storm damage, "no option is off the table" for temporary housing, including rental units, hotel and motel rooms, FEMA trailers and prefabricated units.
To date, Ms. Napolitano said, 206,000 people had registered with FEMA and $192 million in FEMA aid had been distributed, along with 9.2 million gallons of water and 6.3 million meals.
The military has sent 12 million gallons of unleaded gasoline and 10 million gallons of diesel to the region, Ms. Napolitano said. "The gasoline is here; it's just a matter of getting it distributed" to stations, she said.
Nevertheless, she advised people for the time being to conserve gasoline.

HEADLINE: The Big Swipe

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Legislative and legal efforts to reduce the swipe fees levied on credit cards and ease the burden on merchants are under siege from financial interests, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Consumers swipe millions of debit and credit cards every day in electronic transactions for which merchants are charged a small but significant fee. The results add up to one big swipe for a financial services industry that profits from both market power and political influence. Main Street retailers are trying hard to change that, pushing back against Wall Street dominance. 
The Durbin amendment of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill was intended to lower the interchange fees that banks collect on debit card purchases. These fees were considerably higher than in other countries, and far exceeded the actual cost, estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank at about 4 cents per transaction.
Most retail businesses stood to gain from lower fees, and rallied in favor of the amendment, helping swing some Republican votes in Congress.
The proposed fee reduction met especially fierce opposition from large banks (smaller banks, with assets under $10 billion, were exempt), but was finalized last fall. Average debit card fees fell from about 44 cents to about 24 cents per swipe, though banks responded by charging more for small transactions, such as parking meter swipes and coffee purchases, that had previously cost far less than average. 
A year later, the Electronic Payments Coalition, a group that includes Bank of America, Visa and MasterCard Worldwide claims that retailers ranging from big-box stores to gas stations are enjoying a windfall from the legislation rather than passing on price savings to consumers. They remain strongly opposed to the Durbin amendment. 
But the Merchants Payments Coalition, a group that represents many small and big businesses through their retail associations, contends that both consumers and retailers have benefited. This coalition calls for improved regulation of both debit and credit card swipe fees. 
Basic economic principles strengthen their case. Banks that are "too big to fail" are also big enough to bully smaller businesses. Since the early 1970s, the five largest banking institutions in the United States have tripled their share of financial assets from 17 percent to 52 percent. 
The retail sector is more diverse and more competitive: In the first quarter of 2012, the median profit margin was 7 percent for discretionary consumer goods and 8 percent for consumer staples, compared to almost 16 percent for financials.
The credit card industry is even more concentrated than banking. In 2010 Visa and MasterCard alone accounted for 82 percent of all credit receivables outstanding. 
For many years they made it difficult for merchants to offer a cash discount, or better terms to customers with less expensive cards. Left with no practical option other than declining to accept credit cards altogether, which would hurt their sales, merchants had little choice but to pay ever-higher swipe fees. 
These fees now represent one of the largest costs of doing business in retail. The National Association of Convenience Stores reported that in 2006 "interchange fees totaling $6.6 billion exceeded the $4.8 billion profits of all U.S. convenience stores." 
Low-income consumers who are more likely to pay cash end up paying higher prices along with everyone else, subsidizing shoppers using fancy rewards cards that offer benefits like frequent flier miles. 
Under the administration of President George W. Bush, federal antitrust efforts were less than energetic. But in 2005 an entrepreneur named Mitch Goldstone helped initiate a class-action antitrust suit against Visa and MasterCard, along with several card-issuing banks, and backed them all into a corner. 
Last July, the defendants agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement, breaking previous records for private cases filed under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The terms of settlement allow merchants more flexibility to steer customers toward lower-cost transactions, and offer a one-time payout of damages. But not all parties to the suit are satisfied with these terms; many retail organizations - over half the named plaintiffs - now oppose it. 
The current settlement will not change the way swipe fees are priced and will prohibit future law suits. It certainly will not improve competition in the industry. 
The settlement has not yet been finalized, and public opinion could help build pressure to renegotiate it. In the longer run, however, the outcome will be shaped by legislative efforts.
This week's elections will have a significant impact. While most Democrats favor financial regulation, most Republicans oppose it. R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School and one of Mitt Romney's most influential economic advisers, favors dismantling Dodd-Frank altogether. 
Such deregulation would definitely leave credit card companies with the upper hand. 
The future of the big swipe is up for grabs.

HEADLINE: Stifel Financial to Buy KBW for $575 Million

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Stifel Financial Corporation agreed on Monday to buy the investment banking firm KBW Inc., acquiring a 50-year-old concern known for its role as an adviser to the financial services industry. 

 BODY:
The Stifel Financial Group has agreed to buy KBW in a deal valued at $575 million, giving Stifel a foothold in the lucrative business of advising financial institutions.
The combination, announced on Monday, signals what many think could be the beginning of a period of consolidation in the financial services industry. While banks and brokerage firms have recovered since the economic crisis, a number of factors - increased regulatory burdens, pressure on commissions, and persistently low interest rates - have combined to crimp profitability.
"Banks have to start acquiring other banks again to have profit margins go higher," said the market commentator James J. Cramer, discussing the deal on CNBC.
Under the terms of the merger, Stifel will pay $10 a share in cash and $7.50 a share in stock for KBW. Shares of KBW rose 7 percent, to $17.47, but shareholders of Stifel also appeared to support the deal. Stifel's stock rose 2 percent to $32.58.
Stifel's acquisition deal echoes the very advice that KBW has been giving its clients - that now is the time to invest in financial services companies. Banks have seen signs of stabilization, including credit trends improving across their loan portfolios. Year-to-date, banks and insurers are outperforming the broader stock market for the first time since 2006.
"You've told me a number of times that now is the time to invest in financial services," Ronald Kruszewski, the chief executive of Stifel, said to KBW's chief, Thomas B. Michaud, during a call announcing the transaction. Mr. Kruszewski then joked: "It's probably a little late for me to change my mind."
The acquisition of KBW, which is based in New York, extends Stifel's aggressive expansion strategy executed over the last five years. Stifel, based in St. Louis, bought the technology-focused investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners in 2010 and last year made a large investment in Miller Buckfire, a New York firm specializing in restructuring.
Other companies that it has picked up include the fixed income specialists Stone & Youngberg and the New Jersey brokerage firm Ryan Beck & Company.
Stifel has also been mentioned as a possible buyer of a number of other smaller, so-called middle market investment banks and brokerage houses that have recently put themselves up for sale, including the investment bank boutique Gleacher & Company.
Since 2008, when many banks shed employees, Stifel has grown to 5,000 from 1,600 employees. It has a market value of $1.75 billion.
"There has been a lot of turmoil in the industry," Mr. Kruszewski said. "But with our record revenue and record profits in 2008, we have been able to take advantage of all the dislocation. It's Darwinian."
Stifel made news this year when it contributed $30 million to an investment group that bailed out Knight Capital after the trading firm suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses tied to an errant computer program.
Stifel was not unscathed by the financial crisis. In March, it agreed to pay $22.5 million to resolve charges from five Wisconsin school districts that the firm had misled them in the sale of complex mortgage securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has a lawsuit pending related to the same securities.
In KBW - shorthand for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods - Stifel is acquiring a 50-year-old firm that has carved out a niche in advising, and publishing research on, financial services companies.
KBW, whose previous New York headquarters was located in the World Trade Center, has had to bounce back from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, when it lost 67 of its 224 employees, including five of nine directors and its co-chief executive, Joseph Berry.
In 2006, KBW sold stock in an initial public offering. The offering came seven years after the company first tried a share sale. But KBW scrapped its plans after federal prosecutors charged its former chief executive with leaking information about bank mergers to an actress in racy films.
KBW's shares have struggled along with the rest of the brokerage industry since the financial crisis, dropping more than 20 percent since its initial offering. KBW announced soft earnings on Monday, but said that it was seeing improvement in capital-raising activity and the mergers-and-acquisitions pipeline.
Stifel will retain the KBW brand name and operate it as a separate business division of Stifel. Mr. Michaud, KBW's chief, is expected to join Stifel's board and will continue to run the business. On Monday, Mr. Kruszewski said that about 85 KBW executives had signed retention packages. Any staff cuts will come from back-office redundancies, he added.
In the face of logistical headaches caused last week by Hurricane Sandy, the merger's advisers worked furiously to complete the deal so it could be announced on Monday alongside Stifel's and KBW's earnings releases.
Stifel was advised by its own investment banking team and the law firm Bryan Cave. KBW also advised itself, and received addition counsel from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.
H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner at Sullivan, said that even though his law firm lost power and experienced significant flooding at its Lower Manhattan headquarters, there were few hiccups in getting the deal done. In part, Mr. Cohen said, that was because after Sept. 11, Sullivan installed backup servers at a facility in Elmsford, N.Y., accessible from the firm's Midtown office.
"Had this deal been 20 years before, it probably wouldn't have happened," Mr. Cohen said. "But technology today allowed us to get it done seamlessly."

HEADLINE: Higher Bonuses in Lean Times

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street employees may find it hard to celebrate at bonus time. | As large sections of New York and New Jersey still lack basic essentials, some on Wall Street are looking to help out. | Some important issues still haven't been adequately addressed in the campaign. 

 BODY:
HIGHER BONUSES IN LEAN TIMES | Wall Street employees may find it hard to celebrate at bonus time this year. While year-end incentives are expected to be slightly higher, "the increase will come on top of one of the worst years for bank pay in recent memory," DealBook's Susanne Craig reports.
 Bonuses are likely to be flat to up to 10 percent higher, according to a compensation survey by Johnson Associates to be released on Monday, Ms. Craig reports. Fixed-income traders, whose bonuses dropped the most in 2011, are expected to see the biggest gain this year. Top executives, like Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, are projected to take in roughly what they did last year. But the broader context is one of retrenching. "Following a year when year-end incentives declined by as much as 30 percent, the fact that many firms are able to keep this year's bonuses flat or slightly larger is notable," said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates.
 At Goldman, the cutbacks can be seen in the list of partners, who are paid from a special compensation pool. The firm said in a filing on Friday that its class of partners numbered 407, down by 31 from earlier this year, Bloomberg News reports. Reuters notes that the firm named fewer partners "because of a broad decline in Goldman's staff levels."
WALL STREET AFTER THE STORM | As large sections of New York and New Jersey still lack basic essentials, some on Wall Street are looking to help out. Goldman Sachs and its employees are donating $5 million to aid the recovery from Hurricane Sandy, and the firm plans to offer $5 million of loans to small businesses affected by the storm. Goldman, which protected its headquarters with sandbags and managed to keep its lights on as others lost power, may be feeling slightly defensive. "I'm not going to take it that someone is going to scorn us for doing what we did," Mr. Blankfein said at an event late last week, according to New York magazine. "We worked hard and did sensible things. And by the way, having done that, it put us in a position to help other people in the neighborhood."
 Henry Kravis of K.K.R. is hoping to strengthen the city's infrastructure with a $35 million fund, Bloomberg News reports. And a hedge fund manager from the Upper West Side, Roy Niederhoffer, was among volunteers who turned out over the weekend. "I really don't think it's the government's job to take care of all this," he told The New York Times.
ON THE AGENDA | Tesla Motors , Humana , True Religion and Time Warner Cable report earnings before the opening bell. The Library Lions gala at the New York Public Library, which was set for Monday evening, has been canceled because of the storm. Robert Wolf, the former UBS executive who runs 32 Advisors, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m.
WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE POLITICAL DEBATE | Amid the election campaigning, some important issues still have not been adequately addressed. For one, it is not easy to determine exactly how taxes might change, regardless of which candidate wins, James B. Stewart writes in his New York Times column. After some calculations, Mr. Stewart concludes that his own rate under Mr. Obama would be lower than that paid by the ultrarich, but under Mitt Romney it would be higher. The candidates also have spent relatively little time discussing financial regulation. Gretchen Morgenson writes in her New York Times column that "neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney has really addressed one of the nation's most pressing economic issues: the risk that one day taxpayers might have to bail out swashbuckling financial institutions again."
HSBC'S LEGAL WOES | The fallout continues from a money laundering scandal involving HSBC. The bank said on Monday that it had set aside an additional $800 million to cover potential fines, settlements and other expenses related to the investigation, bringing the total earmarked amount to $1.5 billion. The matter could result in corporate criminal and civil charges, in addition to fines against the bank, HSBC said. HSBC's third-quarter profit fell about 50 percent, to $2.8 billion, affected by the new provisions.

HEADLINE: Nov. 4: Did Hurricane Sandy Blow Romney Off Course?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. But while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story. 

 BODY:
If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. 
Already, some analysts are describing the storm as an "October surprise" that allowed Mr. Obama to regain his footing after stumbling badly in the first presidential debate and struggling to get back on course. Some Republicans seem prepared to blame a potential defeat for Mitt Romney on the storm, and the embrace of Mr. Obama by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other public officials.
The theory has some appeal. The last three days of polling have brought what is almost certainly Mr. Obama's strongest run of polling since the first presidential debate in Denver. Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of battleground-state polls over the weekend. And increasingly, it is hard to find leads for Mr. Romney in national surveys - although several of them show a tie.
When the hurricane made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29, Mr. Obama's chances of winning re-election were 73 percent in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Since then, his chances have risen to 86 percent, close to his highs on the year.
But, while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story. 
Mr. Obama had already been rebounding in the polls, slowly but steadily, from his lows in early October - in contrast to a common narrative in the news media that contended, without much evidence, that Mr. Romney still had the momentum in the race.
Moreover, there are any number of alternatives to explain Mr. Obama's gains before and after the storm hit.
Mr. Obama was adjudicated the winner of the second and third presidential debates in surveys of voters who watched them.The past month has brought a series of encouraging economic news, including strong jobs reports in October and last Friday.The bounce in the polls that Mr. Romney received after the Denver debate may have been destined to fade in part, as polling bounces often do following political events like national conventions.Democrats have an edge in early voting based on states that provide hard data about which party's voters have turned out to cast ballots. Some voters who were originally rejected by the likely voter models that surveys apply may now be included if they say that they have already voted.Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been running lots of advertisements, which could have some effect, especially in the swing states.Mr. Obama's voter-targeting operation may in fact be stronger than Mr. Romney's and may have begun to show up in the polls.Mr. Obama's approval rating is at 49 or 50 percent in many surveys, a threshold that would ordinarily predict a narrow re-election for an incumbent.Some elections "break" toward one or another candidate at the end as undecided voters tune in and begin to evaluate their decision.
Each of these hypotheses could merit its own article. But the point is that the causes for Mr. Obama's gain in the polls are

HEADLINE: Let Us Now Praise Mitt Romney

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A flawed candidate, but a far better one than many people (myself included) often thought. 

 BODY:
Later today, I will publish my prediction for tomorrow's outcome - electoral, popular, the whole shebang - and unless something dramatic changes in the next few hours I'll be prophesying an excruciatingly narrow Obama win. But before I explain why I think he's going to just barely lose this election, let me say a few words in praise of Willard Mitt Romney, candidate for president of the United States.
I am a longtime Romney critic. Like many conservatives during the last, exhausted years of Bush's presidency, I thought he seemed like an attractive figure from a distance, but then like almost everybody I hated the serial phoniness of his 2008 presidential campaign and looked forward to the sequel with a mix of weariness and dread. I didn't have much of anything nice to say about him in the run-up to the G.O.P. primary season: I wrote columns touting Mitch Daniels's stillborn candidacy, lamenting Mike Huckabee's decision to forgo a run, and suggesting that Chris Christie might make alate leap into the race. Once the field was set, I was a sometimes conventional, sometimes lonely voice arguing for Romney's inevitability, but that was prognostication rather than partisanship, and the twists and turns of the primary season mostly tended to remind me of his myriad flaws as a candidate. For a Republican Party that needed to somehow channel Tea Party zeal into a credible pitch to middle and working class voters skeptical of the party's economic record, Romney had precisely the wrong profile: His moderate record meant that he had less room to maneuver ideologically than a more consistent conservative might have enjoyed; his temperament and instincts and worldview made him a poor champion for the kind of free market populism that might have bridged the gap between the Tea Party and the center; and his private equity background made him a living, breathing embodiment of everything that Rust Belt swing voters hate about "creative destruction."
This was my judgment during the primaries, and the summertime campaign left me feeling vindicated. Romney's strategy seemed to be all caution and zero creativity: He would campaign as the most generic sort of Republican, play for a narrow 51 percent referendum-on-the-economy win, and claim the presidency more or less by default. Given his weaknesses as a candidate - the base's doubts, blue-collar voters' suspicions - you could understand the theory, and see the course he hoped to chart. But it left him with little room for error, and August and September were both cruel months: The Ryan pick was bold but politically puzzling; the G.O.P. convention was a play-it-safe nothingburger, the combination of the White House's anti-Bain attacks and Bill Clinton's barnburner in Charlotte left Romney exposed - and then his "47 percent" disaster delivered a (self-inflicted) uppercut to the head. At that point, the Romney epitaph seemed to write itself: The wrong man in the wrong year with the wrong campaign strategy, a victim of his own party's pathologies but also of his poor instincts and self-inflicted wounds.
If Romney loses tomorrow, that obituary would still contain strong elements of truth. But win or lose, the Romney comeback - one great debate performance, two effective follow-ups, and a late-in-the-game transformation, amazingly enough, from the most awkward and uncomfortable-seeming of candidates to a politician that voters actually seem to like - should probably change the way we think about his trajectory as a candidate, both for the Republican nomination and then the presidency. I stand by the criticisms I marshaled across the last year and more, but watching him reach out to almost, almost, grasp the prize this month, it feels like we didn't give him enough credit for the things that he did right.
Yes, a Daniels or a Christie or a Huckabee might have beaten him if they'd entered the race, but they didn't get in, did they? There were plenty of Republican politicians who talked big about this being a once-in-a-generation election, but none of them put themselves out there - and Romney did. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena ... 
Yes, he was running against a weak and beatable primary field, but he was trying to become the nominee of a party that wanted to nominate anyone - anyone! - but him, and he made the sale and did what he needed to do: Filleting Rick Perry on the debate stage, carpet-bombing Newt Gingrich in Florida and out-debating the "master debater" when it counted, putting Rick Santorum away in the same Midwestern states he's struggling to win right now. He was inevitable, yes - but only because he actually executed, something that plenty of presidential frontrunners in the past have conspicuously failed to do.
Yes, he ran a terribly unimaginative campaign on policy, by turns vague and contradictory, offering boilerplate one moment and fuzzy math the next. But he was a non-ideological manager trying to lead a party torn by ideological civil war - a party that by rights should still be in the wilderness, working through what went wrong in the Bush era, and that lucked into its 2010 and 2012 opportunities rather than deserving them. A great politician might have been able to done better under these circumstances, finessing the party's divisions, reimagining its message, and pulling a realigning election out of the air. But many politicians could have done worse - losing either the base or their path to the center, and gaining a landslide loss for their efforts. Given Romney's temperament, his skill set, his background, maybe this was the best he could have done with the materials he was given.
Yes, there were the "47 percent" comments, but ... okay, no, I have no defense to issue on that front. I don't think it was Romney's "true" self being exposed, but it was bad enough: An example of how his consultant's willingness to play to his audience's expectations can lead to the most dismal sort of pandering, and a window into a portion of the Republican mind that deserves rejection and defeat.
But even after that seemingly irrecoverable disaster, Romney actually recovered. He outdebated a sitting president famous for his eloquence, and he followed up on that success with a highly effective closing pitch, coming into his own as a candidate at the moment when it mattered most. The pivots he's made, the lines he's tried out, the appeals he's offered - yes, they could have been made earlier in the season, and yes, they could have been wedded to a stronger policy message, but they were enough to pull him into a lead into the national polls in October, which is something that few challengers going up against a sitting president get to enjoy, and put him a position where victory has actually been within his reach.
Every losing presidential candidate probably believes that with a few breaks they could have won, but if Romney loses that will be truer for him that it was for Mondale or Dukakis or Dole or even John Kerry. Precisely because he has come so very close - leading in the national polls for two weeks, just a point or two off in the swing states he needs to win at various moments, lacking only some final hinge moment or stroke of luck - if he ultimately loses it's hard to imagine him being remembered as dismissively as most failed contenders tend to be remembered. He won't be eulogized as a beautiful loser like McGovern or Goldwater, remembered fondly by pundits and idea people on both sides of the aisle, but he also won't become a punchline or a tragic figure or a "let's forget that ever happened" kind of candidate. He'll be in a class by himself - remembered, I suspect, the way everything in his background suggests he'd want to be remembered: As the man who outworked all his rivals, the losing nominee who left it all on the field, and the Republican who gave the once-untouchable Barack Obama the race of his political life.
And hey - he still might actually win this thing.

HEADLINE: Nov. 4: Did Hurricane Sandy Blow Romney Off Course?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. But while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story. 

 BODY:
If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. 
Already, some analysts are describing the storm as an "October surprise" that allowed Mr. Obama to regain his footing after stumbling badly in the first presidential debate and struggling to get back on course. Some Republicans seem prepared to blame a potential defeat for Mitt Romney on the storm, and the embrace of Mr. Obama by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other public officials.
The theory has some appeal. The last three days of polling have brought what is almost certainly Mr. Obama's strongest run of polling since the first presidential debate in Denver. Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of battleground-state polls over the weekend. And increasingly, it is hard to find leads for Mr. Romney in national surveys - although several of them show a tie.
When the hurricane made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29, Mr. Obama's chances of winning re-election were 73 percent in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Since then, his chances have risen to 86 percent, close to his highs on the year.
But, while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story. 
Mr. Obama had already been rebounding in the polls, slowly but steadily, from his lows in early October - in contrast to a common narrative in the news media that contended, without much evidence, that Mr. Romney still had the momentum in the race.
Moreover, there are any number of alternatives to explain Mr. Obama's gains before and after the storm hit.

HEADLINE: Campaign Diary: Candidates Spending Final Day in Swing States

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A running diary of the last day of campaigning for President Obama and Mitt Romney before Election Day. 

 BODY:
 New York Times political reporters traveled with the presidential candidates and their running mates on the last day of campaigning before Election Day. What follows is a running diary of the day. 
 12:09 A.M. | A Raucous Homecoming for Ryan 
MILWAUKEE - Lest he forget where he is after visiting four airplane hangars in four states across three time zones, Representative Paul D. Ryan could glance behind him at the enormous banner, "Victory in Wisconsin.''
But then, he could hardly forget he had finally arrived home. To the strains of "It's a Long Way to the Top if You Want to Rock and Roll,'' he received five minutes of raucous applause from the crowd of 2,500, his biggest response in days. He gave a bear hug to Gov. Scott Walker, who had introduced him. "Boy, it feels so good to be home,'' he exclaimed.
Standing in the middle of the crowd, his voice a mix of rasp and emotion, Mr. Ryan said, "We have traveled across this country as a family, talking with people throughout America who care so deeply about the country.''
He cited a list of conservative Republican leaders from Wisconsin, including the governor, Senator Ron Johnson and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "Here we are, this state, our beautiful 10 electoral votes,'' he said. "They can't take us for granted anymore.'' 
Yet, in presidential elections, as his audience well knew, he said, "We haven't gone Republican since 1984.'' Exhorting a crowd that needed no uplift, he started a chant of "One more day!'' 
"Let's prove 'em wrong!'' he said. 
"I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart on behalf of my family,'' he said. "Thank you for waiting in line, thank you for taking the time, thank you for getting people to the polls '' 
His words were drowned out by cheers, supporters waving flags and "Wisconsin Believes" signs with fervor. 
Mr. Ryan had one more flight, a hop to his hometown of Janesville. But he wasn't quite finished campaigning. Late in the day his campaign announced that after voting Tuesday morning, he would head to Ohio and Virginia. 
He will arrive in Cleveland at 11:55, shortly after Mitt Romney, for a joint appearance. He'll get to Richmond at 2:55. Then, of course, it is on to Boston.

 12:02 A.M. | Emotions Run High in Last Moments on the Trail 
DES MOINES - 10:30 p.m., Central time - And during the last rally, here where it all started, President Obama shed a tear.
Mr. Obama was talking before a crowd of 20,000 here, shivering in the cold. He told the story about the lady who first started the whole "fired up, ready to go" chant, in Greenwood, S.C., back in 2008.
And then, he talked about Iowa, about knocking on doors during the 2008 Democratic primaries, and sitting in living rooms here in this state, when his campaign seemed at once so improbable yet so full of hope.
And then, the tears came. The president is not one for showing emotion. He quickly wiped them away, and kept talking.
- Helene Cooper 
 11:22 P.M. | Back Where It All Began 
DES MOINES - 10:02 p.m., Central time - The first lady, Michelle Obama, is introducing President Obama in front of the State Capitol here, where it all started back in 2008.
There are 20,000 people here, who have been standing in the cold waiting on the president for hours.
"This is a pretty emotional time for us because as you know this is the final event of my husband's campaign," Mrs. Obama says. "So we had to come here."
She vows that "tomorrow, we won't stop until every last voice and every last vote is counted."
She sounds exhausted. But her voice gets stronger when she introduces "the love of my life" and her husband jogs onto the stage, giving her a 10-second-long hug.
And then it's Barack Obama's last campaign rally.
"I've come back to Iowa one more time," he says, "to ask for your vote."
- Helene Cooper 
 10:30 P.M. | On the Last Stop of the Night, a Familiar Face 
DES MOINES - 8:59 p.m., Central time - Air Force One is wheels down in Des Moines, and President Obama alights shortly after.
This is his last stop before heading home to Chicago.
He bounds down the stairs, now clad in a sports jacket to ward off the chill. His motorcade holds on the tarmac for a few minutes, awaiting arrival of the plane with the first lady, Michelle Obama.
At 9:16 p.m., the motorcade moves a few hundred feet to the Flotus plane. Mr. Obama gets out of his car and stands at the bottom of the steps to greet, and hug, his wife.
"How you doing?" he asks her.
Two minutes later, the motorcade is rolling.
- Helene Cooper 
 8:59 P.M. | Biden Seizes on '47 Percent' Remarks in Final Rally 
RICHMOND, Va. - Closing out his campaigning at a frigid evening rally along the banks of the James River here, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told a crowd of supporters that Mitt Romney had "personally offended" him when he spoke about 47 percent of Americans, saying that the Republican presidential nominee was talking about Mr. Biden's parents and people like them.
The long campaign showed little sign of taking its toll on the 69-year-old vice president, who, wearing a brown leather jacket and alternately energetically waving his finger and fist, urged the crowd to defeat the nominees of what he characterized as an increasingly radical and reactionary Republican Party. 
"This is not your father's Republican Party," Mr. Biden said. "This is not John Warner's Republican Party, and this is not Mitt Romney's father's Republican Party," he added, referring to Virginia's popular former G.O.P. senator and to George Romney, who was governor of Michigan in the 1960s.
Much of Mr. Biden's talk here, which followed a performance by John Mellencamp, an Obama-Biden supporter, tracked his familiar stump-speech lines of recent weeks. But he seemed to bear down in an unusually personal way on criticism of Mr. Romney's secretly recorded comments at a fund-raiser earlier this year. In those comments, Mr. Romney had said that there are 47 percent of Americans who "are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them."
"It personally offended me," Mr. Biden said. "Who he was talking about were my mom and dad. Who he was talking about is those seniors who worked their whole life and got social security and now aren't paying taxes on it, nor should they pay any taxes on it. The majority of those people are people who are employed, who pay with their withholding taxes, pay their property tax. They probably pay an effective tax rate more than he pays on $20 million."
Mr. Biden added, "We are determined - Barack and I - to level the playing field for the middle class. Give them a fighting chance."
The rally was Mr. Biden's last official campaign stop, though he will vote Tuesday in his home state of Delaware.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 8:45 p.m. | A Big Crowd Gathers for Romney's Campaign Solo 
FAIRFAX, Va. - Like President Obama (and Gov. Chris Christie), Mitt Romney had his own, admittedly casual brush with a musical legend on Monday: he name-dropped the mother of all rock groups, The Beatles. 
As he surveyed the enormous crowd of at an athletic complex here, Mr. Romney appeared incredulous that they had turned out for him - and him alone. (His biggest crowd are often lured by a two-fer: Mr. Romney and a musical guest, like "Kid Rock.")
"I am overwhelmed," Mr. Romney said. "I am looking around to see if we have the Beatles here or something to have brought you but it looks like you came just for the campaign and I appreciate it."
- Michael Barbaro 
 7:58 P.M. | Stopping at a Campaign Office 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - President Obama mades an unscheduled stop at a campaign office. Staffers and volunteers were working the phones, "Ohio for Obama" signs on the walls.
Mr. Obama walked in to cheers. "Let me say hi to everybody," he said jovially. "You guys are working hard."
The president hugged and kissed some people, then paused and said: "This is the foundation of this campaign. All the ups and downs, the TV stuff doesn't matter because you guys are what make this campaign."
He then turned and hugged a woman who exclaimed: "Oh my god!"
Mr. Obama admonished a campaign worker who asked for a picture. "We're gonna do pictures with everybody...you're a field organizer, you gotta be looking out for your volunteers."
Then the president sat down and began making phone calls to volunteers.
"This is Barack Obama, looks like I missed you, everybody's been telling me what a great job you're doing."
After that phone call, he said, "I like this. This is intense right here."
He then made another call.
"Hi Jim. This is Barack Obama. It really is. Well listen. I heard all the doors you've been knocking on, I wanted to say thank you."
Jim must have been talking a lot because Mr. Obama listened for a long time.
A woman sitting next to the president said into her phone, "I'm sitting next to Barack Obama right now, he says hi to you!"
She handed the phone to Mr. Obama, who said,"hey Gloria, keep it up!"
The woman returns to the call with Gloria: "That's right baby! He kissed me on the cheek!"
- Helene Cooper 
 7:50 P.M. | Campaign Aides Mum on Ryan's Election Day Plans 
DES MOINES, Iowa - Back in the warm months, just after Mitt Romney tapped Representative Paul D. Ryan to be his No. 2, joint appearances by the running mates drew hugely enthusiastic crowds, which were larger than those Mr. Romney alone attracted, and the senior partner visibly drew energy from his younger ticket mate. 
This is now, when Mr. Romney is the one with star power for Republicans, and Mr. Ryan has been much less noticed on the national stage. 
With Mr. Romney announcing he is adding two last-minute events on Election Day, visits to field offices to inspire volunteers and attract publicity, will Mr. Ryan be going along? 
Aides to Mr. Ryan are not saying, at least for now. One press aide said, "You won't hear it from me.'' The travelling campaign spokesman, Michael Steel, said, "No new information yet.'' 
Mr. Ryan is taking a short flight home to Janesville, Wis. late tonight after his finally rally in Milwaukee rally, then plans to vote tomorrow morning. The only other event on his dance card so far is a flight to Boston for the joint election night appearance. 
Stay tuned.
- Trip Gabriel 
 7:15 p.m. | Romney Makes an Entrance 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Mr. Romney's aides wanted a big entrance for his rally here on Monday night. Their time-tested strategy of driving the candidate into an airport hangar on his campaign bus didn't feel right. 
The obvious solution: have Mr. Romney ride in on his campaign plane.
At 7:15 p.m., as the crowd inside a hangar here waited for the candidate to walk in the front door, a giant side gate opened, music blared and the plane began to steer its way in. 
Bob White, Mr. Romney's longtime friend, took out his cell phone to record the moment. "This place is going to go crazy," Mr. White predicted. It did. 
But there was a small problem. The plane's first try in brought the right wing too close to the door, so the plane backed up and attempted a second try. It worked. 
As Mr. and Mrs.Romney walked off, another aide, Beth Myers, soon followed, trailing behind. She radiated a can-you-believe-we-just-did-that mirth. "That," she yelled to her campaign colleagues. "Was s-o-o-o cool."
- Michael Barbaro 
 7:13 P.M. | Mellencamp Warms Up the Crowd in Virginia 
RICHMOND, Va. - John Mellencamp took the stage 20 minutes ago to warm up the crowd at Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s final campaign stop here at the historic Tredegar Iron Works downtown.
He began singing "Jack and Diane" by himself, playing the guitar. Then he sang "Small Town," accompanied by a guitarist and accordion player.
In between the two songs, Mr. Mellencamp told the crowd, "In one man's success, there is real hope for us all. And that's why we're all here tonight."
Then he played "The West End," introducing it as a song about "what greed can do to a country when the middle class has no place to go."
"But the middle class is going to rise up again, and the rich are going to pay their fair share," Mr. Mellencamp told the crowd, adding: "Let there be no haves and have-nots - just a level playing-field that makes everything possible, and that we can still believe in the American dream."
The song's lyrics include:
 For my whole life 
 I've lived down in the West End 
 But it sure has changed here 
 Since I was a kid 
 It's worse now 
 Look what progress did 
 Someone lined their pockets 
 I don't know who that is 
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 5:14 P.M. | Jay-Z, Springsteen and the President in Ohio 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Jay-Z is firing up the crowd of 15,500 here in the Nationwide Arena in a fully amped-up show.
"Ohio, will you make some noise for your president, Barack Obama!"
President Obama is on stage. "Fired up!" he begins, trying to recreate the magic of 2008. "Ready to go!"
The crowds are smaller now, but here in this swing state to end all swing states, on this last day of campaigning, there is a rainbow mix of black, white and brown. And they are all screaming.
For Bruce Springsteen, who opened the show? Yes. For Jay-Z? Definitely. For the president? Sure, him too.
The president is touting his accomplishments. Twenty minutes into his speech, when Mr. Obama mentions the name "Mitt Romney," the crowd predictably boos.
Wait for it. Here comes the line: "Don't boo. Vote!" Mr. Obama says.
Back to his accomplishments. "The war in Iraq is over," Mr. Obama says. "Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat. Osama bin Laden is dead."
Mr. Obama's voice is starting to crack now, and his church-preacher cadence is coming out.
The president is doing a slew of radio interviews Monday, his aides said, and will even appear on ESPN during "Monday Night Football" time.
"Ohio, after four years, you know me by now," Mr. Obama says. There is allowance during his talk for some of the disappointment of the last four years.
"You may be frustrated with the pace of change but that's O.K., so am I," Mr. Obama said, his voice definitely cracking now. "But you know I mean what I say and I say what I mean."
He's tie-less, with a black blazer, leaning into the podium. The blue signs that say "Forward!" dot the arena.
Mr. Obama seems to be weaving in and out of enthusiasm and emotion. One minute he is droning on with the usual stump speech - "change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation-building at home" - and the next minute he seems to remember that this is it, the last day, his last chance.
And his voice rises again. "Ohio, my bet's on you. My hope is with you. My faith is with you."
Now he's yelling. His finger goes up and down against the podium, punctuating his points. "We've come too far to turn back now we will win Ohio let's go vote!"
The voice is almost gone. But he's still got another rally to do, in Des Moines, in a few hours.

 4:35 p.m. | In Colorado, a Ryan Pep Talk 
JOHNSTOWN, Colo. - Representative Paul D. Ryan's marathon fly-around included rallies in four airplane hangars in three time zones, but he also managed a visit to a truck stop here, north of Denver. 
Not just any roadside attraction, it's a place called Johnson's Corner, with its own Web site with an entry for "Our Story." It has been open 24-7, 365 days a year since 1952. It serves its celebrated cinnamon rolls.
"They're like the size of your head, I'm told," Mr. Ryan said to his two young sons as he entered the restaurant in search of voters and baked goods. He ordered two dozen of the rolls, each in a plastic clamshell and swimming in a bath of icing. He held one up to his son Sam's head to show its size.
A reporter asked how Mr. Ryan felt about the election. News flash: "I feel very good about it," he said.
He climbed onto an outdoor stage flanked by red and blue Kenworth tractor-trailer cabs, chrome gleaming.
Midway through Mr. Ryan's stump speech - after he asked supporters to "vote out of love of country"' and before he recited the five-point Romney-Ryan plan - a big rig on Interstate 25 tooted its horn as it passed the rally. "I'll tell you, truckers are great," Mr. Ryan said.
He implored Coloradans to "leave it all on the field" on Election Day, to urge friends and families to go to the polls. "Let's wake up on Wednesday morning knowing we did all we could," he said.
When reporters returned to the press bus, they found a surprise on each seat: a cinnamon roll the size of, well, a salad plate.

 3:15 p.m. | The President Connects the Boss With a Famous Fan 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - On what is supposed to be a day focused on swing states, New Jersey continues to pop up. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, confirmed that President Obama had put Bruce Springsteen on the phone with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey while the president and the Boss were flying to Columbus from Madison, Wis., on Air Force One.
Mr. Christie, a Republican, is well known as one of the biggest Bruce fans ever, but had not gotten love from Mr. Springsteen, a die-hard Democrat, in the past. Though Mr. Christie has attended more than 100 of his concerts, Mr. Springsteen has not invited him backstage. 
But in these post-hurricane days of bipartisan bonhomie between Mr. Obama and Mr. Christie, who better than the president to serve as yenta between the Boss and his fan? 
Mr. Christie promptly relayed the fact of the phone call to reporters. When asked, Mr. Carney confirmed: "When Potus told the governor he had someone who wanted to speak with him, Springsteen, who was using the handset across the table from the president, said, 'Governor, this is Bruce.' "

 4:17 p.m. | Ann Romney Goes to (Suburban) Washington 
FAIRFAX, Va. - Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, own three homes. But just before 4 p.m. on Monday, Mrs. Romney made it known that she wouldn't mind taking up residence in a fourth.
At a rally in a suburb of Washington - home of the coveted 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue address - Mrs. Romney took the stage and posed a question to a crowd of more than 10,000.
 "Are we going to be neighbors soon?" she playfully asked.
(Based on the cheering response, the answer was an unequivocal yes.)
- Ashley Parker 
 3:18 p.m. | Campaign Coverage of the Boss 
COLUMBUS, Ohio - We interrupt this Obama campaign report with a brief side trip to the Jersey Shore.
Air Force One is wheels down here after a one-hour flight.
Instead of scrambling to watch the president alight, the reporters traveling on the plane scramble to catch a glimpse of ... Bruce Springsteen.
Penetrating questions follow.
"Was this your first time on Air Force One?"
The Boss starts grinning. He nods. "It was pretty cool," he says.
Another hard-hitting question:
"What did you talk about on the plane with President Obama?"
Mr. Springsteen, famously a New Jersey native, says they talked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Jersey Shore. "I'm feeling pretty hopeful," he says about the chances that his beloved seashore will recover.
A few minutes later, after his arrival at the campaign's Columbus event, another sharp query for Mr. Springsteen comes rocketing from the traveling press.
"Sir, have you spoken with Governor Christie since the storm?" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, is a huge Springsteen fan, but he doesn't get much love from his state's greatest export.
Times may be changing, though. "Yes," Mr. Springsteen replies. "We have."
O.K., back to the president. Seriously.

 2:44 P.M. | Romney to Hit Ohio and Pennsylvania on Election Day 
DULLES, Va. - Mitt Romney, who had no plans to campaign on Election Day, has decided to travel to the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio on Tuesday.
Aides said Mr. Romney would visit campaign offices in Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Until now, his staff had said a rally in New Hampshire on Monday night would be his last event of the campaign.

 2:14 P.M. | A Refreshed and Confident Biden in Virginia 
STERLING, Va. - Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. finished his first campaign rally of the day about an hour ago in Sterling, Va., where he accused the Republican ticket of doing everything they could to confuse the electorate and to run away in the closing stages of the election from what he suggested were more radical and conservative positions they previously advocated.
Looking and sounding refreshed and confident, Mr. Biden spoke only about 20 minutes - shorter than a lot of his stump speeches - telling a smaller-than-usual but energized crowd that this state was crucial to the Obama-Biden campaign's re-election.
In fact, he said almost word for word the same thing he had told people at a rally in Lakewood, Ohio, on Sunday morning - except for substituting "Virginia" for "Ohio:"
"We need you, Virginia! With your help, we will win Virginia," Mr. Biden said. "We win Virginia, we win this election!"
Mr. Biden also pledged, without detailing how, that there would be 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next 10 years, "so our kids are the best in the world." He also asserted that the students of his wife, Jill, who teaches English at a community college in Virginia, "are going to hear the word 'insourcing' more than their parents heard the word 'outsourcing.'" Mr. Biden did not explain how that would happen, given the significant wage disparities between the United States and many other countries with skilled workers.
Though he was speaking in a wealthy enclave of suburban Washington, a good deal of Mr. Biden's speech sounded as if he were still in the gritty, union-heavy urban locations where he campaigned in Ohio. There, polls indicate that the $80 billion auto bailout that President Obama supported is popular and has helped buttress the Obama-Biden campaign's re-election hopes in a state that is often a battleground between the two parties.
In fact, in one of Mr. Biden's final points at his appearance in Sterling, he referred to a Romney campaign radio commercial that suggested that Chrysler and General Motors, which got federal financing during the auto bailout, were shifting work to China at the expense of American autoworkers. The ad had drawn an unusually harsh response from executives at both companies: A spokesman for G.M. called it "cynical campaign politics at its worst." Chrysler's top executive also felt compelled to e-mail his employees that it was "inaccurate to suggest" that Jeep production would be moved to China from the United States - a message that came as another Romney commercial left the impression that Jeep might shift jobs to China at the expense of domestic workers.
"Not a shred of truth to it," Mr. Biden said here, referring to the Romney advertising blitz over the auto bailout. "General Motors and Chrysler have denounced the Romney ads as untrue and a lie."
"Guys," he added, "when's the last time you've seen two major American corporations in the waning hours of the campaign go after a Republican candidate?"
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 1:50 P.M. | Going All-In on Virginia 
 LYNCHBURG, Va. - Just how badly does Mitt Romney need to win Virginia?
The state's governor, Bob McDonnell, just answered that, perhaps accidentally, during a rally here when he spun through Mr. Romney's Virginia-laden schedule over the past week.
"He's spent three of the last five days of the campaign right here in Virginia," the governor said. "Paul Ryan was here all day Saturday."
Get the idea? Mr. McDonnell was not done, however.
"They've spent an immense amount of time and effort and energy on the ground to be able to tell the people of Virginia about their positive optimistic Romney-Reagan vision for the future of this great nation," Mr. McDonnell added.
- Michael Barbaro 
 1:18 P.M. | A Modest Crowd for Romney in Virginia 
LYNCHBURG, Va. - Let us not measure Mitt Romney's electoral hopes on the size of his crowds today - or risk the wrath of his angry staff members, who eagerly blast out his overflow crowds (30,000 people Sunday night in Morrisville, Penn., on Sunday night) but are far more quiet with his smaller ones.
But it must be said: Mitt Romney's crowds, on this final day before Election Day 2012, are so far quite modest - 3,200 this morning in Sanford, Fla., and no more than a few thousand just now in Lynchburg, Va.
Of course, what actually matters is how many people show up to the polls, not how many people turn out to glimpse Mr. Romney one more time before Tuesday. And Lynchburg is an admittedly small area. ("For the size of our city, it's a good crowd," said Christine Wooldridge, of Lynchburg. "I've heard he's gotten crowds of 20,000, but that won't happen here.")
But Mr. Romney, like many politicians, feeds off his crowds. And this group of voters, halfheartedly waving flags on this sunny day, is a listless, sleepy bunch.
Mr. Romney dutifully made his way through his stump speech, but delivered all of his lines in the pitch you'd use in a boardroom, not a raucous political rally. When he asked the voters if they were "tired of being tired," he sounded pretty tired himself.
Still, his attempts at optimism were on full display as he ad-libbed this line: "It's not just the size of crowds, but this one is pretty darn impressive," he said, as if trying to convince himself.

 1:16 P.M. | Obama and Romney to Appear on 'Monday Night Football' 
President Obama and Mitt Romney will appear at halftime of the "Monday Night Football" game in New Orleans between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New Orleans Saints. They will answer questions - presumably somewhat more oriented to the world of sports than to Libya or auto bailouts - from the ESPN studio host, Chris Berman.
It is becoming something of a tradition the night before the election: four years ago Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain also appeared at halftime on "Monday Night Football."

 12:51 P.M. | Ryan Makes a Plea to Nevada 
RENO, Nev. - Under sunny skies and in the shadow of peaks already covered with snow, Representative Paul D. Ryan made Stop No. 1 on a day that will take him next to Colorado, Iowa, Ohio and, finally, a late-night rally in Milwaukee in his home state.
"We're doing a barn-burner today, we're crisscrossing the country, Mitt and I,'' Mr. Ryan told supporters in a darkened airplane hangar.
"It's kind of déjà vu, you look kind of familiar,'' Mr. Ryan said in a jocular vein. "You've seen a few of us around, haven't you? And you know why? Nevada can make the difference.''
That is possible, but Nevada looks like a tough battleground state for the Republican ticket. By some estimates, two-thirds of Nevadans have already voted. Democrats cast 44 percent of the ballots and Republicans 37 percent. It translates to a 50,000-vote margin for Democrats. A local official introducing Mr. Ryan called on Republicans to "burn down that firewall" on Tuesday. For the Republican ticket to prevail, Nevada analysts say, it would need a flood of independents breaking for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan.
As Mr. Ryan arrived late Sunday night, his motorcade passed the Democratic headquarters of the Washoe County Democrats. The lights were still on at 11:45 p.m.

 12:45 p.m. | A Day of Flybys for Romney 
SANFORD, Fla. - Less than 24 hours before the polls open, Mitt Romney has entered the drive-through portion of his campaign.
He spent the last year traveling to voters, crisscrossing the country and dropping into small towns and rural communities.
But on the final day, they came to him.
Three of Mr. Romney's five rallies are veritable flybys, held in airport hangars so Mr. Romney can land, jog down the steps of his private plane to the blaring thrum of Kid Rock's "Born Free," and then begin taxiing to the next city nearly as soon as he has shaken the last hand and kissed the last baby.
When Mr. Romney's plane touched down here after an 18-hour day (four events in four states) just before 1 a.m. Monday, his aides had already begun setting up for the day's rally. A "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose" sign greeted the plane, and an empty hangar waited lighted and ready for the voters who would file in just hours later. 
So, what do voters think, heading to an auxiliary airport hangar to glimpse the man who they hope will be the next president?
"It's a convenient venue for him to come into and land," Greg Baker, 65, of Sorrento, Fla., said with a shrug. "And rallies are rallies."
- Ashley Parker 
 12:28 P.M. | An Obama Supporter on Political Geography in Virginia 
STERLING, Va. - An Obama-Biden supporter here, Bruce Burton, a union representative who lives in Fairfax County, explained in an interview the rough voting demographics of the state: "Virginia is really
two states: You have Northern Virginia, and then everything below the Rappahannock. And this part tends to be a lot more Democratic," he said, referring to the portion north of the river, which he said includes a lot more people from other parts of the country, more members of minority groups, and more federal government employees.
Mr. Burton blames the Republicans for trying to stymie Mr. Obama¹s efforts to revive the economy, and he credits the president's stimulus package for lowering the unemployment rate by a full percentage point. Citing a recent cartoon, Mr. Burton said, "For the Republicans to criticize the president for the economy is like John Wilkes Booth criticizing Abraham Lincoln for missing the second act of the play." He added: "Or Lucy pulling the football out and then blaming Charlie Brown because he missed." Senator Jim Webb of Virgnia is now warming up the crowd for former governor Tim Kaine, the Democrat who is running to replace him.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 12:16 P.M. | Springsteen Rallies the Crowd in Madison 
MADISON, Wis. - Bruce Springsteen is introducing President Obama. "This is a song called 'Land of Hope and Dreams,'" he said, as he begins the familiar opening chords of his millennium anthem.
The crowd of 18,000 is bundled up in front of the state Capitol, and the American flag is waving in the background. Mr. Springsteen is acoustic. Atop a crane, David Plouffe, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs stand, hands in pockets, watching the Boss as he stumps for their boss.
The song ends, and the president jogs onto the stage, engulfing Mr. Springsteen in a huge bear hug.
Reporters, who had been atop giant cranes themselves to get a better view of Mr. Springsteen, hastily scramble down to take notes as Mr. Obama begins his stump speech.
It's hard to hear, and Mr. Obama, who has been drinking hot tea to help his throat during the final campaign slog, already sounds hoarse. "Our fight goes on," he says. He describes his vision of an America where "everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same rules, that's why you elected me in 2008 and that's why I'm running for a second term!"
The crowd is chanting: "Four more years! Four more years!"
- Helene Cooper 
 12:04 P.M. | A Rock Concert Atmosphere at Biden Rallies 
STERLING, Va. - At Vice President Jospher R. Biden Jr.'s rallies, the aides like to play loud, loud music before and after, so booming that it is hard to interview the people there. Right now it's one of the campaign's favorites: "Roll With the Changes" by REO Speedwagon. "Oh, you got to learn to, got to learn to, got to learn to roll. ..."
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 11:55 a.m. | Casual Monday in Madison 
MADISON, Wis. - There's a Casual Friday feel in the lobby of the Sheraton Madison. Robert Gibbs and David Plouffe are in jeans, Mr. Gibbs in grungy-looking sneakers. Valerie Jarrett is not. David Axelrod and Reggie Love didn't get the jeans memo either. Nor Ben Rhodes nor Jay Carney. Jen Psaki is all in black.
It's a beautiful bright and chilly day. As the motorcade began rolling to the event, we were told, a crowd of 18,000 awaited.
The president arrived as Bruce Springsteen was playing an acoustic version of "Promise Land."
- Helene Cooper 
 11:51 A.M. | A Delivery Four Decades in the Making 
SANFORD, Fla. - An air of unfinished family business has always hovered around the Romney campaign, from the George Romney posters in his Boston headquarters to the way both Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, reverentially speak of Mr. Romney's father, the late three-term governor of Michigan.
And on Monday, just after 10 a.m. here, the generations of Romney men made their presence felt yet again.
Mr. Romney emerged onstage at his first rally of the day wearing a purple striped tie, courtesy of his older brother Scott. Scott has had the tie for years, and last night, when Mr. Romney saw it, he told his older brother he was in need of new neck ware.
"Can I add that to my rotation he asked?" (Yes, came the reply).
After the rally, a supporter approached Mr. Romney as he shook hands, and handed him a Ziploc bag containing six blue Romney pins from 1968, when Mr. Romney's father ran for president.
He had been holding onto the pins, waiting for just the right moment to give them to Mr. Romney. And less than 24-hours before Election Day - and more than four decades after George Romney's bid - he finally found his chance.
- Ashley Parker 
 11:23 a.m. | The Bidens on the Ground in Virginia 
STERLING, Va. - Hundreds of people are already waiting at the Heritage Farm Museum at Claude Moore Park here for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s first scheduled campaign event of the day, a rally with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. 
The Bidens flew to Washington last night after a three-stop swing in Ohio - perhaps the most critical battleground state this election, with 18 electoral votes - where Mr. Biden declared: "We need Ohio, we need you. We win Ohio, we win this election." 
But the Obama-Biden campaign also needs Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. And so the 69-year-old vice president is spending the final day of the campaign in Virginia, ending with an evening rally in Richmond where John Mellencamp will perform. The state's Democratic Senators - Jim Webb and Mark Warner - and the former Democratic governor, Tim Kaine, are expected to attend both events, according to the Obama-Biden campaign.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 9:10 a.m. | Voices of Voters for Romney 
SANFORD, Fla. - On the final day of campaigning, voters are at their most energized, their voices crying out during Mr. Romney's speeches with expressions of support and fury. 
But what exactly are they shouting?
Here is a sampling:
"Help us take back our country!"
"We want Mitt."
 "Fire Obama!"
"Unacceptable!"
"He's a loser!" (Obama)
"Keystone, pipeline!"
"We love you, Ann!" (Mr. Romney's wife)
"One more day! One more day!"
"45! 45! 45!" (Mr. Romney would be the 45th president)
"Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!"
- Michael Barbaro 
 10:15 a.m. | The Traveling Press and the Traveling Press Secretary 
SANFORD, Fla. - It is a fitting coda to the frequently distant and contentious relationship between the reporters that travel with Mr. Romney and his campaign's traveling press secretary, Rick Gorka.
On Monday morning, the reporters yelled in unison for Mr. Gorka to walk to the back of the plane to answer questions, something he has done less and less over time.
He did so, warily, and sparingly.
 REPORTER: What is the mood inside the campaign?
 GORKA: "We are an economic campaign. Streamlining government. We feel great."
 REPORTER: Is Mr. Romney planning a surprise rally in Ohio on Election Day, as we have heard?

GORKA: "We'll advise his official schedule. And if there is anything beyond that, we will update you."
 REPORTER: You said tonight's rally is his "final" rally? Is that accurate anymore?
 GORKA: "We will have an official schedule we will announce."
And so it went, most questions bouncing back half-answered.
Until, suddenly, the questions and answers become rather warm and playful. Both sides seemed to realize the limitations of their long relationship, and to embrace it.
A reporter asked Mr. Gorka to provide running, behind the scenes details about Mr. Romney's day on Tuesday, including his "last meal."
"He is going to live beyond Tuesday," Mr. Gorka deadpanned, drawing laughter. 
A reporter pointed out that if Mr. Romney did have a last-minute rally on Tuesday, despite a widely reported schedule that said he would not, members of the news media would "have egg all over our faces."
To which Mr. Gorka replied dryly: "We don't want that."
Asked about his own mood on the final full day of campaigning, Mr. Gorka was reflective.
"I am sitting here. I am enjoying it. I know I have Patron underneath this plane to help me get through this day if I need to."
At that, Charlie Pearce, a campaign staffer, stalked Mr. Gorka from behind, walked down the plane's center aisle and placed a Philadelphia Eagle's helmet over Mr. Gorka's head.
The press laughed. Mr. Gorka laughed.
"Luckily there is nothing in here to be concussed," he said, pointing to the helmet.
"Now," he added, "I am ready for my close up."
- Michael Barbaro 
 9:30 a.m. | The Boss on The Plane 
MADISON, Wis. - Call it Air Force Born to Run.
Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki electrifies the press corps traveling with President Obama when she informs them that Bruce Springsteen will join President Obama on the presidential 747 on Monday for the last day of campaigning. The Boss, who will be performing at not one but three rallies Monday for Mr. Obama, will fly with the
president from Madison to Columbus.
Stay tuned.
- Helene Cooper 
 8:45 a.m. | Crossed Signals on Economic Messaging 
SANFORD, Fla. - Even on the final day of a presidential campaign, signals can become crossed. At a rally here, the Republican governor of Florida, Rick Scott, introduced Mr. Romney, whose message of economic turmoil under President Obama is central to his quest for the White House.
Mr. Scott did not seem to be playing ball.
"Guess what?" he asked the crowd in an airport hangar. "The biggest drop in unemployment in the country is in our great state of Florida."
Mr. Romney did not repeat that line when he took the stage.
- Michael Barbaro 
 8:36 a.m. | Obama Begins Three-State Swing in Wisconsin 
MADISON, Wis. - President Obama began his last day of campaigning here in a state that almost every Democratic model for an Obama victory assumes will be in his column. But with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin on the Republican ticket, the president is taking no chances.
After this weekend's marathon crisscrossing of every swing state, Mr. Obama's schedule on Monday looked almost tame by comparison. Even so, he was to hit three states before heading to sweet home Chicago for the night.
After the rally planned for Monday morning in this college town, Mr. Obama will return one last time to the swing state of all swing states for a rally in Columbus, Ohio. The president has been holding on to a small lead in the polls in Ohio, and his campaign aides believe that if he wins the state, he will win the election. Unless, that is, Mr. Romney manages to sweep all the other swing states, or turn a blue state - Mr. Romney planted a flag in Pennsylvania on Sunday - red.
After Ohio, Michelle Obama will join her husband for one last rally where the two like to insist that it all started - Des Moines. Mr. Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 catapulted his candidacy from also-ran to front-runner in the Democratic primaries, and the Obamas talk often about how much they loved tramping around in the snow in Iowa and hanging out with butter cows and whatnot at the Iowa State Fair.
In recent days, the president has been joined onstage by Democratic bigwigs. Former President Bill Clinton was with him on Sunday in New Hampshire, and Mr. Clinton will be on the road for him again on Monday in Pennsylvania, lest that state get its head turned by its new suitor, Mr. Romney. 
In Florida, with its crucial Latino vote, Mr. Obama also got a lift on Sunday from Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop artist.
But that is nothing compared to the firepower coming out for the president on Monday. The Obama campaign is hauling out its biggest weapon for dragging blue-collar white voters to the polls: Bruce Springsteen.
He is joining Mr. Obama at all three stops on Monday - Madison, Wis.; Columbus, Ohio; and Des Moines. And lest anyone forget the African-American vote, Jay-Z will also be joining the president in Columbus.
In Des Moines, Mrs. Obama will be onstage with her husband, to talk about the good old days.
Then the president and the first lady will head back to their hometown, Chicago, where they are planning to spend Election Day.

HEADLINE: Ousted Duke Energy Chief Named Head of Tennessee Utility

BYLINE: KEN OTTERBOURG


HIGHLIGHT: William D. Johnson, the ousted chief executive of Duke Energy, was named the new head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the government-created provider of wholesale power in Tennessee and parts of six other southern states. 

 BODY:
William D. Johnson, the ousted chief executive of Duke Energy, was named the new head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the government-created provider of wholesale power in Tennessee and parts of six other southern states.
Mr. Johnson was a casualty of the merger between Progress Energy and Duke Energy, a deal that created the nation's largest public utility. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Johnson, the head of Progress Energy, was to run the newly combined utility, Duke Energy. But he was pushed out at the first board meeting in a coup that sent reverberations through the industry. 
In hearings before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the board of Duke Energy defended its actions. The directors painted Mr. Johnson as an autocratic leader who had failed to be transparent about problems with mounting repair bills at a nuclear power plant in Florida. 
 Mr. Johnson's defense was equally spirited. He testified that Duke Energy's board got cold feet over the merger. When it couldn't back out of the $32 billion deal, the company pushed him out.
On Sunday, Mr. Johnson declined to talk at length about what happened at Duke, preferring to focus on his new job and looking forward. "Life goes on," he said. "You get up. You continue. If you're lucky, you have an opportunity like this to come to the T.V.A. and work with the great people here and carry on this mission."
The Tennessee Valley Authority, with revenue of $11.8 billion in 2011, was established in 1933 to control flood waters on the Tennessee River and spur economic development in what was at the time a deeply impoverished part of the country. Among its top challenges in the coming years is to manage the replacement of its aging coal fleet without running up against its mandated debt cap of $30 billion. Its debt now stands at $22 billion.
Mr. Johnson succeeds Tom Kilgore, who is retiring after leading the organization since 2006. The two worked together at Progress Energy. Mr. Johnson's new salary was not disclosed, although Mr. Kilgore earned just under $4 million in total compensation in 2011.

HEADLINE: Fate of Maryland Same-Sex Marriage Ballot Measure Is Uncertain

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Supporters of Maryland's same-sex marriage law hope to parlay the backing of President Obama, who is expected to win the state, into a victory.

For the first time since President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage, four states will ask voters to decide Tuesday whether it is legal, presenting the latest opportunity for supporters to overcome a losing record of appealing directly to voters through referendums.
Supporters of Maryland's same-sex marriage law hope to parlay the backing of Mr. Obama, who is expected to win the state, into a victory. Voters have backed constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a man and a woman in more than 30 states. If efforts to legalize marriage for gay and lesbian couples in any of the four states succeed Tuesday, it will be the first time that same-sex marriage is legalized by ballot measure.
Six states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage by legislation or a judicial ruling. Following suit, the Maryland and Washington State Legislatures passed laws approving it this year, only to face challenges from opponents who forced referendums on Election Day. Maine, where voters repealed the state's same-sex marriage law in 2009, and Minnesota will also ask voters whether same-sex marriage should be legal.
The Obama campaign announced the president's support for Maryland's law in October as Marylanders for Marriage Equality began broadcasting a radio advertisement featuring Mr. Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage.
"I think President Obama's endorsement has been a significant factor in more conversations being had in all communities, including the African-American community," said Kevin Nix, communications director of Marylanders for Marriage Equality, adding, "The needle has moved."
But even with the president's support, whether the law will survive Election Day is unclear. Recent polls show a close race, and some experts caution that they may be misleading anyway as voters may be hesitant to voice their opposition to the rights of others, with the vote against legalization often undercounted in polls.
A recent poll by The Baltimore Sun showed likely voters were evenly split on Maryland's referendum. Unlike a Washington Post poll about a week earlier - which showed that likely voters favored the law 52 percent to 43 percent - the Baltimore Sun poll did not use the ballot's wording, highlighting the challenge of polling on ballot measures, which pollsters sometimes rephrase to make them easier to understand in phone surveys. Explaining that opponents had petitioned to get the law on the ballot after it was approved by the legislature and Gov. Martin O'Malley, the Baltimore Sun's poll asked simply, "In November, will you vote to make same-sex marriage legal or illegal in Maryland?" In response, 46 percent said legal while 47 percent said illegal.
In Maryland, which has one of the largest black populations in the country, it's been a fight for black voters. Both sides have featured black ministers and civil rights leaders in their campaign ads. The Maryland Marriage Alliance, the campaign opposing the state's same-sex marriage law, recently aired a radio commercial featuring Alveda King, niece of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a minister, rejecting comparisons between the civil rights movement and efforts to legalize marriage for gay and lesbian couples and arguing Maryland already has protections for them
"It is possible to be tolerant of gay and lesbian rights without redefining marriage, God's holy union," she said in the commercial.
The Maryland Marriage Alliance could not be reached for comment.
In addition to Mr. Obama, the N.A.A.C.P. came out in favor of same-sex marriage this year, and local chapters have been especially active in Maryland, Mr. Nix said. But the Baltimore Sun poll in October showed 50 percent of black voters oppose the law, while 42 percent support it.
Polls show young people are among the strongest supporters of the ballot measures, particularly in Maryland and Washington State. A Baltimore Sun poll in September showed that 61 percent of voters under the age of 35 favor Maryland's law, while just 22 percent oppose it. A recent KCTS 9 Washington poll reported more than 70 percent of registered Washington State voters ages 18 to 29 support the ballot referendum there, where polls show that voters are likely to uphold the state's law legalizing same-sex marriage.
But young voters - who tend to support same-sex marriage in higher numbers than older voters but also tend to vote in lower numbers - are not the only reason the polls are close. A study released in October found that support nationwide for legalizing marriage for gay and lesbian couples has increased across the board since 2004, with even evangelical Protestants expressing stronger support. Third Way, the Washington, D.C.-based research institute that conducted the study, attributed 75 percent of the growth in support to people's changing their minds on the issue.
With the countdown to Election Day down to hours, both sides in Maryland are making their closing arguments to voters. In a commercial released Friday, the Maryland Marriage Alliance warns voters that the portions of the law purporting to protect religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriage have harmful loopholes and that the law will hurt parents' rights to decide what their children are taught in school about same-sex marriage.
Mr. O'Malley, who has thrown his support behind the law he signed, will attend Marylanders for Marriage Equality's election night event in Baltimore, and Mr. Nix is hopeful that they will have reason to celebrate.
"The momentum is on our side," he said. "I think it's still going to be a close race, but I think we can pull it out."

HIGHLIGHT: How rude should we be? 

 BODY:
Wow, it's hard to post anything interesting today. Everything -- not just in America, but around the world -- hinges on what happens tomorrow. The odds seem to favor Obama heavily, with national polling having moved modestly but significantly in Obama's favor over the past few days and state-level polling showing a clear electoral college lead; but I guess we'll find out soon.
Meanwhile, via Mark Thoma, Simon Wren-Lewis worries whether he has been too rude toward policy makers who forced a turn toward austerity in 2010, helping to derail recovery in advanced countries.
As Wren-Lewis says, objectively there's every reason to be very angry: policy makers threw out everything we've learned about business cycles these past 80 years in favor of doctrines that made them feel comfortable -- and millions of workers paid the price. But should we cut them some slack nonetheless?
This is basically an operational question; as Mark says, the goal is to change minds -- although the big question there is whether you're trying to change the minds of the policy makers themselves, or the minds of other people, so we can get a new and better set of policy makers.
But even given that, it matters what niche you yourself fill in the intellectual ecology. Insider-type positions, like that of being the senior economist at the IMF, require tact and euphemisms. Outsider positions, like that of being an iconoclastic columnist at the New York Times, require a lot of effort to get peoples' attention. It wasn't nice to characterize the doctrine of expansionary austerity as belief in the confidence fairy, but I do believe that it focused the discussion in a way that a less caustic approach would not have achieved.
And one more point: writing effectively requires that you have a voice, that the passion shows -- and too much self-censorship can get in the way, making the writing dull and stiff. Obviously no four-letter words -- and while I may sometimes envy Matt Taibbi his vampire squid, rudeness in my part of the commentariat has to be within certain bounds. But pretending to respect views that you don't isn't, and shouldn't, be part of the job description for economists trying to grapple with these important issues.

HEADLINE: The Election Won't Solve All Puzzles

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: "Uncertainty" has become the watchword over the last several years as an explanation - or perhaps an excuse - for the economy's slow growth, for the lack of hiring by business and for the volatility in the stock market. 

 BODY:
Here comes more uncertainty.
It may sound counterintuitive, but whatever the outcome of the election - whether President Obama or Mitt Romney wins - the economy and markets are likely to face more uncertainty, not less, over the coming year.
"Uncertainty" has become the watchword over the last several years for many chief executives, politicians and economists as an explanation - or perhaps an excuse - for the economy's slow growth, for the lack of hiring by business and for the volatility in the stock market.
"The claim is that businesses and households are uncertain about future taxes, spending levels, regulations, health care reform and interest rates. In turn, this uncertainty leads them to postpone spending on investment and consumption goods and to slow hiring, impeding the recovery," a group of professors from Stanford University and the University of Chicago wrote in a study that found "current levels of economic policy uncertainty are at extremely elevated levels compared to recent history." (The professors have created a Web site, policyuncertainty.com, where you can track the "uncertainty" levels.)
Come Wednesday morning, we should know who our president will be. But the uncertainty hardly ends there.
Almost immediately after the elections, the next big talking point on Wall Street and in Washington is going to be the now infamous "fiscal cliff," a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that was the result of a Congressional compromise reached last summer and is to take effect on Jan. 1, unless Congress finds an alternative. Some economists say the tax increases and spending cuts in the existing agreement could shave as much as 4 percent off G.D.P. if they are not renegotiated. Already, executives say that the uncertainty over the outcome of the fiscal cliff is causing them to hold back from making new investments.
But the greatest likelihood is that the fiscal cliff isn't going to be resolved soon at all -the betting line of the political cognoscenti is that no matter who wins, Congress will find a way to kick the issue down the road, perhaps as far as the fall of 2013, providing a new cloud of uncertainty over the economy.
For investors, the fiscal cliff includes a tax increase on dividends (making them the equivalent of ordinary income, on which rates could rise to as high as 39.6 percent) and capital gains (up to 20 percent from 15 percent). In a note to clients sent out on Sunday night, Goldman Sachs said that it expected the rate for both dividends and capital gains to be negotiated to 20 percent in either a second Obama term or a Romney presidency. But more important, Goldman noted that when similar tax increases were on the table in 1970 and 1986, "the S.& P. 500 posted negative returns in the December prior to implementation as investors locked in the lower rate." December, the report said, "has the second-highest average monthly return" since 1928.
Many investors have already begun selling stocks and companies in anticipation of tax increases. Speculation was rampant last week that one of the reasons for the timing of the sale of George Lucas's company, Lucasfilm, to Disney for $4.1 billion in cash and stock, was the impending changes in tax policy. (Mr. Lucas has said that he plans to donate a majority of his wealth to charity.)
Once we get past the fiscal cliff, if we do at all, there is Europe. Remember Europe? The issues in Greece and Spain have managed to stay off the front pages during the election run-up, but they have not gone away. Some economists have argued that things have gotten worse. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, who will face election in 2013, said on Monday that the fiscal crisis in Europe was likely to last at least five years. "Whoever thinks this can be fixed in one or two years is wrong," she said.
And don't forget the Middle East. That "uncertainty" for the world - and the global economy - isn't going away anytime soon either. Questions about a possible attack on Iran will persist under either candidate.
And finally, there is Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, one of the biggest uncertainties of them all. As I reported in this column two weeks ago, the greatest likelihood is that Mr. Bernanke will step down at the end of his term in early 2014 no matter who wins the election.
It's possible - though unlikely - that his departure could happen even sooner if Mr. Romney wins. Over the next year and a half, Mr. Bernanke's future as the Fed chairman will feed a sense of uncertainty among investors who have become accustomed to his easy money policies. If President Obama wins, he is likely to appoint a successor to Mr. Bernanke who is dovish on monetary policy, and more likely to keep printing money as Mr. Bernanke has, a strategy that comes with its own risks. If Mr. Romney wins, he may appoint a more hawkish chairman, a move that could create a different sense of uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve will unwind itself from Mr. Bernanke's policies.
None of these issues are new. President Obama took office facing a fiscal policy dispute that was not and probably could not be settled given the gridlock in Congress. No solution is in sight for Europe's problems. Tension in the Middle East is escalating as fast as nuclear technology. And the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is at its most opaque since the Reagan administration.
All of which shows that the comedian Jon Stewart is more on target than ever with the cheeky title of his election coverage on "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central. Carrying on a tradition, it is known as "Indecision 2012."
Update that to 2013, and it's good for another year.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Polls Show Benefit of Auto Rescue to Obama

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: If the polls are correct, and President Obama wins a narrow Electoral College victory on Tuesday, the pivotal moment of the 2012 presidential race may have actually occurred in 2009. 

 BODY:
 We conclude our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it is changing, with Ohio, the Buckeye State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Herb Asher and Paul A. Beck, both professors emeritus in Ohio State University's department of political science. 
If the polls are correct, and President Obama wins a narrow Electoral College victory on Tuesday, the pivotal moment of the 2012 presidential race may have actually occurred in 2009. About two months after taking office, Mr. Obama set the terms of the government's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler, a move that eventually helped to resurrect the American automobile industry, and, in turn, bolster the economy of the king of swing states: Ohio.
Historically, Ohio has been slightly Republican-leaning relative to the nation. But this year polls suggest that Ohio is slightly Democratic-leaning. That divergence -- driven by the auto rescue and the state's improved economy, local analysts said -- may prove determinative. Ohio ranks first on FiveThirtyEight's tipping point index. The model estimates there is roughly a 50 percent chance that the Buckeye State's 18 electoral votes will carry the winning candidate past the 270 mark.
Ohio's historic rightward lean has been slight - about two percentage points, on average, since 1948 - but consistent. In the 16 presidential elections from 1948 through 2008, Ohio was redder than the nation in 13. It was Democratic-leaning relative to the nation only in 1964, 1972 and 2004 (and in 2004, it leaned Democratic by less than half a percentage point).
But polls show Mr. Obama leading Mitt Romney in Ohio by about three percentage points, one point better than Mr. Obama's projected national margin, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. The auto rescue's impact on Ohio's political preferences, though modest, has been decisive.
"The auto rescue is popular in Ohio," Mr. Beck said, and because the Buckeye State was only slightly Republican-leaning, a small shift appears to have tipped the state's partisan balance.
Moreover, the auto rescue and Ohio's steadily falling unemployment rate appear to have improved Mr. Obama's standing with the very demographic group that Mr. Romney might have made inroads with: white working-class voters. 
"White working-class voters in Ohio have been more supportive of Obama than white working-class voters nationwide," Mr. Beck said.
Ohio's economy has traditionally been driven by manufacturing. "Ohio led the industrial revolution 100 years ago," Mr. Asher said, but in the latter half of the 20th century, globalization and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs hurt the state's economy.
Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, during the summer, the Obama campaign saturated Ohio television with advertisements highlighting Mr. Romney's "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt" op-ed article in The Times as well as linking Mr. Romney to Bain Capital and linking Bain Capital to outsourcing, Mr. Asher said. For many Ohio voters, that effort helped undermine Mr. Romney's contention that his business experience would benefit them if he reached the White House.
As a result, Mr. Beck said, many of the white working-class voters whom Mr. Romney might have appealed to now see him "as the kind of businessman who for many of them was the problem." 
Mr. Asher added, "The Obama campaign defined Mr. Romney, and that appeal gets reinforcement by the auto bailout."
The Democratic Party's base of support in Ohio is in the northeast part of the state, a mix of African-American and blue-collar union voters in Cleveland, Canton, Akron and Youngstown. In 2008, Mr. Obama carried Ohio by just over 200,000 votes; he carried Cleveland's Cuyahoga County by almost 250,000 votes. Northeastern Ohio is also the center of the state's auto industry, in Cuyahoga and Lake Counties.
From Cleveland, Democratic support fades as you travel west along Lake Erie (though Toledo is reliably left-leaning) and southeast along Ohio's border with Pennsylvania. Democrats have also made some gains in Ohio's other major cities. Franklin County, which includes the state capital, Columbus, has trended Democratic, and Mr. Obama made gains in Dayton in 2008, as well.
In 2008, Mr. Obama also managed to flip Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, which had long been one of the more Republican-leaning cities in the state.
Conversely, Democratic support has eroded in southeastern Ohio, which is part of Appalachia. The southeast is culturally conservative and economically depressed. Bill Clinton carried many of the counties there, but they have moved sharply toward the G.O.P. since then. Coal is a major economic driver in southeastern Ohio, and Mr. Romney has targeted voters in the area by attacking Mr. Obama's energy policies. But the southeast is also lightly populated, contributing only about 10 percent of the statewide vote, Mr. Asher said.
Outside of the northeast and Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio is mostly Republican-leaning. Western Ohio, in particular, is ruby red and socially conservative. To carry the state, Mr. Romney will need to run up his margins in the suburban and exurban counties in southwestern Ohio around Cincinnati as well as the small towns along the state's western border. In 2008, Senator John McCain carried those counties, but he did not get the turnout and margins that George W. Bush did in 2004. 
 The Bellwether: Stark County 
Stark County, anchored by Canton, has been an almost perfect bellwether for the statewide vote in Ohio in the past three presidential elections. Canton tends to vote Democratic, but Stark County also has more rural areas that lean Republican. Stark County was one percentage point more Republican-leaning that Ohio over all in 2008 and 2000 and two points more Republican-leaning in 2004.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is an 85 percent favorite to carry Ohio, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. Not coincidentally, that almost exactly matches his odds of winning re-election, according to the model.
If not for the auto rescue, Ohio's slight Republican lean would most likely have remained in effect. Unlike in other states, there are no major demographic trends affecting the state's partisan balance.
"Ohio in terms of demographics is a fairly static state," Mr. Beck said. "Our Hispanic population is too small to matter except at the margins."
If Ohio were, relative to the national popular vote, two percentage points Republican-leaning this election -- its average over the last 60 years -- the state would be a tossup. And if Mr. Romney were able to carry Ohio, he would have many more paths to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House.
But if the polls are right, and the auto rescue and Ohio's relatively healthy economy help Mr. Obama prevail in the Buckeye State, then it becomes difficult -- though not impossible -- for Mr. Romney to piece together a winning electoral map.

HEADLINE: Nov. 4: Did Hurricane Sandy Blow Romney Off Course?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. But while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, they do not reflect the whole story. 

 BODY:
If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy. 
Already, some analysts are describing the storm as an "October surprise" that allowed Mr. Obama to regain his footing after stumbling badly in the first presidential debate and struggling to get back on course. Some Republicans seem prepared to blame a potential defeat for Mitt Romney on the storm, and the embrace of Mr. Obama by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other public officials.
The theory has some appeal. The last three days of polling have brought what is almost certainly Mr. Obama's strongest run of polling since the first presidential debate in Denver. Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of battleground-state polls over the weekend. And increasingly, it is hard to find leads for Mr. Romney in national surveys - although several of them show a tie.
When the hurricane made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29, Mr. Obama's chances of winning re-election were 73 percent in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Since then, his chances have risen to 86 percent, close to his highs on the year.
But, while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story. 
Mr. Obama had already been rebounding in the polls, slowly but steadily, from his lows in early October - in contrast to a common narrative in the news media that contended, without much evidence, that Mr. Romney still had the momentum in the race.
Moreover, there are any number of alternatives to explain Mr. Obama's gains before and after the storm hit.
Mr. Obama was adjudicated the winner of the second and third presidential debates in surveys of voters who watched them.The past month has brought a series of encouraging economic news, including strong jobs reports in October and last Friday.The bounce in the polls that Mr. Romney received after the Denver debate may have been destined to fade in part, as polling bounces often do following political events like national conventions.Democrats have an edge in early voting based on states that provide hard data about which party's voters have turned out to cast ballots. Some voters who were originally rejected by the likely voter models that surveys apply may now be included if they say that they have already voted.Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been running lots of advertisements, which could have some effect, especially in the swing states.Mr. Obama's voter-targeting operation may in fact be stronger than Mr. Romney's and may have begun to show up in the polls.Mr. Obama's approval rating is at 49 or 50 percent in many surveys, a threshold that would ordinarily predict a narrow re-election for an incumbent.Some elections "break" toward one or another candidate at the end as undecided voters tune in and begin to evaluate their decision.
Each of these hypotheses could merit its own article. But the point is that the causes for Mr. Obama's gain in the polls are

HEADLINE: In Nevada, a Push to Get Holdouts to the Polls

BYLINE: STEPHANIE SAUL


HIGHLIGHT: In Nevada, where nearly 70 percent of voters had already cast their ballots, both sides pushed forward with fervent last-minute efforts to get the stragglers to polls. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- In Nevada, where nearly 70 percent of voters had already cast their ballots, both sides pushed forward with fervent last-minute efforts to get the stragglers to polls. 
Figures released by elections officials showed that Democrats held an edge of more than 40,000 voters by the time early voting ended last week. In Clark County, the state's most populous, more Democrats had voted early this year than in 2008. 
With the advantage apparently for President Obama in early voting, Mitt Romney's campaign had imported a 600-member volunteer army from nearby states. The group gathered Monday morning at the Las Vegas offices of Brady Industries, a facility supply distributor. 
The volunteers were dispatched in 40 vans to Las Vegas-area neighborhoods, where they planned to walk door to door, guiding by walking lists of conservative voters. After sundown they planned to return to Brady Industries, where the company had donated space for a large phone bank. 
One of the volunteers was Lisa Vander, 50, of San Diego, who said she was unemployed despite an "incredible" résumé and blames it on the current economy. "It's really about jobs jobs jobs," Ms. Vander said. She said she believed Mr. Romney would do more for the economy.
Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, began his day Monday with a final campaign stop in Reno. Later in the day, Craig Romney, Mr. Romney's Spanish-speaking son, was to hold a rally on the heavily Hispanic east side of Las Vegas. 
The state's Hispanic vote -- about 25 percent of the total -- was viewed as critical. The organization Mi Familia Vota had worked to make sure Hispanics registered and went to the polls in early voting. On Tuesday the group is planning to drive additional voters to polling places. The effort appears to have been successful. In Clark County, the home of Las Vegas, early voting among those with Hispanic surnames outstripped turnout in 2008 by more than 12,000 voters. The group skews heavily Democratic. 
The Obama campaign was also working to scrape up every remaining vote. At a senior housing complex in downtown Las Vegas named after Senator Harry Reid, Betty Barfield, a volunteer coordinator for the Obama campaign, was sitting outside in her wheel chair. Half the complex of 100 apartments had voted early, Ms. Barfield said. She had arranged for two buses to come take the remaining residents to polls on Tuesday. Almost all of them will vote for Mr. Obama, she said. 
"It's really been a joy and a privilege for me," said Ms. Barfield, a minister who is African-American. "I never thought I would see this and it would happen in my lifetime. I thank God for letting me live long enough." 
She has also held phone banks and Obama meetings at the senior complex, many of them catered. The Obama campaign supplied ice cream for one of them. "Any time you want people to come and hear what you have to say, you must have free food," Ms. Barfield said. 
Morning television viewers in Las Vegas on Monday were bombarded with back-to-back commercials paid for by both the candidates and outside groups supporting both sides. Campaign-weary Nevadans said they were particularly tired of the negative advertising in the race between Senator Dean Heller, a Republican, against his Democratic opponent, Representative Shelley Berkley.

New York Times correspondents around the nation surveyed the activity in swing states a day before the election, and what they found was a frenzied push to the very end to coax voters to the polls. Many had already cast their ballots, but the bulk of the votes are expected Tuesday. And for some, Election Day will be even more significant, the start of a new life: from the Romney volunteer who moved with his wife from Texas to help the campaign's cause in Ohio, to the political junkie who makes his living selling memorabilia in battleground states during election years
 FLORIDA 
MIAMI - "Mamita, tenemos una conga outside!" someone shouted. "We have a conga outside!"
It was voting Miami style. On a final, unexpected day of voting in Miami-Dade County, Obama supporters swayed in a conga line, with an actual conga drum at the front, all in the hopes of keeping voters waiting in yet another five-hour line excited. As the sun pounded voters, they gulped water, ate pizza, unfolded chairs and opened umbrellas, courtesy of the Obama campaign.
It was obvious why. Most voters waiting here sported Obama stickers. Some voters grumbled about the persistently long lines around the county. After a federal lawsuit was filed by Florida Democrats, six counties agreed to let voters fill out and drop off absentee ballots in person on Monday and Tuesday.
"I've been calling places for the last couple of days, but the wait time had been too long," said Gabriela Reyes, 19, a student who works part time. "It's time-consuming. It has made it really hard for people to come out and vote."
Nearby, Tania Mancia, 47, looked at her watch. She had one hour left before work beckoned. "There is always tomorrow," she said with a sigh. 
 - LIZETTE ALVAREZ 
 OHIO 
DUBLIN, Ohio - The parking lot at the Romney-Ryan state headquarters here in a suburban office park would be a bonanza for a minivan full of kids playing the license plate game.
Lots of Ohio, of course. Then the neighbors: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Then a bit farther afield: Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
Then there is a tan Chevy Tahoe with Texas plates, belonging to John and Cheri Gilbert, a pair of soft-spoken believers in the Romney cause from the Houston area. "Our country recruited us," said Mr. Gilbert, 67, a semiretired engineer.
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert, by their count, have knocked on 4,000 doors and made more than 1,000 calls on behalf of the Republican ticket. Mr. Gilbert said he and his wife had never been involved in a presidential campaign.
President Obama lost them when he pushed health care through Congress without a single Republican vote, and when, in their view, he traveled abroad and "apologized for who we are."
The Gilberts said that on Wednesday, win or lose, they would pack up and return to Texas. "But the fight is not over," said Mrs. Gilbert, 66. "We are going to be watching Congress, the Senate and whoever is president and vice president and hold their feet to the fire."
 - JOHN M. BRODER 
 WISCONSIN 
MILWAUKEE - Forget hanging chads and contested ballots. In Wisconsin, some election officials are worried about fistfights.
Law enforcement agents here are being trained on mediating disputes at the polls.
In Milwaukee, lawyers from the district attorney's office will be on call if tensions get out of hand. Bickering has already broken out at the clerk's office in Sun Prairie, a small city outside Madison, where voters argued as they waited in line to cast absentee ballots.
Still reeling from a divisive recall fight this year, Wisconsinites are voting in a tinderbox atmosphere, stoked by a near-constant stream of attack ads. City clerks are bracing for a combustible combination of aggressive poll watchers and partisan voters. "We have to anticipate the worst," said Neil V. Albrecht, the executive director of Milwaukee's election commission. "This is a very politically polarized state right now, and an electrically charged climate when it comes to issues like voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement."
Some voters are yearning for the finish line. Mary Markwiese, 59, a legal assistant, said the end of the campaign would be a relief. "It's like watching the Packers in the Super Bowl," said Ms. Markwiese, who supports Mitt Romney. "You're just too nervous about it." 
 - MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM 
 COLORADO 
DENVER - Early voting is over in Colorado. The first completed ballots have already been scanned into computers. The candidates have all departed, making their last hoarse, passionate pushes for Colorado's nine electoral votes before flying east.
So for the army of election workers and county clerks across Colorado, Monday was the eye of the storm. As the campaigns papered neighborhoods with door tags reminding people to vote, election workers answered phone calls and sorted through mail-in ballots. They ran last-minute training seminars for election judges and made sure the voting machines were working. They marshaled their staff and braced for a frenzied day that would begin at 6 a.m. sharp and might well last until past midnight.
The night before would be a restless one.
"It's hard not having nightmares," Gilbert Ortiz, the Pueblo County clerk, said in a telephone interview. "My wife is complaining to me that I'm giving speeches in my sleep about ballots."
Mr. Ortiz was subsisting on Power Bars, coffee and pot roast his mother brought him for lunch. Other clerks had similar arsenals lined up for Tuesday.
"Coffee and Dr Pepper," said Terri Carver, an election official in Alamosa County. "We just take one minute at a time, and keep smiling." 
 - JACK HEALY 
 IOWA 
DES MOINES - Most political junkies get their election fix from the comfort of their homes, where they watch pundits on cable television or scour the latest polls online.
But Jeff Reul needs to be closer to the action. So, for the past two presidential election cycles he has hopscotched swing states, hawking political pins and T-shirts from parking lots outside rallies to support his travels.
As he stood in the cold outside a rally for Representative Paul D. Ryan here on Monday afternoon, it was easy to see from his pins where he stood politically. There were the pins that said: "I'LL TAKE THE MORMON OVER THE MORON." Others said "Don't Tax Me Bro!" or "Hot Chicks Dig Ryan," and "GIVE ME LIBERTY NOT DEBT."
"It's the best road trip you can take," Mr. Reul said. "I can say I was there for history."
Mr. Reul said that he had shaken hands with both Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan, and sold buttons to celebrity politicians.
When asked what he planned to do after the election on Tuesday, Mr. Reul, a dietitian from Columbia, Mo., said: "Just go back to my boring life." 
 - MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT 
 VIRGINIA 
ARLINGTON, Va. - Elaine Dawes has had pretty good luck calling people on President Obama's behalf over the past month.
"Usually I get the enthusiastic people," Ms. Dawes, 72, said Monday as she stood next to a power outlet clogged with charging cellphones.
In a storefront humming with activity two miles from the Pentagon, 20 volunteers dotted the room, many leaning forward in their folding chairs as they made last-minute calls.
"This is your neighbor in Arlington," one volunteer said into a cellphone, sitting near a banner tracing progress toward their goal of knocking on 142,000 doors. As of Monday afternoon, the banner put them at just over 106,000.
Gabriel Thoumi, 41, estimated that they had seen about 30 percent more people coming in to volunteer on Monday compared with last week. He said volunteers were focused on encouraging people not only to vote, but also to decide ahead of time when to vote and how they would get to the polls.
"Their voice is as important as anybody else in this country, and it's absolutely critical that everybody gets to vote, whoever they are," he said. "Republican, Green, Libertarian, Democrat, it doesn't matter. That's the beauty of our country." 
 - EMMARIE HUETTEMAN 
 NEW HAMPSHIRE 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Hours before Mitt Romney visited here on Monday, two of his sons, Tagg and Ben, traveled through the state visiting Romney "victory" offices and encouraging voters to get to the polls.
It is familiar turf for the family: they have a summer home in New Hampshire, and throughout the grueling race they would get together on Lake Winnipesaukee for breaks from the campaign trail.
But the state has not always been kind to Mr. Romney. In 2008, Senator John McCain won the presidential primary here, reviving his once moribund candidacy. But this campaign cycle, Mr. Romney won the primary decisively, and he hopes to repeat that success on Tuesday.
Both President Obama and Mr. Romney have rolled out their top surrogates across the state and have enlisted armies of volunteers to canvass and host get-out-the-vote efforts.
In the battle of signs, the Romney-Ryan ticket dominated Granite Avenue, a main stretch in downtown Manchester.
Ricardo Rodriguez, 42, a delivery man for a florist and an Obama volunteer, was undeterred.
"I'm not a political person," he said on a cold Manchester night as snow began to fall. "But listening to Mitt Romney's ideas about where he wants to take the country, it just sounds scary." 
 - AMY CHOZICK 
 NEVADA 
LAS VEGAS - With the advantage apparently going to President Obama in early voting in Nevada, Mitt Romney's campaign has imported a 600-member volunteer army from nearby states. The group gathered on Monday morning at the Las Vegas offices of Brady Industries, a facility supply distributor.
One volunteer was Lisa Vander, 50, of San Diego, who said she was unemployed despite an "incredible" résumé and blamed the current economy. "It's really about jobs, jobs, jobs," said Ms. Vander, who added that she believed Mr. Romney would do more for the economy.
But the Obama campaign was also working to secure every remaining vote. At a senior housing complex named after Senator Harry Reid in downtown Las Vegas, Betty Barfield, 74, a volunteer coordinator for the Obama campaign, was sitting outside in her wheelchair. Half the residents of the complex of 100 apartments had voted early, Ms. Barfield said. She had arranged two buses to come take the remaining ones to polls on Tuesday. Almost all of them will vote for Mr. Obama, she said.
"It's really been a joy and a privilege for me," said Ms. Barfield, a minister who is African-American. "I never thought I would see this and it would happen in my lifetime. I thank God for letting me live long enough."

HEADLINE: My Old Kentucky Conservatism

BYLINE: By MAURICE MANNING. 
Maurice Manning is a poet and the author, most recently, of the poetry collection ''The Common Man.''

 BODY:
Washington County, Ky.
CUTTING firewood on a recent afternoon in the woods at the back of our farm, it occurred to me that the term conservative has lost all connection to its original meaning.
The root of the word comes from the Latin verb ''conservare,'' which means ''to keep and preserve.'' It's interesting that the origin is a verb and not a noun, a term that implies action and duty, rather than merely a stance. Other meanings suggested by conservative have to do with frugality, modesty and the preservation of tradition.
By these lights, I would qualify as a conservative. My goal in tending our 20 acres is to preserve the character and health of this land. I don't pile chemicals on our soil; I plant our gardens on our few patches of level ground, and every fall I am careful to rebuild the soil with leaves and compost. 
And I am pleased to preserve the traditional order of this land. If I leave a rut in a field, I repair it; if, in moving one of the many rocks that dot my property, I uncover a pair of salamanders, I put it back and leave the spotted creatures to their lives, as they have left me to mine. My most modern farm implement is a 1967 International Cub tractor, Old Yeller I call it, and it runs like a top.
I managed to pay off our $70,000 mortgage this spring after just nine years of indebtedness, which has required working two jobs at times, considerable frugality and considerable sweat. These are values I learned from my grandfather, who after buying a house following his service in World War II took on two jobs and paid off his home in seven years. It is the only home he ever owned.
My neighbors share this outlook. Two of them live on land that the family of one of them has owned since 1786: they live in a trailer; they raise cattle and are certified master gardeners.
During the extended drought this summer, I built a shed on the top of our hill to catch rainwater; we then used it to water our gardens with buckets and used hand tools to hoe and aerate the ground.
This is a practice borne of necessity that I inherited from my great-grandparents and my great-great Aunt Clara, who lived to be 108 years old. I plant a variety of bean she developed in Clay County, Ky., which, according to the last census, is among the poorest regions in the country.
My wife, Amanda, volunteers in our county with an organization called New Pioneers for a Sustainable Future, which promotes local agriculture. Its members include farmers and merchants; people who run vineyards, raise alpacas and sheep; nurses, insurance agents, potters and former school-bus drivers. The group believes that by buying locally raised food, we can keep more money in the county and in that way help to preserve our heritage, become healthier and enhance our shared prosperity. This is conservatism, as I understand it and value it.
This version of conservatism, however, runs counter to the model presented by the Republican establishment. The latest Republican administration got us enmeshed in two wars, neither of which is winnable, and both of which have cost us blood and treasure, as the old saying goes, that cannot be calculated. A small number of extremely elite ''conservatives'' has even profited from these ventures. Is that conservatism?
It was obvious from the beginning that our national economic woes come from Wall Street, not the government. Yet our ''conservative'' leaders think we should do away with oversight and regulation and give the financial world absolutely free rein. It is a freedom that has not been earned. And allowing our financiers to run unchecked is about as conservative as leaving the faucet running. Financial regulations discourage waste and fraud, two values that ought to be at the forefront of any conservative mind-set.
Here in Kentucky we have a number of so-called conservatives who advocate mountaintop removal, a destructive technique used by the coal industry. It is surely the most egregious and unnecessary form of coal extraction: thousands of acres of land are blown up and bulldozed away, as if the land itself is an unpleasant encumbrance without any value whatsoever.
Yet Jim Booth, a Kentucky politician and coal operator, was recently hailed here for sealing a deal to sell Kentucky coal to India, a deal that will make many millions for a few, but that, curiously, will export American energy resources in favor of mere monetary profit and at the expense of American energy independence.
Mitt Romney is keen to say he ''is a friend of coal.'' But I doubt Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan has ever looked out on the vast wasteland of a mountaintop removal site and pronounced it good.
They are also keen to build an oil pipeline from Alberta to Oklahoma, a project that would endanger water resources and threaten the vitality of huge sections of farmland. There is no way to describe such an outlook as conservative -- shortsighted, opportunistic and wasteful, perhaps, but not conservative.
For that matter, I don't see how a man who has multiple homes around the country, whose business has been to serve investors seeking purely monetary gains -- that is, people with no interest in local preservation or local well-being, and those who do not live side by side the community into which they are invested -- can be considered conservative.
That kind of extravagance has not been good for our country or anywhere else; it places making money ahead of making sense. If they represent anything, Mr. Romney and the policies he advocates represent a betrayal of conservatism, at least the kind of conservatism we practice here in Washington County.

HEADLINE: In Combination of Services, Stifel Financial to Buy KBW for $575 Million

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The Stifel Financial Group has agreed to buy KBW in a deal valued at $575 million, giving Stifel a foothold in the lucrative business of advising financial institutions.
The combination, announced on Monday, signals what many think could be the beginning of a period of consolidation in the financial services industry. While banks and brokerage firms have recovered since the economic crisis, a number of factors - increased regulatory burdens, pressure on commissions, and persistently low interest rates - have combined to crimp profitability.
"Banks have to start acquiring other banks again to have profit margins go higher," said the market commentator James J. Cramer, discussing the deal on CNBC. 
Under the terms of the merger, Stifel will pay $10 a share in cash and $7.50 a share in stock for KBW. Shares of KBW rose 7 percent, to $17.47, but shareholders of Stifel also appeared to support the deal. Stifel's stock rose 2 percent to $32.58.
Stifel's acquisition deal echoes the very advice that KBW has been giving its clients - that now is the time to invest in financial services companies. Banks have seen signs of stabilization, including credit trends improving across their loan portfolios. Year-to-date, banks and insurers are outperforming the broader stock market for the first time since 2006.
"You've told me a number of times that now is the time to invest in financial services," Ronald Kruszewski, the chief executive of Stifel, said to KBW's chief, Thomas B. Michaud, during a call announcing the transaction. Mr. Kruszewski then joked: "It's probably a little late for me to change my mind."
The acquisition of KBW, which is based in New York, extends Stifel's aggressive expansion strategy executed over the last five years. Stifel, based in St. Louis, bought the technology-focused investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners in 2010 and last year made a large investment in Miller Buckfire, a New York firm specializing in restructuring.
Other companies that it has picked up include the fixed income specialists Stone & Youngberg and the New Jersey brokerage firm Ryan Beck & Company.
Stifel has also been mentioned as a possible buyer of a number of other smaller, so-called middle market investment banks and brokerage houses that have recently put themselves up for sale, including the investment bank boutique Gleacher & Company.
Since 2008, when many banks shed employees, Stifel has grown to 5,000 from 1,600 employees. It has a market value of $1.75 billion.
"There has been a lot of turmoil in the industry," Mr. Kruszewski said. "But with our record revenue and record profits in 2008, we have been able to take advantage of all the dislocation. It's Darwinian."
Stifel made news this year when it contributed $30 million to an investment group that bailed out Knight Capital after the trading firm suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses tied to an errant computer program.
Stifel was not unscathed by the financial crisis. In March, it agreed to pay $22.5 million to resolve charges from five Wisconsin school districts that the firm had misled them in the sale of complex mortgage securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has a lawsuit pending related to the same securities.
In KBW - shorthand for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods - Stifel is acquiring a 50-year-old firm that has carved out a niche in advising, and publishing research on, financial services companies.
KBW, whose previous New York headquarters was located in the World Trade Center, has had to bounce back from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, when it lost 67 of its 224 employees, including five of nine directors and its co-chief executive, Joseph Berry.
In 2006, KBW sold stock in an initial public offering. The offering came seven years after the company first tried a share sale. But KBW scrapped its plans after federal prosecutors charged its former chief executive with leaking information about bank mergers to an actress in racy films.
KBW's shares have struggled along with the rest of the brokerage industry since the financial crisis, dropping more than 20 percent since its initial offering. KBW announced soft earnings on Monday, but said that it was seeing improvement in capital-raising activity and the mergers-and-acquisitions pipeline.
Stifel will retain the KBW brand name and operate it as a separate business division of Stifel. Mr. Michaud, KBW's chief, is expected to join Stifel's board and will continue to run the business. On Monday, Mr. Kruszewski said that about 85 KBW executives had signed retention packages. Any staff cuts will come from back-office redundancies, he added.
In the face of logistical headaches caused last week by Hurricane Sandy, the merger's advisers worked furiously to complete the deal so it could be announced on Monday alongside Stifel's and KBW's earnings releases.
Stifel was advised by its own investment banking team and the law firm Bryan Cave. KBW also advised itself, and received addition counsel from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.
H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner at Sullivan, said that even though his law firm lost power and experienced significant flooding at its Lower Manhattan headquarters, there were few hiccups in getting the deal done. In part, Mr. Cohen said, that was because after Sept. 11, Sullivan installed backup servers at a facility in Elmsford, N.Y., accessible from the firm's Midtown office.
"Had this deal been 20 years before, it probably wouldn't have happened," Mr. Cohen said. "But technology today allowed us to get it done seamlessly."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Flooded Manhattan Buildings May Stay Closed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
New York City's buildings commissioner said Monday that scores of the 445 Lower Manhattan buildings his inspectors had labeled contaminated or otherwise temporarily uninhabitable, including some that house huge financial services companies and other large businesses, could remain so for weeks or possibly months. 
The commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, said in a telephone interview that since Hurricane Sandy struck, his department had inspected 853 buildings, in an area bounded by the Hudson and East Rivers below Delancey Street on the East Side and Canal Street to the west. Most were in the evacuation zone and hit hard by the storm surge.
Mr. LiMandri said 393 were found to be habitable and were marked with green stickers identifying them as such. Nine buildings received red stickers, marking them as too dangerous to enter, along with six others that were scheduled for reinspection on Monday night and Tuesday morning.
But of the 445 that received yellow tags, he acknowledged, scores could be out of commission for weeks or months.
Mr. LiMandri said some of these buildings were large structures with thousands of workers that produced ''a lot of economic activity for the neighborhood'' and were subject to closing because of the flooding and fuel oil contamination that damaged their electrical, heating and other systems.
He said most of those buildings were operated by large corporations, with resources and personnel that could in some instances provide the means to temporarily solve the building's problems and allow it to reopen.

HEADLINE: Costs of Shoring Up Coastal Communities

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
For more than a century, for good or ill, New Jersey has led the nation in coastal development. Many of the barrier islands along its coast have long been lined by rock jetties, concrete sea walls or other protective armor. Most of its coastal communities have beaches only because engineers periodically replenish them with sand pumped from offshore.
Now much of that sand is gone. Though reports are still preliminary, coastal researchers say that when Hurricane Sandy came ashore, it washed enormous quantities of sand off beaches and into the streets -- or even all the way across barrier islands into the bays behind them. 
But even as these towns clamor for sand, scientists are warning that rising seas will make maintaining artificial beaches prohibitively expensive or simply impossible. Even some advocates of artificial beach nourishment now urge new approaches to the issue, especially in New Jersey.
The practice has long been controversial.
Opponents of beach nourishment argue that undeveloped beaches deal well with storms. Their sands shift; barrier islands may even migrate toward the mainland. But the beach itself survives, because buildings and roads do not pin it down.
By contrast, replenishment projects often wash away far sooner than expected. The critics say the best answer to coastal storms is to move people and buildings away from the water, a tactic some call strategic retreat.
Supporters of these projects counter that beaches are infrastructure -- just like roads, bridges and sewer systems -- that must be maintained. They say beaches attract tourists and summer residents, conferring immense economic benefits that more than outweigh the costs of the projects. Also, they argue, these beaches absorb storm energy, sparing buildings inland.
New Jersey has embraced this approach with gusto. Stewart C. Farrell, a professor of marine geology at Stockton College of New Jersey, said that since 1985 80 million cubic yards of sand had been applied on 54 of the state's 97 miles of developed coastline: a truckload of sand for every foot of beach.
Dr. Farrell and his colleagues have calculated that the work cost more than $800 million -- before adjusting for inflation.
Typically, the federal government pays 65 percent of the cost; the state and towns share the rest.
By now in New Jersey, most beaches ''are engineered dikes,'' said Thomas Herrington, a professor of ocean engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, who has been working with the state to assess its coastal protection. About half of its coastal communities have projects still under way, so their beaches are already approved -- at least in theory -- for topping up with sand as needed.
But even if there is money for that work, engineers must find the sand. Around the nation, that is getting more and more difficult. The problem is particularly acute in New Jersey.
''We know from geological surveys -- and New Jersey is a prime example -- that offshore sand, high-quality sand, is a highly finite resource,'' said S. Jeffress Williams, a coastal scientist with the United States Geological Survey and the University of Hawaii.
Underwater ridges of sand lie offshore, but engineers must go farther and farther (and spend more and more) to find them, Mr. Williams said, adding that eventually ''it is not going to be there.''
And while it is theoretically possible to replenish a beach with material mined inland, that approach would create other problems, said Robert Young, a coastal geologist who directs the program for the study of developed shorelines at Western Carolina University. ''Trucks full of sand weigh a lot,'' he added. ''There is a tremendous toll on highway infrastructure.'' And excavating inland sand ''would create holes that would be miles in diameter.''
Howard Marlowe, a prominent advocate of replenishment projects, agrees that the nation needs ''a better way of managing short supplies of sediment.''
Mr. Marlowe is president of Marlowe & Company, a lobbying concern that represents many Atlantic and Pacific coastal communities. He said in an interview that sand supplies should be managed ''holistically'' -- and on a regional basis, not town by town, as is now largely the case.
Managers should look at inlets, ports and the Intracoastal Waterway, as well as offshore sand sources, Mr. Marlowe said, adding, ''You have to have an interstate approach.''
That is particularly true in New Jersey, he said, because towns in New York and Delaware also often find themselves on the hunt for sand. Elsewhere in the country, towns feud over who is entitled to offshore sand. Towns in Florida have gone to court over the issue.
Avalon, N.J., about 20 miles north of Cape May, looks to Townsends Inlet north of town for its sand, according to Harry deButts, who retired in 2008 as the town's director of public works and now works part time on its emergency management efforts. He said Avalon shares that sand with Sea Isle City, the town across the inlet.
Mr. deButts said the Army Corps of Engineers dredged about 450,000 cubic yards of sediment from the inlet in 2003, and applied ''a couple hundred thousand cubic yards'' more about five years later. The town is scheduled to receive more sand in December, to repair damage from Hurricane Irene last year.
He said ''the beaches did their job'' during Hurricane Sandy, saving buildings in Avalon from flood damage. The town had built a dune more than 20 feet high, adopting what he called ''an education program'' to explain the advantages of second-floor living rooms to residents whose views were blocked.
That can be a hard sell. In Harvey Cedars, on Long Beach Island, homeowners have sued for compensation over loss of ocean views because of a proposed project. The case is before the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Where artificial beaches failed to protect their communities, it was probably because ''this storm just exceeded the design conditions,'' said Dr. Herrington, of the Stevens Institute, who has been working with the state to assess coastal protection. Typically, he said, projects in New Jersey are engineered to withstand the kind of storm that on average occurs only once every 75 years.
But as the climate warms, sea levels are rising and bad storms may come more frequently. And New Jersey is particularly vulnerable because of tectonic forces and changes in ocean currents.
When the glaciers retreated about 15,000 years ago, land in the region bounced up; now it is sinking again. Meanwhile, ocean circulation patterns are changing in ways that push water up against the mid-Atlantic coast.
''We cannot sustain the shoreline in the future as we have in the past,'' said Mr. Williams, of the Geological Survey. ''Particularly from a beach nourishment standpoint.''

HEADLINE: Record Number Complete High School and College

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Although the United States no longer leads the world in educational attainment, record numbers of young Americans are completing high school, going to college and finishing college, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of newly available census data. 
This year, for the first time, a third of the nation's 25- to 29-year-olds have earned at least a bachelor's degree. That share has been slowly edging up for decades, from fewer than one-fifth of young adults in the early 1970s to 33 percent this year.
The share of high school graduates in that age group, along with the share of those with some college, have also reached record levels. This year, 90 percent were high school graduates, up from 78 percent in 1971. And 63 percent have completed some college work, up from 34 percent in 1971.
The study attributed the increase both to the recession and a sluggish jobs recovery, which led many young people to see higher education as their best option, and to changed attitudes about the importance of a college education. In a 2010 Gallup survey, about three-quarters of Americans agreed that a college education is very important, up from only 36 percent in 1978.
The wage premium for those with college degrees has leapt 40 percent since 1983, according to Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
''The demand for college graduates has been increasing about 3 percent a year, while the supply has increased only 1 percent a year, which is why the college wage premium has increased so precipitously,'' he said.
The United States was the undisputed global leader in educational attainment until 1992. But more recently, some European countries have been producing degree-holders at a higher rate -- and a faster-growing rate.
''The recent increases in the U.S. come at a time when other advanced economies are registering similar or greater gains, leading experts and college presidents to question whether the U.S. has been losing its competitive position as the global leader in higher education,'' the report said.
Over the past few years, education experts have warned that the United States had undergone a worrisome ''education reversal,'' in which older Americans are more educated than younger ones. For example, in 2007, the share of adults aged 45 to 64 who had graduated from high school or earned a bachelor's degree was slightly higher than among 25- to 29-year-olds.
But now, the report found, ''the education reversal that arose in the first decade of the 2000s has vanished or been reversed by recent improvements in the education attainment of young adults.''

HEADLINE: Service Sector Growth Eases, But Hiring Is at 7-Month High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The rate of growth in the nation's services sector slowed modestly in October, though a measure of employment improved to its highest in seven months, underscoring expectations the economic recovery will remain modest. 
The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its services index eased to 54.2 last month from 55.1 in September, shy of forecasts for 54.5, according to a Reuters survey.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
The forward-looking new orders gauge fell to 54.8 from 57.7, but the measure of employment rose to its highest since March, at 54.9 from 51.1.
The vast services sector has fared better than its manufacturing counterpart, which contracted during the summer. Still, this was the first time since June that the rate of growth in services firms had cooled.
While manufacturing has begun to grow again, the services sector is expected to remain stronger as it feels less of an impact from weaker exports.
Taken together, the two reports point to an economy that is growing at a rate of about 2 percent, analysts said, maintaining the third quarter's rate of growth and reinforcing the view that the United States is holding on to a modest recovery.
''Moderate growth in the U.S. economy continues,'' said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWide Markets in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
New export orders contracted to 47.5 from 50.5 against the backdrop of slower global growth and the euro zone's debt crisis.
Services companies in other parts of the world also had slower growth in October, separate reports showed on Monday. The rate of activity in China slipped, while Britain's sector grew at its slowest rate in almost two years.

HEADLINE: Lean Days for Hotel Deals

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
With the domestic hotel industry on the cusp of a widespread recovery, operators are breathing a sigh of relief. But business travelers who have gotten used to low rates, the ability to book at the last minute and perks like free Wi-Fi and parking are less enthusiastic.
Travel managers, too, are finding that negotiating corporate rates for 2013 is much more challenging. 
''We're going to be seeing well-above-average increases in average room rate for at least the next three to four years,'' said R. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research.
Eileen Kelly, travel liaison at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, said she had already run into the higher rates. ''It's not making my job easier,'' she said. ''It's been a buyer's market for the past three to four years.'' She said the tide was turning toward sellers, with hotel operators seeking to raise her rate by 8 to 10 percent. ''It's going to be tough this year, because it's their ballgame.''
Hotels in major cities, especially top-tier ones, have already recovered. ''There are some markets where real negotiations are going on and rates will go up as much as 10 percent,'' said Scott D. Berman, principal and United States industry leader for the hospitality and leisure practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Experts predict that this recovery will spread throughout the country next year, particularly in upscale hotels that tend to be frequented by business travelers. ''What we expect to see happen next year is kind of a continuation of what's happening this year,'' said Fred Deschamps, a vice president at Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. ''What we've seen this year is the big urban centers are pulling the U.S. market ahead. They're a freight train pulling the U.S. market along.''
Mr. Woodworth said that demand for rooms began increasing as early as 2010, shortly after the recession ended, but that the drop in travel had been so sharp that occupancy levels were only now approaching traditional norms.
As a result, outside of a handful of top markets, prices have not yet caught up to rising demand. ''Rates have not come back as fast as they have in prior cycles,'' Mr. Berman said.
But experts say the industry is approaching the tipping point for rates. According to PKF, the average hotel occupancy rate over the long term is just under 62 percent. PKF predicts that the industry will end 2012 with average occupancy of 61.4 percent, and will pass the historical average by the middle of next year.
''We literally had had a year and a half of consistent decline in lodging demand,'' Mr. Woodworth said. ''Not only was the length of it troubling, but the depth of it was damaging. What we need to have happen is for scarcity to return to the marketplace.''
Mr. Berman said that this scarcity of hotel rooms was a result of the continued reluctance of lenders to commit to new hotel construction projects. ''In this cycle, with the banks standing on the sidelines, not making as many loans as they have historically, supply growth has diminished,'' he said.
That means business travelers will find fewer rooms available, especially in major cities, Mr. Berman said. Since it takes a couple of years, at minimum, to build a full-service hotel from the ground up, ''consumers will face more sold-out nights than they have been,'' he said.
Rick Wakida, global travel manager at Atmel Corporation, which makes semiconductors, said he expected both high prices and sellouts to become more common next year for the 1,200 travelers at his company. ''In the most expensive markets, there's going to be a premium for last-room availability,'' he said. He added that he and other corporate travel managers would have to tell employees that they could no longer book at the last minute and expect rooms to be available.
Some business travelers said they had noticed prices going up already. ''I'm definitely always looking for the best deal, but I have seen that the rates have gone up,'' said Zalmi Duchman, chief executive of the Fresh Diet, a home-delivery diet company.
Mr. Duchman said his job took him on the road about three times a month. Several of his employees also travel frequently, and he has been asking them to seek out lower hotel rates. ''We're trying to penny-pinch,'' he said.
Hotels are also looking to improve their bottom lines by increasing fees for extras like Internet access, breakfast and parking. Last year, hotels in the United States collected a record $1.85 billion in fees and surcharges, according to Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. This year, that amount is forecast to grow to $1.95 billion as a result of higher occupancy and higher fees.
Adept travel managers can often negotiate to eliminate the fees, especially if the hotel is pushing for a sharp increase in the room rate.
The higher fees are more of a burden on people like Dennis Moseley-Williams, who owns a consulting firm and travels about 150 days a year. These travelers don't have the clout to bargain away extra charges.
''All the little niceties are eroding, and in general, fees are up,'' Mr. Moseley-Williams said, adding that he recently paid $38 for two days of Wi-Fi at a hotel in San Francisco. ''It's so gradual -- it's just that it's across the board.''
Mr. Woodworth said the trend was toward a seller's market. ''The number of freebies, the amount of discounting has clearly been dissipating,'' he said. ''The level of discounting on the room rate is quickly going away.''

HEADLINE: HSBC May Face Charges In a Laundering Inquiry

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG; Mark Scott reported from London, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.

 BODY:
9:28 p.m. | Updated LONDON - The British bank HSBC Holdings acknowledged on Monday that its exposure to an industrywide money laundering investigation had swelled as it disclosed that it could face criminal charges in the United States.
With its legal liabilities rising, HSBC set aside an additional $800 million to cover potential fines stemming from the case, bringing its total to $1.5 billion. The bank, which is negotiating a settlement with United States authorities, is expected to pay the largest fine on record for money laundering and related actions. 
The trouble at HSBC coincides with a widespread crackdown by federal and state authorities into the illegal movement of money. Officials are moving to choke off the supply of American dollars to drug cartels and terrorist organizations.
Regulators and prosecutors are looking into whether foreign banks failed to monitor cash transactions at their American subsidiaries, allowing drug dealers and terrorists to move tainted money. In addition to scrutinizing money laundering activities, they are also investigating whether institutions skirted rules by transferring money for nations subject to sanctions, like Iran, Sudan and North Korea.
Over the last few years, most of the cases have focused on those so-called sanction violations. The Treasury Department reached a $619 million settlement with ING Group in June over such accusations. A couple of months later, the British bank Standard Chartered agreed to pay $340 million to New York's top banking regulator, which claimed the bank had laundered hundreds of billions of dollars for Iran for nearly a decade.
HSBC faces harsher scrutiny. Besides sanction violations, prosecutors are considering criminal charges related to money laundering, according to several law enforcement officials with knowledge of the matter. It would be the first such case stemming from the broad investigation.
"A lot of banks will likely have to respond if U.S. authorities impose criminal sanctions on HSBC," said Jimmy Gurulé, an expert on money laundering practices at the University of Notre Dame. "It could send shock waves through the financial services industry."
This year, HSBC was thrust into the spotlight when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused the bank of exposing the United States "financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks." The subcommittee claimed that some bank executives had been complicit in the activity, ignoring warning signs and allowing illegal behavior to continue unchecked from 2001 to 2010.
For example, an HSBC executive pushed the firm to continue dealings with Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, even though some of the owners of the firm were linked to the financing of terrorism, according to the report. The Senate report found that HSBC's American operations had provided at least $1 billion in financing to Al Rajhi.
Senate investigators said that HSBC had also failed to effectively monitor the bulk-cash businesses in Mexico even after federal officials warned that drug cartels could harness those operations to move illegal money.
Instead of heightening security precautions in a country rife with drug crime and violence, HSBC officials assigned Mexico the bank's lowest risk rating for years, according to the Senate report. From 2007 to 2008, HSBC's Mexican businesses funneled at least $7 billion to the United States, a volume that law enforcement officials warned must have included "drug proceeds."
At Congressional hearings in July, HSBC executives apologized for any past problems and vowed reforms. David Bagley, who served as head of compliance at the British bank since 2002, announced his resignation at the hearings.
In an effort to fortify its safeguards, the bank has doubled its spending on compliance functions and revamped its oversight. In January, HSBC brought in Stuart A. Levey as chief legal officer. Mr. Levey, a former under secretary at the Treasury Department who focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, has been hashing out new internal standards for thwarting the illegal flow of money. In August, the bank hired Robert Werner, who formerly oversaw the group at the Treasury Department that enforces sanctions.
"We deeply regret what took place" in the United States and Mexico, HSBC's chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, told reporters in a conference call on Monday. "A number of people have left the bank and have had clawbacks against their compensation."
The bank's legal woes have weighed on its earnings.
On Monday, the bank announced that net profit had dropped by nearly 50 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30, to $2.8 billion, compared with $5.5 billion the previous year. Along with the additional legal provisions, HSBC added that it incurred a quarterly charge of $1.7 billion on the value of its own debt during the quarter.
Shares in HSBC fell 1.3 percent in London on Monday.
Excluding the adjustments, the bank said pretax profit in the third quarter more than doubled, to $5 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates. Despite the weak global economy, HSBC's pretax profit in its global banking and markets division, which includes its investment banking operations, more than doubled to $2.2 billion. Pretax profit at its commercial banking unit increased 16 percent, to $2.2 billion.
HSBC is benefiting in part from fast-growing markets like Asia and Latin America. While the bank reported a pretax loss in its European and North American operations, it posted a $1.8 billion pretax profit in its Hong Kong business, an increase of almost 40 percent from the third quarter of 2011.
Still, the legal problems could crimp profits for a while.
On Monday, the bank indicated that a resolution of the money laundering investigation would probably include corporate criminal and civil charges, as well as large fines. In the end, the bank, which has already set aside $1.5 billion to cover the potential fines, said its total costs could be even higher.
Mark Scott reported from London, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Spirit of America

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Four years ago, on the eve of the victory of Obama in the 2008 election, I attempted to define what America is.
It is renewal, I suggested, the place where impossible stories get written.
It is the overcoming of history, the leaving behind of war and barriers, in the name of a future freed from the vengeful clamp of memory.
It is reinvention, the absorption of one identity in something larger -- the notion that ''out of many, we are truly one.'' Americans are decent people. They're not interested in where you came from. They're interested in who you are. 
At the close of this endless campaign -- on one of those crisp, clear New York days where the glimmer of possibility seems to lurk at the tapering edge of the city's ruler-straight canyons -- it is worth recalling that America, alone among nations, is an idea; and that idea dies when hope and possibility disappear.
As a naturalized American who recalls the 1,000 faces in the room where I swore the oath of allegiance and how they mapped the world and yet shared some essential notion of humanity, I confess to the convert's zeal. I had to take a dictation back then to become a citizen. It was supposed to prove my command of English. The second sentence was, ''I plan to work very hard every day.'' So here I am writing, loneliest of tasks.
It has been a hard, uneven road from 2008. The idealism vested in America's first black president was also vested in an introverted man whose talent for the deal-making that oils the wheels of politics proved limited. Barack Obama is the least ''political'' president since Jimmy Carter.
The United States is as divided today as it was four years ago -- over economic policy, of course, but more deeply over social policy: the whole regressive God-invoking push of the Republican right against a woman's right to abortion, gay rights, marriage equality and so on.
One nation sometimes feels like two.
But even with its debt and division and uneven recovery the United States has come a long way from the abyss of 2008. Obama is a man more likely than not to make smart decisions. He's also lucky. Sandy blew in a week before the election and by the time it blew out Mittmentum was dented, Bloomberg on board and New Jersey's Republican governor cooing.
There have been big achievements: the winding down of the wars, health reform, getting Osama bin Laden, and restoring the battered American idea.
Obama has fallen short of the pledge he made in 2009 when said we ''cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.'' Drone killings have nothing to do with due process. But the country no longer inhabits the ''dark side'' of torture and rampant renditions.
By allowing gays to serve openly in the military and by signing legislation to back equal pay for equal work for women, Obama has strived to make the United States more inclusive.
America turns its back on its core ideas when it discriminates against women or on the basis of people's sexual orientation.
Romney has led a campaign that has said everything and the contrary, embracing war then peace, changing positions on Obamacare, refusing to reveal how he will offset tax cuts. He wants to deny women the right to abortion. His America, it seems, would be more unequal and divided.
Last week I wrote about the sharp divisions in the Jewish community of Cleveland, Ohio, where the Senate candidacy of a young right-wing Jewish ex-Marine named Josh Mandel has exacerbated the tensions of a close campaign where some Jews have tried hard to portray Obama as anti-Israel. Mandel, who has campaigned against the Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, is related by marriage to the influential Ratner family.
After the column a paid ad in the form of an open letter to Mandel from several members of the Ratner family appeared in the Cleveland Jewish News. It read in part:
Dear Josh, Your cousins, Ellen Ratner and Cholene Espinoza, are among the many wonderful couples whose rights you do not recognize. They were married almost eight years ago in Massachusetts, at a time when it was the only state in the nation to allow same-sex marriage. Their wedding, like yours, was a beautiful and happy occasion for all of us in our family. It hurts us that you would embrace discrimination against them.
We are equally distressed by your belief that gay men and women should not be allowed to serve openly in the military. Like you, Cholene spent many years in the armed forces.

HEADLINE: For Romney, a Way Around Pledge to Attack China's Currency

BYLINE: By NICK EDWARDS | REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney would lack the legal power to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, should he win the election Tuesday, offering him a way out of what experts say is the weakest claim on the issue in years.
The authority to make the formal accusation lies with the U.S. Treasury secretary, which could be a face-saving remedy that former U.S. officials said Mr. Romney might need. As part of his campaign to suggest President Barack Obama had been soft on the country, Mr. Romney repeatedly said he would declare China a currency manipulator.
A public slap at Beijing on his first day in the White House could carry serious consequences for both countries and the global economy, putting at risk bilateral trade -- valued in Chinese customs figures at $540 billion in 2011. 
It would almost certainly compel the new leadership in China, also set to be unveiled this month, to respond, increasing the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies -- one Mr. Romney would most likely have to fight without the support of the International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organization.
''Romney has painted himself into a bit of a corner on the currency issue,'' said David Loevinger, emerging markets managing director at the Los Angeles fund firm TCW, which he joined in June from the Treasury, where he was senior coordinator for China affairs and the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.
''If you look at the law, it is not the president that has that authority, it's the Treasury secretary,'' Mr. Loevinger said. ''And on Day 1 he is not going to have a Senate-confirmed Treasury secretary.''
That could be just as well.
A Romney White House would be applying the label to China at a time when trade imbalances are shrinking, the dollar is falling and the renminbi is rising.
''Over the last decade, this seems like the oddest moment to pick a fight with China as a currency manipulator,'' Mr. Loevinger said.
The renminbi has rallied 17 percent against the dollar in nominal terms during the past five years, and China's trade surplus as a proportion of gross domestic product has shrunk 75 percent. Foreign exchange reserves have remained largely static for 18 months, implying that the Chinese central bank has made no major intervention in the currency.
It's not the kind of evidence likely to win an argument at the W.T.O., the main global body with power to impose penalties in international trade disputes, but which experts say has never ruled in a currency case.
Spencer Griffith, managing partner in the Beijing office of the U.S. law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, has practiced international trade law for more than 20 years.
''You could go to a W.T.O. panel and try to argue that currency manipulation violates China's W.T.O. obligations,'' he said. ''My bet is that the United States would lose that case.''
A Romney White House could instead try to levy duties on China under U.S. trade law, a process that could take the Commerce Department a year and could prompt Beijing to file a complaint with the W.T.O. that such duties are invalid under W.T.O. rules -- a case that Mr. Griffith figures Beijing would be likely to win.
The dispute could drag on for years, putting two-way trade at risk, especially as the new leadership of the Chinese Communist Party would probably want to demonstrate that it is no pushover.
U.S. companies operating in China already complain about unfair competition, discrimination and barriers to entry in the Chinese market. That would be made worse if Mr. Romney initiated a protracted trade dispute.
The I.M.F., which has no obligation to respond to complaints of currency malfeasance, significantly shifted its assessment of the relative value of the renminbi in a report in July, concluding the currency was ''moderately undervalued,'' softening its previous view that the renminbi was ''substantially undervalued.''
As a medium-term analysis of the currency's dynamics, the implication is that the language may not shift again for years -- especially given the I.M.F.'s relatively stable projections for China's current account surplus to 2017.
But worse than being isolated internationally for Mr. Romney would be being seen to be out of step with his business backers and other leading Republicans.
In September, former President George W. Bush and three Republican governors participated in U.S.-China Investment Week to promote the United States as a natural home for billions of dollars of Chinese foreign direct investment to create American jobs.
Jay Riskind, managing director of global projects at PiYi Investment, a private equity firm in Beijing that helped organize the event, said concerted efforts in U.S. states to secure Chinese investment counter campaign rhetoric.
''We have seen over and over again that states are very eager to facilitate direct investment promotion efforts,'' Mr. Riskind said.
Wiggle room may be what Mr. Romney needs. Indeed, his plan to issue a presidential order on his first day in office could create that room if he merely directed the U.S. Treasury to list China as a currency manipulator in its biannual report, effectively delaying action until the report's release, set for April 15.
Mr. Romney's campaign literature says the Treasury would use the designation if China failed to bring its currency to fair value. Some academics argue the renminbi is close to that point already, based on a steady level of foreign exchange reserves, recent capital outflows and its current-account balance relative to G.D.P.
One of Mr. Romney's main economic advisers and a top candidate for Treasury secretary, R. Glenn Hubbard -- a former senior Treasury official and chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 to 2003 -- has said he does not expect the United States and China to get into a trade war.
There is plenty at stake, with analysts estimating that China could spend $2 trillion globally on foreign direct investment in the next 10 years.
Research in September from the consulting firm Rhodium Group analyzed 600 Chinese direct investment transactions in the United States between 2000 and 2012 and concluded that U.S. subsidiaries of Chinese majority-owned firms directly supported 27,000 jobs. Assuming a steady investment trend, Rhodium estimates that number would jump to between 200,000 and 400,000 by 2020.
Meanwhile, surveys of U.S. businesses by organizations like the U.S.-China Business Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in China do not rate the value of the renminbi particularly high on the list of corporate concerns. Fresh disruption to market access is among the bigger fears.
U.S. executives worried about a business backlash to a diplomatic dispute have an example playing out before them in the shape of a festering territorial dispute between China and Japan that flared into anti-Japan violence in September. After boycotts of Japanese goods by Chinese buyers, some Japanese companies, especially carmakers, report sales sinking up to 40 percent.
Kenneth Jarrett, greater China chairman of the consulting firm APCO Worldwide, said the currency manipulator label is not a China-Japan moment, but it would be damaging should it be applied.
''It could be corrosive to the bilateral relationship,'' Mr. Jarrett said. ''That's what I would see as the biggest danger.''
''The benefit of declaring the intent'' of applying the label ''is quite different to the benefit of doing so when you are sitting in the Oval Office,'' he said of Mr. Romney. ''I'm not convinced he would do it when push came to shove.''

HEADLINE: Netanyahu Says He'd Go It Alone on Striking Iran

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday reiterated his willingness to attack the Iranian nuclear program without support from Washington or the world, returning to an aggressive posture that he had largely abandoned since his United Nations speech in September.
''When David Ben-Gurion declared the foundation of the state of Israel, was it done with American approval?'' Mr. Netanyahu asked in an interview broadcast on Israel's Channel 2 on Monday night. ''When Levi Eshkol was forced to act in order to loosen the siege before 1967, was it done with the Americans' support?
''If someone sits here as the prime minister of Israel and he can't take action on matters that are cardinal to the existence of this country, its future and its security, and he is totally dependent on receiving approval from others, then he is not worthy of leading,'' Mr. Netanyahu added. ''I can make these decisions.''
Though American officials, including President Obama, have always acknowledged that Israel ultimately has the right to decide how to defend itself, Mr. Netanyahu's tough tone and timing -- on the eve of the American presidential election -- are sure to reignite rifts with Washington over how best to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. 
As has been the case over the past two years, however, it is impossible to know whether his hawkish words are harbingers of deeds or part of a strategic campaign to scare nations into increasing economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran.
''I am not eager to go to war,'' Mr. Netanyahu said in the seven-minute interview. ''I have been creating very heavy pressure, and part of this pressure comes from the knowledge some of the most powerful nations in the world have that we are serious. This isn't a show, this is not false.''
Besides the creation of diplomatic tensions if Israel were to act alone against Washington's wishes, there is a more practical concern: the Israeli military lacks the capacity to penetrate all of Iran's underground nuclear facilities, and thus could most likely only delay the potential development of a nuclear weapon by a few years. The United States has bunker-busting bombs that could do far more damage.
The interview was broadcast on ''Fact,'' a program often compared to ''60 Minutes,'' at the end of an hourlong documentary on Israeli decision making regarding Iran over the past decade. The program highlighted the opposition of Israel's own security establishment to a unilateral strike, saying that Mr. Netanyahu and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, ordered the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for an imminent operation in 2010 but were rebuffed by the chiefs of their military and international intelligence service.
Among those interviewed was Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister currently contemplating a political comeback. He accused Mr. Netanyahu of ''spitting in the face'' of Mr. Obama and ''doing anything possible to stop him from being elected president of the United States,'' a harsh critique in a country that regards safeguarding its special relationship with Washington as a sacred priority.
''What's all this talk, that we will decide alone on our fate and that we won't take anybody else into consideration?'' said Mr. Olmert, who is expected to make Mr. Netanyahu's relationship with Mr. Obama a mainstay of his campaign if he runs. ''Can someone please explain to me with which airplanes we will attack if we decide to attack alone, against the opinion of others -- airplanes that we built here in Israel? With which bombs will we bomb, bombs that we made by ourselves? With which special technologies will we do it, those that we made by ourselves or those that we received from other sources?''
But when shown a video of Mr. Olmert's retort, Mr. Netanyahu was not cowed. ''If what I just heard is that on this matter which threatens our very existence, we should just say, we should just hand the keys over to the Americans and tell them, 'You decide whether or not to destroy this project, which threatens our very existence,' well, that's one possible approach, but it's not my approach,'' he said. ''My approach is that if we can have others take care of it, or if we can get to a point where no one has to, that's fine; but if we have no choice and we find ourselves with our backs against the wall, then we will do what we have to do in order to defend ourselves.''
After years in which Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak pursued the Iranian threat in close partnership, the prime minister now seems virtually alone in his defiant stance, as other leaders attempt to distinguish their positions ahead of Israeli elections on Jan. 22. While Mr. Netanyahu said in his Sept. 27 speech at the United Nations that the critical moment for preventing Iran from developing a weapon would most likely come next spring, Mr. Barak last week pushed the timetable back further, and offered a new explanation of Israel's reduced sense of urgency.
The crux of Mr. Barak's argument, made in an interview with Britain's Daily Telegraph, was based on reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the most recent in August, showing that Iran had 189 kilograms, about 416 pounds, of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level -- from which it could relatively easily be further enriched to weapons grade. Roughly half of that was diverted to civilian use in a form that could not be easily turned into bomb fuel. But Iran has continued production and by most estimates, at current rates, would have roughly a bomb's worth by next summer.
That ''allows contemplating delaying the moment of truth by 8 to 10 months,'' Mr. Barak said.
But several high-ranking Israeli officials and analysts said that Mr. Barak's explanation was overly simplistic. While the diversion was clearly a factor, they said, it was not a new development: the nuclear agency had reported a similar transfer of enriched uranium in May, and that had hardly cooled the rhetoric of either Mr. Barak or Mr. Netanyahu through the summer. And both men have long warned of secret centrifuges that could be spinning without outside knowledge, enabling rapid replenishment of the enriched stockpile.
''Netanyahu backed away because he was getting the message that he was going too far and this could do damage, this was not helpful either to Israel or to stopping Iran,'' said Emily Landau, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. ''It might be easier for Barak to now say that it's because of the technical issue, but it's not a real issue. Relations with the United States is a much more substantial, real issue, but it's more difficult to give that as your explanation.''
Graham Allison, a Harvard professor of government who specializes in international security, called Mr. Barak's statement ''kind of a convenient excuse,'' adding that ''the reason they really blinked'' was that the prime minister was unable to convince a majority of his cabinet of the wisdom of acting alone.
''The big phenomenon here is what I've called the revolt of the Israeli security barons,'' Mr. Allison said. ''I can't think of a prior Israeli government or an analogous case anywhere where there's such a clear gap between a prime minister on one hand and his security establishment on the other.''

HEADLINE: A Trail of Clicks, Culminating in Conflict

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Washington is pushing Silicon Valley on children's privacy, and Silicon Valley is pushing back.
Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have all objected to portions of a federal effort to strengthen online privacy protections for children. In addition, media giants like Viacom and Disney, cable operators, marketing associations, technology groups and a trade group representing toy makers are arguing that the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule changes seem so onerous that, rather than enhance online protections for children, they threaten to deter companies from offering children's Web sites and services altogether.
''If adopted, the effect of these new rules would be to slow the deployment of applications that provide tremendous benefits to children, and to slow the economic growth and job creation generated by the app economy,'' Catherine A. Novelli, vice president of worldwide government affairs at Apple, wrote in comments to the agency.
But the underlying concern, for both the industry and regulators, is not so much about online products for children themselves. It is about the data collection and data mining mechanisms that facilitate digital marketing on apps and Web sites for children -- and a debate over whether these practices could put children at greater risk. 
In 1998, Congress passed the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in an effort to give parents control over the collection and dissemination of private information about their children online. The regulation, known as Coppa, requires Web site operators to obtain a parent's consent before collecting personal details, like home addresses or e-mail addresses, from children under 13.
Now, federal regulators are preparing to update that rule, arguing that it has not kept pace with advances like online behavioral advertising, a practice that uses data mining to tailor ads to people's online behavior. The F.T.C. wants to expand the types of data whose collection requires prior parental permission to include persistent ID systems, like unique device codes or customer code numbers stored in cookies, if those codes are used to track children online for advertising purposes.
The idea is to preclude companies from compiling dossiers on the online activities -- and by extension the health, socioeconomic status, race or romantic concerns -- of individual children across the Web over time.
''What children post online or search as part of their homework should not haunt them as they apply to colleges or for jobs,'' Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, said in a recent phone interview. ''YouTube should not be turned into YouTracked.''
The agency's proposals have provoked an intense reaction from some major online operators, television networks, social networks, app platforms and advertising trade groups. Some argue that the F.T.C. has overstepped its mandate in proposing to greatly expand the rule's scope.
Others say that using ID systems like customer code numbers to track children ''anonymously'' online is benign -- and that collecting information about children's online activities is necessary to deliver the ads that finance free content and services for children.
''What is the harm we are trying to prevent here?'' said Alan L. Friel, chairman of the media and technology practice at the law firm Edwards Wildman Palmer. ''We risk losing a lot of the really good educational and entertaining content if we make things too difficult for people to operate the sites or generate revenue from the sites.''
The economic issue at stake is much bigger than just the narrow children's audience. If the F.T.C. were to include customer code numbers among the information that requires a parent's consent, industry analysts say, it might someday require companies to get similar consent for a practice that represents the backbone of digital marketing and advertising -- using such code numbers to track the online activities of adults.
''Once you've said it's personal information for children that requires consent, you've set the framework for a requirement of consent to be applied to another population,'' Mr. Friel said. ''If it is personal information for someone that's 12, it doesn't cease being personal information when they are 13.''
Indeed, many of the F.T.C.'s proposed rule revisions have vocal detractors.
Take, for example, the agency's plan to require companies to get a parent's permission before collecting photographs, videos or voice recordings from children under 13. The idea makes sense to some leading privacy researchers, who say that facial recognition technology could allow strangers to identify and possibly contact children.
''Because of advances in facial recognition technology, photos are increasingly identifiable by third parties and not anonymous,'' said Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.
Children, he added, often have difficulty understanding the long-term risks of sharing intimate details like photos of themselves. ''You might get an immediate benefit from uploading a photo because you get your face close to the mascot,'' he said, referring to mascots for food and toy companies, but the cost ''comes much later.''
But the proposed regulation of children's photos could interfere with a popular marketing technique that involves encouraging children to submit photos or videos of themselves online as a way to increase their engagement with a brand. Toy makers, for one, say the F.T.C. has gone too far.
''So long as reasonable methods to assure that the photo, video or audio file, or facial recognition technology, does not include contact details, this sort of engagement does not pose a privacy risk to kids,'' Carter Keithley, president of the Toy Industry Association, wrote in comments to the F.T.C.
An agency proposal to hold sites and apps liable for the data collection practices of their third-party analytics or advertising partners has also met with fierce opposition.
The Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group representing more than 5,000 app developers, has estimated that complying with such requirements could cost educational app developers $250 million in legal fees. It could also dissuade some mom-and-pop developers, who rely on free third-party software for features like animation and social networking, from designing products for children, said Morgan Reed, the trade group's executive director.
''Children under 13 aren't enough of a market, aren't worthwhile to spend the money on compliance and tolerate the risk of getting it wrong,'' Mr. Reed said.
Facebook, which does not allow children who say they are under 13 to register as members, and Twitter, which says its service is not intended for those under 13, have criticized another F.T.C. proposal: to hold third parties liable if they know or have reason to know that they are collecting personal data on children's sites.
The social networks say they cannot keep track of the many sites that download their software plug-ins, and therefore cannot know whether they are inadvertently collecting data on children's sites. Google and Apple made a similar argument, telling regulators that app platforms like Android and the iTunes store should not be held liable for the data collection practices of the children's apps they sell.
Many children's advocates, however, have urged the agency to impose proposed revisions in full, arguing that a stricter rule is needed to give parents greater control over the many entities that track or show ads to their children online.
''Until there are some rules, marketers will continue to use what they have to penetrate children's lives,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, a professor of communications studies at American University who helped lead the effort to get Congress to pass the original children's online privacy law. ''Without constraints, it could easily get out of hand.''
Regulators, for their part, said the planned new rule should not inhibit companies from designing apps and sites for children.
''The choice they can make is not to engage with children,'' said Phyllis H. Marcus, a senior attorney in the F.T.C.'s division of advertising practices, ''or they may seek parental consent and give robust offerings.''

HEADLINE: The Real Loser: Truth

BYLINE: By KEVIN M. KRUSE. 
Kevin M. Kruse, a professor of history at Princeton, is the co-editor, most recently, of ''Fog of War: The Second World War and the Civil Rights Movement.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
THE director Steven Spielberg, whose ''Lincoln'' biopic opens Friday, recently said he hoped the film would have a ''soothing or even healing effect'' on a nation exhausted after yet another bitter and polarizing election.
But there's one line attributed to Lincoln that Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays the president, doesn't utter in the film: ''You may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can't fool all of the people all the time.'' 
The omission makes sense. Not only is the line probably apocryphal, but also, this Election Day just might demonstrate that you really can fool all of the people -- or at least enough of them -- in the time it takes to win the White House.
Venomous personal attacks and accusations of adultery, miscegenation and even bestiality are as old as the Republic. Aaron Burr was the sitting vice president when he killed Alexander Hamilton.
But while the line between fact and fiction in politics has always been fuzzy, a confluence of factors has strained our civic discourse, if it can still be called that, to the breaking point.
The economic boom and middle-class expansion of the postwar era encouraged relative deference for officials, journalists and scholars. It's true that reporters and politicians had far cozier relationships, but the slower news cycle allowed more time for verification and analysis.
Candidates accordingly believed that being caught in an outright lie could damage their careers. (As Daniel Patrick Moynihan reportedly said, ''Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.'') They tended only to bend the truth, not break it.
In 1948, President Harry S. Truman denounced Republican financiers as ''bloodsuckers'' and ''gluttons of privilege,'' but grounded his inflammatory language in the facts of Congress's legislative record. He denied his ''give 'em hell'' reputation, saying later only that ''I used to tell the truth on the Republicans, and they called it that.''
Two years later, Richard M. Nixon, running for the Senate from California, said his opponent, Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, was ''pink right down to her underwear,'' a red-baiting remark, but one that referred to statements she'd made calling for global disarmament and civil rights for women and blacks.
The brass-knuckle 1964 campaign is remembered for Lyndon B. Johnson's alarmist ''daisy ad,'' which suggested that Barry M. Goldwater's election might lead to nuclear war. But it rested on statements Goldwater had made indicating a loose attitude toward nuclear weapons. (''Lob one into the men's room in the Kremlin,'' he once joked.)
The attack ads devised by the strategist Lee Atwater for Vice President George Bush in the 1988 campaign, one of the dirtiest ever, were grounded in at least a kernel of truth. Mr. Bush's opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, might not have deserved blame for the furlough program that let Willie Horton commit additional crimes, but at least the program and prisoner were real. Atwater exploited these events, but did not invent them.
At least four factors since the 1970s have lowered the cost for politicians who lie and, more important, repeat their fabrications through their attack ads. First is the overall decline in respect for institutions and professionals of all kinds, from scientists and lawyers to journalists and civil servants.
Second are changes in media regulation and ownership. In 1985, the conservative organization Fairness in Media, backed by Senator Jesse Helms, tried to arrange a takeover of CBS and ''become Dan Rather's boss.'' It failed, but two years later conservatives set the stage for an even bigger triumph. For decades, radio and television broadcasters had been required to present multiple viewpoints on contentious public debates on the grounds that they were stewards of the public airwaves. But in 1987, members appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Federal Communications Commission abolished this ''fairness doctrine.'' The change facilitated the creation of conservative talk radio and cable outlets to combat perceived liberal bias. Liberals followed suit with programming (albeit less effective) of their own.
As this cacophony crescendoed, a third trend developed as political operatives realized they had more room to stretch the truth. In 2004, an aide to President George W. Bush dismissed a journalist for being part of a ''reality-based community'' of people who ''believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.'' But even Mr. Bush believed there were limits to truth-bending. The ads that attacked the military service of Senator John Kerry came from the ostensibly independent ''Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.'' After the ads aired, Mr. Bush belatedly called them ''bad for the system.''
A fourth factor: most news organizations (with notable exceptions) abandoned their roles as political referees. Many resorted to an atrophied style that resembled stenography more than journalism, presenting all claims as equally valid. Fact checking, once a foundation for all reporting, was now deemed the province of a specialized few.
But as this campaign has made clear, not even the dedicated fact-checkers have made much difference.
PolitiFact has chronicled 19 ''pants on fire'' lies by Mr. Romney and 7 by Mr. Obama since 2007, but Mr. Romney's whoppers have been qualitatively far worse: the ''apology tour,'' the ''government takeover of health care,'' the ''$4,000 tax hike on middle class families,'' the gutting of welfare-to-work rules, the shipment by Chrysler of jobs from Ohio to China. Said one of his pollsters, Neil Newhouse, ''We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers.''
To be sure, the Obama campaign has certainly had its own share of dissembling and distortion, including about Mr. Romney's positions on abortion and foreign aid. But nothing in it -- or in past campaigns, for that matter -- has equaled the efforts of the Romney campaign in this realm. Its fundamental disdain for facts is something wholly new.
The voters, of course, may well recoil against these cynical manipulations at the polls. But win or lose, the Romney campaign has placed a big and historic bet on the proposition that facts can be ignored, more or less, with impunity.

HEADLINE: As Decision Day Looms, Trading Seems Indecisive

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market posted slight gains in light trading on Monday ahead of the presidential election.
Uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the election has been discouraging most investors from making any big moves, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. 
National polls show President Obama and Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, locked in a tight race.
''I honestly think the markets are going to sit here and mark time,'' Mr. Frederick said. ''The markets have a tendency to trade sideways before big news events, and nothing is bigger than a presidential election.''
Mr. Frederick said he believed that no matter who wins, the stock market would most likely surge once the election is decided for the sole reason that investors will know who will be the next president.
After wavering between small gains and losses, the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 19.28 points, or 0.15 percent, at 13,112.44, on Monday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,417.26, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 17.53 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,999.66.
Apple rose $7.82, or 1.4 percent, to $584.62 after the company said it sold three million iPads in the three days after it introduced a smaller version, the Mini. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief, said the iPad Mini was ''practically sold out.''
In the bond market, interest rates fell. The 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32, to 99 17/32, while its yield fell to 1.68 percent, down from 1.72 percent late Friday.
There was only one notable economic report, a measure of activity among service companies, which employ about 90 percent of the American work force. The Institute for Supply Management's service sector index showed growth in October, but at a slower pace than in September, and just short of what economists had expected.
In Europe, a renewed focus on Greece's economic problems combined with uncertainty over the American election to push markets there lower. Germany's benchmark index, the DAX, dropped 0.5 percent, and the CAC-40 in France fell 1.3 percent.
''With the race so close, investors are understandably risk-averse today,'' said James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari, a London brokerage.
Among the stocks making big moves, Tesla Motors, the maker of rechargeable electric cars, jumped 8.9 percent after the company said it was producing enough of its Model S cars to generate operating cash flow.
Tesla now has two all-electric models on the market, the $109,000 Roadster and the new Model S. The company's stock gained $2.58, to finish at $31.50.
The investment bank KBW rose 7.2 percent after it agreed to be acquired by Stifel Financial in a $575 million deal, subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. KBW's stock leapt $1.17 to $17.47, while Stifel gained 67 cents, to $32.58.
Time Warner Cable lost 6.4 percent, the biggest drop of any company in the S.& P. 500. The giant cable television company reported earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock fell $6.24 to $91.93.

HEADLINE: Factoring Hurricane Sandy Into the Election Equation

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy.
Already, some analysts are describing the storm as an "October surprise" that allowed Mr. Obama to regain his footing after stumbling badly in the first presidential debate and struggling to get back on course. Some Republicans seem prepared to blame a potential defeat for Mitt Romney on the storm, and the embrace of Mr. Obama by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other public officials.
The theory has some appeal. The last three days of polling have brought what is almost certainly Mr. Obama's strongest run of polling since the first presidential debate in Denver. Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of battleground-state polls over the weekend. And increasingly, it is hard to find leads for Mr. Romney in national surveys - although several of them show a tie.
When the hurricane made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29, Mr. Obama's chances of winning re-election were 73 percent in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Since then, his chances have risen to 86 percent, close to his highs on the year. 
But, while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story.
Mr. Obama had already been rebounding in the polls, slowly but steadily, from his lows in early October - in contrast to a common narrative in the news media that contended, without much evidence, that Mr. Romney still had the momentum in the race.
Moreover, there are any number of alternatives to explain Mr. Obama's gains before and after the storm hit.
Mr. Obama was adjudicated the winner of the second and third presidential debates in surveys of voters who watched them.
The past month has brought a series of encouraging economic news, including strong jobs reports in October and last Friday.
The bounce in the polls that Mr. Romney received after the Denver debate may have been destined to fade in part, as polling bounces often do following political events like national conventions.
Democrats have an edge in early voting based on states that provide hard data about which party's voters have turned out to cast ballots. Some voters who were originally rejected by the likely voter models that surveys apply may now be included if they say that they have already voted.
Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been running lots of advertisements, which could have some effect, especially in the swing states.
Mr. Obama's voter-targeting operation may in fact be stronger than Mr. Romney's and may have begun to show up in the polls.
Mr. Obama's approval rating is at 49 or 50 percent in many surveys, a threshold that would ordinarily predict a narrow re-election for an incumbent.
Some elections "break" toward one or another candidate at the end as undecided voters tune in and begin to evaluate their decision.
Each of these hypotheses could merit its own article. But the point is that the causes for Mr. Obama's gain in the polls are overdetermined, meaning that there are lot of variables that might have contributed to the one result.
If I had told you in January that Mr. Obama's approval rating would have risen close to 50 percent by November, and that the unemployment rate would have dropped below 8 percent, you likely would have inferred that Mr. Obama was a favorite for re-election, with or without a hurricane and what was judged to be a strong response to it.
This is not to dismiss the effects of the hurricane entirely. But the fact that Mr. Obama's rebound in the polls has been slow and steady, rather than sudden, would lend weight to some of these other ideas, even if they make for less dramatic narratives.
Sunday's Battleground State Polls
Although the outcome of the election is not yet known, we are at the point where the polling averages in each state are pretty much locked in - and it is mostly a question of whether the actual results will approximate them, in which case Mr. Obama should claim enough electoral votes between Ohio and other states to win another term.
Given the extremely large volume of polling data that has been published in the closing days of the campaign, you should mostly be looking for cases in which there are trends apparent across several different surveys of the same state.
For example, Mr. Obama led in four separate polls of Virginia on Sunday, three of which represented improvement from the prior polls issued by the same polling firms. Virginia has moved out of the tossup category into a state that leans toward Mr. Obama; he has between a 70 and a 75 percent chance of winning it, according to the forecast model.
That represents a problem for Mr. Romney because Virginia's 13 electoral votes could potentially substitute for Ohio's 18 under many electoral configurations. If Mr. Obama were to win Virginia along with Wisconsin, Nevada and either Iowa or New Hampshire, he would have enough electoral votes even if he lost Ohio.
Mr. Obama's polls in Iowa were not as strong on Sunday as they had been earlier in the week. Increasingly, it looks as though Mr. Obama's first line of defense consists of Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada specifically, which would usually allow him to win the Electoral College on their own.
Mr. Obama's standing in Ohio seems to have drifted upward to a lead of about three points from two, reducing the risk of a polling error there.
North Carolina, where Mr. Romney led surveys on Sunday, does not appear as though it will play a central role in the electoral math.
What about that poll in Michigan, which had Mr. Romney leading by about a point?
The problem is that the polling firm, Foster McCollum White Baydoun, has had extremely Republican-leaning results (it found Mr. Romney 15 points ahead in Florida earlier this year) and shows a close race pretty much every time it polls Michigan. Other recent polls of the state do not show the same result, and the campaigns are not treating Michigan seriously as a battleground state based on their pattern of advertising expenditures and other resources.
Pennsylvania has more merit as a last-ditch tactical play for Mr. Romney - but it is another case where the characterization of the race as having tightened relies in part on a selective reading of the evidence. Between Saturday and Sunday, five polls of Pennsylvania had Mr. Obama an average of four points ahead there, and they did not show much of a trend, with Mr. Obama having led by the same amount on average in the previous editions of the same surveys.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Claim: Natural disasters can influence birthrates.

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
THE FACTS
A sociologist once remarked that a blackout can produce a boom in birthrates. When the lights go out, he said, people are left to interact with each other. 
All levity aside, there are some researchers who believe that large-scale disasters can influence birthrates. Psychologists say it comes down to attachment theory: that catastrophes, in short, have a way of driving people together and influencing major life decisions.
In a study published in The Journal of Family Psychology in 2002, researchers examined data on marriage, birth and divorce rates across South Carolina from 1975 to 1997. They found, as predicted, that in 1990, the year after Hurricane Hugo struck, marriages and births spiked in the 24 counties declared disaster areas. But so, too, did divorce rates, a finding the researchers hadn't expected.
The findings suggested, they wrote, that the life-threatening hurricane had motivated many people to take "significant action in their close relationships that altered their life course."
In another study, published in the journal Demography in 2005, a team of psychologists found that birthrates climbed in Oklahoma after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
But some studies have found evidence of a reverse phenomenon. One, published in The Journal of Population Economics in 2010, used data on hurricanes and storm advisories to look at births in 47 counties along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts from 1995 to 2001. It found that "high-severity advisories" had a significant "negative fertility effect." And a study of decades of data in Italy and Japan found similar decreases in fertility after earthquakes.
Disasters, the author argued, perhaps make people less willing to make the long-term investments required to raise a family, and disruptions in family life and loss of homes and jobs may also contribute to declines in birthrates.
THE BOTTOM LINE
There is evidence that large-scale catastrophes may influence birth and marriage rates, but in which direction is not clear.

HEADLINE: The Election Won't Solve All Puzzles

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Here comes more uncertainty.
It may sound counterintuitive, but whatever the outcome of the election - whether President Obama or Mitt Romney wins - the economy and markets are likely to face more uncertainty, not less, over the coming year.
"Uncertainty" has become the watchword over the last several years for many chief executives, politicians and economists as an explanation - or perhaps an excuse - for the economy's slow growth, for the lack of hiring by business and for the volatility in the stock market. 
"The claim is that businesses and households are uncertain about future taxes, spending levels, regulations, health care reform and interest rates. In turn, this uncertainty leads them to postpone spending on investment and consumption goods and to slow hiring, impeding the recovery," a group of professors from Stanford University and the University of Chicago wrote in a study that found "current levels of economic policy uncertainty are at extremely elevated levels compared to recent history." (The professors have created a Web site, policyuncertainty.com, where you can track the "uncertainty" levels.)
Come Wednesday morning, we should know who our president will be. But the uncertainty hardly ends there.
Almost immediately after the elections, the next big talking point on Wall Street and in Washington is going to be the now infamous "fiscal cliff," a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that was the result of a Congressional compromise reached last summer and is to take effect on Jan. 1, unless Congress finds an alternative. Some economists say the tax increases and spending cuts in the existing agreement could shave as much as 4 percent off G.D.P. if they are not renegotiated. Already, executives say that the uncertainty over the outcome of the fiscal cliff is causing them to hold back from making new investments.
But the greatest likelihood is that the fiscal cliff isn't going to be resolved soon at all -the betting line of the political cognoscenti is that no matter who wins, Congress will find a way to kick the issue down the road, perhaps as far as the fall of 2013, providing a new cloud of uncertainty over the economy.
For investors, the fiscal cliff includes a tax increase on dividends (making them the equivalent of ordinary income, on which rates could rise to as high as 39.6 percent) and capital gains (up to 20 percent from 15 percent). In a note to clients sent out on Sunday night, Goldman Sachs said that it expected the rate for both dividends and capital gains to be negotiated to 20 percent in either a second Obama term or a Romney presidency. But more important, Goldman noted that when similar tax increases were on the table in 1970 and 1986, "the S.& P. 500 posted negative returns in the December prior to implementation as investors locked in the lower rate." December, the report said, "has the second-highest average monthly return" since 1928.
Many investors have already begun selling stocks and companies in anticipation of tax increases. Speculation was rampant last week that one of the reasons for the timing of the sale of George Lucas's company, Lucasfilm, to Disney for $4.1 billion in cash and stock, was the impending changes in tax policy. (Mr. Lucas has said that he plans to donate a majority of his wealth to charity.)
Once we get past the fiscal cliff, if we do at all, there is Europe. Remember Europe? The issues in Greece and Spain have managed to stay off the front pages during the election run-up, but they have not gone away. Some economists have argued that things have gotten worse. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, who will face election in 2013, said on Monday that the fiscal crisis in Europe was likely to last at least five years. "Whoever thinks this can be fixed in one or two years is wrong," she said.
And don't forget the Middle East. That "uncertainty" for the world - and the global economy - isn't going away anytime soon either. Questions about a possible attack on Iran will persist under either candidate.
And finally, there is Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, one of the biggest uncertainties of them all. As I reported in this column two weeks ago, the greatest likelihood is that Mr. Bernanke will step down at the end of his term in early 2014 no matter who wins the election.
It's possible - though unlikely - that his departure could happen even sooner if Mr. Romney wins. Over the next year and a half, Mr. Bernanke's future as the Fed chairman will feed a sense of uncertainty among investors who have become accustomed to his easy money policies. If President Obama wins, he is likely to appoint a successor to Mr. Bernanke who is dovish on monetary policy, and more likely to keep printing money as Mr. Bernanke has, a strategy that comes with its own risks. If Mr. Romney wins, he may appoint a more hawkish chairman, a move that could create a different sense of uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve will unwind itself from Mr. Bernanke's policies.
None of these issues are new. President Obama took office facing a fiscal policy dispute that was not and probably could not be settled given the gridlock in Congress. No solution is in sight for Europe's problems. Tension in the Middle East is escalating as fast as nuclear technology. And the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is at its most opaque since the Reagan administration.
All of which shows that the comedian Jon Stewart is more on target than ever with the cheeky title of his election coverage on "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central. Carrying on a tradition, it is known as "Indecision 2012."
Update that to 2013, and it's good for another year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Early Scenes From States Up for Grabs

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
NEVADA
LAS VEGAS -- With the advantage apparently going to President Obama in early voting in Nevada, Mitt Romney's campaign has imported a 600-member volunteer army from nearby states. The group gathered on Monday morning at the Las Vegas offices of Brady Industries, a facility supply distributor. 
One volunteer was Lisa Vander, 50, of San Diego, who said she was unemployed despite an ''incredible'' résumé and blamed the current economy. ''It's really about jobs, jobs, jobs,'' said Ms. Vander, who added that she believed Mr. Romney would do more for the economy.
But the Obama campaign was also working to secure every remaining vote. At a senior housing complex named after Senator Harry Reid in downtown Las Vegas, Betty Barfield, 74, a volunteer coordinator for the Obama campaign, was sitting outside in her wheelchair. Half the residents of the complex of 100 apartments had voted early, Ms. Barfield said. She had arranged two buses to come take the remaining ones to polls on Tuesday. Almost all of them will vote for Mr. Obama, she said.
''It's really been a joy and a privilege for me,'' said Ms. Barfield, a minister who is African-American. ''I never thought I would see this and it would happen in my lifetime. I thank God for letting me live long enough.''

To the Editor:
Re ''Candidates Make Last Pleas as Legal Skirmishes Begin'' (front page, Nov. 5):
To those who choose to vote for president on Tuesday, congratulations! You have earned the right to critique your federal government for the next four years.
To those who choose not to vote for president on Tuesday, I'm sorry. You have lost your right to complain about anything -- anything -- the federal government does until the next election. 
ROBERT J. INLOW Charlottesville, Va., Nov. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''His Last Race, Win or Lose'' (front page, Nov. 5):
Justifiably or not, the Denver debate and its spin turned the election into a tight contest. On Tuesday, voters will decide that contest.
In many ways, the choice before them reflects what was presented at the debates.
President Obama offers a list of accomplishments, a steady hand in a troubled world, a calm demeanor against hate, fury and obstruction, and truthfulness.
Mitt Romney has few accomplishments of note, offers an array of inconsistent and vague promises, presents himself with a salesman's manipulative disposition and appears not to value the truth.
How Americans choose between these two very different men will say a great deal about the values Americans hold dear.
JOHN E. COLBERT Chicago, Nov. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
As a sophomore in college and a first-time voter, I am in the same predicament as every other college student: Am I going to be able to get the job I will have earned when I graduate?
By watching the presidential debates and doing my own research on the candidates, I have concluded that we need a president who will improve our economy so that America can prosper once more.
With America on the road to a balanced budget, businesses will improve and prosper and be more willing to invest, creating income so that America can fix the roads, schools, bridges and so on that need fixing.
With business investing and the available money to repair what needs repairing, there will be an increase in jobs at all levels.
You cannot spend more than you have, and everything costs money, so let's get the administration that will bring the economy to a balanced budget and bring America income and no more deficits.
Mitt Romney is the available option with the experience in business and the economy that will put America onto the road to a balanced budget.
DEANNA TUSO Hammonton, N.J., Nov. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
''The Loin King,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Nov. 4), was way off base. The parallels drawn between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, are unfounded.
Ms. Dowd asks if we know what we are getting with President Obama as he faces a second term; the answer is a resounding yes.
Unlike his opponent, the president has not vacillated on his platform. He remains steadfast in his actions and resolve to build the middle class, create jobs, improve education, provide affordable health care and protect retirement security.
To use his performance in the first presidential debate as an indication that we may not really know who he is is a significant overreach.
Let's not forget that Mr. Obama is human, and like all of us is capable of having an off day, which in no way indicates that he is depleted or undeserving of a second term.

New York Times political reporters are traveling with the presidential candidates and their running mates on the last day of campaigning before Election Day. What follows is a running diary of the day.
12:09 A.M. | A Raucous Homecoming for Ryan
MILWAUKEE - Lest he forget where he is after visiting four airplane hangars in four states across three time zones, Representative Paul D. Ryan could glance behind him at the enormous banner, "Victory in Wisconsin.''
But then, he could hardly forget he had finally arrived home. To the strains of "It's a Long Way to the Top if You Want to Rock and Roll,'' he received five minutes of raucous applause from the crowd of 2,500, his biggest response in days. He gave a bear hug to Gov. Scott Walker, who had introduced him. "Boy, it feels so good to be home,'' he exclaimed.
Standing in the middle of the crowd, his voice a mix of rasp and emotion, Mr. Ryan said, "We have traveled across this country as a family, talking with people throughout America who care so deeply about the country.'' 
He cited a list of conservative Republican leaders from Wisconsin, including the governor, Senator Ron Johnson and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "Here we are, this state, our beautiful 10 electoral votes,'' he said. "They can't take us for granted anymore.''
Yet, in presidential elections, as his audience well knew, he said, "We haven't gone Republican since 1984.'' Exhorting a crowd that needed no uplift, he started a chant of "One more day!''
"Let's prove 'em wrong!'' he said.
"I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart on behalf of my family,'' he said. "Thank you for waiting in line, thank you for taking the time, thank you for getting people to the polls ''
His words were drowned out by cheers, supporters waving flags and "Wisconsin Believes" signs with fervor.
Mr. Ryan had one more flight, a hop to his hometown of Janesville. But he wasn't quite finished campaigning. Late in the day his campaign announced that after voting Tuesday morning, he would head to Ohio and Virginia.
He will arrive in Cleveland at 11:55, shortly after Mitt Romney, for a joint appearance. He'll get to Richmond at 2:55. Then, of course, it is on to Boston.

12:02 A.M. | Emotions Run High in Last Moments on the Trail
DES MOINES - 10:30 p.m., Central time - And during the last rally, here where it all started, President Obama shed a tear.
Mr. Obama was talking before a crowd of 20,000 here, shivering in the cold. He told the story about the lady who first started the whole "fired up, ready to go" chant, in Greenwood, S.C., back in 2008.
And then, he talked about Iowa, about knocking on doors during the 2008 Democratic primaries, and sitting in living rooms here in this state, when his campaign seemed at once so improbable yet so full of hope.
And then, the tears came. The president is not one for showing emotion. He quickly wiped them away, and kept talking.
- Helene Cooper
11:22 P.M. | Back Where It All Began
DES MOINES - 10:02 p.m., Central time - The first lady, Michelle Obama, is introducing President Obama in front of the State Capitol here, where it all started back in 2008.
There are 20,000 people here, who have been standing in the cold waiting on the president for hours.
"This is a pretty emotional time for us because as you know this is the final event of my husband's campaign," Mrs. Obama says. "So we had to come here."
She vows that "tomorrow we won't stop until every last voice and every last vote is counted."
She sounds exhausted. But her voice gets stronger when she introduces "the love of my life" and her husband jogs onto the stage, giving her a 10-second-long hug.
And then its President Barack Obama's last campaign rally.
"I've come back to Iowa one more time," he says, "to ask for your vote."
- Helene Cooper
10:30 P.M. | On the Last Stop of the Night, a Familiar Face
DES MOINES - 8:59 p.m., Central time - Air Force One is wheels down in Des Moines, and President Obama alights shortly after.
This is his last stop before heading home to Chicago.
He bounds down the stairs, now clad in a sports jacket to ward off the chill. His motorcade holds on the tarmac for a few minutes, awaiting arrival of the plane with the first lady, Michelle Obama.
At 9:16 p.m., the motorcade moves a few hundred feet to the Flotus plane. Mr. Obama gets out of his car and stands at the bottom of the steps to greet, and hug, his wife.
"How you doing?" he asks her.
Two minutes later, the motorcade is rolling.

8:59 P.M. | Biden Seizes on '47 Percent' Remarks in Final Rally
RICHMOND, Va. - Closing out his campaigning at a frigid evening rally along the banks of the James River here, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told a crowd of supporters that Mitt Romney had "personally offended" him when he spoke about 47 percent of Americans, saying that the Republican presidential nominee was talking about Mr. Biden's parents and people like them.
The long campaign showed little sign of taking its toll on the 69-year-old vice president, who, wearing a brown leather jacket and alternately energetically waving his finger and fist, urged the crowd to defeat the nominees of what he characterized as an increasingly radical and reactionary Republican Party.
"This is not your father's Republican Party," Mr. Biden said. "This is not John Warner's Republican Party, and this is not Mitt Romney's father's Republican Party," he added, referring to Virginia's popular former G.O.P. senator and to George Romney, who was governor of Michigan in the 1960s.
Much of Mr. Biden's talk here, which followed a performance by John Mellencamp, an Obama-Biden supporter, tracked his familiar stump-speech lines of recent weeks. But he seemed to bear down in an unusually personal way on criticism of Mr. Romney's secretly recorded comments at a fund-raiser earlier this year. In those comments, Mr. Romney had said that there are 47 percent of Americans who "are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them."
"It personally offended me," Mr. Biden said. "Who he was talking about were my mom and dad. Who he was talking about is those seniors who worked their whole life and got social security and now aren't paying taxes on it, nor should they pay any taxes on it. The majority of those people are people who are employed, who pay with their withholding taxes, pay their property tax. They probably pay an effective tax rate more than he pays on $20 million."
Mr. Biden added, "We are determined - Barack and I - to level the playing field for the middle class. Give them a fighting chance."
The rally was Mr. Biden's last official campaign stop, though he will vote Tuesday in his home state of Delaware.

8:45 p.m. | A Big Crowd Gathers for Romney's Campaign Solo
FAIRFAX, Va. - Like President Obama (and Gov. Chris Christie), Mitt Romney had his own, admittedly casual brush with a musical legend on Monday: he name-dropped the mother of all rock groups, The Beatles.
As he surveyed the enormous crowd of at an athletic complex here, Mr. Romney appeared incredulous that they had turned out for him - and him alone. (His biggest crowd are often lured by a two-fer: Mr. Romney and a musical guest, like "Kid Rock.")
"I am overwhelmed," Mr. Romney said. "I am looking around to see if we have the Beatles here or something to have brought you but it looks like you came just for the campaign and I appreciate it."
- Michael Barbaro
7:58 P.M. | Stopping at a Campaign Office
COLUMBUS, Ohio - President Obama mades an unscheduled stop at a campaign office. Staffers and volunteers were working the phones, "Ohio for Obama" signs on the walls.
Mr. Obama walked in to cheers. "Let me say hi to everybody," he said jovially. "You guys are working hard."The president hugged and kissed some people, then paused and said: "This is the foundation of this campaign. All the ups and downs, the TV stuff doesn't matter because you guys are what make this campaign."
He then turned and hugged a woman who exclaimed: "Oh my god!"
Mr. Obama admonished a campaign worker who asked for a picture. "We're gonna do pictures with everybody...you're a field organizer, you gotta be looking out for your volunteers."Then the president sat down and began making phone calls to volunteers."This is Barack Obama, looks like I missed you, everybody's been telling me what a great job you're doing."After that phone call, he said, "I like this. This is intense right here."
He then made another call."Hi Jim. This is Barack Obama. It really is. Well listen. I heard all the doors you've been knocking on, I wanted to say thank you."
Jim must have been talking a lot because Mr. Obama listened for a long time.
A woman sitting next to the president said into her phone, "I'm sitting next to Barack Obama right now, he says hi to you!"She handed the phone to Mr. Obama, who said,"hey Gloria, keep it up!"
The woman returns to the call with Gloria: "That's right baby! He kissed me on the cheek!"

7:50 P.M. | Campaign Aides Mum on Ryan's Election Day Plans
DES MOINES, Iowa - Back in the warm months, just after Mitt Romney tapped Representative Paul D. Ryan to be his No. 2, joint appearances by the running mates drew hugely enthusiastic crowds, which were larger than those Mr. Romney alone attracted, and the senior partner visibly drew energy from his younger ticket mate.
This is now, when Mr. Romney is the one with star power for Republicans, and Mr. Ryan has been much less noticed on the national stage.
With Mr. Romney announcing he is adding two last-minute events on Election Day, visits to field offices to inspire volunteers and attract publicity, will Mr. Ryan be going along?
Aides to Mr. Ryan are not saying, at least for now. One press aide said, "You won't hear it from me.'' The travelling campaign spokesman, Michael Steel, said, "No new information yet.''
Mr. Ryan is taking a short flight home to Janesville, Wis. late tonight after his finally rally in Milwaukee rally, then plans to vote tomorrow morning. The only other event on his dance card so far is a flight to Boston for the joint election night appearance.
Stay tuned.

7:15 p.m. | Romney Makes an Entrance
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Mr. Romney's aides wanted a big entrance for his rally here on Monday night. Their time-tested strategy of driving the candidate into an airport hangar on his campaign bus didn't feel right.
The obvious solution: have Mr. Romney ride in on his campaign plane.
At 7:15 p.m., as the crowd inside a hangar here waited for the candidate to walk in the front door, a giant side gate opened, music blared and the plane began to steer its way in.
Bob White, Mr. Romney's longtime friend, took out his cell phone to record the moment. "This place is going to go crazy," Mr. White predicted. It did.
But there was a small problem. The plane's first try in brought the right wing too close to the door, so the plane backed up and attempted a second try. It worked.
As Mr. and Mrs.Romney walked off, another aide, Beth Myers, soon followed, trailing behind. She radiated a can-you-believe-we-just-did-that mirth. "That," she yelled to her campaign colleagues. "Was s-o-o-o cool."
- Michael Barbaro
7:13 P.M. | Mellencamp Warms Up the Crowd in Virginia
RICHMOND, Va. - John Mellencamp took the stage 20 minutes ago to warm up the crowd at Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s final campaign stop here at the historic Tredegar Iron Works downtown.
He began singing "Jack and Diane" by himself, playing the guitar. Then he sang "Small Town," accompanied by a guitarist and accordion player.
In between the two songs, Mr. Mellencamp told the crowd, "In one man's success, there is real hope for us all. And that's why we're all here tonight."
Then he played "The West End," introducing it as a song about "what greed can do to a country when the middle class has no place to go."
"But the middle class is going to rise up again, and the rich are going to pay their fair share," Mr. Mellencamp told the crowd, adding: "Let there be no haves and have-nots - just a level playing-field that makes everything possible, and that we can still believe in the American dream."
The song's lyrics include:
For my whole life I've lived down in the West End But it sure has changed here Since I was a kid It's worse now Look what progress did Someone lined their pockets I don't know who that is
- Richard A. Oppel Jr.
5:14 P.M. | Jay-Z, Springsteen and the President in Ohio
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Jay-Z is firing up the crowd of 15,500 here in the Nationwide Arena in a fully amped-up show.
"Ohio, will you make some noise for your president, Barack Obama!"
President Obama is on stage. "Fired up!" he begins, trying to recreate the magic of 2008. "Ready to go!"
The crowds are smaller now, but here in this swing state to end all swing states, on this last day of campaigning, there is a rainbow mix of black, white and brown. And they are all screaming.
For Bruce Springsteen, who opened the show? Yes. For Jay-Z? Definitely. For the president? Sure, him too.
The president is touting his accomplishments. Twenty minutes into his speech, when Mr. Obama mentions the name "Mitt Romney," the crowd predictably boos.
Wait for it. Here comes the line: "Don't boo. Vote!" Mr. Obama says.
Back to his accomplishments. "The war in Iraq is over," Mr. Obama says. "Al Qaeda is on the path to defeat. Osama bin Laden is dead."
Mr. Obama's voice is starting to crack now, and his church-preacher cadence is coming out.
The president is doing a slew of radio interviews Monday, his aides said, and will even appear on ESPN during "Monday Night Football" time.
"Ohio, after four years, you know me by now," Mr. Obama says. There is allowance during his talk for some of the disappointment of the last four years.
"You may be frustrated with the pace of change but that's O.K., so am I," Mr. Obama said, his voice definitely cracking now. "But you know I mean what I say and I say what I mean."
He's tie-less, with a black blazer, leaning into the podium. The blue signs that say "Forward!" dot the arena.
Mr. Obama seems to be weaving in and out of enthusiasm and emotion. One minute he is droning on with the usual stump speech - "change is turning the page on a decade of war so we can do some nation-building at home" - and the next minute he seems to remember that this is it, the last day, his last chance.
And his voice rises again. "Ohio, my bet's on you. My hope is with you. My faith is with you."
Now he's yelling. His finger goes up and down against the podium, punctuating his points. "We've come too far to turn back now we will win Ohio let's go vote!"
The voice is almost gone. But he's still got another rally to do, in Des Moines, in a few hours.
- Helene Cooper
4:35 p.m. | In Colorado, a Ryan Pep Talk
JOHNSTOWN, Colo. - Representative Paul D. Ryan's marathon fly-around included rallies in four airplane hangars in three time zones, but he also managed a visit to a truck stop here, north of Denver.
Not just any roadside attraction, it's a place called Johnson's Corner, with its own Web site with an entry for "Our Story." It has been open 24-7, 365 days a year since 1952. It serves its celebrated cinnamon rolls.
"They're like the size of your head, I'm told," Mr. Ryan said to his two young sons as he entered the restaurant in search of voters and baked goods. He ordered two dozen of the rolls, each in a plastic clamshell and swimming in a bath of icing. He held one up to his son Sam's head to show its size.
A reporter asked how Mr. Ryan felt about the election. News flash: "I feel very good about it," he said.
He climbed onto an outdoor stage flanked by red and blue Kenworth tractor-trailer cabs, chrome gleaming.
Midway through Mr. Ryan's stump speech - after he asked supporters to "vote out of love of country"' and before he recited the five-point Romney-Ryan plan - a big rig on Interstate 25 tooted its horn as it passed the rally. "I'll tell you, truckers are great," Mr. Ryan said.
He implored Coloradans to "leave it all on the field" on Election Day, to urge friends and families to go to the polls. "Let's wake up on Wednesday morning knowing we did all we could," he said.
When reporters returned to the press bus, they found a surprise on each seat: a cinnamon roll the size of, well, a salad plate.

3:15 p.m. | The President Connects the Boss With a Famous Fan
COLUMBUS, Ohio - On what is supposed to be a day focused on swing states, New Jersey continues to pop up. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, confirmed that President Obama had put Bruce Springsteen on the phone with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey while the president and the Boss were flying to Columbus from Madison, Wis., on Air Force One.
Mr. Christie, a Republican, is well known as one of the biggest Bruce fans ever, but had not gotten love from Mr. Springsteen, a die-hard Democrat, in the past. Though Mr. Christie has attended more than 100 of his concerts, Mr. Springsteen has not invited him backstage.
But in these post-hurricane days of bipartisan bonhomie between Mr. Obama and Mr. Christie, who better than the president to serve as yenta between the Boss and his fan?
Mr. Christie promptly relayed the fact of the phone call to reporters. When asked, Mr. Carney confirmed: "When Potus told the governor he had someone who wanted to speak with him, Springsteen, who was using the handset across the table from the president, said, 'Governor, this is Bruce.' "

4:17 p.m. | Ann Romney Goes to (Suburban) Washington
FAIRFAX, Va. - Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, own three homes. But just before 4 p.m. on Monday, Mrs. Romney made it known that she wouldn't mind taking up residence in a fourth.
At a rally in a suburb of Washington - home of the coveted 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue address - Mrs. Romney took the stage and posed a question to a crowd of more than 10,000.
"Are we going to be neighbors soon?" she playfully asked.
(Based on the cheering response, the answer was an unequivocal yes.)
- Ashley Parker
3:18 p.m. | Campaign Coverage of the Boss
COLUMBUS, Ohio - We interrupt this Obama campaign report with a brief side trip to the Jersey Shore.
Air Force One is wheels down here after a one-hour flight.
Instead of scrambling to watch the president alight, the reporters traveling on the plane scramble to catch a glimpse of ... Bruce Springsteen.
Penetrating questions follow.
"Was this your first time on Air Force One?"
The Boss starts grinning. He nods. "It was pretty cool," he says.
Another hard-hitting question:
"What did you talk about on the plane with President Obama?"
Mr. Springsteen, famously a New Jersey native, says they talked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Jersey Shore. "I'm feeling pretty hopeful," he says about the chances that his beloved seashore will recover.
A few minutes later, after his arrival at the campaign's Columbus event, another sharp query for Mr. Springsteen comes rocketing from the traveling press.
"Sir, have you spoken with Governor Christie since the storm?" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, is a huge Springsteen fan, but he doesn't get much love from his state's greatest export.
Times may be changing, though. "Yes," Mr. Springsteen replies. "We have."
O.K., back to the president. Seriously.
- Helene Cooper
2:44 P.M. | Romney to Hit Ohio and Pennsylvania on Election Day
DULLES, Va. - Mitt Romney, who had no plans to campaign on Election Day, has decided to travel to the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio on Tuesday.
Aides said Mr. Romney would visit campaign offices in Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Until now, his staff had said a rally in New Hampshire on Monday night would be his last event of the campaign.

2:14 P.M. | A Refreshed and Confident Biden in Virginia
STERLING, Va. - Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. finished his first campaign rally of the day about an hour ago in Sterling, Va., where he accused the Republican ticket of doing everything they could to confuse the electorate and to run away in the closing stages of the election from what he suggested were more radical and conservative positions they previously advocated.
Looking and sounding refreshed and confident, Mr. Biden spoke only about 20 minutes - shorter than a lot of his stump speeches - telling a smaller-than-usual but energized crowd that this state was crucial to the Obama-Biden campaign's re-election.
In fact, he said almost word for word the same thing he had told people at a rally in Lakewood, Ohio, on Sunday morning - except for substituting "Virginia" for "Ohio:"
"We need you, Virginia! With your help, we will win Virginia," Mr. Biden said. "We win Virginia, we win this election!"
Mr. Biden also pledged, without detailing how, that there would be 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next 10 years, "so our kids are the best in the world." He also asserted that the students of his wife, Jill, who teaches English at a community college in Virginia, "are going to hear the word 'insourcing' more than their parents heard the word 'outsourcing.'" Mr. Biden did not explain how that would happen, given the significant wage disparities between the United States and many other countries with skilled workers.
Though he was speaking in a wealthy enclave of suburban Washington, a good deal of Mr. Biden's speech sounded as if he were still in the gritty, union-heavy urban locations where he campaigned in Ohio. There, polls indicate that the $80 billion auto bailout that President Obama supported is popular and has helped buttress the Obama-Biden campaign's re-election hopes in a state that is often a battleground between the two parties.
In fact, in one of Mr. Biden's final points at his appearance in Sterling, he referred to a Romney campaign radio commercial that suggested that Chrysler and General Motors, which got federal financing during the auto bailout, were shifting work to China at the expense of American autoworkers. The ad had drawn an unusually harsh response from executives at both companies: A spokesman for G.M. called it "cynical campaign politics at its worst." Chrysler's top executive also felt compelled to e-mail his employees that it was "inaccurate to suggest" that Jeep production would be moved to China from the United States - a message that came as another Romney commercial left the impression that Jeep might shift jobs to China at the expense of domestic workers.
"Not a shred of truth to it," Mr. Biden said here, referring to the Romney advertising blitz over the auto bailout. "General Motors and Chrysler have denounced the Romney ads as untrue and a lie."
"Guys," he added, "when's the last time you've seen two major American corporations in the waning hours of the campaign go after a Republican candidate?"
- Richard A. Oppel Jr.
1:50 P.M. | Going All-In on Virginia
LYNCHBURG, Va. - Just how badly does Mitt Romney need to win Virginia?
The state's governor, Bob McDonnell, just answered that, perhaps accidentally, during a rally here when he spun through Mr. Romney's Virginia-laden schedule over the past week.
"He's spent three of the last five days of the campaign right here in Virginia," the governor said. "Paul Ryan was here all day Saturday."
Get the idea? Mr. McDonnell was not done, however.
"They've spent an immense amount of time and effort and energy on the ground to be able to tell the people of Virginia about their positive optimistic Romney-Reagan vision for the future of this great nation," Mr. McDonnell added.
- Michael Barbaro
1:18 P.M. | A Modest Crowd for Romney in Virginia
LYNCHBURG, Va. - Let us not measure Mitt Romney's electoral hopes on the size of his crowds today - or risk the wrath of his angry staff members, who eagerly blast out his overflow crowds (30,000 people Sunday night in Morrisville, Penn., on Sunday night) but are far more quiet with his smaller ones.
But it must be said: Mitt Romney's crowds, on this final day before Election Day 2012, are so far quite modest - 3,200 this morning in Sanford, Fla., and no more than a few thousand just now in Lynchburg, Va.
Of course, what actually matters is how many people show up to the polls, not how many people turn out to glimpse Mr. Romney one more time before Tuesday. And Lynchburg is an admittedly small area. ("For the size of our city, it's a good crowd," said Christine Wooldridge, of Lynchburg. "I've heard he's gotten crowds of 20,000, but that won't happen here.")
But Mr. Romney, like many politicians, feeds off his crowds. And this group of voters, halfheartedly waving flags on this sunny day, is a listless, sleepy bunch.
Mr. Romney dutifully made his way through his stump speech, but delivered all of his lines in the pitch you'd use in a boardroom, not a raucous political rally. When he asked the voters if they were "tired of being tired," he sounded pretty tired himself.
Still, his attempts at optimism were on full display as he ad-libbed this line: "It's not just the size of crowds, but this one is pretty darn impressive," he said, as if trying to convince himself.

1:16 P.M. | Obama and Romney to Appear on 'Monday Night Football'
President Obama and Mitt Romney will appear at halftime of the "Monday Night Football" game in New Orleans between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New Orleans Saints. They will answer questions - presumably somewhat more oriented to the world of sports than to Libya or auto bailouts - from the ESPN studio host, Chris Berman.
It is becoming something of a tradition the night before the election: four years ago Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain also appeared at halftime on "Monday Night Football."

12:51 P.M. | Ryan Makes a Plea to Nevada
RENO, Nev. - Under sunny skies and in the shadow of peaks already covered with snow, Representative Paul D. Ryan made Stop No. 1 on a day that will take him next to Colorado, Iowa, Ohio and, finally, a late-night rally in Milwaukee in his home state.
"We're doing a barn-burner today, we're crisscrossing the country, Mitt and I,'' Mr. Ryan told supporters in a darkened airplane hangar.
"It's kind of déjà vu, you look kind of familiar,'' Mr. Ryan said in a jocular vein. "You've seen a few of us around, haven't you? And you know why? Nevada can make the difference.''
That is possible, but Nevada looks like a tough battleground state for the Republican ticket. By some estimates, two-thirds of Nevadans have already voted. Democrats cast 44 percent of the ballots and Republicans 37 percent. It translates to a 50,000-vote margin for Democrats. A local official introducing Mr. Ryan called on Republicans to "burn down that firewall" on Tuesday. For the Republican ticket to prevail, Nevada analysts say, it would need a flood of independents breaking for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan.
As Mr. Ryan arrived late Sunday night, his motorcade passed the Democratic headquarters of the Washoe County Democrats. The lights were still on at 11:45 p.m.

12:45 p.m. | A Day of Flybys for Romney
SANFORD, Fla. - Less than 24 hours before the polls open, Mitt Romney has entered the drive-through portion of his campaign.
He spent the last year traveling to voters, crisscrossing the country and dropping into small towns and rural communities.
But on the final day, they came to him.
Three of Mr. Romney's five rallies are veritable flybys, held in airport hangars so Mr. Romney can land, jog down the steps of his private plane to the blaring thrum of Kid Rock's "Born Free," and then begin taxiing to the next city nearly as soon as he has shaken the last hand and kissed the last baby.
When Mr. Romney's plane touched down here after an 18-hour day (four events in four states) just before 1 a.m. Monday, his aides had already begun setting up for the day's rally. A "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose" sign greeted the plane, and an empty hangar waited lighted and ready for the voters who would file in just hours later.
So, what do voters think, heading to an auxiliary airport hangar to glimpse the man who they hope will be the next president?
"It's a convenient venue for him to come into and land," Greg Baker, 65, of Sorrento, Fla., said with a shrug. "And rallies are rallies."

12:28 P.M. | An Obama Supporter on Political Geography in Virginia
STERLING, Va. - An Obama-Biden supporter here, Bruce Burton, a union representative who lives in Fairfax County, explained in an interview the rough voting demographics of the state: "Virginia is reallytwo states: You have Northern Virginia, and then everything below the Rappahannock. And this part tends to be a lot more Democratic," he said, referring to the portion north of the river, which he said includes a lot more people from other parts of the country, more members of minority groups, and more federal government employees.
Mr. Burton blames the Republicans for trying to stymie Mr. Obama¹s efforts to revive the economy, and he credits the president's stimulus package for lowering the unemployment rate by a full percentage point. Citing a recent cartoon, Mr. Burton said, "For the Republicans to criticize the president for the economy is like John Wilkes Booth criticizing Abraham Lincoln for missing the second act of the play." He added: "Or Lucy pulling the football out and then blaming Charlie Brown because he missed." Senator Jim Webb of Virgnia is now warming up the crowd for former governor Tim Kaine, the Democrat who is running to replace him.

12:16 P.M. | Springsteen Rallies the Crowd in Madison
MADISON, Wis. - Bruce Springsteen is introducing President Obama. "This is a song called 'Land of Hope and Dreams,'" he said, as he begins the familiar opening chords of his millennium anthem.
The crowd of 18,000 is bundled up in front of the state Capitol, and the American flag is waving in the background. Mr. Springsteen is acoustic. Atop a crane, David Plouffe, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs stand, hands in pockets, watching the Boss as he stumps for their boss.
The song ends, and the president jogs onto the stage, engulfing Mr. Springsteen in a huge bear hug.
Reporters, who had been atop giant cranes themselves to get a better view of Mr. Springsteen, hastily scramble down to take notes as Mr. Obama begins his stump speech.
It's hard to hear, and Mr. Obama, who has been drinking hot tea to help his throat during the final campaign slog, already sounds hoarse. "Our fight goes on," he says. He describes his vision of an America where "everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same rules, that's why you elected me in 2008 and that's why I'm running for a second term!"
The crowd is chanting: "Four more years! Four more years!"
- Helene Cooper
12:04 P.M. | A Rock Concert Atmosphere at Biden Rallies
STERLING, Va. - At Vice President Jospher R. Biden Jr.'s rallies, the aides like to play loud, loud music before and after, so booming that it is hard to interview the people there. Right now it's one of the campaign's favorites: "Roll With the Changes" by REO Speedwagon. "Oh, you got to learn to, got to learn to, got to learn to roll. ..."
- Richard A. Oppel Jr.
11:55 a.m. | Casual Monday in Madison
MADISON, Wis. - There's a Casual Friday feel in the lobby of the Sheraton Madison. Robert Gibbs and David Plouffe are in jeans, Mr. Gibbs in grungy-looking sneakers. Valerie Jarrett is not. David Axelrod and Reggie Love didn't get the jeans memo either. Nor Ben Rhodes nor Jay Carney. Jen Psaki is all in black.
It's a beautiful bright and chilly day. As the motorcade began rolling to the event, we were told, a crowd of 18,000 awaited.
The president arrived as Bruce Springsteen was playing an acoustic version of "Promise Land."

11:51 A.M. | A Delivery Four Decades in the Making
SANFORD, Fla. - An air of unfinished family business has always hovered around the Romney campaign, from the George Romney posters in his Boston headquarters to the way both Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, reverentially speak of Mr. Romney's father, the late three-term governor of Michigan.
And on Monday, just after 10 a.m. here, the generations of Romney men made their presence felt yet again.
Mr. Romney emerged onstage at his first rally of the day wearing a purple striped tie, courtesy of his older brother Scott. Scott has had the tie for years, and last night, when Mr. Romney saw it, he told his older brother he was in need of new neck ware.
"Can I add that to my rotation he asked?" (Yes, came the reply).
After the rally, a supporter approached Mr. Romney as he shook hands, and handed him a Ziploc bag containing six blue Romney pins from 1968, when Mr. Romney's father ran for president.
He had been holding onto the pins, waiting for just the right moment to give them to Mr. Romney. And less than 24-hours before Election Day - and more than four decades after George Romney's bid - he finally found his chance.

11:23 a.m. | The Bidens on the Ground in Virginia
STERLING, Va. - Hundreds of people are already waiting at the Heritage Farm Museum at Claude Moore Park here for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s first scheduled campaign event of the day, a rally with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden.
The Bidens flew to Washington last night after a three-stop swing in Ohio - perhaps the most critical battleground state this election, with 18 electoral votes - where Mr. Biden declared: "We need Ohio, we need you. We win Ohio, we win this election."
But the Obama-Biden campaign also needs Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. And so the 69-year-old vice president is spending the final day of the campaign in Virginia, ending with an evening rally in Richmond where John Mellencamp will perform. The state's Democratic Senators - Jim Webb and Mark Warner - and the former Democratic governor, Tim Kaine, are expected to attend both events, according to the Obama-Biden campaign.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr.
9:10 a.m. | Voices of Voters for Romney
SANFORD, Fla. - On the final day of campaigning, voters are at their most energized, their voices crying out during Mr. Romney's speeches with expressions of support and fury.
But what exactly are they shouting?
Here is a sampling:
"Help us take back our country!"
"We want Mitt."
"Fire Obama!"
"Unacceptable!"
"He's a loser!" (Obama)
"Keystone, pipeline!"
"We love you, Ann!" (Mr. Romney's wife)
"One more day! One more day!"
"45! 45! 45!" (Mr. Romney would be the 45th president)
"Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!"
- Michael Barbaro
10:15 a.m. | The Traveling Press and the Traveling Press Secretary
SANFORD, Fla. - It is a fitting coda to the frequently distant and contentious relationship between the reporters that travel with Mr. Romney and his campaign's traveling press secretary, Rick Gorka.
On Monday morning, the reporters yelled in unison for Mr. Gorka to walk to the back of the plane to answer questions, something he has done less and less over time.
He did so, warily, and sparingly.
REPORTER: What is the mood inside the campaign?
GORKA: "We are an economic campaign. Streamlining government. We feel great."
REPORTER: Is Mr. Romney planning a surprise rally in Ohio on Election Day, as we have heard?GORKA: "We'll advise his official schedule. And if there is anything beyond that, we will update you."
REPORTER: You said tonight's rally is his "final" rally? Is that accurate anymore?
GORKA: "We will have an official schedule we will announce."
And so it went, most questions bouncing back half-answered.
Until, suddenly, the questions and answers become rather warm and playful. Both sides seemed to realize the limitations of their long relationship, and to embrace it.A reporter asked Mr. Gorka to provide running, behind the scenes details about Mr. Romney's day on Tuesday, including his "last meal."
"He is going to live beyond Tuesday," Mr. Gorka deadpanned, drawing laughter.
A reporter pointed out that if Mr. Romney did have a last-minute rally on Tuesday, despite a widely reported schedule that said he would not, members of the news media would "have egg all over our faces."
To which Mr. Gorka replied dryly: "We don't want that."
Asked about his own mood on the final full day of campaigning, Mr. Gorka was reflective.
"I am sitting here. I am enjoying it. I know I have Patron underneath this plane to help me get through this day if I need to."
At that, Charlie Pearce, a campaign staffer, stalked Mr. Gorka from behind, walked down the plane's center aisle and placed a Philadelphia Eagle's helmet over Mr. Gorka's head.
The press laughed. Mr. Gorka laughed.
"Luckily there is nothing in here to be concussed," he said, pointing to the helmet.
"Now," he added, "I am ready for my close up."
- Michael Barbaro
9:30 a.m. | The Boss on The Plane
MADISON, Wis. - Call it Air Force Born to Run.
Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki electrifies the press corps traveling with President Obama when she informs them that Bruce Springsteen will join President Obama on the presidential 747 on Monday for the last day of campaigning. The Boss, who will be performing at not one but three rallies Monday for Mr. Obama, will fly with thepresident from Madison to Columbus.
Stay tuned.
- Helene Cooper
8:45 a.m. | Crossed Signals on Economic Messaging
SANFORD, Fla. - Even on the final day of a presidential campaign, signals can become crossed. At a rally here, the Republican governor of Florida, Rick Scott, introduced Mr. Romney, whose message of economic turmoil under President Obama is central to his quest for the White House.
Mr. Scott did not seem to be playing ball.
"Guess what?" he asked the crowd in an airport hangar. "The biggest drop in unemployment in the country is in our great state of Florida."
Mr. Romney did not repeat that line when he took the stage.
- Michael Barbaro
8:36 a.m. | Obama Begins Three-State Swing in Wisconsin
MADISON, Wis. - President Obama began his last day of campaigning here in a state that almost every Democratic model for an Obama victory assumes will be in his column. But with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin on the Republican ticket, the president is taking no chances.
After this weekend's marathon crisscrossing of every swing state, Mr. Obama's schedule on Monday looked almost tame by comparison. Even so, he was to hit three states before heading to sweet home Chicago for the night.
After the rally planned for Monday morning in this college town, Mr. Obama will return one last time to the swing state of all swing states for a rally in Columbus, Ohio. The president has been holding on to a small lead in the polls in Ohio, and his campaign aides believe that if he wins the state, he will win the election. Unless, that is, Mr. Romney manages to sweep all the other swing states, or turn a blue state - Mr. Romney planted a flag in Pennsylvania on Sunday - red.
After Ohio, Michelle Obama will join her husband for one last rally where the two like to insist that it all started - Des Moines. Mr. Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 catapulted his candidacy from also-ran to front-runner in the Democratic primaries, and the Obamas talk often about how much they loved tramping around in the snow in Iowa and hanging out with butter cows and whatnot at the Iowa State Fair.
In recent days, the president has been joined onstage by Democratic bigwigs. Former President Bill Clinton was with him on Sunday in New Hampshire, and Mr. Clinton will be on the road for him again on Monday in Pennsylvania, lest that state get its head turned by its new suitor, Mr. Romney.
In Florida, with its crucial Latino vote, Mr. Obama also got a lift on Sunday from Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop artist.
But that is nothing compared to the firepower coming out for the president on Monday. The Obama campaign is hauling out its biggest weapon for dragging blue-collar white voters to the polls: Bruce Springsteen.
He is joining Mr. Obama at all three stops on Monday - Madison, Wis.; Columbus, Ohio; and Des Moines. And lest anyone forget the African-American vote, Jay-Z will also be joining the president in Columbus.
In Des Moines, Mrs. Obama will be onstage with her husband, to talk about the good old days.
Then the president and the first lady will head back to their hometown, Chicago, where they are planning to spend Election Day.

HEADLINE: G-20 Leaders Urge Balance For Growth

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Finance officials meeting here Monday from the world's largest economies warned that efforts to deal with debt troubles in Europe and the United States must be balanced with actions to spur the global economy.
The meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 countries came as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast that the euro zone economies would endure a third year of recession in 2014. 
But over the past six months concern over economic risk has spread from the focus on the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis to a wider array of problems, including Washington's political stalemate over its persistent deficits, Japan's debt burden and slowing growth in China and other emerging markets.
''The economic context remains difficult, and the fragile recovery remains at risk if the needed policy actions are not implemented,'' said the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, at the end of the two-day meeting.
Ms. Lagarde listed several countries and regions where she said policy makers needed to act quickly, beginning with the United States ''first and foremost,'' where a $600 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff are to take effect on Jan. 1.
Analysts fear that if the measures go into effect as planned, the United States economy could tip into recession, dragging global growth down with it.
Europe ''remains a challenge,'' Ms. Lagarde continued, and Japan needs to take action on its debt. ''It is my impression over the last few days that the membership has shared a sense of urgency,'' she added.
Striking the balance between reining in deficits without harming growth was the principal theme at the meeting here.
While the final communiqué contained a pledge that the group's members ''ensure our public finances are on sustainable paths,'' it also opened up space for countries to adjust their budgets to support recovery.
''We have weak growth and high risk,'' Finance Minister Felipe Larrain of Chile said of the global economy. Chile attended the talks as an observer. ''This is a very delicate equilibrium.''
''There is nothing more important to the global economy than to lift growth in the world's major advanced economies,'' the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, said in a prepared statement released by Reuters.
As expected, the meeting, which took place just before the presidential election in the United States and as China begins its leadership transition, produced no major decisions, Indeed, several important players skipped the meeting, among them Timothy F. Geithner, the American Treasury secretary, and Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president.
With recession and weak growth in Europe and the United States, emerging markets will account for much of the world's forecast growth of 3.6 percent next year. For their part, though, officials in developing countries are concerned about monetary easing in advanced economies that can push up their exchange rates, making their exports more expensive.
The meeting turned attention to a 2010 pledge the group's members made in Toronto to halve their deficits by the end of next year. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble of Germany told the group that Germany and the euro zone as a whole were on track to meeting those targets. Other countries, including the United States, are much further off, though.
In response to the concerns about the approaching fiscal cliff, the final communiqué included a commitment from the United States to ''carefully calibrate the pace of fiscal tightening.''
Ministers also discussed financial industry regulation. A series of measures, known as Basel III, intended to shore up banks' capital reserves to protect against future financial crises are supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1. But several countries, including the United States, the European Union and Britain, are unlikely to meet the deadline.
Mr. Schäuble and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne of Britain called for international cooperation on harmonizing corporate tax collection, leading a drive by several G-20 countries, including the United States. Larger multinational companies have been able to take advantage of e-commerce to lower their tax burdens by shifting their profits to lower-tax countries, the ministers said.

HEADLINE: The Battle for the Senate

 BODY:
For Republicans intent on unraveling President Obama's accomplishments, electing Mitt Romney has been only one part of the equation. Almost as important was installing a Republican majority in the United States Senate, where 50 votes (plus the vice president) would be necessary to repeal much of health care reform, roll back tax increases on the rich and gut social welfare programs. 
The party's hopes, however, have been severely damaged in recent weeks. Republican candidates who are crucial to regaining a majority in the Senate have tumbled, according to a variety of polls, and Democrats are now considered likely to retain control. The reason for this is clear: Primary voters chose several unappealing or ideologically driven candidates who repelled general-election voters once they began speaking their minds.
In a country facing enormous economic and international challenges, for example, it is stunning that two Midwestern Democrats are leading their races solely because their Republican opponents explained in shocking detail why they oppose a rape exception to a ban on abortion. Neither Richard Mourdock of Indiana nor Representative Todd Akin of Missouri felt any need to hold back, because their beliefs are central to why they were nominated.
Mr. Akin, who is running against Senator Claire McCaskill, has long opposed abortion in all cases, and, in August, he announced that it was not really an issue because, in cases of ''legitimate rape,'' the female body shuts down the conception process. Mr. Mourdock, who is running against Representative Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, said last month that pregnancy resulting from rape was ''something that God intended to happen.'' Both candidates could still win in their conservative states, but, for now, their insensitive rigidity has left them behind.
In Wisconsin, Representative Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, has benefited from the comments of her opponent, former Gov. Tommy Thompson. He said he would come up with programs ''to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.'' Josh Mandel, a Republican who is challenging Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, has a tissue-thin résumé and no fixed position on a variety of issues. In Florida, Representative Connie Mack IV, a Republican who is challenging Senator Bill Nelson, has been crippled by revelations that he did marketing work on behalf of Hooter's and has a history of barroom brawling and road rage.
Republicans in two relatively liberal northeastern states are fighting a huge Democratic headwind stirred up by the presidential race. Most polls in Massachusetts have shown Senator Scott Brown either tied with his Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Warren, or behind. (Ms. Warren's solid agenda on behalf of consumers and against economic inequality has won her enthusiastic support.) In Connecticut, Linda McMahon's enormously expensive, self-financed Republican campaign has not bought her a lead in the polls against Representative Christopher Murphy, so now she is committing a laughable party heresy by urging voters to support both her and Mr. Obama.
The House is likely to remain in Republican hands, so keeping Democrats in control of the Senate is the best way to fight off savage budget cuts like those endorsed by Mr. Romney and Representative Paul Ryan. That effort has been made a lot easier by Republican Senate candidates displaying their true colors.

HEADLINE: As China Awaits New Leadership, Liberals Look to a Provincial Party Chief

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- As the once-a-decade tussle over how to fill seats in the Communist Party's supreme ruling body enters its final days, many of the nation's beleaguered liberals are casting an anxious gaze southward to Guangdong Province in the hope that the top official of this booming export hub near Hong Kong might win a coveted spot in the central leadership.
Although his prospects have dimmed in recent weeks, Wang Yang, the provincial party boss who has cultivated a following by denouncing ''entrenched interests'' and promoting individual happiness over party perquisites, remains the reformist camp's best candidate for counterbalancing the slate of colorless technocrats and conservatives who are likely to dominate the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee that runs China.
But anxiety among Mr. Wang's followers has been heightened by the impending retirement of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, whose frequent pronouncements on democracy endeared him to liberal dreamers, even if his words proved to be largely empty talk during his 10 years in office. 
''Wang Yang has become the main receptacle for the expectations and hopes of China's reformers,'' said Xiao Bin, a public affairs professor at Sun Yat-sen University here in Guangzhou, the provincial capital.
Even if he is something of a political chameleon, Mr. Wang has become a torchbearer for advocates of free-market economics and quasi-enlightened governance, much the way his former rival Bo Xilai, the fallen party chief of Chongqing in southwest China, had been championed by the neo-leftists who crave a return of Mao-style populism.
With Mr. Bo having been deposed in a salacious murder and adultery scandal, Mr. Wang stands as one of the country's few charismatic political figures.
''There's always a degree of maneuvering over who may or may not be promoted to Standing Committee positions, but I can't recall a time when we've been so focused on the prospects of one person,'' said Joseph Fewsmith, an expert on Chinese politics at Boston University.
For a variety of reasons, the Standing Committee, currently run by nine men, will probably be reduced to seven seats during the coming party congress, which begins on Thursday. With two spots already occupied by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who are set to become president and prime minister respectively, Communist Party power brokers, including retired President Jiang Zemin, 86, are in the throes of a secretive political dance to decide on the remaining handful of seats.
Even though he is considered unlikely to make it to the inner sanctum this time, party insiders say that Mr. Wang, 57, will play an important role in the next government, perhaps as a vice premier, and that he is an odds-on favorite to ascend to the Standing Committee during the next round of retirements in 2017.
A lifelong party stalwart and a current member of the 25-seat Politburo, Mr. Wang would not be mistaken for a Western-style liberal. He does not call for free elections, and he rarely strays far from the agenda set by Beijing. But at a time when the party apparatus has embraced a clenched-fist approach to news media censorship, rural unrest and demands for social justice, Mr. Wang stands out for his paeans to political liberalization and the virtues of American-style individualism.
''We should eradicate the wrong concept that happiness is a benevolent gift from the party and the government,'' he said this year.
Known for his cherubic smile and a refusal to follow the pack of party elders who dye their graying hair jet black, Mr. Wang, the son of a laborer, is fond of folksy sound bites that sometimes take aim at the party elite. Since his appointment as Guangdong's party chief in 2007, he has called on provincial officials to publicly reveal their assets and ordered government departments to communicate with the public via Sina Weibo, China's wildly popular microblog platform.
In June, after one of several recent visits to Singapore, he returned home to extol the city-state's soft-glove approach to authoritarian rule. ''If China doesn't reform,'' he said, ''we will be slow boiled like frogs.''
When he was faced with an insurrection last year in the fishing village of Wukan, Mr. Wang displayed a knack for coolheaded crisis management: he called off the riot police, tossed out Wukan's corrupt party officials and allowed villagers to elect a new slate of leaders.
Mr. Wang is often mentioned in the same breath as Mr. Bo, who also managed -- at least for a while -- to navigate the narrow space between party establishment and political maverick. Their jousting took the form of a debate over economic policy, expressed most notably in cryptic talk about cake -- as a metaphor for China's wealth. Mr. Bo argued for cutting up the cake and distributing it more equally; Mr. Wang insisted on first making the cake bigger.
With their forceful personal styles and flair for self-promotion, both Mr. Wang and Mr. Bo are controversial figures within a party that expects its leaders to be wooden apparatchiks.
Mr. Wang's office declined to make him available for an interview. But party insiders who have followed his career, which includes his unremarkable stint as the party boss of Chongqing, say his reformist credentials are overblown. He has repeatedly tacked away from the expectations of bolder change that he himself encouraged, and even die-hard supporters admit that his vows to fight corruption, reduce the power of vested interests and increase government transparency have had, at best, mixed results.
''The thunder is loud, but the rain has been rather light,'' said Mr. Xiao, the academic, who nonetheless counts himself an admirer.
Some of Mr. Wang's boldest ideas -- like shifting Guangdong's dependence on cheap exports to innovative and environmentally friendly industries -- came to naught. Meanwhile, critics say, he has used an iron glove during the past year in a cynical attempt to burnish his appeal to the leaders up north who will decide his political future.
He initiated an aggressive anticorruption drive that resulted in scores of arrests, and, more ominously, tightened censorship rules ahead of the party congress. And his decision to solve the Wukan impasse through peaceful means appears to have been a one-shot gesture, say activists who point to a spate of recent protests over illegal land grabs that ended in violence.
Political analysts suggest that Mr. Wang simply adapted to the more liberal ethos of Guangdong, which is heavily influenced by Hong Kong, the former British colony that enjoys a measure of self-rule. Long a magnet for millions of rural migrants drawn to the region's factories, Guangdong, with its 100 million people, is a weather vane for the social and economic pressures bearing down on China.
In the early 1980s, the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, and his allies promoted China's successful experiment with the free market here. And Mr. Deng returned in 1992 to symbolically swat back the party conservatives who threatened his reforms.
''People here are proud of Guangdong's progressive streak,'' said Ding Li, a senior researcher at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences. ''We are also happy to be far away from Beijing -- and the least controlled by it.''
In addition to a few pilot projects that reduced red tape and shrank an unwieldy bureaucracy, Mr. Wang's most notable accomplishment was to ease the restrictions that hobble nongovernmental organizations in much of China.
The changes have led to a flowering of local civil society groups, but the reforms appear to have come with some caveats. In Shenzhen, labor rights advocates say they have been dogged by local officials who object to their work and who they say forced seven such groups out of their offices.
''His words sound sweet to the ears, but they are hollow,'' Guo Feixiong, 46, a human rights advocate who recently emerged from a five-year prison term, said of Mr. Wang.
If Mr. Wang does not make it onto the Standing Committee, some analysts say, it will be an indication of the waning influence of departing President Hu Jintao as well as Mr. Wen, who has been one of his most vocal supporters.
Mr. Wang's rise may well be hamstrung as well by his relative youth. If elevated now, he could serve three five-year terms on the Standing Committee, which, apparently in the minds of some party elders, would allow him to amass too much power.
For the moment, members of China's urban intelligentsia and the disenfranchised farmers who see him as their champion have been left to fret and speculate. Many, like Liu Zhengqing, 48, a rights lawyer in Guangdong, are fully aware that Mr. Wang may simply be a political pragmatist dressed as a liberal.
''I admit that Wang Yang isn't a great reformer,'' Mr. Liu said, ''but considering the other leaders out there, he is the best hope we have.''

HEADLINE: A Widow at the Polls

BYLINE: BETH GOLDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: The importance of voting was impressed on a poll worker by a remark from one woman whose husband had recently died. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
Presidential elections always get me riled up - and eight years ago I was really energized. I wanted to participate in some way, so I volunteered to work at the polls. (Plus I was unemployed and it paid $200 for the day!)
I was assigned to work at my own West Village polling center. All the voters who came to my table seemed genuinely excited to vote. No exception was a mother and her adult daughter who arrived together. Each signed the roll book, one under the other. The mother then told me that her husband, whose name was listed just below her own, could be removed from the rolls: he had died just a week earlier.
 Stunned, I expressed how sorry I was.
"Oh, don't be" she instructed. "He already voted absentee."

HEADLINE: The Big Barrier Question

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: After a devastating storm, the question is front and center: Should New York City armor itself with steel and concrete at a cost of billions of dollars? 

 BODY:
As the storm chugged toward the Eastern Seaboard at 3 p.m. on Oct. 27, an engineering crew in Stamford, Conn., was at the ready. It was time.
With the click of a computer mouse, machinery on the seafloor groaned into action and a gate swung up from the deep, snapping into place high above the waves in Long Island Sound.
Two days later, when stormwaters from Hurricane Sandy ripped through the coast of the tristate area, much of Stamford, a city of 124,000, sat secure behind a 17-foot-high barrier that easily blocked an 11-foot surge.
The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the barrier system, completed in 1969, helped prevent an estimated $25 million in damage to factories, businesses and homes.
"It was extremely effective in protecting areas that would have been flooded completely by this storm," Mayor Michael Pavia said. "It made all the difference in the world."
The technology of movable sea barriers, from Stamford's modest flap gate to London's mighty 10-gate system in the Thames, has long intrigued engineers and planners contemplating a solution for low-lying areas of New York City. The hope is that such a system could someday block surges from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor.
Now, in the aftermath of a devastating storm, the question is front and center: should New York armor itself with steel and concrete at a cost of billions of dollars?

Experts whose barrier designs and studies from a 2009 conference were issued on Monday in book form argue that anything short of sea gates is a Band-Aid approach.
Even since the storm passed through, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has remained publicly wary of the barrier proposal, saying he is not sure the gates would work well enough to justify the cost. Yet it is clear that his administration's view is evolving.
Jeroen Aerts, a researcher from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands who was hired by the city in 2009 to assess flood risks and protections, said that New York officials initially preferred to focus on cheaper and less intrusive options like flood-proofing buildings and expanding wetlands to absorb more water.
The assumption, he said, was that unlike New Orleans, New York is far enough above sea level and skilled enough at evacuations that it could prevent a major loss of life.
The turning point was Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011, which mostly skirted the city but pummeled other coastal areas of the state.
After the storm, the mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability asked Dr. Aerts, a geographer and expert on water risk management and climate, to compare the costs and benefits of barriers with smaller-scale changes like building levees around sewage treatment plants and elevating subway stations.
Dr. Aerts, who is to present a draft of his findings at the end of January, estimates that any barrier system would cost $10 billion to $17 billion depending on the model used. The city would need another $10 billion to $12 billion to shore up the areas on the sides of the barriers, he added.
Still, he said, the city should still consider building them.
Brian Colle, a professor of atmospheric science who is part of the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook University, contends that barriers would have made a big difference when the storm pounded the area last week.
If gates had been placed in strategic spots like the mouth of the Arthur Kill between Staten Island and New Jersey, he said, they would have protected some of the areas that were swamped by floodwaters, including the edges of Lower Manhattan, low-lying areas of Brooklyn and Queens and the western part of Staten Island as well as Jersey City and Hoboken.
"The idea is that you raise these barriers, and anywhere inside of that you're basically protected," Dr. Colle said, adding, "With a solid barrier, we basically can have business as usual in Lower Manhattan."
But vexing questions remain. Would industries tolerate immense disruption from barrier construction in the city's busy waterways? Would residents object to the marring of historic vistas? With climate change advancing, can scientists accurately predict the size of hurricanes that the sea gates will one day have to withstand? (London officials already deem the Thames Barrier inadequate for future risks.)
And where would the $10 billion-plus in construction money come from? Even a study itself - taking into account the complexity of New York waterways, sea level rise projections and other factors - would take years and millions of dollars.
City officials have pressed for a feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers but that would require Congressional authorization and funding.
The scientists and engineers who have worked on conceptual designs for the city say that a comprehensive study is needed on the most effective locations and the most practical type - whether barriers that swing close like a driveway gate or pivot up from the ocean floor, for example.
"A lot of things need to be taken into consideration before we throw up a giant wall," said Chris Gardner, a spokesman for the Army Corps.
Beyond the enormous potential cost, there is no question that there are drawbacks to sea barriers. A barrier that blocks the surge on one side will cause water levels to rise close to a foot on the other, potentially worsening flooding in other areas, depending on wind and currents.
"You could have about 20 percent more water on the other side of the barrier," Dr. Colle cautioned.
What is more, pollution from the runoff of stormwater mixed with sewage would be trapped behind a barrier, with nowhere to go while the sea gate is closed.
There is also considerable concern about the environmental costs of disrupting tidal flows and salinity for fish and other aquatic life by building a permanent infrastructure at the mouth of New York Harbor and in the metropolitan area's rivers.
"The harbor, the Hudson, the Hackensack and Raritan Rivers, Arthur Kill all have thriving ecosystems that benefit us economically and in terms of recreation," said Paul Gallay, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper. "We understand everything needs to be on the table dealing with the new normal, but storm surge barriers may end up doing more harm than good."
In Stamford, where a hurricane barrier was built at a cost of $14.5 million, it took experience with deadly storms - most notably, devastating hurricanes in 1944, 1954 and 1955 - to make the investment. It has been used hundreds of times for both storms and high tides.
Sandy, some skeptics argue, was not bad enough for barriers to become part of the preventive mix in New York.
"People won't accept these dramatic changes to the environment," said Philip Orton, a storm surge research scientist with the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. "I don't think we've had our big disaster where hundreds of people die to make this palatable. But it certainly will change the debate."

HEADLINE: U.S. Fuel Economy Is at All-Time High, Researchers Say

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: New cars and light trucks sold in the United States in October have the highest average fuel economy ever recorded on American vehicles - 24.1 mpg combined. 

 BODY:
University of Michigan researchers said Monday that new cars and light trucks sold in the United States in October had the highest average fuel economy ever recorded on American vehicles - 24.1 mpg combined.
Michael Sivak, one of the researchers, said in a telephone interview that new vehicle sales showed a four mile-per-gallon gain from October 2007 to October 2012, an improvement of about 20 percent.
Mr. Sivak and his colleague at Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, Brandon Schoettle, have tracked data from 1923 to show a largely stagnant fuel economy trend from that time until about 1973, when the Arab oil embargo caused gasoline shortages. That data was published last July in the journal Transport Policy. "Technology improvements were used to add power and acceleration for 50 years, and it's only after that time that we see sharp increases in fuel economy," Mr. Sivak said. The average on-road fuel economy of all vehicles in 1923 was 14 m.p.g., the report said, compared with 17.4 m.p.g. as recently as 2008.
Historical fuel economy figures were attained by dividing the amount of fuel used for road transportation by vehicle miles traveled. More recent mileage information comes from Environmental Protection Agency data as used on window stickers.
"This is great news for consumers and the environment," Luke Tonachel, a senior analyst in the transportation program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an e-mail. "New cars being sold today make up the greenest car fleet ever, and we can look forward to even cleaner cars as fuel-efficiency standards continue to ramp up. If new cars had the efficiency of 2007 models, drivers would be spending another $8 billion a year at the pump."
Fuel economy varies widely across the vehicle fleet. According to the Transport Policy article, the average 2011 model year car has 38 percent better fuel economy (23.7 m.p.g. combined) than a pickup truck from the same year (17.2 m.p.g. combined). The best car, it said, is nine times more fuel efficient than the worst car, and the best pickup twice as fuel efficient as the worst.
The article also showed that driving a car uses about twice as many B.T.U.'s of energy per occupant mile as taking an Amtrak train on the same trip. Flying also reduces energy use compared with driving, but not by as much. The comparisons take into account the average number of passengers in a car and the average load in planes and trains.
Mr. Sivak and Mr. Schoettle also publish a national Eco-Driving Index that estimates average monthly greenhouse gas emissions per American driver, based on fuel economy and per-capita distance driven. The monthly index was unchanged in August, reflecting the most current data available, but has declined 19 percent over all since October 2007.

HEADLINE: Restructurings and the Impact of Credit-Default Swaps

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: A disclosure requirement might be one way to address the "empty creditor" problem that comes up in times of financial distress. 

 BODY:
Last week we learned that one of the biggest critics of derivatives - Warren E. Buffett - actually made a lot of money from them.
This is kind of indicative of the general reality: no matter how much has changed with regard to derivatives after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, much remains the same.
Take, for example, the issue of credit-default swaps and financial distress. Before the financial crisis, bankruptcy scholars, including myself andothers, noticed that the growth of these swaps had the potential tochange the way restructurings were conducted.
 While it is normally assumed that creditors are interested in keeping a solvent but financially distressed company out of bankruptcy and are therefore willing to renegotiate out of court, a hedged creditor may lack the incentive to participate in an out-of-court workout. 
In extreme cases, creditors might have incentives to thwart workouts and file involuntary bankruptcy cases, all with an eye toward activating their default swap contracts. This problem could be especially extreme in North America, where, for historical reasons, "restructuring" is often not included as a credit event in standard default swap contracts.
It is also possible that the holder of a large, speculative swap position could acquire a position in a distressed firm's traded debt to block a potential workout. After the onset of financial distress, it could be that the cost of such a blocking position on the distressed debt market would be justified given a sufficiently large credit-default swap position. 
Indeed, if the market for credit-default swaps is made up mostly of speculators,as seems likely, the above situation, or something like it, might be the most plausible. After all, it is unclear how many buyers of credit-default swaps actually use them to hedge ordinary bonds.
This is part of the phenomenon called the "empty creditor" problem by Professors Henry T.C. Hu and Bernard S. Black.
Dodd-Frank did not even attempt to address this issue, so how might be that be accomplished?
In a paper to appear in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, co-written with Rajesh P. Narayanan of Louisiana State University, I argue that one good starting point might be the Williams Act.
In particular, the Williams Act requires shareholders to disclose large (5 percent or more) equity positions in companies.
Perhaps holders of default swap positions should face a similar requirement. Namely, when a triggering event occurs, a holder of swap contracts with a notional value beyond 5 percent of the reference entity's outstanding public debt would have to disclose their entire credit-default swap position.
In the paper, Mr. Narayanan and I suggest that such a disclosure obligation could kick in at the onset of financial distress, when it becomes most useful to understand the incentives of parties to workout negotiations. One clear indicator of financial distress that could be used is the issuance of a going concern qualification by the firm's auditors. 
To our minds, this represents one workable solution to the challenges that credit-default swap contracts create for resolution of financial distress.

HEADLINE: Why Climate Disasters Might Not Boost Public Engagement on Climate Change

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A climate communication analyst warns that Hurricane Sandy may not be a useful tool for engaging communities on the greenhouse challenge. 

 BODY:
There has been an intense rush to use Hurricane Sandy as a teachable moment to focus the public (and politicians) on the risks of an unabated buildup of greenhouse gases and resulting global warming. The climate campaigner Dan Miller epitomized that approach in a discussion here last week.
But it's important, always, to consider the other contexts to events, however dramatic, in judging whether they provide a real opportunity for engagement on the momentous challenge of getting the carbon out of the world's energy system. (This is a very different task than girding communities against climate-related risks.)
George Marshall, an expert on climate and communication, has just done that, in an important, if sobering, essay weighing the climate discourse around Hurricane Sandy against what he learned in recent interviews with a variety of people in Bastrop County, Texas, the suburban-exurban region east of Austin that experienced a stunning outbreak of wildfires in September 2011.
It would be hard to find someone more concerned about human-driven climate change and more involved in pursuing and assessing ways to get traction on curbing greenhouse gas emissions than Marshall. After many years of working at Greenpeace and other environmental and indigenous-rights groups, he founded Britain's Climate Outreach and Information Network and has also helped develop Talking Climate, an online "gateway to research on climate change communication."
I became familiar with Marshall's work through the Garrison Institute's annual meetings on "Climate, Mind and Behavior" (there's a great related reading list here). He was one of many speakers (see the video here) and was particularly engaging (see a glowing review by Dan Kahan of Yale's Cultural Cognition Project.) 
A couple of days ago, Marshall contributed an important note in an e-mail conversation about the "Frankenstorm" and global warming, involving many participants in past Garrison Institute meetings. I asked him if I could post his thoughts here. Marshall helpfully fleshed out his note into an essay. Here's a long excerpt (posted with permission), followed by a link to the full piece on his blog.
In the wake of extreme heat, droughts, and Hurricane Sandy, many people are assuming that, at last, there may be the critical mass of extreme weather events that will tip public opinion towards action on climate change.
This is based on the long held assumption that extreme climate events will increase awareness and concern - and this would seem logical considering that climate change suffers as an issue from distance and a consequent lack of salience.
I have heard many scientists, including the former UK chief scientific adviser Sir David King, go further and argue that real public and political attention requires such events. Climate change campaigners are already building their public communications around this assumption (for example a viral campaign 'advert' contrasts Romney's ludicrous nomination speech with Sandy).
However this assumption deserves to be challenged. Climate change awareness is complex and strongly mediated by socially constructed attitudes. I suggest that there are some countervailing conditions - especially in the early stages of climate impacts. It is important to recognize that many of the social and cultural obstacles to belief are not removed by major impacts and may, indeed, be reinforced.
A few weeks ago I was in Texas interviewing people in Bastrop where, in 2011, the worst fires in Texas history (by a tenfold margin) destroyed 1,700 homes. The fires were directly related to the extreme drought and record breaking temperatures that struck central Texas in 2011. Causal links are always hard, but even the state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon (who surely has one of the hardest jobs in climate science) made a cautious connectionbetween climate change, the drought and the fires. I did six interviews in Bastrop: with the mayor, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, the editor of the local newspaper and with three people who had lost everything they owned in the fires.
It was very interesting that not one of them could recall any conversation about anthropogenic climate change in relation to the fires. The mayor, who said he accepted climate science, found that there was little interest or willingness among people to make this connection and it seems he felt it politic not to push it.
People did note that there was a change in the weather and most anticipated that the drought and fires could happen again. But they weren't really interested in talking about this- what they really wanted to talk about was their pride in their community, the value of their social relations, their resilience and their personal and collective capacity to overcome challenges. They had recovered remarkably fast and the local economy had grown (boosted by government recovery grants and insurance payments). The county is doing very well and continues to grow- incredibly, after entirely repeatable wildfires incinerated the homes of a third of the residents, it is said to be the fourth fastest growing county in the US.
I would argue that the responses in Bastrop are entirely consistent with what we know about the way that people respond socially and cognitively to disasters and climate change.
 Disasters can reinforce social networks (and with them established norms and worldviews) 
In disasters, especially in areas with strong communities, people tend to pull together and show a remarkable and inspiring sense of collective purpose. This is nicely reflected in Rebecca Solnit's excellent book, a Paradise Built in Hell
We know, though, that attitudes to climate change are strongly correlated with political and ideological worldviews (see for examplethe work of Dan Kahan and the Cultural Cognition Project ). We can therefore anticipate that a stronger cultural cohesion could make it even harder for ideas that challenge existing worldviews to be voiced or accepted- creating even further obstacles for the acceptance of climate change in societies that are currently skeptical.
And we could anticipate that extreme events might also reinforce existing concern in places that are already disposed to accept climate change. It will also be very interesting to see how Hurricane Sandy affects attitudes to climate change of both people inside and outside affected areas. Given than attitudes to climate change are often held as part of a political identity, we cannot be surprised if people in a politically left leaning area (and much of the affected area is strongly Democrat) are prepared to ascribe extreme weather events to climate change. But this will not, of itself, be evidence that extreme events changes attitudes.
 Disasters can increase social confidence and certainty. 
Accepting anthropogenic climate change requires a high degree of self-criticism and even self-doubt. It requires a preparedness to accept personal responsibility for collective errors and for entire societies to accept the need for major collective change. And, inevitably, this process of acceptance would generate intense debate and conflict.
Disasters may very well do the opposite and provide proof of the worth of the existing social system- including the existing worldview and lifestyle. The spirit of pulling together and moving on generates a consensus to suppress divisive issues and support the existing society. Areas of contention or disagreement are likely to be suppressed in the interests of social cohesion or out of respect to people who have offered kindness and generosity. After all, if your current society and economic model has served you well in a crisis you are surely less willing to accept change.
We could say, for historical comparison, that the transition of Germany from a dictatorship to a successful social democracy required the self doubt and introspection that came with defeat. Britain and the U.S. won the war and with it a correspondingly inflated view of their own global authority that lasts to this day.
 Disasters encourage powerful and compelling survival narratives (that can overwhelm weaker and more complex climate change narratives). 
People's view of the world (and their place in it) is shaped through narratives. Social groups seek to negotiate shared narratives that are simple, appealing and reinforce shared values. In so doing they will reject or marginalize competing narratives that might challenge their current worldview. (For example just look at the competition ofinterpretive narratives around Thanksgiving ! ).
So a complex and challenging narrative will have a very hard time being accepted as social truth when it is competing against strong, appealing and highly coherent narrative. In the case of Bastrop the weak narrative is that the fires were caused (in part) by weather conditions which were caused (in part) by climate change which was caused (in part) by the culture and behavior of Bastrop residents.
It's a hard one to sell at the best of times, and a disaster is the very worst condition for this narrative because it is overwhelmed by a much more attractive story: "we support each other, we are surrounded by evidence of our love and kindness, we are tough, we faced a huge challenge and we won through and we can do it again." This does not just speak to local pride, but the much larger mythology of frontier town Texas.
And there are other powerful narratives waiting in the wings. In other disasters the most powerful narrative can be one of blame- of the people who started a fire (leading at times to the demonization of a supposed arsonist), the government who did not build the flood defenses, the construction companies who broke building codes, or the emergency services who failed to do their job.
These may well be valid arguments, but they also generate an enemy and victim frame which is far more compelling that anything offered by climate change. "It's their fault and I demand action against them and restitution" is a much more compelling story than "it may be my fault or our fault and I demand that we work together to change the way we live." The fatal flaw of the climate change narrative is that, uniquely among our major problems, it has no clear enemy at all.
There's much more, so I urge you to click and read the rest at his blog, Climate Change Denial. As I told him yesterday, I was glad to see him frame denial far more broadly than those using "denier" as a label for anyone rejecting the science pointing to greenhouse-driven dangers. I noted: "As I've written, there's been a lot of denial on a lot of fronts. I'm guilty of being in denial over the reality that better information doesn't necessarily change people.
Marshall told me he is researching a book on humans' "complex psychological relationship to climate change and why we still find it so hard to accept it and take action." I look forward to reading the book, which sounds like it will build nicely on Mike Hulme's invaluable book "Why We Disagree About Climate Change: Understanding Controversy, Inaction and Opportunity."

HEADLINE: More on Tax Rates and Growth

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: A 2011 study served as a foundation to a more recent Congressional Research Service report that drew Republican criticism. 

 BODY:
In his Daily Economist post this week, Bruce Bartlett writes about a September study on taxes and economic growth by Thomas Hungerford for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Mr. Hungerford's conclusion that changes in the top statutory tax rate and the capital gains rate had no discernible effect on growth was at odds with a central tenet of conservative economic theory, and the study was withdrawn after Congressional Republicans raised concerns about methodology and wording. 
Mr. Bartlett notes that an earlier report on the topic for the research service, by Jane G. Gravelle and Donald J. Marples in December 2011, laid a foundation upon which Mr. Hungerford built. Distinguishing between tax rate cuts intended as short-term stimulus measures and those intended as the basis for long-term growth, the 2011 study says that in the long run, "a review of statistical evidence suggests that both labor supply and savings and investment are relatively insensitive to tax rates."

HEADLINE: The Clashing Globalisms of West 29th Street

BYLINE: THE STAFF


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at the people involved in the curious economy of this Manhattan street. 

 BODY:
Though Adam Davidson covers the entire planet in his column (It's the Economy), he often draws lessons from what may be the greatest economics laboratory in the world, New York City. He has investigated the struggles of mom-and-pop businesses by exploring his native Greenwich Village, analyzed the phenomenon of urban revival by asking whether why the Bronx is not more like Brooklyn and scrutinized the luxury market by focusing on the fact that local tailors who create $4,000 suits are not rich themselves.
This week, Davidson travels just 11 blocks from the New York Times Building to West 29th Street, where high and low versions of the global economy - a booming boutique hotel catering to information workers and purveyors of mass-market trinkets - coexist, in ways that are both a little awkward and very naturally urban.
Here, Gabrielle Plucknette, a member of our staff and a photographer, gives us a closer look at some of the people involved.

HEADLINE: Trivial Stakes

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Things only a nerd could care about. 

 BODY:
No, not the election as a whole -- the stakes are huge: whether near-universal health care finally comes to America, whether we get any kind of tightening of financial regulation after the bankers destroyed the world economy. But there are a couple of trivial things I probably shouldn't care about given the really important stuff, but can't help thinking about.
One is the battle of the nerds versus the traditional pundits. The outpouring of Hate for Nate has been awesome to watch; much of it is coming from the right, but a fair bit also from mainstream pundits who rely on their ineffable sense of "momentum" or whatever rather than polls. 
Obviously I side, professionally and temperamentally, with the nerds here -- not just Nate Silver, but Sam Wang, Drew Linzer, Pollster, and more. I'd like to think I'd be on their side even if the numbers were pointing the other way. 
The point is that relying on data rather than hunches is my style; I'd hate, professionally, to see the voices in the air people get this right, simply because the polls were wrong.
The other trivial stake involves economic analysis. I've written a lot about freshwater versus saltwater, but that's not on the ballot today. What is on the ballot, sort of, is the attempt by a number of Romniaceconomists -- economists who have a basically saltwater, Keynesian view of macroeconomics -- to deny that there's anything special about economies trying to recover from a severe financial crisis that pushes monetary policy up against the zero lower bound, to insist that if only Obama weren't looking at business funny we'd be having a recovery just like the recovery from the Fed-induced recession of 1981-2.
This seems to me to be an obviously cynical move; basically, I think these guys have to know better, since their own textbooks should at the very least tell them that the zero bound matters a lot. And I'd hate to see this kind of cynicism rewarded.
Trivial stuff compared with the tens of millions who will have to live -- and, in a number of cases, die -- without health insurance if the polls are wrong. But I never said that I'm free from petty motivations.

 BODY:
President Obama was elected to a second term. Times reporters around the country shared scenes from polling places, analysis, voters' portraits and more. 
 2:18 A.M. | That's a Wrap 
Barack Hussein Obama was re-elected president of the United States on Tuesday, overcoming powerful economic headwinds, a lock-step resistance to his agenda by Republicans in Congress and an unprecedented torrent of advertising as a divided nation voted to give him more time. 
The candidates have given their speeches and gone home, and we're heading home, too. Be sure to check back on nytimes.com and The Caucus for continuing coverage. Thanks for following along.

 1:00 A.M. | Romney Concedes 
Mitt Romney conceded the presidential race to President Obama, telling his supporters that he had wished his rival well during a telephone call moments before coming onto a stage at his Boston headquarters.
"This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation," Mr. Romney said.
In very brief remarks delivered just before 1 a.m., Mr. Romney stressed the need for the country to come together to face the challenges that still face the nation's leaders.
"We look to Democrats and Republicans in government at all levels to put the people before politics," he said. "I believe in America. I believe in the people of America."
Mr. Romney thanked his family and his supporters and said he would pray for Mr. Obama to be successful. But he expressed sadness about not having the opportunity to lead.
"Paul and I have left everything on the field," he said, referring to his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. "We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish I had been able to fulfill your hopes."
Transcript of Mr. Romney's speech.
- Michael D. Shear 
 0:37 A.M. | In New Hampshire, Disappointment Hits Close to Home 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - In an evening of painful blows, Mitt Romney's defeat in New Hampshire came as a particularly hard knock.
The Live Free or Die state may carry only four electoral votes, but it is where Mr. Romney had kicked off his presidential campaign 16 months ago, and it is a state he frequently talks about as if it were his own. But President Obama exceeded most polls and defeated Mr. Romney here, 53.2 percent to 45.5 percent.
A short time after that result was announced, the networks began projecting that Mr. Obama had won the electoral vote and secured re-election. Mr. Obama's supporters jumped up and down and embraced as they watched the news on a big screen television set up in a ballroom at the Raddison Hotel here. The song "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" blared, and supporters danced and screamed.
Supporters had also broken out in song when news that the Granite State had tipped in Mr. Obama's favor was announced, with a full-throated version of "Walking in Obama Wonderland," a take on a popular soccer chant in Britain (and the other Manchester).
Diana Maldonado, a 24-year-old Obama volunteer, had worried that a Romney victory would affect her health care and student loans. She became teary when the results came in. "We did it," she said hugging a friend who wore a "Latinos for Obama" shirt.
The mood at both the Romney and Obama camps was optimistic throughout Tuesday. New Hampshire has a notoriously independent streak and votes in large numbers in often unpredictable ways. By many accounts turnout was more than 70 percent on Tuesday, thanks in part to sunny and seasonable weather.
"We thought the work people put in here would help, but this is even better than we expected," said James M. Demers, a Concord resident and a co-chairman of Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He said Mr. Romney's comment at a closed-door fund-raiser that 47 percent of Americans pay no income taxes and consider themselves "victims" put New Hampshire, and the country, over the edge for Mr. Obama. "That really turned the state's independent voters off," Mr. Demers said.
"I just couldn't trust him," said Harold Fink, a 69-year-old member of the National Association of Letter Carriers. "He just wrote off half the people," he said of Mr. Romney's 47 percent comment.
Pat Furano, a 66-year-old retired teacher from Londonderry, said she felt positive but "you never know" with New Hampshire. She said her daughter recently married her partner, and she worried that same-sex marriage would be banned under a Romney presidency. "It feels wonderful," Ms.Furano said of Mr. Obama's re-election.
Even as Dan Forbes, a 58-year-old from Barrington, celebrated Mr. Obama's victory, he worried about the divisive mood in the country. "

 0:18 A.M. | Ballots Still to Be Counted in Miami-Dade County 
One of the closest battleground states yet to be decided is Florida, where President Obama leads Mitt Romney - with 96 percent of precincts reporting - by roughly half a percentage point. Read more on FiveThirtyEight...
- Micah Cohen 
 0:14 A.M. | Romney Supporters Voice Frustration 
BOSTON - Now that the electoral tide has turned against Mitt Romney, the crowd here at the campaign's election night party has turned against CNN.
Every time the network is turned on, audience members at the Boston Convention Center chant for a change of channel. "Fox! Fox! Fox!" they yell.
When Candy Crowley appeared on a screen moments ago, around midnight, the audience tried to drown her out, screaming the name of its rival network and waving miniature flags.
The Romney campaign's slogan is "Believe in America." But so far, the mantra here is "Turn On Fox"
- Michael Barbaro 
 0:10 A.M. | Obama Wins Virginia and Second Term 
President Obama narrowly won Virginia over Mitt Romney, giving him at least 270 electoral votes, enough to win the presidency for another four years, The New York Times projects.
The race remains too close to call in Ohio and Florida. But with the addition of Virginia's 13 electoral votes, as well as those of Colorado and Nevada, Mr. Obama has at least 285 electoral votes.
The Virginia race was always one of the closest in the nation and one that both camps said they needed to win in order to succeed in the presidential election.
Mr. Romney made a big push in Virginia's coal country and in the areas near Norfolk, where there is one of the nation's largest naval bases. He also pushed hard in the state's rural counties.
But Mr. Obama won the state's populous suburbs outside Washington, where minorities have been increasingly moving in the last decade. The president also pushed hard for the support of women in the state, arguing that Mr. Romney would take the country backward on issues that are especially important to women.
- Michael D. Shear 
 12:04 A.M. | On Fox News, Rove Second-Guesses Fox News on Ohio 
Karl Rove was incredulous. His colleagues at the Fox News decision desk had called Ohio - and the election - for President Obama, a move he insisted just a few minutes earlier would be premature.
"We've got to be careful about calling this when we have 991 votes separating the candidates," he scolded them. "I'd be very cautious about intruding into this process."
Silence settled over the set.
"That's awkward," Megyn Kelly quipped. And she and her co-anchor, Bret Baier, offered to broker something of a compromise. They would interview the decision desk about why it made its call.
And so ensued the most bizarre on-air encounter of election night: a network anchor putting her colleagues on the spot, forcing them to defend their news judgment.

 11:54 P.M. | Obama Defeats ... Bieber? 
And the results for the Twitter contest are also in. 
This tweet sent by President Obama's campaign moments after learning of his re-election...
Four more years. twitter.com/BarackObama/st
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 7, 2012
... has now overtaken what is likely the most-retweeted tweet of 2012 so far, by Justin Bieber.
RIP Avalanna. i love you
- Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) September 26, 2012
Mr. Bieber's message referred to a 6-year-old fan, Avalanna Routh, who died of cancer.
In other Twitter news, with 20 million messages about the election sent so far today, Nov. 6, 2012, just became the most tweeted about political event in the six-year history of the service, Andrew Fitzgerald, the manager of editorial programming at Twitter, said. On Election Day in 2008, by comparison, just 1.8 million Twitter messages were sent in total. 
While this record is unsurprising given the overall rise of Twitter during the past four years, it shows a tangible picture of the service's growth. Today, there are approximately 140 million active Twitter users, said Mr. Fitzgerald, while in 2008, according to surveys conducted that year, active users of the service numbered fewer than five million. 
President Obama, who joined Twitter in 2007 and has made social media a cornerstone of his administration and re-election campaign, has 22 million followers, while Governor Romney, a Twitter user since 2009, has 1.7 million followers.

 11:42 P.M. | The Scene at Romney Headquarters 
BOSTON - Around 11:15 p.m., a young man cupped his hands to his mouth - half in prayer and half in shock. 
Fox News had just called Ohio for President Obama, bringing a deafening silence to the ballroom at Mitt Romney's election night party at the Boston Convention Center and - if the results hold - bringing an effective end to Mr. Romney's presidential hopes.
"Essentially, Barack Obama is re-elected," the host said.
A tour around the room, still only half full, found people in various stages of mourning. 
John Kubik, a donor from Orlando, Fla., pecked away at his iPhone, sending a text message to a friend with the news: "They just called Ohio for Obama."
Asked how he felt, Mr. Kubik pulled no punches. "Horrible," he said. "I've despised Obama from the election. He's an arrogant Communist."
He added: "I felt he would win. I felt it would be closer."
Romney staff members, meanwhile, huddled in the back of the room, talking in hushed tones and turning their backs when photographers tried to snap their wrung-out expressions. They had always known the race would be tough, they said, but they had at least expected it to be close. "Iowa by 10," moaned one, wondering how Mr. Romney had lost the state by such a large margin.
At one point, Karl Rove appeared on Fox News and said that the call was premature. A half-hearted cheer went up in the room. But moments later, Mr. Romney's press pool - a small group of reporters that follows all of his movements - arrived at the party.
The staff had moved the reporters from the Westin, where Mr. Romney was waiting with his family, to the ballroom. The implication: Mr. Romney is getting ready to give a speech, and it's not likely to be the victory one he had hoped.

 11:28 P.M. | The Crowd Goes Wild 
CHICAGO - When NBC projected President Obama had been re-elected at 10:12 p.m. Central, the convention floor here at McCormick Place exploded. It is bedlam here.
- Helene Cooper 
 11:25 P.M. | Obama Re-elected, Networks Project 
President Obama has won re-election to a second term, according to projections by several television networks.
The president's official Twitter account quickly posted a message: "This happened because of you. Thank you."
CBS News, CNN and NBC News all projected that Mr. Obama would defeat Mitt Romney after concluding that he would win the necessary 270 electoral votes.
The decision gives Mr. Obama another four years to put in place policies that he had argued would continue to move the country along to economic recovery.
Mr. Romney and Republicans had implored the country to change course, saying that the president had failed to turn the economy around quickly enough.
The president's victory was hard-scrabble and nowhere near as easy as it appeared to be four years ago. But an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising and voter turnout efforts gave him the win.
Mr. Romney's campaign closed strong, coming extremely close in the final weeks, after a listless debate performance by the president and an increase in Mr. Romney's favorable ratings among independent voters.
- Michael D. Shear 
 11:23 P.M. | Celebration at Warren Headquarters 
BOSTON - The Warren campaign victory party - no doubt one of the biggest and happiest redoubts of Democratic supporters in the country Tuesday night - exploded with cheers and shouts of joy when Mr. Obama was projected the winner by television networks. 
"Yes we can!" they chanted, "Yes we can!" 
Several supporters of Elizabeth Warren, among thousands gathered in a ballroom at the Fairmont Copley Plaza hotel, started dancing.

 11:16 P.M. | Kaine Wins in Virginia Senate Race 
Tim Kaine, the Democratic former governor of Virginia and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee under President Obama, was elected on Tuesday to the United States Senate.
George Allen, the former Republican senator from the state, conceded to Mr. Kaine after one of the most closely watched and negative Senate races, according to multiple news reports.
Mr. Allen had hoped to reclaim the seat he once held in the Senate. He lost the seat in 2006 to the Democrat Jim Webb. Mr. Webb decided to retire after one term, paving the way for Mr. Kaine's campaign.
From the beginning, Mr. Allen portrayed Mr. Kaine as a liberal who is close to Mr. Obama and would raise taxes if he got a chance to serve in the Senate. In the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Allen also accused Mr. Kaine of supporting a Congressional deal to cut defense spending, hoping that would scare voters in parts of the state where many military voters live.
Mr. Kaine portrayed Mr. Allen as out of step with the burgeoning suburban communities in Northern Virginia, especially when it comes to issues of importance to women.
The race was a marquee one from the start, in part because of Mr. Kaine's closeness to the president and the assumption that the race would be very close.
It stayed true to form for much of the year, with polls suggesting repeatedly that the race was virtually tied. It quickly became one of the most expensive races in the country, with third-party groups pouring money into the state, especially on behalf of Mr. Allen.
But in the end, Mr. Kaine won in a state that is rapidly changing. The suburbs near Washington are becoming much less white and tend to vote Democratic. That helped Mr. Kaine and hurt Mr. Allen's chances of redemption.
Mr. Allen's fall from grace began six years ago, after he called a young man of Indian descent "macaca." A video of the comment went viral and helped to doom his re-election campaign. Mr. Webb won by a narrow margin.
At the time, Mr. Allen vowed to bide his time, and he spent the next six years planning his attempt to reclaim his seat. On Tuesday, that effort failed.
- Michael D. Shear 
 11:13 P.M. | West Coast Returns Cheer Chicago Crowd 
CHICAGO - The West Coast returns begin to come in, and as CNN shows President Obama surging ahead of Mr. Romney in the Electoral College tally the crowd here goes wild. 
Was this a surprise? Not even close, but that's how highly strung and nervous people are. California, Washington State and Hawaii go into the blue column, eliciting a standing ovation. 
But still, no projection yet from the big three: Virginia, Florida and those Buckeyes in Ohio.

 11:11 P.M. | McCaskill Wins Missouri Senate Race 
Claire McCaskill, once considered the most endangered incumbent in the Senate, won re-election Tuesday, beating the Republican Representative Todd Akin, who sank his campaign when he said women who were victims of "legitimate rape" would not get pregnant.
Republicans had considered Ms. McCaskill's seat in their pocket earlier this year as they mapped out a path to control of the Senate. Missouri was trending Republican, and her votes for President Obama's health care law and stimulus plan were considered insurmountable obstacles to a second term.
Then came Mr. Akin, the most conservative of three candidates vying in a Republican primary to compete with Ms. McCaskill in the general election. Republicans in Washington considered him the weakest of the three, a poor fund-raiser prone to voicing positions too far to the right even for conservative Missouri. But his conservatism helped him secure the nomination, especially when Ms. McCaskill ran a last-minute round of ads declaring him too conservative, ads that featured diatribes against President Obama that were clearly appealing to the Republican primary electorate.
Just weeks after his victory, Mr. Akin uttered a now-infamous explanation for his opposition to abortion even in the case of rape: "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down," he said.
In the ensuing uproar, the National Republican Senatorial Committee begged him to leave the race, vowing to not help finance his campaign. American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, the deep-pocketed Republican groups co-founded by Karl Rove, declared they would not finance his run either.
But backed by Christian conservatives, Mr. Akin stayed in the race, running on little money but a conviction that Missouri Republicans would rally around him as a bulwark of opposition to President Obama. They didn't.
With more than a third of the state reporting, Ms. McCaskill was cruising to victory, 11 percentage points ahead of her rival.

The differences between national polls, which often showed a very tight race for the popular vote, and polls of swing states, where President Obama usually maintained an advantage, were a source of intrigue this year. It could be that Mitt Romney's performance in strongly red-leaning states, which were sparsely polled this year, accounts for much of the difference, allowing him to rack up votes without helping himself in the Electoral College.

 10:44 P.M. | At Obama Headquarters, All Eyes on Ohio 
CHICAGO - The Obama campaign election night rally is showing a video - Road to November 6 - that seems particularly apt right now as the nervous crowd waits for results from the swing state to end all swing states.
"Ohio, I still believe in you!" a full-throated President Obama is yelling into the microphone on the screen during one of his umpteen trips to the Buckeye State this year. In the background, soaring music is playing. "And I need you to keep believing in me!"
The crowd is rapt, every eye on the screen. The tension is fierce. Everyone keeps saying Mr. Obama is up in Ohio, and the wide belief in the crowd is that if the president wins Ohio, he wins the presidency.
But the networks still have not called Ohio.
"This is a great time to pray," Bishop Vashti McKenzie, of the A.M.E. Church, says from the podium.

 10:17 P.M. | Warren Wins in Massachusetts 
BOSTON - Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the left, won a hard-fought race in Massachusetts for the Senate on Tuesday, according to network projections, recapturing for the Democrats the seat held for almost half a century by Edward M. Kennedy.
The networks began calling the race for Ms. Warren shortly before 10 p.m., first CBS and then CNN and NBC. Whoops went up in the hotel ballroom here where Ms. Warren was holding her victory party.
The Senate seat had slipped into Republican hands when Scott P. Brown, a state legislator, won it in a special election in 2010 after Mr. Kennedy's death. Taking it back was a Democratic priority.
Ms. Warren, 63, a professor at Harvard Law School, will become the first woman to win a Senate seat in Massachusetts. Her victory was fueled by a forceful appeal to female voters, who supported her in lopsided numbers, while men overwhelmingly backed Mr. Brown.
She cast herself as a fighter for the middle class and a champion of women's causes, particularly equal pay for equal work, health insurance coverage for birth control and abortion rights.
It was a message that resonated with Elizabeth Lear, 46, a book reviewer in Waltham, who said she voted for Ms. Warren because "she cares about the financial concerns of everybody and most importantly about women's reproductive rights, the freedom to choose."
And, Ms. Lear added, "I feel she's pretty scrappy and I really like that about her."
Mr. Brown cast Ms. Warren as a partisan and inflexible ideologue who would march in lockstep with the Democratic Party.
The combined spending on the race totaled more than $68 million, making it the most expensive Senate race in the country in this election cycle and one of the most expensive ever. With the help of progressive groups that bolstered her candidacy early, Ms. Warren raised a stunning $39 million, which put her among the top five most successful Senate fund-raisers of all time. The money was all the more remarkable considering that Ms. Warren was a first-time, and untested, candidate.
"We raised money from more donors than any Senate campaign in the history of the United States," Ms. Warren said in a statement about an hour after the polls closed Tuesday. She added, "We knocked on more doors and made more phone calls than any candidate in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."

 10:07 P.M. | In Boston, From Upbeat to Anxious 
BOSTON - As of about 30 minutes ago, when television screens showed Mr. Romney jump from a 100,000-vote deficit in Florida to a 12,000-vote lead, the mood outside the ballroom at the Boston Convention Center where Mr. Romney is holding his party suddenly ticked up. 
People cheered, breaking off their conversations. But there was little exuberance. 
"I still think it's a tossup," said Jeff Dusault, who is in the recycling business.
Michelle McCarthy, a mother of three, said she felt hopeful, but "you're on the edge."
A friend, a freelance writer who did not want to give her name, said, "I want to see Virginia, and then we'll start celebrating."
The dress code is Big Night, with women in cocktail dresses and men in suits. Guests sipped Sam Adams and nibbled R-monogramed chocolates as they watched the television monitors tuned to Fox News above the large central bar. 
Inside the ballroom, where the floor was about two-thirds filled, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, one of Mr. Romney's most loyal surrogates, addressed guests by phone, his image on large monitors. After he recited figures for various Ohio counties in a voice that sounded a bit downbeat, he signed off with, "Thank you for letting me be a part of this amazing journey." There was only the smallest ripple of applause.
The cover band launched into Hall & Oates's "You Make My Dreams Come True."
But as more state results rolled in, the mood in the ballroom at Mr. Romney's victory party slowly began shifting from optimistic to anxious.
 "It doesn't look good," said an attendee. His wife shook her hand back and forth, in so-so gesture.
Earlier, the half-full ballroom had stood dead silent as Fox News called Michigan - Mr. Romney's native state, where his late father, George, was a three-term governor - for President Obama. 
At 10 p.m., the music stopped and the volume returned to Fox News, the network of choice here. The anchors called New Hampshire and Pennsylvania for Mr. Obama.
One or two people in the audience booed, lightly.
There did not appear to be enough energy for anything more.

 10:04 P.M. | A Soggy Viewing Party in Chicago 
CHICAGO - Early results flashed across a giant screen at the edge of a plaza as a crowd of mostly Obama supporters, many huddled under umbrellas, gathered for what was expected to be a long and rainy election night.
The outdoor viewing party, sponsored by CNN, was staged just a couple of miles from President Obama's indoor election night event, held at the McCormick Place convention center downtown.
But for some, this soggy communal gathering was a meager replacement for the grandeur of Mr. Obama's last election party, which packed Grant Park with thousands of supporters four years ago.
"There was a lot of love in the atmosphere," remembered Tiana McEntee, 36, who attended the outdoor celebration in 2008.
On Tuesday night, Ms. McEntee and her family sat in lawn chairs, wrapped in winter coats and blankets, barely talking. "Everybody is just concerned now," she said, adding that she expected the crowd to grow larger as the night went on. "There's a little nervousness right now."
Others who felt as if they had missed out on the 2008 celebration were just happy to be there and eager for their own lasting experience.
"It's a historic event," said Joseph Hill, 28, who drove from a western suburb of Chicago to stand in the crowd. "I wanted to be in the city, downtown, to absorb it."

 9:54 P.M. | Alabama Republicans Celebrate Second Amendment 
HOOVER, Ala. - At the Alabama Republican Party festivities on Tuesday night, the top raffle prize is a Glock pistol. Guests are encouraged to bring firearms. And gunfire can be heard over the television coverage of the election.
Here in the reddest of red states, the Republican Party is gathering at a shooting range and weapons store in this Birmingham suburb. While state parties in other states gather in hotel ballrooms, Alabamians are packing into the Hoover Tactical Firearms.
 The location was chosen for its 52,000-square-foot facility, said Bill Armistead, the party chairman. But it is also a gesture of support for the Second Amendment.
 "It makes total sense being here," said George Singleton, a longtime Republican from Birmingham. "Republican or Democrat - but especially Republican - most people in Alabama support gun ownership."
 Attendees could bring guns, but not ammunition. Extra security was hired. And the range dropped its prices for the night to $13. "It's going to be very, very safe," said Mr. Armistead, who brought a Glock and a .38-caliber pistol. "We're checking everyone's guns as they come in."
 About 400 people - only a handful of them armed - attended the celebration, which was hosted by a former Miss Alabama, Amie Beth Dickinson Shaver. Most gathered around televisions and picked at snack food. But a few ventured onto the shooting range until it closed at 8 p.m.
"There's no other way my parents could have gotten me to come to this," said Andrew Rogers, 14, wearing a Romney T-shirt as he left the shooting range with a target full of holes. "This definitely makes politics more fun."

 9:49 P.M. | Mood Swings in Chicago 
CHICAGO - All night the crowd gathered here for Obama election night rally has been jamming to the campaign's familiar musical playlist - Al Green, Jennifer Hudson, Brooks and Dunn. But the mood has veered crazily back and forth.
The early cheers come when the networks called Michigan for President Obama. The Florida vote count, which has shown the president inching up to tie Mr. Romney, elicits cautious clapping. And then the networks call Pennsylvania for the president and and the crowd goes wild. 
But then things quiet quickly, when one of the monitors shows the race remains undecided. The big three - Ohio, Florida, Virginia - remain too close to call.

 9:49 P.M. | Obama Wins Wisconsin, Networks Project 
President Obama has won Wisconsin, according to several television networks, ending hopes by Mitt Romney's campaign of an upset in the state.
Fox News, NBC News and CBS News each said Mr. Obama had won the state.
Mr. Obama had been leading in the state for much of the campaign. But Republicans were hopeful in the last days that the race was tightening and that Mr. Romney might have a chance there.
Both candidates and their surrogates scheduled late trips to the state, each hoping to sway the last undecided voters and to motivate their supporters.
Republicans had put faith in the fact that they had won a recall battle last year over whether to end the term of the Republican governor, Scott Walker, early. Democratic efforts to oust the governor lost that battle. Also boosting Republicans' hopes was the presence of Representative Paul D. Ryan, a native son, on the ticket.
But Mr. Obama's victory in the state means that Mr. Romney was unable to capitalize on the same Republican fervor in the state that helped Mr. Walker.

 9:25 P.M. | Obama Wins Pennsylvania, Networks Project 
President Obama has won Pennsylvania, according to three television networks, despite a strong, late push by Mitt Romney's campaign to claim the state amid polls that showed the race tightening.
Fox News, CBS News and NBC News all said that Mr. Obama had won the state, a big prize that carries 20 electoral votes.
In the waning days of the campaign, Mr. Romney visited the Keystone State, and his campaign and its allies poured millions of dollars into television ads there.
The Obama campaign mocked the effort, saying that it was a fool's errand and that Mr. Obama would win there. Even some Republicans worried that the party often tries to win Pennsylvania, without any luck.
The president's victory in Pennsylvania puts added pressure on Mr. Romney to win in Ohio. Some Democrats said last week that Mr. Romney's campaign was turning to Pennsylvania because it saw Ohio slipping away.
Without Pennsylvania's electoral votes, Mr. Romney needs Ohio's 18 electoral votes to get to 270, both sides say.

 9:21 P.M. | Obama Wins Michigan, A.P. Reports 
President Obama has defeated Mitt Romney in the state where the Republican candidate was born and where his father served as governor, The Associated Press said.
Mr. Romney had spent plenty of time in Michigan during the early part of the campaign, declaring himself to be especially fond of the state where he grew up.
But the race between himself and Mr. Obama did not last long in Michigan, where polls showed the Democrat leading for months.
Mr. Obama's campaign hammered voters with ads about Mr. Romney's opposition to the bailout of the automobile industry, and exit poll surveys suggested that the ads took their toll on support for the Republican candidate.
That may sting for Mr. Romney. Michigan was the state where his father was governor. The elder Mr. Romney also ran an auto company in Detroit, a fact that Mr. Romney often cited in trying to rebut the charges by Mr. Obama.
Toward the end of the campaign, some strategists for Mr. Romney suggested that the president might be vulnerable in Michigan, where polls showed the races tightening.
But in the end, Mr. Obama won the state, adding its 16 electoral votes to his total.

 8:44 P.M. | Exit Polls: Blaming Bush 
One of the central arguments of the 2012 presidential election has been who should be blamed for the country's economic situation.
Nearly four years after George W. Bush departed office, a majority of voters still believe he is the answer to that question.
Mitt Romney repeatedly argued that President Obama should bear the burden of an economic recovery that has been tepid at best.
Mr. Obama strenuously argued that the country's economic struggles were a result of the disastrous situation Mr. Bush left him. He said Mr. Bush and the Republicans "drove the country into a ditch."
And the president said again and again that Mr. Romney's policies would take the country back to the ones that Mr. Bush followed.
Preliminary exit poll results suggest that Mr. Obama's argument has carried the day with more voters. Half of all voters said that Mr. Bush was more to blame for current economic problems, while only 4 in 10 blamed President Obama.
As expected, Democrats were far more likely to blame Mr. Bush for the country's problems. Republicans were more likely to blame Mr. Obama for the economic woes.
But independent voters - a key group - said they, too, believed Mr. Bush deserved more of the blame for the country's woes, suggesting that Mr. Obama's arguments have been more successful.
Among independent voters, half said that Mr. Bush should be blamed for the problems. Less than 4 in 10 said that Mr. Obama deserved that blame.
The same holds true for moderate voters. Two-fifths of voters identify themselves as moderates. Among these voters, a clear majority (6 in 10) blame Mr. Bush for economic problems, while only 3 in 10 blame Mr. Obama.

 8:35 P.M. | At a Polling Place, an Oasis of Nonpolitical Talk 
PERRY, Iowa - Election Day for a reporter, particularly in a swing state, can be an overwhelming mix of political operatives telling you how great they're turning out the vote, repetitive advertisements choking the airwaves and the fear that you are missing some huge voter issue.
After a long day here, I have discovered that there is a safe house of sorts where you can get away from all of this and just be around people who are quietly chatting with one another: a polling place.
As much as polling places are where Americans come to have their voices heard, most people - perhaps out of respect for the process, fear of being thrown out for trying to persuade another voter, or just fatigue after the monthslong election - say nothing about politics while waiting.
In an hour that I sat in the lobby of a Masonic lodge here where votes were being cast, I heard nothing about whether Bain Capital had shipped jobs overseas, 47 percent, "You Didn't Build That" or the first debate.
I didn't even hear the names Obama or Romney.
Instead, old friends reconnected and asked about each others' spouses. A woman talked with a friend about a new program her company was planning to put in place. And one man confided with a friend that he had just been suspended from work for being late too many times.
As nice as it was inside the polling place, I couldn't forget that I was in a swing state. And as it was getting closer to the polls closing at 10 p.m. Eastern, I thought it was a good time to check in with an analyst here to get some last-minute thoughts on what would affect the state's vote.
So from the parking lot of the polling place, I called Dennis J. Goldford, a professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines.
Mr. Goldford has been studying how Iowans vote since the 1980s and said there were three things that would most likely determine whether the state goes for Obama or Romney.
Not surprisingly, the first factor was how independents break. In 2008, he said, they went for Obama and it was unlikely they would do so this time because there was far less enthusiasm toward him.
To make up that difference, Mr. Goldford said, Obama has to have a larger turnout of Democrats than Republicans. The Obama campaign in Iowa, he said, was more organized than Romney's, so it was conceivable that the Obama campaign could turn out more voters. 
The second issue, Mr. Goldford said, was the impact of down-ballot votes at the state level on same-sex marriage. The issue tends to galvanize conservatives, he said, and if many decide to vote based solely on that issue, it will most likely help Mr. Romney as it did President Bush in 2004.
Last, Mr. Goldford said it would come down to the accuracy of the polls. Mr. Obama had been polling well in the final days of the campaign, but Mr. Goldford said that Mr. Obama had not broken through the 50 percent mark. This left Mr. Goldford to believe that the electorate had not cemented its view.
"I would rather have Obama's numbers coming into today, but it is still very close, there are two outs in the ninth inning and it's 2-1 Obama," he said.

 8:17 P.M. | Swing State Exit Polls Show Party ID Edge for Democrats 
One source of debate this year was the charge that polls "oversampled" Democrats, meaning that they had more voters who identified as Democratic in the surveys than some conservatives expected would actually turn out to vote. So far, however, Democrats also have an edge in the party identification numbers in the exit polls. More on FiveThirtyEight.
- Nate Silver 
 8:17 P.M. | Exit Polls: Broad Support for Auto Bailout in Ohio 
If President Obama wins the state of Ohio, it could be his bailout of the auto industry - which is very popular there - that helped pave the way.
The federal government's aid to United States automakers wins broad support from Ohio voters, according to early exit poll results. About 6 in 10 of the voters say they approve of it. Just over a third disapprove.
That provides some help for Mr. Obama in the state, with about three in four voters who support the auto industry bailout backing his candidacy. Mr. Romney is supported by the overwhelming majority of those who disapprove of the bailout.
Mr. Romney's campaign has long complained that the news media and the Democrats have misrepresented his position on the auto bailout. In an opinion article in The New York Times, he argued for a managed bankruptcy that would help the companies restructure.
But in the article - and later - Mr. Romney also opposed government funds at the beginning of the bankruptcy process, a position that critics said would have forced the companies into bankruptcy.

 8:07 P.M. | Voting Winding Down, Parties Heating Up 
As the polls began to close in Atlanta, where African-Americans make up about 54 percent of the city's population, the postelection parties were just beginning.
Students at traditionally black colleges like Morehouse and Spelman were heading to celebrate what they hoped would be a victory party for President Obama.
At the Indigo Bar near the Old Fourth Ward, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s old neighborhood, early party-goers posed for pictures in front of cutouts of the president and first lady. The Fox Sports Grill was hosting a "Yes We Did" party with a red carpet for supporters to stroll and a wall of photos of Mr. Obama with African-American celebrities. The V.I.P. reservation list for the election party at Halo, a midtown nightclub that promised "hookahs and bottles," was filled before the day was out.
And $20 bought a ticket to the Presidential Prosperity Party at Paschal's, where leaders of the civil rights movement often met to discuss strategy. The party Tuesday featured a couture fashion show inspired by Michelle Obama.
Of course, not everyone would be spending the evening with a crowd. With less certainty that Mr. Obama would win this election, many Obama supporters in Atlanta weren't sure they were in the mood to party.
"The first time around was very emotional in a very specific way. This feels entirely different," said Jamillah Simmons, 39, who works as a makeup artist. "There's just more at stake in a way for African-Americans."

Brown in Massachusetts, and, of course, Ohio.
CNN en Español led its Web site with a slideshow of Election Day photos and a "minute by minute" article updated with election results, state by state, as projected by CNN.
MundoFox, the newest addition to the Spanish-language broadcast set, did not dedicate all of its home page to election coverage but offered a microsite for users that included a live stream of its broadcast, a Facebook widget for user comments, and a series of interactive graphics including a map with election results and an explanation of the American voting system.
Fox News Latino, the English-language site for Latinos, included a series of articles related to the election including how voters were voting after Hurricane Sandy. The site also carried a large yellow banner advertisement promoting an analysis of the election results in Spanish at 9 p.m. Eastern with Rick Sanchez, the journalist who was fired from CNNin 2010 for calling the comedian Jon Stewart a bigot.
HuffPost Latino Voices led its election coverage with a series of political cartoons by Lalo Alcaraz, a Mexican illustrator, academic and radio host.

 7:39 P.M. | Packing the Polls in Massachusetts 
BOSTON - For those trying to read the tea leaves in the highly competitive Massachusetts Senate race, turnout may provide a clue.
So many people have jammed the polling stations that officials here are predicting a record turnout in Massachusetts of 73 percent - higher, even, than the 3.1 million people who voted in the 2008 presidential race. 
Generally, Democrats benefit from higher turnout in a state like Massachusetts, where they outnumber Republicans, 3 to1. If more people are coming to the polls, the reasoning goes, more of them are likely to be Democrats.
But with high turnout comes long lines, and on a cold autumnal night like this one, a long line can discourage people who are not dedicated voters. Voting at some spots took more than an hour.
This is why Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic challenger, who had nothing on her public schedule Tuesday, ended up making a mad dash to at least eight polling places as the day wore on. Senator Scott P. Brown, the Republican incumbent, visited numerous sites as well.
"As the sun goes down and it gets colder, we've got to try to keep people in line," said Doug Rubin, a senior adviser to the Warren campaign.
They do this by deploying volunteers to serve hot coffee to voters as they stand in line. They will also send elected officials and other local notables to polling places to chat with voters and encourage them to stay.
No one wants to lose an election because their voters got to the polls, saw long lines, then turned around and went home.

 7:25 P.M. | Exit Polls: A Portrait of Virginia Voters 
If the nation is just about evenly divided about who should be president - and it seems to be - the state of Virginia is a microcosm of the country.
Preliminary exit polls from the state show a tied race and an electorate whose characteristics closely mirror those in the rest of the country.
Early exit polls in Virginia, one of the most watched battleground states, show that more than 6 in 10 voters say that the economy is the most important issue facing the country. Far fewer cite health care and foreign policy issues as important issues.
When it comes to the economy, more than 4 in 10 report that unemployment is the biggest economic problem facing people like them, with rising prices being the next biggest problem.
Mitt Romney rates somewhat better on being able to handle the economy. And voters are split on whether Mr. Obama or former President George W. Bush is to blame for the current economic problems.
Turning to the national economy, about a third rate it as excellent or good. Looking to the future, voters in Virginia are more positive: more than 4 in 10 say the national economy is improving and a third say it is getting worse. 
Virginia voters are split when it comes to their own financial situation. Compared with four years ago, about one third said their family's situation was "worse today," another third saying it was "about the same."
Over all, Virginia voters see Mr. Obama's policies favoring the middle class and poor, and Mr. Romney's policies favoring the rich followed by the middle class. The contrast becomes more striking when looking at voter preference.
Among Mr. Obama's supporters, 8 in 10 say his policies favor the middle class while 9 of 10 say Mr. Romney's policies favor the rich.
Virginians are divided on the 2010 health care law. Those saying some or all of the law should be repealed have the edge over those preferring that the law be expanded or left as it is.
Mr. Obama is seen as better able to handle Medicare..
Virginia voters are split on taxes. Almost half say taxes should be increased only on those with incomes over $250,000, and another third said taxes should not increase for anyone. Three-quarters of Mr. Obama's supporters said that taxes should be increased only on those with incomes over $250,000, while about two-thirds of Mr. Romney supporters favor no increases for anyone. 
Feelings about the Obama administration align with voter preference. Early exit polls suggest overwhelming majorities of Romney supporters are dissatisfied or angry, while 6 in 10 Obama supporters are enthusiastic and another third are satisfied.

 7:16 P.M. | Exit Polls: Government Trying to Do Too Much 
A central theme of Mitt Romney's campaign was the need for government to play a lesser role - and private business a greater role - in the life of the country, from repealing the postcrash financial regulations to overturning President Obama's signature legislative achievement, the national health care law.
Preliminary exit polls show that the Republican argument has made inroads with voters since the dark days of 2008, when voters elected Mr. Obama amid a severe economic crisis.
In a change from 2008, when just over half of voters said that government should do more to solve problems, more voters now say that government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals.
Voters' partisanship has helped fuel these views: A broad majority of Democrats said they favored more government and a large majority of Republicans disagreed.
What helps tip the scales? Independents voters, most of whom said government was doing too much.

 7:02 P.M. | Exit Polls: A Closer Look at Taxes 
There were few differences between President Obama and Mitt Romney more stark then their proposals on taxes, with Mr. Obama proposing to raise them on wealthier Americans to help close the deficit and Mr. Romney seeking reductions in overall tax rates at every level, along with the elimination of never-specified loopholes.
Broadly speaking, most voters are wary of raising taxes to lower the nation's budget deficit: When asked if taxes in general should be raised to help cut the deficit, more than three-fifths of voters oppose this idea.
But when asked if taxes should be increased only on income over $250,000 - a proposal similar to one of Mr. Obama's - almost half of all voters said they were supportive.
Exit polls suggest that Mr. Obama's arguments about tax fairness may explain some of the difference: A majority of voters say the U.S. economy favors the wealthy, and nearly two-thirds of these voters support raising taxes on income over $250,000.
Voters' own income - and self-interest - do not appear to have much of an effect on their opinions about tax fairness. All income groups are about even in their support.

 6:56 P.M. | A Polling Place Party 
BOW, N.H. - By Tuesday evening, the community center here felt more like a block party than a polling place. Voters streamed in, many with their children, stopping to catch up with their neighbors or fill out a free raffle ticket for the local gardening club.
"Is everybody registered?" Selectwoman Colleen Hunter said to a pair of teenage girls, taking them under her wing as if she were a party host introducing new guests to old ones. "Do you have an ID with you?"
Frank Jones, a teacher and part-time police officer here, chatted with friends outside the polls. After years of voting Republican - including for John McCain in 2008 - he had recently registered as a Democrat, and he spoke effusively about President Obama.
"If you were to ask me, am I better off than I was four years ago, I have to say, absolutely," Mr. Jones said. "I think we're a stronger nation. Obama managed to make significant progress. He inherited a mess."
Tom McCoo, a state worker who votes independently, said he had also voted for Mr. Obama, in part because he preferred the president's stance on women's issues to that of his challenger, Mitt Romney. "I have four daughters," Mr. McCoo said. "Their right to choose is important to me. That was one of my biggest concerns."
Inside, Sheila Labounty, an independent voter who works for the state's pharmacy board, said she was anxious about the outcome of the race. "I'm glad it's going to be over," she said. "I think it's a tight race all around - I'm hoping Romney comes out on top."
Ms. Labounty made her choice, she said, in part because of concerns about the national debt. "If it's going on the way it is now, they'll have to start a new program to teach us all Chinese," she said. "And then we'll be even more in deficit."
And at seven years of age, Ali Sargent was over the moon about having voted with her mother, Sandy.

 6:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: A Portrait of Ohio Voters 
Early exit poll data in Ohio suggest that voters for President Obama have very different perceptions of the state of the national economy compared with those who supported Mitt Romney 
Ohio voters who supported Mr. Obama are about evenly split on whether the economy is in good or excellent shape compared with those who think the economy is not so good or is poor. But Mr. Romney's voters almost unanimously say the national economy is not so good or poor. 
Looking to the future, some two-thirds of Mr. Obama's voters say the national economy is getting better and about 4 in 10 say their family's finances are better today than four years ago. 
Those who backed Mr. Romney see things differently. Close to two-thirds of Mr. Romney's voters say the economy is getting worse, and over half say their family's financial situation is worse than four years ago. 
Who is to blame for the current economic situation? About three-quarters of Mr. Romney's supporters say it is Mr. Obama; some 90 percent of those who preferred Mr. Obama say it is former President George W. Bush. 
Voters who choose Mr. Obama see health care reform, Medicare and the legality of abortion very differently from those who support Mr. Romney. 
Over three-quarters of Mr. Romney's voters would like to see the 2010 health care law either repealed in part or in total. Almost all of them think that Mr. Romney would better at handling Medicare. Voters who preferred Mr. Obama say the opposite. Some three-quarters of them say they think the health care law should be left alone or expanded; almost all of them say Mr. Obama would handle Medicare better.
Abortion is also an issue that separates the two groups of voters. Over three-quarters of Obama voters said abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Some 6 in 10 of Mr. Romney's supporters said the opposite - that it should be illegal in most or all cases. This preliminary exit poll data show, however, that among Mr. Romney's voters, about a third have views similar to those who backed Mr. Obama in that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

 6:40 P.M. | Exit Polls: A Narrow Majority for Obama Job Approval 
Mitt Romney's campaign repeatedly sought to undermine President Obama's handling of the economy and other issues during his four years in office. Preliminary exit poll results suggest that the campaign failed to convince a majority of voters.
Early results show a narrow majority of voters approve of the way Mr. Obama is handling his job as president. Similarly, about half of all voters express positive views of the Obama administration over all.
Top strategists to Mr. Romney believed throughout the campaign that struggling Americans would become angry at the president and would take out that anger on Election Day.
But among those who have already voted, more of those with negative views of the Obama administration said they were merely dissatisfied but not angry (3 in 10). Only 2 in 10 said they were outright angry. (Those with positive views were split evenly between the enthusiastic and the merely satisfied.)
Nearly two-thirds of all voters say that Mr. Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy was a factor in their vote for president. Two-fifths of all voters said that it was an important factor.
Slightly more voters trust Mr. Obama to handle an international crisis than trust Mr. Romney. A majority said Mr. Obama would better handle the issue of Medicare than would Mr. Romney. Regarding the economy and the deficit, however, a narrow majority said Mr. Romney would be better.

 6:35 P.M. | One Last Campaign News Conference 
Just hours before the polls closed, Mitt Romney came back on his private plane to chat with his traveling press corps one final time. He was by turns nostalgic, confident and at peace. Here is the complete exchange of Mr. Romney's 50th news conference - and his last one as a candidate:
 Q: How did it feel to see your name on the ballot?
 ROMNEY: That was quite a moment. We've been working for this a long, long time, and to be on the ballot for the president of the United States Is very humbling. It's a great honor, and I hope that I have the chance to serve.
 Q: Are you thinking of your father?
 ROMNEY: You know, I think about my dad from time to time and my mom. I sure wish they were around to be a part of this. It's one of the inevitable parts of life that we lose the people we care most about, and I hope they're able to watch in their own way.
 Q: Governor, what does it feel like getting off the plane in Pennsylvania and seeing that, for someone who has no idea what you're going through, what does it feel like to be you today?
 ROMNEY: You know intellectually I've felt we're going to win this and have felt that for some time, but emotionally just getting off the plane and seeing those people standing there - we didn't tell them we were coming, we didn't notify them when we'd arrive - just seeing people there cheering as they were connected emotionally with me and I not only think we're going to win intellectually, I feel it as well.
 Q: What is your assessment of your campaign? Are you proud of every moment out there? Do you have any regrets? Is there an argument that you wish you could have made better?
 ROMNEY: You know I'm very proud of the campaign that we've run, to tell you the truth. No campaign is perfect. I'm sure like any campaign, people can point to mistakes. But that's the mark of anything that's produced by human beings. Our team has been very solid. We have not had the kind of infighting that's reported to have occurred in other campaigns. We've worked well together, our campaign team. And we've gotten our message across. I am very pleased. I feel we have put it all on the field. We left nothing in the locker room. We fought to the very end. And I think that's why we will be successful.
 Q: Do you have two speeches written for tonight?
 ROMNEY: I just finished writing a victory speech. It's about 1,118 words. And, uh, I'm sure it will change before I'm finished, because I haven't passed it around to my family and friends and advisers to get their reaction, but I've only written one speech at this point.
 Q: Looking back over the last two years, how has this experience changed you as a person?
 ROMNEY: You come away with a much greater appreciation for the depth of character of the American people. Despite our great differences in location and background, we have some characteristics of greatness that inspire and give you confidence that the future can be brighter than the past.
 Q: But what about you? How has it changed you personally? Did you surprise yourself in any way over the last two years?
 ROMNEY: I expected to be more tired given the number of events and the hours. And I think I got energy from the people that I spent time with, whether at the rope line or the rallies. You know when you have 10,000 people cheering you, you get a real boost from it. And so I have not been tired by the process. And frankly have enjoyed it a good deal. It's very exciting. I think the general election campaign is particularly invigorating as you see people come together and support the effort.
 Q: What's it been like to campaign with Ryan? What difference has he made?
 ROMNEY: Oh, it's fun to be with Paul. It's too bad that we have to divide to be able to hit all of the places we want to go to. Likewise with Ann. She's off on her own day after day. But being with Paul is a real plus. I think we both enjoyed that a great deal."
 Q: What are you most looking forward to doing as a noncandidate?
 ROMNEY: You know, assuming I win, my mind will immediately focus on the transition, the work that has to be done, the gathering of the people to carry out the work that we have. And I can't imagine that I'll be able to unwind. I think instead it's winding tighter. So I don't look postelection to be a time of regrouping. Instead it's a time of forward focus. And the prospect of losing, I don't give that a lot of thought. I know it's possible and, because there's nothing certain in politics, but I have of course a family and a life that are important to me, win or lose.
 Q: I heard you were thinking about getting a puppy?
 ROMNEY: If, assuming I win, one of the benefits would be to get anotherWeimaraner.
[Starts to walk away, then turns back around]
 ROMNEY: Thanks you, guys. ... I thought you had bigger seats back here.
 Q: Don't you wish you had spent more time back here?
 ROMNEY: I know what the result of that would have been. More things to regret. [Laughs]

 6:33 P.M. | Exit Polls: Most Voters Decided Before Debates 
The first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney is widely believed to have been a turning point in the presidential contest.
Mr. Obama delivered what his aides now concede was an uninspired performance.
But the debate - along with three more face-offs, including the vice-presidential candidates, and millions spent on campaign ads in the final month - may have come after most of the country had already made up their mind about who to vote for, according to preliminary exit poll results.
A wide majority of voters - about 8 in 10 - say they decided which candidate to support before October. The first debate between the two presidential candidates took place on Oct. 3.
Indeed, about 7 in 10 made up their minds well in advance - even before September, when the campaigns are said to really kick into high gear. Nearly 1 in 10 said they decided in September and another 2 in 10 said they made up their minds in October or in the last week.
That suggests that in the final weeks, the campaigns were increasingly fighting over a smaller and smaller number of potential supporters in the country.

 6:29 P.M. | Exit Polls: Romney's Policies Would Not Favor the Poor 
Sometimes in politics, there are moments that stick.
In February, just after winning the Florida Republican primary, Mitt Romney said on CNN: "I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it."
The campaign argued - with some justification - that the broader context of his comments were immediately ignored. But it didn't matter - Democrats pounced, saying the comments were further evidence that Mr. Romney's policies would benefit the rich alone.
Now, preliminary exit poll results suggest that the comment helped shape opinions about the Republican nominee.In the surveys, a tiny percentage said they believed that Mr. Romney's policies would favor "the poor."
That result was probably also affected by the millions of dollars in negative ads that Mr. Obama spent accusing Mr. Romney of being a corporate raider who shipped jobs overseas.
But it is striking that 10 months after the "very poor" comment, voters seem to remember.

 6:26 P.M. | A Full Day at School for Malia and Sasha 
CHICAGO-Malia and Sasha Obama didn't let Election Day interfere with their schoolwork.
The White House says the first daughters flew into Chicago, along with their grandmother Marian, to join their parents - having put in their time at school Tuesday first.
The Obama family will have dinner together alone. Afterward, they will be joined by the first lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson and his family, and the president's sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, and her family.
Then they will presumably watch election returns. Well, the White House didn't say that, but what else would they do?

 6:14 P.M. | In Missouri, a Tough Choice 
CHESTERFIELD, Mo. - Patty Fogertey represents the hope and concern for both candidates in the Missouri Senate race.
Ms. Fogertey, 58, left the St. Louis County Library here on Tuesday saying she decisively cast her vote for Mitt Romney because she wanted "less government, less socialism," a repeal "of some of Obamacare - not all - and less regulation."
But when it came time to check the box for either the incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill or her Republican challenger, Representative Todd Akin, she hesitated.
"That was tough," she said.
Speaking of Mr. Akin, she said, "He's maybe too extreme in some of his beliefs in order to represent the people."
At the same time, however, Ms. Fogertey said, "I have a lot of issues with Claire McCaskill."
"I think that she has taken financial advantage of her position," she said.
One of the most promising paths to victory for Mr. Akin, who upended his lead in this race in August with his infamous "legitimate rape" comment, is if Romney supporters automatically check his name down the ballot. Mr. Romney has polled well ahead of President Obama in Missouri.
But Ms. McCaskill has sought to inject in Missouri voters just the kind of hesitation that Ms. Fogertey expressed. Time and again, Ms. McCaskill has said that Mr. Akin was "too extreme" for Missouri voters, with the hope that some of those who favored Mr. Romney would split the ticket and vote for her.
Soon, we will know which strategy was most effective.
In Ms. Fogertey's case, she went with Mr. Akin.

 6:06 P.M. | Ryan Pops by a 'Victory Center' 
HENRICO COUNTY, Va. - Have you wondered what happens at a campaign field office on Election Day? It's as brutally efficient as the three-sentence script used by volunteers to call identified Republicans or Republican-leaning independents from a "Victory Center" here, where Representative Paul D. Ryan paid a surprise visit.
After identifying themselves as calling from the Republican Party of Virginia, volunteers, reading a single question, "Have you voted in today's election?"
If the answer is yes, the scripted response is: "Fantastic! Thanks for your support."
If the answer is "no, not planning on voting," the volunteer says: "This election could come down to the wire. I'd really encourage you to vote sometime today."
In the event the voter is an Obama supporter, the script is simply blank, suggesting either speechlessness or the need to not waste time and move to the next call.
Mr. Ryan, who scheduled his visit to this crucial state only late Monday, stayed for less than 10 minutes in the windowless, all-business office. In truth, his remarks also had a bit of a formulaic feel. 
"I don't want to take too much of your time because we've got a lot of work to do," Mr. Ryan told about 40 volunteers, including teenagers from Benedictine College Preparatory, a Roman Catholic secondary school.
"We've got to run for the tape," he said, adopting the voice of a coach he has used at recent rallies. "We've got to leave it all on the field."
He told the volunteers that a Republican victory was important because it would confer "a mandate to fix the country's problems."
"Thank you for the hard work, for turning this thing around, getting our country on the right track," he added.
"This is a great effort, keep it up, go at 'em and let's wake up tomorrow knowing we did everything we could."
A young man shouted, "Help us get rid of Biden!'' 
Mr. Ryan did not directly respond. He thanked the volunteers once again. "Let's get it done," he said. "I don't want to take any more of your time."
And with that he posed for a few pictures, returned to his motorcade and headed back to the Richmond airport for his final campaign flight of 2012 to Boston.

 6:05 P.M. | In New Hampshire, 'Disillusioned' With the Ads 
PEMBROKE, N.H. - For some voters here, the walk to the polls was a weary one, an anticlimactic coda to a campaign that has flooded airwaves, telephone lines and mailboxes with relentless advertising.
"Thank God the ads are over," said Cody Favata, a 20-year-old independent voter. "It's nice to have the freedom to vote, but those ads can really get to you."
"They don't really talk about their own ideals," said his friend, Sean Bonin, 18.
"You just learn how to trash talk - that's not good," Mr. Favata agreed.
The negativity had also worn on Barbara Nobrega, a retiree in this town of nearly 7,000, leaving her unenthused about her choice for president.
"I was disillusioned with all the political ads," Ms. Nobrega said. "I thought they were dishonest, biased and out of context."
Ms. Nobrega had voted for Mitt Romney for president, but she was not particularly happy about it. "I chose him as the lesser of two evils," Ms. Nobrega said. "I preferred Ron Paul. I did not believe he was trying to please anyone - both of these candidates," she said, referring to Mr. Romney and President Obama, "are going to say anything to get a vote."
Jack Lewis, who runs a towing company here, was equally ambivalent as he left the elementary school that served as a polling place. "Totally confused," he said, of his mind-set. "I'm voting for which is worse - I don't think Obama has got business going like he should have. Unemployment's terrible."
Although Mr. Lewis hinted that he had voted for Mr. Romney, he had choice words for him, too. "I just don't trust the man," Mr. Lewis said. "He's for big business, not small business."

 6:01 P.M. | Exit Polls: State by State, Economy Varies 
The nation's economy was a focus of the presidential campaign. But the race between Mitt Romney and President Obama played out state by state, where the strength of the economy varied.
Preliminary exit poll results suggest that voters were affected by the economic situation where they live.
Iowa, New Hampshire and Virginia all have unemployment levels under 6 percent, well below the national unemployment average of 7.9 percent, while Nevada is facing the highest unemployment in the country, at 11.8 percent.
Florida's unemployment is still a high 8.7 percent, and 1 in every 318 housing units in Florida was in foreclosure in September, the highest rate in the country, according to RealtyTrac, which follows foreclosure activity.
Despite these conditions, about 4 in 10 voters in both Florida and Nevada expressed some optimism, saying the nation's economy was getting better, while about 3 in 10 said it was getting worse or staying the same.
In Iowa, more voters cited rising prices as their biggest economic problem, over unemployment and the housing market, while in Virginia, more voters said that unemployment was the biggest economic problem. In Florida, unemployment and rising prices vied for the top economic problem, according to early exit poll results.
Voters were divided over which candidate could better handle the economy, with Mr. Romney having a slight edge in Florida and Virginia. In Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, voters were nearly evenly divided over whether Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama would better handle the economy.
In closely watched Ohio, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 7 percent, nearly 4 in 10 voters said the economy was getting better. And in Ohio, voters were essentially divided whether Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney was the candidate better able to handle the nation's economy.

 5:52 P.M. | Exit Polls: What Voters Want From the President 
The presidential candidates clashed on the economy, health care, the federal budget deficit and foreign policy. The economy was cited as the top issue by most voters.
But the electorate is more divided on which candidate quality mattered most to them in deciding how to vote for president, with about 3 in 10 saying they wanted someone with a vision for the future and about as many looking for a candidate who shares their values.
President Obama spent months during the summer airing negative commercials about Mitt Romney, suggesting that the Republican candidate does not share the values of the middle class.
Early results in exit polls find Mr. Obama with an edge on empathy, with somewhat more voters saying he is more in touch with people like them. And a plurality of voters say his policies generally favor the middle class, while more than half say Mr. Romney's policies favor the rich.
About 2 in 10 say they want someone who cares about them, while about as many are looking most for a strong leader. That plays to the case that Mr. Romney tried to make, repeatedly suggesting that the president had failed to lead while in office.
Mr. Romney most often made that case on foreign policy, accusing the president of a listless, rudderless approach to foreign affairs.

 5:53 P.M. | New Faces on Tonight's Broadcast Coverage 
Dozens of news and opinion Web sites will offer essentially live coverage on election night, some with TV-like newscasts and others with live blogs.
The New York Times will stream live video on its home page throughout the night. But just as in past elections, the largest audiences are expected to flock to the big three broadcast networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and the big three cable news networks, Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.
The cable networks have been live all day. The broadcasters will kick off live coverage at 7 p.m. Eastern and will keep going until at least 2 a.m.
Four years ago, Brian Williams was the anchor on NBC, Charles Gibson on ABC and Katie Couric on CBS. Mr. Williams is back for his second presidential election night as anchor, but Mr. Gibson, who retired three years ago, will not; heading the coverage instead will be the pair who sat alongside him in 2008, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos. Ms. Couric, now of ABC, will join them from time to time with social media reaction. On CBS, Scott Pelley will anchor his first presidential election night.
It is also the first time for Rachel Maddow, who will be the co-host with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, and Bret Baier and Megyn Kelly, the co-hosts on Fox News. On PBS, Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff will make up national television's first two-woman anchor team on election night.
A pack of smaller channels - like CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg, TV One and HDNet - will also have hours of live election talk.
Comedy Central will have special live editions of "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report" from 11 p.m. to midnight.

 5:45 P.M. | Exit Polls: Economy the Key Issue 
President Obama and Mitt Romney each framed his case for being president as an argument about confronting the nation's economic struggles.
That seems to have been the right message, according to voters, who said the economy is the No. 1 issue on their minds.
Of those selecting the economy as their top issue, most - 4 in 10 - said that unemployment was the biggest economic problem, flowed closely by prices - 1 in 3 voters.
Mr. Romney had argued for months that voters would blame Mr. Obama for unemployment that had remained over 8 percent for much of the president's term. The rate dropped to 7.8 percent in September and stayed at 7.9 percent in October.
Voters express a mixed view of the state of the economy over all. While three-quarters of voters rate the national economy as not so good or poor, only 3 in 10 say the economy is getting worse, and 4 in 10 say it is getting better.
Half of all voters said that President George W. Bush was more to blame for current economic problems, while only 4 in 10 blame President Obama.
Voters give a narrow edge to Governor Romney when asked which candidate would better handle the economy.
One-third of voters said they felt their own family's financial situation had deteriorated. This is slightly better than in 2008, when 42 percent of voters said their family's financial situation was worse than it was four years prior.
A majority of voters said they felt that the United States economic system generally favors the wealthy. Only 4 in 10 said it is fair to most Americans.

 5:34 P.M. | Exit Polls: Majority Says No Repeal of Obamacare 
The Republican position on health care - led by Mitt Romney and embraced by nearly all the members of the party leadership - is to repeal the entire health care law passed by President Obama and the Democrats.
But that is not the opinion of the majority of voters, according to preliminary exit poll results. The survey shows that just a quarter of the people who voted in the election want to repeal all of Mr. Obama's law.
About the same amount want to repeal only some of the law. And the rest want to leave the law as it is or expand it.
Republicans have argued for years that the health care law would be an albatross around Mr. Obama's neck as he seeks re-election. They said the law's broad scope would be seen by voters as job-killing regulations.
But the exit poll results back up claims by Democrats that some provisions in the law are very popular, and that voters would react negatively to the Republican push to repeal it.

"If they are in line at 7, they can vote," she said.
Ms. Weimer said that scene was being repeated across the state, although she had not compiled the numbers to know whether turnout would be greater than 2008 or not.
"We have some precincts that have some very long lines," she said.

 5:07 P.M. | Five Senate Races to Watch 
If you have followed the battle for the Senate for even a few minutes this election cycle, you probably know that Elizabeth Warren and Senator Scott P. Brown are locked in a tight race in Massachusetts, that comparing Senator Claire McCaskill to a dog appeared not to be additive to Representative Todd Akin's bid to unseat her in Missouri and perhaps have pondered with the rest of the United States Senate which party, if elected, Angus King of Maine would choose to caucus with.
But below we have highlighted five races that may not have been given as much attention but that deserve a little look-see as we await returns.
 Arizona 
Republicans assumed, with good reason, that the retirement of Senator Jon Kyl would mean a loss of a senior lawmaker for Arizona, but not of a seat for their party in the Senate. But a tough Republican primary left their nominee, Representative Jeff Flake, a well-known and well-established Republican, broke, bruised and in need of more help than his party expected to give. Democrats in the meantime got the best candidate they could have hoped for in Richard H. Carmona, a former surgeon general in the Bush administration, a Vietnam war hero and a Hispanic well known around the state. Mr. Carmona has occasionally closed in on Mr. Flake, though Republicans still count this in their column. A victory by Mr. Carmona seems unlikely but, both sides say, not impossible. This race also offered perhaps the most comic ad war, when Mr. Carmona released a television ad that featured glowing remarks from Mr. Kyl and Senator John McCain, delivered during Mr. Carmona's 2002 confirmation hearing. Neither Mr. Kyl nor Mr. McCain, who have endorsed Mr. Flake, were amused.
 Indiana 
Oh Indiana, what a story you have provided this year. First the state treasurer, Richard Mourdock, picked off the longtime and respected Senator Richard G. Lugar in a Republican primary, and seemed poised to coast to victory in this usually reliably Republican state. Democrats maintained hope that Mr. Mourdock's Tea Party imprimatur and fondness for saying that compromise means Democrats doing what Republicans want, might end up hurting him. Instead, he was dinged during a recent debate when he said that "when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen." Representative Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, who has run this campaign as a moderate and does not support abortion rights, saw a door opening after that debate, and his party helped him push on it. Mr. Donnelly may now be well on his way to crossing the Rotunda.
 Montana 
A third-party candidate has turned this always-a-question-mark race into the ultimate nailbiter. Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat and a rancher, managed to narrowly win his 2006 race in a state as he worked his just-folks image and occasional voting independence into a strong brand. Even though President Obama is a significant liability for him this year, he imagined that ticket splitters would pull the lever for Mitt Romney but then choose him over his Republican opponent, Representative Denny Rehberg. But that calculation did not factor in Dan Cox of the Libertarian Party, who has not made a major dent in the polls but could be a factor in a razor-thin margin.
 Nebraska 
Republicans were convinced they could pick up a seat here when Senator Ben Nelson, the two-term Democratic incumbent, decided not to run again, and for months that is exactly how it looked. Democrats recruited Bob Kerrey, the state's former governor and two-term senator who returned to his native Nebraska after a decade in New York City and scrambled to put together a campaign without so much as a place to hang his hat. Mr. Kerrey, however, did not get the opponent he wanted in State Senator Deb Fischer, who became the Republican nominee after winning a three-way primary. Nebraska has gotten a lot more conservative since Mr. Kerrey last served, and his double-digit deficit in the polls all fall seemed to presage defeat. However in the last few weeks, Mr. Kerrey has seemed to be gaining ground and landed the big endorsement by a former senator, Chuck Hagel, a Republican and fellow wounded Vietnam War veteran, who overlapped with Mr. Kerrey in the Senate. Mr. Kerrey's surge may be too little too late, but he is within the margin of error in some polls, which makes this a race to watch.
 Wisconsin 
The retirement of Senator Herb Kohl, a four-term Democrat, excited Republicans and Democrats equally, because each side knew a strong candidate in a presidential year would have a shot at a seat. Republicans were particularly emboldened by the failed effort to recall Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, which they believed was a vote of confidence for their party. What's more, they got the candidate they wanted in Tommy Thompson, the state's former four-term governor. But Mr. Thompson has struggled against Representative Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate, who would be the first openly gay senator should she be elected. Mr. Thompson has been dogged by his lobbyist past, and Ms. Baldwin appears to be benefiting from Democrats coalescing. This is a pure toss-up, tied strongly to partisan turnout.

 5:04 P.M. | In Romney Office, 'Clear Eyes' Slogan Remains 
BEDFORD, N.H. - Slogan-gate continues even as the final hours of the presidential campaign wind down. 
Signs all over the walls of the Romney Victory office here use the famous slogan of NBC drama "Friday Night Lights." In red, white and blue ink, the signs taped up around the office read: "Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose," the phrase, echoed by the heroic Coach Taylor to his underdog team before a football game.
It's an inspiring message for a volunteer operation that needs some last-minute inspiration as supporters face polls that place Mr. Romney with a slight disadvantage in the battleground state of New Hampshire. The only problem is that "Friday Night Lights" creator Peter Berg sent a terse note Mr. Romney last month accusing him of plagiarizing the slogan and asking him to stop using it on campaign materials. "Your politics and campaign are clearly not aligned with the themes we portrayed in our series," Mr. Berg wrote.
He said the only comparison between Mr. Romney and "Friday Night Lights" was in the wealthy, smooth-talking car salesman character Buddy Garrity "who turned his back on American car manufacturers selling imported cars from Japan," Mr. Berg wrote. 
Regardless of who wins on Tuesday, Mr. Berg can rest assured that the signs will finally come down this week. 
Below is a full copy of the letter, first published on The Hollywood Reporter:
Governor Romney:
I created the TV show "Friday Night Lights" and came up with the phrase "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose."
I was not thrilled when I saw that you have plagiarized this expression to support your campaign by using it on posters, your Facebook page and as part of your stump speeches. Your politics and campaign are clearly not aligned with the themes we portrayed in our series.
The only relevant comparison that I see between your campaign and "Friday Night Lights" is in the character of Buddy Garrity - who turned his back on American car manufacturers selling imported cars from Japan. Your use of the expression falsely and inappropriately associates "Friday Night Lights" with the Romney/Ryan campaign. Mitt, we all wish you and your family all the best. We are grateful for your support of our beloved show, but we are not in any way affiliated with you or your campaign. Please come up with your own campaign slogan
Sincerely
Peter Berg

 4:46 P.M. | Chilly Temperatures and Long Lines in Virginia 
FAIRFAX, Va. - In Northern Virginia, voters suffered through frosty temperatures, computer glitches and unusually long lines to cast their ballots. Both Republicans and Democrats shared one sentiment: relief that the long campaign was finally over.
"Commercials, campaign signs, five calls a day at home - I'm just glad it's all over," Lori Recher, a Democratic supporter, said after casting her ballot at an elementary school in Fairfax with her son in tow.
Fairfax County favored Mr. Obama overwhelmingly in the 2008 election and helped propel him to a key victory statewide. Democrats were eager for a repeat Tuesday, but Romney organizers saw a chance to steal a win as they pointed to polls showing a statewide race that was very close.
"For us to be this close in this area really says something," Monica Cameron, a precinct leader for the Romney campaign in Northern Virginia, said as she staffed a table outside Mantua Elementary School in Fairfax. Standing beside an American flag and a table draped in red, Ms. Cameron offered voters coffee and glazed doughnuts - but only after they had voted so as not to be accused of trading votes for doughnuts.
A computer glitch at some precincts in the region forced delays of several hours, and some would-be voters who showed up at the polls before 7 a.m. gave up and left in frustration, only to return later in the day once the computer problems were fixed. Many voters opted to use paper ballots because they said it was quicker.
"We've just been trying to calm people through the long wait," said Rod Bubeck, who coordinated the voting at the Mantua site. "It's working out."
By midmorning, the wait time was down from about two hours to 5 or 10 minutes, he said.
Tram Nguyen, associate director for Virginia New Majority, a liberal advocacy group that sent members to monitor polling stations, said it received ''numerous complaints across the state" about precincts failing to provide the required provisional ballots to residents who were not found on registration lists.
The group was also examining several isolated complaints of possible voter intimidation.
In the Richmond area, a heckler who Ms. Nguyen said appeared to be aligned with the Tea Party heckled voters for about an hour, making derogatory comments as they entered a polling place in a primarily black neighborhood, she said.
In Fairfax County, Ms. Nguyen said that her group received a complaint that a group of people outside a polling place in the Lorton area approached an elderly registered voter of Asian descent and told her, erroneously, that she needed to show her "naturalization papers" at the voting place under a new state law.
"She got so disturbed by this that she just got in her car and left without voting," Ms. Nguyen said.

 4:46 P.M. | House Races to Watch 
Waiting, waiting, waiting on the White House? Suspense making you want to cry? Why don't you spend a few minutes pondering some of the most exciting House races of 2012
Thanks to the powerful force of gerrymandering, the vast majority of the hundreds of races around the country are anticlimactic, with the party registration numbers in each Congressional district dictating the outcome. Republicans appear poised to hold their majority in the House and may even pick up a few seats, although Democrats are desperately hoping that states like California will deliver enough to give them a modest gain.
Many races have mirrored the fight for the presidency - tight, exciting and riddled with tough advertisements. While there are more than 10 competitive races, some of them even closer than the ones we have listed list here, these House races are 10 worth watching.
 California's 36th District 
For eight terms, Representative Mary Bono Mack, the Republican incumbent, has won in this largely blue state, and redistricting seemed to favor another good outcome for her. But she found herself in a scrappy fight against the Democrat, Dr. Raul Ruiz, an emergency room physician. Latinos make up nearly a third of the district's voters, and Ms. Bono Mack, one of the most moderate Republicans in the House, may have boo-booed when she said on the campaign trail that she would reach out to Latinos "after the election." Twist: If she loses, and her husband, Representative Connie Mack of Florida,fails in his Senate bid, they will be a married Congressional couple out of work.
 Colorado's 6th District 
As goes this district, so likely goes the presidential candidate in this western bellwether state. Representative Mike Coffman, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, is known for his colorful statements, including calling into question President Obama's American-ness, and his path to a third term narrowed after political mapmakers redrew his overwhelmingly Republican district to include near-equal amounts of registered Republican, Democratic and independent voters. His Democratic rival, Joe Miklosi, a state lawmaker, has struggled to raise money for his own campaign and has had to rely on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to keep afloat. 
 Florida's 18th District 
Representative Allen B. West is one of the few nationally known freshman Republicans, a former Army officer who in 2010 became one of only two black Republicans to be elected to the House since Reconstruction. A Tea Party favorite who works the talk-show circuit and is a fund-raising powerhouse, he is in a too-close-to-call contest with a wealthy construction executive, Patrick Murphy, and Democrats would love to see Mr. West go. This race has also featured some of the nastiest ads, in a year with a high bar for that.
 Iowa's 3rd District 
This race was the war of the nice guys. Iowa lost a seat after the 2010 census, and two veteran incumbents - Representatives Leonard L. Boswell, a Democrat, and Tom Latham, a Republican - found themselves facing off in a new district made up of a nearly equal number of Republican, Democratic and independent voters. The cash advantage went to Mr. Latham, who received a ton of fund-raising help from his B.F.F., the House speaker John A. Boehner. But more of the district is currently held by Mr. Boswell, and Mr. Obama enjoys a narrow edge in the state.
 Kentucky's 6th District 
Republicans have long sought to remove Representative Ben Chandler, first elected in 2004, but it seemed that he would escape the liability of President Obama at the top of the ticket. Mr. Chandler, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition who voted against Mr. Obama's health care law, gained a slight edge through redistricting and could still protect the seat he has held since 2004. But in the last few weeks, Democrats have been forced to spend money to defend Mr. Chandler against Andy Barr, a lawyer, who came back for more after losing to Mr. Chandler in 2010 by just 648 votes, and who Republicans now believe is going to have his day.
 Massachusetts's 6th District 
So, an openly gay Republican member of the House from Massachusetts? Get ready, as it could happen. Representative John F. Tierney, an eight-term Democrat, should have cruised to re-election, but he has been dogged with nagging questions about his in-laws' illegal offshore gambling enterprise. His opponent is the former State Senator Richard Tisei, an openly gay Republican who supports abortion rights, and polling shows Mr. Tisei heading into the last month of his campaign with a strong lead.
 New York's 27th District 
There are many close races in New York, and a few involving freshmen, but the first-term incumbent Representative Kathy Hochul is considered among the most vulnerable Democrats in the country. Ms. Hochul, a former county clerk, won her seat in a closely watched special election in a conservative district in the Buffalo area last year in a race that was viewed nationally as a referendum on a Republican proposal in Washington to overhaul Medicare. This year, redistricting has given her an even more Republican district than the one she had, and her well-known Republican opponent, Chris Collins, the former Erie County executive, has gotten a lot of help from his party.
 Pennsylvania 12th District 
Redistricting hurt Democrats in this state but nowhere more than here, where a member-on-member primary put a dent in their prevailing incumbent, Mark Critz who toppled Jason Altmire's moderate independence with his labor muscle in that primary. Republicans believe that they now have the Democratic opponent they want to face their candidate, Keith Rothfus, a lawyer and Tea Party favorite who lost by two percentage points to Mr. Altmire in 2010. The question will be: can Mr. Critz's labor fans outman Mr. Rothfus's in get out the vote operations and deliver him another victory, or will Mr. Rothfus succeed in painting him as too liberal for this new district.
 Tennessee's 4th District 
You should not even be reading about this race. Representative Scott DesJarlais, the Republican incumbent, was as safe as one can get. Then it was revealed that the anti-abortion Mr. DesJarlais appeared to have pressured a mistress to terminate a pregnancy. Things got less optimal for Mr. DesJarlais when Lloyd Daugherty, chairman of the Tennessee Conservative Union, said that Mr. DesJarlais, a doctor, should find a new line of work, saying: "He got elected on the same issue that he obviously does not have the same personal commitment to. It's the hypocrisy." It is still way uphill for the Democrat in the race, State Senator Eric Stewart, but watch it.
 Utah's 4th District 
Representative Jim Matheson, one of the last remaining Blue Dogs, is used to winning in a district and state where the Republican nominee for president always prevails. But this time, Mr. Matheson is in a battle against Mayor Mia Love of Saratoga Springs, who is looking to become the first black woman to join the House of Representatives as a Republican. Ms. Love is sure to have big coattails from Mitt Romney to ride, and her party is giving her strong support, but incumbency is not without its benefits, even in this district.

 4:41 P.M. | Free Beer and a Few Hiccups in Milwaukee 
MILWAUKEE - When the biggest problem is a bar handing out free beers, you know Election Day is going well.
Officials in Wisconsin, who are predicting a 70 percent turnout for their hotly contested state, said on Tuesday afternoon that voting had so far gone relatively smoothly, with few disputes or broken machines.
In fact, the state's Government Accountability Board took time to chastise Badger State businesses that have offered free or discounted refreshments - including a cold pint of brew - to anyone sporting an official "I Voted!" sticker.
"While this has not been a widespread problem, it is illegal under Wisconsin law, and businesses should not do it," election officials said in a brief statement.
There have been a few hiccups. In Milwaukee, a handful of precincts ran out of ballots or experienced equipment malfunctions, including one jam-up caused by an "I Voted!" sticker that slipped into the machinery. Most of the problems were fixed within an hour.
At two polling sites here, observers were asked to leave the premises after ignoring directions from local inspectors. The problems stemmed from technicalities, like standing too close to a voting table, rather than any evidence of intimidation or registration challenges, said Neil V. Albrecht, executive director of Milwaukee's election commission.
Mr. Albrecht said that Milwaukee's polling stations received "a significant volume of voter turnout" on Tuesday morning, and the city could be on track for a record. But rain and snow are expected across the region in the final hours of voting, which may discourage some residents.
Milwaukee's mayor, Tom Barrett, stopped by the city's French Immersion School after lunch, "just checking to make sure everything's moving smoothly," as he told a poll worker. The site had briefly run out of ballots toward the end of the morning rush; the inspector said that more arrived after a 30-minute delay. "That's a half-hour too long," the mayor said. "We need to call that in more quickly."
Still, with observers from opposing political groups seated near one another at polling stations, tensions did arise. Some suburban residents traveled into predominantly African-American areas of Milwaukee to serve as observers. At the French school, when confusion broke out in the morning over proper placement of some ballots, tempers flared and local lawyers arrived to sort out matters, according to an observer at the site. 
By noon, the polling station was peaceful once again.

 4:21 P.M. | Optimism Fills a Romney "Victory Office" in New Hampshire 
BEDFORD, N.H. - "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose," read several signs hung up around the Romney Victory office, the same slogan used by the inspirational Coach Taylor in the NBC drama about Texas football, "Friday Night Lights." Volunteers noshed on sandwiches and potato chips as they cranked out last-minute calls. Stacks of empty Dunkin' Donuts boxes and cartons of coffee lay on folding tables. Fox News played on a big-screen television in the background. 
If there was one sentiment across the office, aside from the obvious, "Vote for Mitt," it was to heck with political polls.
Romney volunteers said on-the-ground enthusiasm trumped recent polls that mostly show the battleground of New Hampshire slightly favoring President Obama. "I don't believe the polls," said Dana Lydstone, 61 and a small business owner. "No one I've talked to has even thought about going one way or the other. And no one screams that they're voting for Obama."
(Highlighting the last-minute rush and partisan sensitivity in this part of the state, Mr. Lydstone and other volunteers joked with this Times reporter that interrupting their calls to conduct interviews was part of a "liberal media" plan to distract voter outreach.)
Mr. Lydstone said he had never been involved in a political campaign before, but he said he felt as if this is the most important election of his lifetime. 
"The president wants to fundamentally change the country, to take us in a socialist type of direction," he said on a quick break from cranking out calls. "I was one of those people who thought when he got elected that he had a dynamic opportunity to do something good and he went in the opposite direction," he said of Mr. Obama. 
A nearby volunteer from Londonderry, N.H., agreed. "Our base is much more enthusiastic this year than they were four years ago," he said. "The polls are wrong."
Dylan Stanford, a 22-year-old volunteer, predicted that Mr. Romney would win nationally with 274 electoral votes and would win New Hampshire by two percentage points. "All the polls in 2004 showed Kerry up by four points in Ohio and then the magic happened and Bush pulled it off by two," Mr. Stanford said. He added: "Polling is an inexact science. You can find a poll anywhere that makes you feel good."
But ultimately, Mr. Stanford said, it's not about getting out the vote but that "this election comes down to who has more people stay at home."

 4:06 P.M. | One Immigrant's Barrier to Voting: Citizenship 
WEST DES MOINES, Iowa - As Jesus Castro stood behind the counter of his small grocery store here and began to talk about the election, he took out a small red box that almost instantly answered the question of why he would not vote yet again this year.
The words "Civics Flash Cards" were printed across the front of the box. Below those words was the seal of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
"I try and study when I'm at work but then someone comes up to the counter and I have to put them down," he said in an interview in Spanish.
Mr. Castro, 47, has never voted in his life. 
He never voted before he left Mexico in 1983.
And despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes he said he has paid and the three children he has had here, he said he had not participated in any of the eight presidential elections that have occurred since he came because he is not a citizen.
"I want to vote because I want to help Mexicans and Hispanics," he said.
Mr. Castro, who said he had a Green Card, can't vote because he has not taken the civics test, which is part of the process of becoming a citizen.
Although he can't vote, he had a stack of Obama pamphlets in Spanish at the counter.
He said that the Obama campaign had made a lot of effort to reach out to Hispanics. And, like many of his friends, he believes that President Obama understands the needs of Hispanics.
"Obama's doing more for Latinos," he said. "He's fighting for health care. He is thinking of all the people who come here, who pay taxes like me."
Mr. Castro said that he had a difficult time relating to Mr. Romney because he was so much wealthier than him. And Mr. Castro said he was offended by the fact that Mr. Romeny's father, who was born in Mexico to American parents, did not consider himself Mexican.
"If you are born in a country, you are a citizen of that country," he said. "Why wouldn't he want to call himself Mexican. My kids who were born in the United States are American citizens. He is lying about his roots."
Mr. Castro said that he planned take the civics test before the next election and finally cast his first vote at the age of 51.
"But I have always been in this situation," he said.

 4:09 P.M. | At Empire State, Red if It's Mitt, Blue if It's Obama 
In November 1932, a bright searchlight atop the Empire State Building signified that Franklin D. Roosevelt had been elected president of the United States.
Eighty years later, CNN's taking the idea a big step further, lighting up the building in red and blue as the presidential election results come in.
On Tuesday night, according to the cable news channel, a "meter" running up the building's spire will show the electoral votes that President Obama and Mitt Romney are projected to win. The gimmick will be televised on CNN from time to time via a camera on an nearby rooftop. NBC similarly showed the electoral vote count on the side of Rockefeller Center in 2008, and will do so again this year.
For decades the Empire State Building has been lit in different colors depending on the occasion. It's been used to recognize holidays, charitable events, corporate anniversaries and other events.
The partnership with CNN is an opportunity to show off a new lighting system that will allow the building's facade and mast to change colors in real time. "When CNN projects a winner of the presidential election, the tower lights of the Empire State Building will change color to all-blue or to all-red," the channel said in a news release.

 3:54 P.M. | Democrats Look to Mobilize Hispanic Voters in Colorado 
DENVER - Colorado's Hispanic vote will almost certainly be critically important in determining which candidate wins the coveted swing state.
With polls leading up to Election Day showing President Obama and Mitt Romney in a dead heat here, Democrats were especially hopeful that Colorado's sizable Latino demographic, about 20 percent of the state's total population, would turn out en masse at the polls on Tuesday.
"I would say at the beginning of the election season there was a lot more apathy," said Liz Hamel, lead organizer for Rights For All People, a local immigrant rights group that has been working with other local organizations to mobilize the Hispanic vote in and around Denver.
"A lot of folks were skeptical about the voting process. But now towards the end, we're seeing a lot more excitement. And a lot of the groups on the ground are connecting the issues being discussed by the candidates with Latinos," she said.
Efforts to reach Colorado's Hispanic voters have intensified during the last few days, especially in the city of Aurora, which has a growing Latino population. Matt Inzeo, spokesman for the Colorado Democratic Party, said he was hopeful that implicit support for the president would translate at the polls on Tuesday.
At Barnum Elementary School, in a primarily Hispanic area of Denver dotted with taquerias and Mexican restaurants, a sprinkle of voters came to cast their ballots during lunchtime.
"I'm for Obama. I think he connects more with lower-income people," said a 29-year-old housekeeper, Elaine, who did not want to give her last name.
Elaine said this was her first time voting, and that she had been motivated by Mr. Obama's support for health care reform in particular. 
"He hasn't had time to finish the job," she added. "He hasn't had time to finish making that change he talked about."
She flashed a smile. "It feels good to vote," she said. "I feel like I'm a big girl now."

 3:54 P.M. | An Unexpected Crowd for Romney 
MOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. - Mitt Romney landed here at Pittsburgh International Airport Tuesday afternoon to an unfamiliar sight: More than a thousand supporters who had spontaneously gathered to greet his arrival, lining the decks of a parking garage that overlooked the airport hangar.
Though Mr. Romney's campaign almost always sends out a press release with the details of all of his flights, Election Day was the first time any real crowd had turned out to watch him land and walk off his plane.
A visibly touched Mr. Romney walked over to the chain-link fence separating him from the voters, and paused for several moments, waving to the crowd as they cheered and waved back. He then offered a thumbs up, and later placed his right hand over his heart - an appreciative gesture he also did after the first presidential debate.
Asked how the impromptu crowd made him feel, Mr. Romney turned back to a group of reporters and said: "Well, that's when you know you're going to win."

 3:52 P.M. | Judge in Texas Extends Voting Time 
A state district judge in Galveston County signed an order Tuesday extending the voting time by two hours, in response to widespread delays earlier in the morning at polling sites, county officials said.
Judge John Ellisor of the 122nd Judicial District Court ruled that county residents could cast their ballots until 8:54 p.m. instead of 7 p.m. Those who are in line by 7 p.m. will have their votes counted in the traditional fashion, but those who show up between 7:01 p.m. and 8:54 p.m. will vote by provisional ballot, officials said.
"I think it's the right thing to do," said the county's top elected official, County Judge Mark Henry. "We would have liked for it to have gone perfectly and flawlessly, but that's not always possible when you've got so much technology involved."
County election officials said that some of the 45 polling sites were unable to begin accepting votes at 7 a.m., and experienced a delay of up to an hour before they were fully operational. The problems stemmed for the most part from poll workers failing to allow enough time to set up the electronic voting machines and the process of preparing the machines taking longer than anticipated, county officials said.
Local Democratic leaders accused county officials overseeing the election of disenfranchising voters and failing to properly plan and prepare. Lloyd Criss, the chairman of the Galveston County Democratic Party, said it was possible that a couple thousand people were unable to vote in the morning because of the problems, and left the polling sites because they had to get to work.
"How do we know who they were, and how do we get a hold of them to let them know time was extended?" Mr. Criss said. "It's just a mess. It's a mess. I'm irritated about it."
Mr. Criss said that he was considering filing a lawsuit against the county clerk, Dwight D. Sullivan, whose office oversees the administration of the election. Mr. Criss said at one polling site he visited, there were about 150 people in line at 7 a.m., and he watched many of them leave and head to their cars after waiting.
He added: "I asked them, 'Did you vote?' And they said, 'No, I couldn't, I have to go to work.' They're working-class people. They were minorities. Hispanics, blacks, some whites. It happened all over the county. It didn't just happen in one precinct."
"Whether it's on purpose or incompetence, the end result is people were disenfranchised, and I am really upset about it," he said.

 3:49 P.M. | An Undecided Voter in Florida 
MIAMI - Standing in line to vote, Debbie Gomberg gave no hint of her power. She is that mythical creature in the United States - the undecided voter - a class of person that is so rare, so elusive, that, when the people waiting next to her heard the news, they gasped.
"I'm one of those people," Ms. Gomberg said, almost under her breath as she bided her time in line in Miami's southern reaches.
"There's pros and cons to both parties," she said, referring to her mental back-and-forth between Mitt Romney and President Obama. "I think Romney is a business man who will be able to be more helpful to bring the economy where it needs to be. But his social policies ." She trailed off.
In a swing state that has been bombarded with political ads, Ms. Gomberg's indecision is unusual. At this point, political positions in Miami-Dade County, which voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, are sharply drawn. This year, the race for president here will be closer and an Obama victory is far from a given.
But back to Ms. Gomberg, who is 56 and is the director of safety for a management company. As soon as her neighbors in line (who are also her neighbors in real life), realized she still did not know what bubble to mark on the ballot, they made their pitch.
"You're a mother, do you feel that good about the state of things," asked Bonnie Williamson, 59, a Romney supporter. "He's a socialist," she said of Mr. Obama. "I'm scared to death."
"He's going to redistribute the wealth," said her husband, Tom Williamson, 64. The Williamsons mentioned, with foreboding, the film "2016: Obama's America."
"But things change," Ms. Gomberg said.
A short while later, it was over.
"Bonnie told me to vote my heart," she said, about her neighbor. "So I did. I voted for Obama," Ms. Gomberg said. "It was really a toss-up." Her husband, she said, is voting for Mr. Romney, so, in the end, there will a balance, of sorts. "I think this race will be very close."

 3:38 P.M. | Voting Machine Fixed After Reports of Malfunction 
A Pennsylvania voting machine that appeared to automatically switch a vote for Barack Obama to one for Mitt Romney was fixed after the malfunction and is now working normally, an official said.
A video widely circulated on the Internet appeared to show a voter trying three times to select the option for Mr. Obama on the machine's screen, and being automatically redirected each time to Mr. Romney.
Ron Ruman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections, said the machine, in Perry County, central Pennsylvania, was found to be malfunctioning when one voter tried to use it. It malfunctioned only once, for just one voter, and was then recalibrated and made available to other voters, Mr. Ruman said. 
"It was brought to the attention of election officials who turned the machine off and recalibrated it," Mr. Ruman said.
"It happened one time," he said. "It has been returned to service."

 3:30 P.M. | Ohio Voters Are Ready to Exit the Spotlight 
CINCINNATI - Whatever else the election outcome will mean, voters in battleground states like Ohio confessed on Tuesday that they felt relieved at the prospect of an end to a campaign that has felt the longest in places like this. A halt to all those political phone calls around the dinner hour each night, to the daily piles of direct mail, to the constant commercials that seem, by now, to fill every momentary pause on local television.
"We haven't had the ringer turned on on the telephone since July," said Matt Fleger, a firefighter, as he emerged from a voting place in Wyoming, Ohio, just north of Cincinnati. The flood of attention, these voters said, had been both the blessing and the curse of being in a state the presidential candidates need the most. 
In many cases, voters here said they felt fortunate to have had so much attention, and said they felt both better educated about the issues than they otherwise might have been and more obliged than ever - given all the focus on Ohio - to turn up to vote. Still, after all this, at least one voter here compared casting her ballot to finally getting a hot shower, washing off all the layers the long campaign had left behind.
Though George Tscheinr, 91, complained that his household received "10 calls a night, at least" and that the whole system "was crooked anymore," he still dutifully appeared at a library branch in Westwood to cast his vote for Mitt Romney. And though Robert Robinson, 47, said he thought it was wrong than any one set of voters should seem to matter more than others, he made sure to appear before noon to vote for President Obama, who he said had done a good job despite very trying economic circumstances. 
As he headed to his truck, Mr. Fleger, the firefighter, declined to say whom he had chosen for president. But he said he was a longtime Republican voter and a member of a labor union - qualities that made him a central target on both sides and ensured that the piles of campaign leaflets mailed to him have been huge.
"When it comes down to it, I have found both candidates frustrating," said Mr. Fleger, 38, who said his family has had to cut expenses for home repairs and entertainment to get through the economic downturn and carry two mortgages when one house failed to sell. "These politicians can't speak with a message that most Americans can relate to. Everything is so extreme. Americans know what it's like to scale back. But with these people, if you want to scale back defense spending, you're called a hippie. And if you want to cut human services, you're accused of starving the poor. I wish someone would talk about things in the middle so we could solve something."

 3:23 P.M. | A Few Hiccups Before Finally Casting a Ballot 
LAS VEGAS - Naiby Almaguer voted in an American election for the first time Tuesday. It was not entirely without glitches. 
An immigrant from Cuba, Ms. Almaguer, 30, works as a housekeeper at the Bellagio. She became a citizen in 2009. 
A week ago, she had surgery. Her doctor ordered her not to drive, so to get to the polls, she called the Latino organization Mi Familia Vota, which has been working in Las Vegas to register voters.
A volunteer from the organization picked her up at her apartment on Tuesday morning and drove her to the polls. But they went to the wrong place. 
It turned out that Ms. Almaguer had registered to vote at her old address. Sofia Sanchez, the Mi Familiar Vota volunteer, drove Ms. Almaguer across town. 
"I'm excited because it's my first time," said Ms. Almaguer after she cast her ballot at Valley High School. "I hope Obama wins. I like Obama. He's a nice guy. He's not such a bad president."

 3:13 P.M. | Judge Orders G.O.P. Watchers Inside Polling Places 
PHILADELPHIA - A judge here ordered that all Republican poll watchers be allowed into polling places, after reports that they were being excluded from some locations by Democrats.
The district attorney's office said early Tuesday afternoon that Judge John M. Younge issued the order allowing all "certified minority inspectors" access to polling places. The judge said sheriff's deputies would be sent out to enforce the order.
In heavily Democratic Philadelphia, "minority inspectors" is code for Republicans who may not have had any presence as poll watchers in previous years. With the addition of some G.O.P. watchers this year, they may not be recognized by established Democrats who have been staffing the polling places for years.
Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia district attorney's office, said in the early afternoon that her office had received 11 calls complaining that G.O.P. poll watchers had been excluded from some polling places.

Meanwhile, some voters are finding their names are not on voter lists when they show up to vote, according to the Committee of Seventy, a nonpartisan election watchdog for Philadelphia.
The Committee said it had received "numerous reports" of the problem, which it said seems to apply to any voters whose registrations were processed after Oct. 23. "An issue seems to be whether these new, late-processed registrations made it to the polling place on time for Election Day," the organization said in a statement.
Ms. Jamerson of the district attorney's office said registered voters whose names do not appear on the voter rolls would be allowed to cast provisional ballots. But the Committee of Seventy said it is hearing of some polling places where judges are declining to allow voters to vote provisionally, and has alerted the city commissioners.
The committee also reported that both voting machines at one polling place had broken down. Voters are being told to cast provisional ballots but at least 30 have just walked away, the group said.
Ms. Jamerson dismissed media reports that Black Panthers had been intimidating voters at some polling places. She said the district attorney's office had received 30 phone calls by 10 a.m. alleging such intimidation but that officials had found only one member of the militant group at a polling place, and that person was holding the door for voters, she said.

 3:09 P.M. | A Closer Look at Virginia 
If Mitt Romney loses Virginia tonight - and perhaps the presidency with it - Republicans might be wondering, what in the world happened?
The answer might be as simple as the drastic changes that have taken place in Loudoun and Prince William Counties, two suburban counties that once were mostly rural and mostly white and mostly conservative.
They are not anymore.
The changes are documented in two maps published by The New York Times that track the changes in voting and demographics. They provide what may be the clearest evidence of the challenge that Republicans like Mr. Romney face in the future.
In 2000, George W. Bush won Loudoun County by 15 percentage points over Al Gore. Eight years later, Barack Obama won the same county by eight percentage points over John McCain, a 23-point swing in less than a decade.
A fluke? In next-door Prince William County, Mr. Bush won by eight percentage points over Mr. Gore. In the 2008 election, it was one of Mr. Obama's best counties. He defeated Mr. McCain by 16 percentage points, a 24-point turnaround.
What happened?
The second map tells part of the story. In the years between the two elections, Loudoun and Prince William Counties were drawn into the Washington orbit, growing dramatically and becoming less rural. And in striking fashion, they became far less white.
Take Prince William: From 2000 to 2010, the county's population grew by nearly 50 percent. But nearly all of that population growth was among minorities. The number of African-Americans increased by about 50 percent while the number of Hispanics and Asians jumped by almost 200 percent each.
What had been a sleepy county that had once fought over development around Civil War battlefields now is a place gripped by the national debate about illegal immigration.
In Loudoun County, the changes are similar, but even more significant. For years, Loudoun had been home to the horse-riding set, but by the end of the decade, thousands of town homes had sprung up along its eastern edge, filled with government workers willing to fight the traffic into Washington.
The population of Loudoun almost doubled from 2000 to 2010. And minorities drove that growth. The number of Hispanics in Loudoun grew by nearly 300 percent. The number of Asians in the county increased by even more - 400 percent.
The demographic shifts alone do not necessarily guarantee victory for Democrats. But the trends are unmistakable, especially among Hispanic voters, who have tended to vote for the Democratic Party in huge numbers in the past several years.
If Mr. Romney manages to make inroads in Prince William and Loudoun today, he may win Virginia and the presidency. But if not, there's a good chance that the state's 13 electoral votes will go to President Obama.
Unfortunately for Republicans, that would be a sign of things to come, and a warning that once-reliable parts of the country are beginning to change.

 1:59 P.M. | Wisconsin Votes to Leave Endless Election Season Behind 
APPLETON, Wis. - Inside St. Bernard Catholic Church, voting seemed a festive occasion. Christmas lights lined the lobby wall above voting booths and winter snowflake decorations dangled from the wood-planked ceiling. 
By midday on Tuesday, a line stretched out the door as people waited to cast their ballots. "Four years ago there was a line to the street," said Medith Phillips, the head election official for the polling site, where more than 2,500 voters were registered. 
As in years past, voters had started arriving outside the church at 6:30 a.m., said Ms. Phillips, adding that nearly 500 early absentee votes in her wards may contribute to smaller lines this year. Still, she darted around the room helping a dozen other volunteers answer questions as voters trickled through. 
No one seemed to mind the delay. 
Wisconsin voters have endured a double dose of television attack ads and campaign calls in recent months - not just from the presidential race, but from a nail-biting senate contest that only got nastier as Election Day neared. 
"I don't think the sleaze is any greater," said John Stroebel, 40, who took the day off to vote with his wife and then go out for lunch to celebrate what they hoped would be an Obama victory. "I just think the volume has been getting louder." 
Factor in the divisive recall election that failed to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in June, and Wisconsin voters seemed relieved to finally put election season - and the onslaught of partisan messages that has clogged their airwaves for most of the year - in the past. 
"I can't wait until tomorrow and watch a full show without seeing a political ad," said a Green Bay resident, Amy Thurber, 42, who has been recording television programs and skipping over the commercial breaks. 
In Appleton, others were just happy to finally cast their ballot. 
Leaving the polling site, Carrie Huth, 18, an Obama supporter, smiled as she thanked the people who stopped to congratulate her on her first trip to the voting booth. 
Her mother, Dorothy, seemed calmed to have finally picked a candidate after dithering for weeks. On the drive over to the polling site, she was still undecided - torn between her belief in fiscally conservative principles and dislike of the direction the Republican Party leans on social issues. "For me, it wasn't an easy choice," she said, declining to reveal her final decision as she returned to the car.

 2:28 P.M. | Biden Votes and Hints at 2016 
There was no misty-eyed nostalgia for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as he emerged from a polling booth in Greenville, Del., on Tuesday morning.
Just weeks shy of 70, Mr. Biden grinned when a pool reporter, Mike Memoli from the Tribune Company, asked if this was his last time voting for himself.
"No, I don't think so," Mr. Biden replied. Naturally, the remark immediately reignited speculation about his 2016 ambitions.
But Mr. Biden was still focused on the 2012 race when he arrived at his polling place, Alexis I. duPont High School, just after 7 a.m. The vice president waited in line for about 11 minutes - declining an offer to cut from a woman in front, according to the pool report. Once he got into the booth, it only took him 20 seconds.
Mr. Biden's political career is longer, by far, than that of anyone else on either presidential ticket: he was 29 when he won his first U.S. Senate election. Today's vote felt as good as that first one, he told the pool reporter.
"I tell you what, you know, every time I do it - this is the eighth time that I've run statewide in the state of Delaware - it's always a kick, it really is, to see people out here," Mr. Biden said.
Then Mr. Biden headed to the airport, got on his plane and made an unannounced stop in Cleveland - landing within sight of Mitt Romney, who was waiting on the tarmac to hold an event with Representative Paul D. Ryan in Ohio - where he dropped in for coffee and conversation with the mostly black clientele at the Landmark Diner.

 1:57 P.M. | Obama Congratulates Romney on 'Spirited Campaign' 
CHICAGO - President Obama took a moment from the relentless pounding his campaign has been dishing out to congratulate his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, on Tuesday, as the two men began their final countdown to finding out which one of them will be sitting in the Oval Office next year.
During a stop at a local campaign office to thank volunteers, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Romney "congratulations on a spirited campaign." 
"I know that his supporters are just as engaged and just as enthusiastic and working just as hard today," the president said. "We feel confident we've got the votes to win, but it's going to depend ultimately on whether those votes turn out."
Mr. Obama spent the morning making calls to volunteers to thank them. Because he already voted early two weeks ago - the better to set an example since his campaign has been depending heavily on early vote turnout among supporters - Mr. Obama couldn't take advantage of the traditional Election Day photo-op of the president going to his polling location to cast his ballot. 
He did plan, however, to take part in another tradition, the Election Day basketball game, which he and friends have played on the day of each one of his elections.
The president was surrounding himself with friends, familiar faces and old campaign hands from his 2008 glory days. On this Election Day in Chicago, Team Obama was uniformly presenting a picture of cautious optimism. They all seem to think the president is going to win. But none of them is sure enough about it to avoid offering a caveat that Mr. Romney could pull it off somehow, even during private conversations with the news media.

 1:46 P.M. | Obama Mural Covered After Image Appears on Twitter 
A judge in Philadelphia ordered poll workers to cover up a mural depicting President Obama at a school on Tuesday, after a photograph posted on Twitter, showing voting machines set up in front of the president's image, spread rapidly across the social network.
Valerie Caras, the communications director for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, drew attention to the image, taken by one of the party's volunteer election monitors at the polling place for Philadelphia's 5th Ward, 18th Division, inside the Benjamin Franklin Elementary School.

Just an hour later, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Tim Miller, posted an image on his Twitter feed, showing the order to have the mural covered, which was issued by Judge John Milton Younge, a Democrat.

The mural appeared to pay tribute to President Obama's 2008 campaign, featuring the words "hope" and "change" on either side of his image, and a quote from a speech he gave during the Democratic primary campaign that year, on Feb. 5, 2008, in which he said: "Change will not come if we wait for some other person or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek."

 1:41 p.m. | For Romney Camp, Enthusiasm and Exhaustion, With One Exception, Age 7 
CLEVELAND - Hours after the polls opened, Stuart Stevens was on the attack.
Mr. Stevens, Mitt Romney's senior strategist, prowled the aisles of Mr. Romney's private plane, Nerf gun in hand, aiming it at unsuspecting reporters. Then, something out the window caught his attention.
Peering out on the tarmac here, where Mr. Romney had just landed - one of two last-minute stops on the final day of the election - Mr. Stevens observed the vice president's plane, Air Force Two, also idling on the runway.
"I thought they said that it was panic that we were campaigning today," Mr. Stevens deadpanned.
Just after noon on Election Day, the mood on the Romney campaign was lighthearted, and even upbeat. Mr. Romney was joined on his final swing by Bob White, a close confidant whom he jokingly calls his "wing man"; Garrett Jackson, his personal assistant; Kevin Madden, a senior adviser; Rick Gorka, the campaign's traveling press secretary; and his oldest son, Tagg, as well Tagg's oldest son, Joe.
Mr. Romney's aides seemed relaxed if exhausted. Mr. Madden told reporters that he had hardly slept; the campaign had arrived back at their hotel late Monday night after a huge rally in New Hampshire, and he'd had to get up in the predawn dark for a TV appearance. Mr. Gorka wandered to the back of the plane holding a "Gorka doll" - a miniature replica of himself that a member of the campaign's finance team had ordered after Mr. Gorka had a foul-mouthed explosion in Poland, during Mr. Romney's foreign trip.
Both Mr. Madden and Mr. Gorka said they were eschewing Twitter for the day. Nothing good, they joked, could come from monitoring tweets on Election Day.
Upon landing in Ohio, Mr. Romney waited on his plane until his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, arrived on his plane - "The Flying Badger." Mr. Ryan boarded Mr. Romney's cabin to applause.
And then the two men were off, heading to a "Victory Center" - basically a campaign phone bank and office where volunteers are trying to turn out every last voter - to greet supporters.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ryan's three young kids - Liza, Charlie and Sam - filed off their plane and onto the tarmac, where they were joined by a coterie of cousins and Mr. Ryan's wife, Janna, to toss around a football.
By the time Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan headed to grab lunch at Wendy's, most of the Ryan clan had tired of football. But Mr. Ryan's youngest son, Sam, 7, was still giddy with energy.
From the window of the room where the traveling press corps was waiting, he could be seen below, running around - and around - in circles.

 1:12 P.M. | The First 'Social Media Election'? 
Is this the first "social media Election Day"? Judging by the number of posts and photos being uploaded to Twitter, Instagram and other platforms, it certainly looks that way.
Depending on how you slice it, about half of the top-10 trending topics on Twitter at the moment are election-related (one is a promoted hashtag, #VoteObama; Halo 4 and the Cypher Kids Club have also made appearances). The Times asked readers to let us know about their election day experiences with the tag #tellNYT (specify where you voted, what you saw and how it felt) and early reports are flowing in. (We are sharing a selection on the nytimes.com homepage.)
Some are noting long waits and some chaotic conditions, often in frigid weather:

On Instagram, where we asked users to use the hashtag #NYTelection - a selection can be found here - photos are showing a combination of long lines, elaborate signage, first-time voters, and, in some cases, individual ballots. (Readers should take care on that last category, since, as a a report by ProPublica notes, it is illegal to share your ballot or photograph inside a polling station in some states, including Hawaii, Colorado and Michigan.)

 12:59 P.M. | Showing ID in New Hampshire 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Frank Dubisz, a 72-year-old registered Independent, played a joke on his polling administrator when he cast his ballot for Mr. Obama at the Bishop Leo E. O'Neil Youth Center near downtown Manchester. 
When the administrator, a neighbor he's known for years, asked for his photo identification, he thumbed through a giant wad of cards in his wallet, finally settling on his Sam's Club membership card. "She said 'That's good!'" he said. "It's one thing if she didn't know me, but I've voted in this ward for 50 years."
Stephen B. Stepanek, a conservative state representative seeking re-election to New Hampshire's Hillsborough District 6, stood outside his polling location in Manchester's Ninth Ward. He wore a button that said "NObama" and held a Romney-Ryan sign. He said the state's new law that requires voters to present photo identification or sign a sworn statement is "a great thing and a long time coming."
According to his local survey, at least 40 to 50 homes in Manchester have residents listed as registered voters who no longer live in the state. "I know a guy who hasn't lived in this district in 35 years and he's still registered," Mr. Stepanek said. "You need a photo ID to cash a check. You should need one to vote."
When asked about the Obama campaign's concerns that the law could scare away voters who hadn't previously participated in the political process, Mr. Stefanik said, "That's just an excuse because they're scared they're going to run out of Democrats."
Barbara E. Shaw, a Democrat seeking her seventh term as a state representative for Hillsborough District 16, voted against the law. "If there was evidence of fraud, it'd be different," she said. "There are always people who will try to do something sneaky but most people just want to vote."

 12:26 P.M. | 'Sick of Fighting' 
KENSINGTON, N.H. - This 2,200-person town is a bucolic enclave, nestled just north of the Massachusetts border. It is a swing town, in a swing county, in a swing state. As Lee Veader headed to the polls on Tuesday morning, he was hoping the day would bring relief from what he said was the most acidic election he can remember, with partisanship as rife in his own social circles as it has been on cable television.
"There's really people that we're close with that are willing to let politics end relationships - we're talking friends that you've been friends with for years that all of a sudden can't get past not sharing the same viewpoint," said Mr. Veader, a registered Republican who lives here and works in sales. "People really feel strongly how they stand nowadays. It's not as gray as it used to be - because of that, it just gets personal."
Mr. Veader, who voted for Mitt Romney for president, said he had tried to be quiet about his choice so as not to provoke tension - which has been exacerbated, he said, by people's ability to share their political views over social media. "With everyone having access to Facebook, Twitter, they're saying things I don't think they'll be able to take back."
Alia Elwy, a 19-year-old student at the University of New Hampshire, said social media had given her pause over the course of the campaign, too. Ms. Elwy said she had been shocked by what she described as racist comments by acquaintances and classmates here about the election posted to Facebook. "I never really realized how much racism there was here," she said. "They're just repeating the same things - Obama is a terrorist, he's in cahoots with Al Qaeda - things are so out there, they don't even make sense."
"I'm glad it's over. I'm sick of fighting, I'm sick of political ads, phone calls, all these things," added Ms. Elwy, who voted for President Obama.
Diane Chigas, an independent voter, also planned to vote for Mr. Obama as she rushed into the polling place here on her lunch break from her job as a receptionist at a law firm. It is the Affordable Care Act, she said, that came to the fore of her mind as she made her decision. "I had to work through two years of chemo so I wouldn't lose my insurance," said Ms. Chigas, "I'm not a pre-existing condition. I'm a person."
Beverly Clarke, a 62-year-old volunteer at a local food pantry, said she was excited to vote for Mr. Romney. Health care costs, she said, have eroded the middle class, and she has been frustrated by high property taxes and tight budgets here. "We don't have streetlights, sidewalks, we have part-time fire and police," said Ms. Clarke, who is a registered Republican. "I really think he could pare down some of these tax issues," she said of Mr. Romney. "He will put things into their proper perspectives - give things back to the states to run."
Dennis Carroll, a retired small-business owner, said he had tired of Mr. Obama's rhetoric on taxes and was planning to vote for Mr. Romney. "He's doing class warfare. I'm not a rich guy, but they pay their fair share. How much more does he want them to pay?" Mr. Carroll asked.
Mr. Carroll said he was also distrustful of Mr. Obama's record on foreign policy: "I don't feel safe with this guy. He bows down to everybody, he doesn't rule with strength."
"My husband's being very kind," said his wife, Jo, suggesting that Mr. Carroll had used stronger language at home.
Inside the polling place, the election moderator, Harold Bragg, stuck ballots into a wooden box and steeled himself for the task of counting them all by hand later this evening. "It's been very busy, we have yet to see a break this morning," Mr. Bragg said. "I'd say we're doing three to one what we normally do."

 12:25 P.M. | 'A New Hampshire Citizen First' 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - At Bishop Leo E. O'Neil Youth Center near downtown with its rows of government-subsidized housing and redbrick buildings, Eric Thoman, a 51-year-old former software engineer on disability, stood outside holding a Romney-Ryan sign. Mr. Thoman, a registered independent, voted for Mitt Romney because, he said, he felt that President Obama had expanded the role of the federal government. 
"I'm a New Hampshire citizen first, and a Manchester citizen before that," Mr. Thoman said. "Limited government is good government."
- Amy Chozick 
 12:18 P.M. | A First-Time Voter 
CHERRY HILLS VILLAGE, Colo. - The excitement of voting for the first time nearly overwhelmed Lorena Cantarovici, an immigrant from Buenos Aires who became an American citizen three years ago.
Ms. Cantarovici, who owns a Denver-area empanada restaurant, beamed as she emerged from Cherry Hills Village Elementary School after casting her first vote in an American presidential election. 
"It felt fantastic. After 11 years of fighting to become a citizen and all the complications, it is very important for me to participate right now," she gushed. "The United States is asking for my vote. It's incredible!"
Ms. Cantarovici left Argentina 11 years ago and landed in Denver through a friend, hoping for better economic opportunity. And she credited President Obama's economic and immigration policies with allowing her restaurant to flourish and enabling her to become a citizen. In return, he got her vote.
The difference between voting in Argentina and the United States was not lost on Ms. Cantarovici as she marveled at how extensive and organized the electoral process seemed to her. 
"Here, the campaign process is fantastic. Just seeing the future presidents debate is great. It's so great," she said. "In Argentina, you go more for who your family votes for. If you come from a family that is Peronista, you are Peronista too."
And despite the large numbers of Coloradans who decided to vote early, there was no way Ms. Cantarovici was going to miss out on the experience of experiencing the polls in person. 
"I was waiting for today. Everyone was telling me, 'You can go and vote before,'" she said, laughing. "'No, I want to vote the day you need to go and vote!'"

 12:12 P.M. | Lines in Milwaukee 
MILWAUKEE - In Milwaukee's northern neighborhoods, an African-American enclave where President Obama enjoys wide support, some residents said they had waited as long as 90 minutes to vote, longer than any other election in their lives.
At Rufus King High School, several hundred residents were lined up by 6:45 a.m., 15 minutes before the polls opened. By 8:30 a.m. at Washington Park Library, nearly 100 would-be voters stood, grim-faced, in a line that circled the glass lobby and then snaked all the way up a staircase. "I should've voted early," one woman said, shaking her head. "This is ridiculous."
High turnout accounted for most of the long lines, although there were scattered reports of damaged voting machines, including a breakdown of the single machine at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, which led to some voters' leaving in frustration. The machine was back up after a half-hour wait. 
"We figured we'd wait till everybody went to work, but looks like a lot of people are out of work," said Donnie Beene, 63, as he gestured toward the dozens of people lined up on the sidewalk in front of Atkinson Library, near West Capitol Drive. A few passing motorists shouted out to friends in line, leading the voters in a chant of "O-ba-ma!"
As she left the library's polling place, Hazel Johnson said it had taken her 90 minutes to cast her ballot. "I've never waited that long," she said. The library, she said, was far too small a site for a smooth operation, and at one point an ambulance had to be called because a man with diabetes fainted. But she said she did not see any problems or irregularities. "And I was looking!" she added, with a laugh.
Mr. Beene, at the back of the line, said that he originally had some doubts about giving Mr. Obama a second term. "That was until people started learning the truth" about Mr. Romney, Mr. Beene said. Drawing laughs from the crowd, he offered his definition of trickle-down economics: "Give to the rich, and hopefully we'll get some."
After voting at the Children's Outing Association on West Burleigh Street, Theresa Pelmore, 22, explained her vote for Mr. Obama this way: "I believe everybody deserves a second chance." Ms. Pelmore said that she had finished school, where she trained as a medical assistant, but that she had not been able to find work for nearly a year. "I don't know who I blame for that," she said. For the president, "it was hard, because he came in having to deal with what President Bush left behind."
Chris Mortorff, an observer for Mitt Romney's campaign and a law student in Chicago, made the hour-and-a-half drive to Milwaukee in the car he shares with his wife, who is nine months pregnant. "She said she wasn't having the baby today," Mr. Mortorff explained. In several hours at the polls, he said he had seen only one irregularity, when poll workers did not ask residents for a proof of address when they tried to register to vote. (In Wisconsin, residents can register on the day of the election.) The problem was quickly corrected, he said.

 11:59 A.M. | A Frustrated Voter in Westchester County 
Randy Harter, 66, an artist and designer, voted in New Rochelle, in Westchester County, N.Y., at 6 a.m. and said his frustrating experience was symptomatic of incompetence in government. It was an issue that was on his mind because of what he described as an incompetent response to Hurricane Sandy in an area where thousands of houses still have no power more than a week after the storm struck.
He said he asked an election worker how to fill out a paper ballot he had never seen before and was told: "Just fill it out." When his ballot was inserted, the machine jammed, he said. A second worker came over and brought another machine, and it too jammed. He eventually was given an envelope in which to place a ballot that would be hand counted. The entire voting experience took 45 minutes, Mr. Harter said.
"Morons are running things, and nobody's in charge," he said afterward.
He said he voted for President Obama. "He inherited a government that's incompetent, and he's trying to fix it," Mr. Harter said.

 11:53 A.M. | Voting for Romney in Chicago 
CHICAGO - Here in a heavily Democratic city in a heavily Democratic state, Ken Selvig, a resident of the South Loop, is voting against the grain. In a sea of blue, he is a flash of red: the elusive Chicagoan who is also a Romney supporter.
"You stay quiet about it," he said, only half joking. "It's not something you see much on the surface around Chicago, but there are a few of us."
While Mr. Selvig, 45, voted for Mitt Romney, it was not with an incredible amount of enthusiasm.
"It's not that I really, really like him," said Mr. Selvig, who works in the legal field. "I'm not gung ho about Romney. He's not like Reagan, funny and charismatic. But I just prefer him. It's not about being a nice guy. I'm sure Obama is a nice guy. This election is all about the economy."
He continued: "It was all hope and change last time. It's hope and change again, but in the opposite direction. I just think we need a change because of the state of the economy."

 11:48 A.M. | Voting in Philadelphia 
PHILADELPHIA - Kristin Luebbert, 53, a seventh- and eighth-grade teacher in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia, said she voted for President Obama, as she did in 2008, because she believes Mitt Romney lacks specifics in his pitch to voters and isn't concerned about ordinary people.
"I don't think he really has a plan," she said. "I don't think he really does care about the little people."
Felicia Brown, 43, a respiratory therapist at a Philadelphia hospital, said she had been ready to produce identification to polling officials, but found it wasn't necessary. 
A Pennsylvania law passed this year would have required voters to present official ID but was put on hold by a judge after opponents argued that it would have disenfranchised groups such as the elderly and the poor who do not have driver's licenses or other forms of officially approved ID.
Ms. Brown, speaking outside a polling place in West Philadelphia's Parkside neighborhood, said she voted a straight Democratic ticket because she believes that Mr. Obama needs another term to complete the work of his first four years. In previous elections, she said, she had voted for some Democrats and some Republicans among federal and state candidates for different offices, but backed all Democrats this time.
Ms. Brown said she would not vote for Mitt Romney because he had "contradicted himself" on some issues including health care, and she believes that he would lessen women's rights to abortion and family planning if elected president.
The economic crisis that confronted Mr. Obama when he came into office was "not his fault," Ms. Brown said, and he needs another term to put it right.

 11:40 A.M. | Waiting to Vote in Colorado 
COMMERCE CITY, Colo. - At a community center here on the outskirts of Denver, a line of people snaked through the lobby as the polls opened at 7 a.m., Tuesday morning.
Many Coloradans voted before Election Day - either by mailing in their ballots or voting in person at early-voting locations - but some people clearly wanted to cast their votes in person. 
"I got here early because I didn't want stand in line," said Jimmy Gilbee, 59, who voted for President Obama, saying he thought the president should get four more years to implement his policies. "It was quick, and it was easy."
David Rolla, a 60-year-old retired teacher, said he decided to show up in person because he worried his vote would get miscounted if he mailed it in.
"Remember what happened in Florida," said Mr. Rolla, who also supported Mr. Obama. "I had to be here in person."
Here in Adams County, Mr. Obama won by about 30,000 votes in 2008. But Republicans were hoping to make inroads in the sprawl of politically mixed Denver suburbs along Colorado's front range.
According to numbers released Tuesday morning by the Colorado secretary of state, Scott Gessler, more than 1.8 million Coloradans had voted before Election Day. 
Of that number, some 675,797 Republicans and 642,834 Democrats voted early, evidence, ostensibly, that Republicans have been pushing people to choose early. 
More than half a million unaffiliated voters also cast their ballots early - perhaps the most critical number in a state where such voters make up a sizable slice of the electorate and have the power to turn elections.
"We feel very good about our position," said James Garcia, state director for the Romney campaign. "We've been leading the early vote throughout the entire way and the same with the mail in returns. That's a huge chunk of Colorado."

CHICAGO - Here in the heart of President Obama's hometown, where he is planning a huge victory party in a cavernous convention center tonight, is there any surprise that voters are cheering for one of their own?
Enthusiasm may have waned in other parts of the country since the president was swept into office on the promise of "hope and change" in 2008, but Chicago is still enchanted with the candidate some people lovingly refer to as "our guy."
And no one wants to see their guy lose.
"I'm just ready for the next phase of change," said Bianca Murray, 29, a South Sider who voted early this morning for Mr. Obama. "It didn't take four years to get our country into this economic state, and there's no way it would have taken only four years to fix it."
Ms. Murray thinks Mr. Obama actually has more support now than in 2008. "If anything, I think the ones who weren't with him the first time are now more on his side."
Why?
"It's personal now," she said. "The insults, the attacks, how much the middle class has to lose if Mitt Romney wins. People know they will feel pain, personal pain, if the other side wins."
Gabe Morton-Cook, 30, agreed. "I've been an Obama supporter all along," he said. "The last four years, his progress has been stifled by Congress and I'm confident that in the next four years, he can make the progress he's been wanting to."
For Ms. Murray, a hotel clerk, and Mr. Morton-Cook, a graphic designer, voting today was exciting. Their votes were cast enthusiastically, not simply out of obligation.
"Everybody I know has been pretty excited about this," Mr. Morton-Cook said. "And any election this close is bound to get people out to vote."
A reporter wondered if Mr. Morton-Cook and his friends had been unduly influenced by the amount of good feelings in Chicago for Mr. Obama.
"No," he said. "That can't explain it because I just moved here from Minnesota."
Ms. Murray said the high spirits locally might have influenced her vote. "Of course we want our guy to win," she said.

LAS VEGAS - As he left his polling place here today, Bob Cole, a retired casino security guard, said he was happy that the campaign was over.
A registered independent, Mr. Cole said he received about a dozen robocalls nightly during the campaign. One of them was from former President Bill Clinton, asking him to vote for someone in Michigan.
"I don't have anything to do with Michigan," Mr. Cole said.
Mr. Cole said he erased the messages nightly.
Despite being an independent, Mr. Cole said he voted a straight Democratic ticket.

 10:47 A.M. | Ryan Votes in Janesville 
JANESVILLE, Wis. - Representative Paul D. Ryan and his family arrived at the Hedberg Public Library at 8:40 Tuesday morning. Moving to the head of a line in a second-floor room, Mr. Ryan and his wife, Janna, waited for a poll worker to find their names in the registration book. As she flipped pages, Liza Ryan, 10, pointed to the entry and said, "Paul D. Ryan."
At a second table, the Ryans picked up their ballots, and Mr. Ryan shook hands with a few polling volunteers he knew.
"You know who this is, don't you?'' he asked his three children as he shook one man's hand. 
"You keep in touch with Larry?'' Mr. Ryan said to another man.
The family moved to a line of folding tables to mark their ballots. 
"Come on, Sam, let's do this together,'' Mr. Ryan said to his youngest child, 7, who increasingly enjoyed the campaign in recent days, flashing V-for-victory signs once his father finished a speech and stepping to the microphone at one event to say, "One more day!"
Mr. Ryan marked his ballot as Sam and Liza looked on. Mrs. Ryan voted with Charlie, 9, who has proved shyer on the trail, often ducking behind a barrier onstage while his father has introduced him. 
Both voting-age Ryans fed their ballots into an Optech III-P Eagle machine. It sucked in the cardboard ballots, scanned them electronically and deposited the "paper trail" in a bin below, according to a poll worker. 
After he stepped from the room, Mr. Ryan said: "I feel great today. It's a great tradition. It's Election Day. I'm very excited to be here. I've been voting here a long time."
"It felt good waking up in my hometown," he added. "It felt good coming to this neighborhood I grew up in. I went to junior high about 60 yards that way. So it's great to be here in my hometown. It's great to vote, and we're really excited."
Asked if he expected to win, Mr. Ryan said: "I think we are. I feel good about it."

 10:26 A.M. | Looking to Turn Wisconsin Red 
GREEN BAY, Wis. - It has been nearly three decades since Wisconsin voted for a Republican presidential candidate - not since Ronald Reagan in 1984 - but some voters here believe that could change this year. 
If that historical trend is upended, it will be in part to the credit of a recent uptick in Republican enthusiasm in the state and a G.O.P. ground game that was honed while fending off a union-backed recall election that failed to oust Gov. Scott Walker, a conservative, just a few months ago. 
"It just seems like the Republicans are so much more a force, stronger," said one woman who declined to give her name but said she voted for President Obama. "They've gotten their message out." 
That recall election bitterly divided the state along partisan lines. And after a wave of Republicans victories in the State Legislature during the 2010 midterm elections, some here are wondering if conservative momentum in Wisconsin will be enough to help overthrow an Obama presidency. 
Steven Steinbruecker, 40, a Republican supporter who has his own electronics repair business, did not hesitate when asked how well he thought Mitt Romney would do statewide. "I think Romney's going to run away with it," he said, citing the recall win and the vice-presidential candidate, Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, for his confidence in a more eager conservative electorate in the state this year. "I think 'excited' is the wrong term, but I think we're tired of Democrats." 
John Seybold, 50, another Romney backer, said many people here would cast their vote for the former Massachusetts governor on Tuesday because they were discouraged about the direction the country is heading in - not only economically, but also morally. "It wasn't Adam and Steve, it was Adam and Eve," he said, apparently referring to Mr. Obama's support of same-sex marriage. "If you believe in God, you have to vote for Romney." 
Even Obama supporters at one polling site in Green Bay said they had seriously considered supporting Mr. Romney until late into the campaign. Others said the end of the election and the torrent of get-out-the-vote efforts, whatever the outcome, could not come soon enough. 
"I'll be glad when it's over with all the door-knocking and the phone calls," said Diane Basten, 70, a public school kindergarten teacher who backed Mr. Obama. "I would easily say we had at least 500 calls in the last month."
- Steven Yaccino 
 10:24 A.M. | After Prison, Hoping to Vote 
LAS VEGAS - One hopeful voter here is Clyde Davis, an ex-offender who wants to cast his ballot today for President Obama. Mr. Davis said that he recently went to a grocery store to vote early but was told that his voting rights had been negated. Mr. Davis served time in prison for burglary.
Today, he is waiting for paperwork from the prison system that will permit him to vote. He's hoping the documents will be ready in time to cast his ballot.
"I felt terribly upset," Mr. Davis said. "I know every person's vote counts, and I was expecting to vote for the candidate that I saw would best suit America as far as the people were concerned. They just wouldn't let me vote."
Mr. Davis, 31, has been working with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Advancement Project to get the paperwork in order. He is one of at least 18 Nevadans who were turned away during early voting because of felony convictions and are now working with the two groups to have their rights restored.
The A.C.L.U. estimates that more than 165,000 ex-offenders in Nevada are not registered to vote, partly as a result of a complex system for restoring voting rights.

 10:23 A.M. | Hoping to Seal the Deal 
MANCHESTER, N.H. - The nondescript basement of an office park here buzzed with activity early Tuesday morning. The walls were covered with makeshift signs directing Obama campaign volunteers on how to get New Hampshire voters to the polls. Signs written in marker gave phone numbers for voters to call to schedule a ride to the nearest polling spot.
"We'd like to seal the deal with the voter," Russ Roy, a 58-year-old software engineer, told a group of canvassers before they hit the nearby streets. He gave them one last piece of advice: "We're being pushy, but we're being nice-pushy, O.K.?"
Mr. Roy had been volunteering for President Obama's re-election effort for four months. He supported John Edwards in the Democratic primary in 2008 (a "bad choice," he said) and decided to get involved because of the "divergence of choice" in this campaign. "I don't worship at Mr. Obama's feet," he said. "But for the most part he's done an enormous job at putting us back on track."
Obama volunteers said it was particularly important this year that voters who have not participated before understand the process. "We need to make it crystal clear that no one will be turned away, no one will be denied for lack of identification," Mr. Roy said. "We're going to dispel any fears people have."

 10:30 A.M. | Whiplash in Brown County 
GREEN BAY, Wis. - Not far from the Fox River, flecks of snow began to fall as voters filtered into this city's bus station to cast their ballots early Tuesday morning.
While President Obama has led in statewide polls, Republican efforts to turn Wisconsin red this year may hinge on some northern areas of the state, including counties around Green Bay, that have shown a wide partisan swing in past elections. 
When Norman Thurber, 49, arrived to vote on Tuesday, he still had not yet decided who he thought the next president should be. He had been wrestling with it for weeks, trying his best to avoid an onslaught of negative advertising while he made up his mind. 
Life has not been easy since he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. Mr. Thurber has been out of work since 2009, when his 20-year construction business collapsed with the housing market. "It's hard to find people who want to build houses," he said, describing how he went from being a licensed contractor to doing renovation work to being unemployed. "It's hard to find anyone who wants to invest in anything." 
But he was also reluctant to back Mitt Romney, he said. "I feel like I'm being forced to choose between one of two devils," he said. "I don't think that either candidate has what it takes to get the country where it needs to be." 
So he waited until the final possible moment to make up his mind. "I won't know until I walk in there and make a choice," he said. 
Fewer places have seen more partisan whiplash in Wisconsin than here in Brown County, where the lawn signs appear to be equally divided between the two major political parties. In 2004, President George W. Bush beat John Kerry in the county by 10 percentage points. In 2008, the county flipped in Mr. Obama's favor by almost the same amount. In the years since, Republicans took it back when they elected Gov. Scott Walker in 2010 and rebuffed a union-backed attempt to recall the conservative governor this year, winning both of those elections with double-digit margins. 
Armondo Diaz, 30, a forklift driver for a mail distribution company in town, said he was planning to vote for Mitt Romney until about a month ago. He changed his mind after the president displayed stronger performances in the final two debates, and said that he believed that Mr. Obama deserved a second chance. 
"I think the economy wasn't fixable in four years no matter who was in there," he said. "Pretty much any president I vote for, I give a second term. I did the same for Bush."

HEADLINE: Nov. 5: Late Poll Gains for Obama Leave Romney With Longer Odds

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama appears to have gained ground in the closing days of the race: among 12 national polls published on Monday, he led Mitt Romney by an average of 1.6 percentage points. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has always had difficulty drawing a winning Electoral College hand. Even during his best period of polling, in the week or two after the first presidential debate in Denver, he never quite pulled ahead in the polling averages in Ohio and other states that would allow him to secure 270 electoral votes.
But the most recent set of polls suggest another problem for Mr. Romney, whose momentum in the polls stalled out in mid-October. Instead, it is President Obama who is making gains.
Among 12 national polls published on Monday, Mr. Obama led by an average of 1.6 percentage points. Perhaps more important is the trend in the surveys. On average, Mr. Obama gained 1.5 percentage points from the prior edition of the same polls, improving his standing in nine of the surveys while losing ground in just one. 
Because these surveys had large sample sizes, the trend is both statistically and practically meaningful. Whether because of Hurricane Sandy, the relatively good economic news of late, or other factors, Mr. Obama appears to have gained ground in the closing days of the race.

The national polls now range from showing a 1-point lead for Mr. Romney to slightly more than a 4-point advantage for Mr. Obama. The FiveThirtyEight forecast of the national popular vote is within this range, projecting Mr. Obama's most likely margin of victory to be two or three percentage points, approximating the margin that George W. Bush achieved in defeating John Kerry in 2004.
Averaging polls together increases their sample size -- making them much more powerful statistically than any one poll taken alone. But the errors in the polls are sometimes correlated, meaning there are years when most of them miss in the same direction. Mr. Romney remains close enough to Mr. Obama that he could fairly easily win the popular vote if there is such an error in Mr. Obama's favor this year.
Mr. Romney's chances are less, however, of winning the Electoral College. The large majority of polls in battleground states over the past three days have shown leads for Mr. Obama. On Monday, for example, 19 battleground state polls found leads for Mr. Obama, as compared with just three for Mr. Romney.
Ohio remains the largest problem for Mr. Romney, where he has been behind in most polls all year. Mr. Romney might ordinarily take some solace in the fact that Ohio is slightly Republican-leaning, but the auto bailout may have changed its character this year, as there is evidence that Mr. Obama is performing more strongly with working-class voters in Ohio than he is elsewhere in the country.
Mr. Obama could secure the Electoral College by winning Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania, along with Ohio.
A win for Mr. Romney in Wisconsin would now qualify as a substantial upset. He has not led in a poll there since August, and an increasing number of surveys there instead show Mr. Obama five or more points ahead.
Mr. Obama's margins have been narrower in Nevada, but Mr. Romney has a different type of problem there: perhaps 70 percent of the state has already voted, and Democrats have locked in roughly a 7-point advantage over Republicans from the vote so far. This margin is down for Democrats from 2008, but Mr. Romney would nevertheless need an exceptional turnout on Tuesday to make up enough ground.
This has led Mr. Romney to make a last-minute play for Pennsylvania, and there is some evidence that the state has tightened slightly. But the gains for Mr. Romney may be too little and too late, or they may have been counteracted by a national trend toward Mr. Obama. With the exception of one Republican polling firm, public polls of the state still have Mr. Obama leading by three to nine percentage points.
Moreover, Mr. Obama has a number of backup options were he to lose one or more of these states. In Iowa, Mr. Obama leads by about three percentage points in the average of polls, and by a similar margin in New Hampshire. Recent polls also suggest movement toward Mr. Obama in Colorado and Virginia, and he now appears to be favored in each one.
Florida remains too close to call. The FiveThirtyEight forecast has the race there within two-tenths of a percentage point, which would be close enough to trigger an automatic recount. 
Only in North Carolina, among the battleground states, has Mr. Romney had a reasonably consistent polling edge over the final week of the campaign.
If the national popular vote winds up roughly tied, instead of favoring Mr. Obama by two points or so, then Mr. Romney could claw back to win Florida, Colorado and Virginia, and perhaps Iowa and New Hampshire. But Mr. Obama's lead in Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania is clear enough to withstand some underperformance in the polls, and his margins in the polling averages there have converted into a victory on election night a very high percentage of the time historically.
In order for Mr. Romney to win the Electoral College, a large number of polls, across these states and others, would have to be in error, perhaps because they overestimated Democratic turnout. It's this possibility, more than the chance of a successful hail-mary in a state like Pennsylvania, that accounts for most of Mr. Romney's remaining chances of winning the Electoral College. 
There is also the chance that Mr. Obama could finish toward the higher end of the polling range in most states. If Mr. Obama has gained a point or two nationally because of Hurricane Sandy or other factors, then polls taken before it may underestimate his standing in the individual states as well. 
The FiveThirtyEight forecast accounts for this possibility through its trendline adjustment, which is why our forecasts now are slightly more optimistic for Mr. Obama in some states than a simple average of polls. Had there been evidence of late movement toward Mr. Romney, the trendline adjustment would instead have worked in his favor.
But Mr. Romney's chances of winning the Electoral College have slipped, and are now only about 8 percent according to the forecast model -- down from about 30 percent 10 days ago.
The most notable recent case of a candidate substantially beating his polls on Election Day came in 1980, when national surveys had Ronald Reagan only two or three points ahead of Jimmy Carter, and he won in a landslide instead. That year is not comparable to this one in many respects: the economy is much better now, there is not a major third-party candidate in the race, and Mr. Obama's approval ratings are about 50 percent rather than 35 percent for Mr. Carter. And in 1980, Mr. Reagan had late momentum following the presidential debate that year, whereas this year the momentum seems to favor Mr. Obama.
All of this leaves Mr. Romney drawing to an inside straight. I hope you'll excuse the cliche, but it's appropriate here: in poker, making an inside straight requires you to catch one of 4 cards out of 48 remaining in the deck, the chances of which are about 8 percent. Those are now about Mr. Romney's chances of winning the Electoral College, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast
As any poker player knows, those 8 percent chances do come up once in a while. If it happens this year, then a lot of polling firms will have to re-examine their assumptions -- and we will have to re-examine ours about how trustworthy the polls are. But the odds are that Mr. Obama will win another term.

HEADLINE: The U.S. Election Campaign That Was and What to Watch Tonight

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: It's Election Day in America and you know what that means. Yes, lawyers fanning out to polling stations from sea to shining sea. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - The debate about the place and the role of the United States in a rapidly changing world grows ever louder and, sometimes it seems, more urgent: China is ascendant while the liberal free-market West is beset by a crisis of confidence, cleavages between politicians and their constituents and ideological civil wars; the United States is a debtor nation, indebted to China, the second largest economy in the world after the United States and closing fast; America, supposedly the mightiest military in the world, has recently fought two wars in the Middle East and won neither. 
Still, nothing quite sums up the reality that the United States remains, as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright put it, "the indispensable nation," as does the attention the world pays to what are, technically, strictly U.S. domestic affairs.
That will be the case today as millions of Americans turn out to vote - though probably in relatively anemic proportions, compared to other democracies around the world.
Rendezvous has chronicled the more than $2-billion campaign between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, from a stubbornly global perspective: from the candidates' use of China as a cudgel to attack each other, to China's umbrage -- and Henry Kissinger's; to the challenges facing whoever wins the White House in the post-Arab Spring Middle East; to the chill between Mr. Romney and European conservatives; to most of the world's alleged preference for an Obama victory tonight.
Now its Americans' turn to tell us what the story is. Many have already voted, taking advantage of so called "early voting" in many states. But anticipating voting disputes - and with the horrific memory of 2000's seemingly unending election in mind - both campaigns have dispatched teams of lawyers to watch for any shenanigans and, in a quintessentially American rite, sue.
While you wait for the polls to close in each state here's a list of the times, the point at which mainstream news organizations will start to declare each state (if a result is clear), you can read and manipulate some of the most informative graphics anywhere on the web:
The Swing State Tracker lays out the stakes in each swing state, the visits there in the last days of the campaign by the candidates and their spouses and the probability of a candidate's winning the state, as determined by the model of the FiveThirtyEight blog.
My favorite graphic is the one that shows, based on which of the nine most competitive states a candidate wins or loses, how many paths, or scenarios for the remaining states, could still take him the White House. You have to play along using this interactive graphic as the results roll in on Tuesday night in America to see what the most important next dominoes are.
Throughout Tuesday, into Wednesday in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, www.nytimes.com will carry the latest news from polling stations around the country. I'll be hosting a political show on www.nytimes.com at 10 New York time on Tuesday morning. And later I'll be co-hosting our livestreamed coverage of the election results from The New York Times newsroom in New York at 7 and 10 New York time Tuesday evening. 
 I promise to put to the reporters and editors covering the election the best questions from RDV readers. So put yours in the Comments below. See you then.

HEADLINE: Republicans Censor What They Can't Refute

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: By forcing the Congressional Research Service to withdraw a report that found no link between tax cuts on the wealthy and economic growth, Republicans put ideology ahead of economic reality, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
On Sept. 14, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a report, one of hundreds it puts out every year, titled "Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of Top Tax Rates Since 1945." Although the C.R.S. reports are not released directly to the public, they tend to leak out within days. The New York Times posted this one on the Economix blog on Sept. 15 because of its provocative conclusions.
In essence, the report, written by the economist Thomas L. Hungerford, who has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Michigan, concluded that changes in the top statutory tax rate and the rate on capital gains had no discernible effect on economic growth in the period since 1945. It noted that the top rate was over 90 percent in the 1940s and 1950s, 70 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, 50 percent during most of the 1980s and has been below 40 percent ever since.
These changes were correlated with various measures of saving, investment, productivity and gross domestic product growth. No relationship could be found.

Intuitively, everyone knows this is true. The 1950s are today considered almost an idyllic era, economically, in which most families could prosper with only a single breadwinner. The top tax rate was well above today's top rate of 35 percent in the 1960s and during Ronald Reagan's administration, two periods of exceptional growth.
And, as I often note, growth increased after Bill Clinton raised the top rate to 39.6 percent in 1993 from 31 percent, contrary to every Republican's expectations, and growth has been stagnant since George W. Bush reduced the top rate to 35 percent in 2003, as well as slashing the tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 15 percent.
Republicans assured us that these measures would lead to rapid growth. They did not.
Right-wing think tanks were quick to jump on the Congressional Research Service report. In brief blog posts on Sept. 17, both the Heritage Foundation and the Tax Foundation simply dismissed its conclusions without offering any remotely convincing evidence of error. Their purpose was not to offer a serious critique but rather to send a signal to Republicans in Congress that the study contradicted party dogma.
Republicans believe, as we know from the infamous video of Mitt Romney speaking to supporters or the interview with the financier Edward Conard in the New York Times Magazine in May, that the world is divided between makers and takers. The rich are the makers, and they must be given the maximum incentive to work, save and invest. The takers contribute nothing; the rich carry them on their backs.
Tax cuts for the rich and for corporations are the core Republican idea for how to jump-start growth. That is why Mr. Romney proposes to keep the 15 percent tax rates on dividends and capital gains permanently and drop the top statutory rate to 28 percent, as well as to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.
Therefore, the Congressional Research Service report was a political threat that Republicans had to quash - and fast, with the election looming. According to an article in The New York Times on Nov. 2, a number of Senate Republican offices complained to the head of the C.R.S. about the report and succeeded in having it taken down from its internal Web site, accessible only by those within Congress.
It is not known precisely what objections were made beyond the insignificant points raised in the Heritage and Tax Foundation blog posts. All C.R.S. reports undergo thorough internal review by experts with advanced degrees in their fields before they are released, and this particular report was also reviewed by an outside expert as well. All the reviewers signed off on the report as consistent with generally accepted statistical techniques and with the published literature.
Among those who have commented on the C.R.S. report publicly is Prof. Alan Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, who is among the nation's leading public finance economists. He told Bloomberg Businessweek that he agreed with the report's findings.
Further supporting the report's conclusions is a July 24 paper by the economist Owen M. Zidar, also of the University of California, Berkeley. It concludes, "The empirical relationship between tax cuts for the top 10 percent and job creation is negligible in magnitude, statistically insignificant and much weaker than that of equivalently sized tax cuts for the bottom 90 percent."
One problem with cutting through the assertions and responses to them about taxes and growth is that a lot depends on where you are starting from and what other policies are being enacted simultaneously. It was much more plausible for Reagan to argue that dropping the top rate to 50 percent from 70 percent would stimulate growth than it was for President Bush to say that a reduction to 35 percent from 39.6 percent would do so.
In Reagan's case, those affected by the top rate went from keeping 30 cents on their last dollar to keeping 50 cents - a 67 percent increase in their after-tax reward. In Bush's case, the increase was from 60 cents on the dollar to 65 cents - an 8 percent increase in incentives.
Elsewhere, I have noted that federal purchases increased significantly under Reagan because of his military buildup and that Federal Reserve policy strongly supported growth in the early 1980s. Today, there is enormous pressure to cut spending and the Fed is severely constrained by the fact that its target interest rate is already at zero.
The appropriate response for Republicans critical of the Congressional Research Service report's findings would have been to convene a conference, at which I am sure the author would have gladly participated, or to get the House Ways and Means Committee, which is under Republican control, to call a hearing.
Getting the report withdrawn smacks of censorship. Andrew Rosenthal, editor of The New York Times's editorial page, commented, "Congressional Republicans seem to think that the C.R.S. should function like Pravda." Pravda was, of course, the official organ of the Soviet Communist Party.
The irony is that the Republican effort to quash the report has led to it getting vastly more attention than if they had simply ignored it. Censorship has a funny way of doing that.

HEADLINE: The Belly of an Architecture

BYLINE: CLARISSA SEBAG-MONTEFIORE


HIGHLIGHT: Architecture in China is bold and unapologetic, but it embodies China's rapid growth in less positive ways, too. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Late last month, I attended the opening of the British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid's latest work, the Galaxy Soho. A gargantuan structure of white curved orbs connected by sky-bridges, it towered over the squat, Soviet-style buildings nearby - like a spaceship just landed in downtown Beijing.
Thousands of people had turned up to see the new structure unveiled. They swarmed three floors of indoor balconies, straining to catch a glimpse of Hadid giving a talk in an inner courtyard below. Despite the crush, the atmosphere was giddy.
The people of Beijing seem excited about how their city is being shaped. And so they should be. Architecture in China today is bold and unapologetic.
But it embodies China's rapid growth in less positive ways, too. Although the industry is buoyant these days, its long-term benefits for the people who live here are questionable. Too often, form trumps function.
The creative space given to architects in Beijing - despite complaints that too many are foreign - offers a welcome distraction to the ambient ugliness. Beijing is seeped in gray, and notable for vast boulevards and imposing squares, clogged ring roads and the drab tower blocks that line them. Until recently, relief from this bleakness could be found mainly in remarkable imperial sights, the historic hutongs - of which a tiny percentage are now left - and a handful of funky areas like 798 Art Zone, a former factory area that was converted into an art district beginning in the late 1990s. 
Since Beijing won the bid to host the Olympic Games in 2008 construction has been rabid. But if impressive new buildings are improving the city's look, the real gems are few and far between. Concerns about visual context are less pressing here than in much of the United States or Europe. Ultimately, Beijing's skyline is being shaped by politics more than anything, leading to poor urban planning and questionable construction standards.
Many buildings created to inspire awe stand on huge, inhuman streets - themselves designed for cars rather than people - behind menacing gated squares. Iconic buildings, including those designed for the 2008 Olympics, have scant regard for the individual. The iconic "Egg," or National Center for the Performing Arts, is a gorgeous dome completely surrounded - and shielded - by a pool of water.
Poor construction - a byproduct of fast development, corruption and unskilled migrant laborers - also is a stain on Beijing architecture. Last summer, a large panel toppled from the sheer glass front of the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, the state-owned institution responsible for large-scale public design; it remained unfixed for months. 
Or take Sanlitun Soho, a project opened in 2010 by SOHO China Limited, Beijing's largest real-estate developer and the company behind the new Hadid building. Designed by the renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Sanlitun Soho's five shopping malls and nine office and apartment buildings cluster around an outdoor waterscaped courtyard. The complex is intimidating. Its commercial space is largely empty, thanks to a glut of malls elsewhere in Beijing. In winter, racing winds howl through the courtyard. Some finishings are already scuffed from lack of upkeep, giving the development a desolate feel.
Last month, just as I walked out of the Galaxy Soho after the glitzy opening, I stepped into a mega traffic jam on the 2nd ring road. However smooth and white the building's interior, the world outside remains noisy and chaotic.

HEADLINE: The Big Day, but More Uncertainty to Come

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: It may be Election Day, but the outcome won't end uncertainty for Wall Street. | Morgan Stanley is betting that Colm Kelleher has what it takes to revive its securities unit. | Mark E. Tucker, chief executive and president of the AIA Group, is joining Goldman Sachs's board. 

 BODY:
THE BIG DAY, BUT MORE UNCERTAINTY TO COME | It may be Election Day, but the outcome won't end uncertainty for Wall Street, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. Regardless of whether President Obama or Mitt Romney wins, the business world will face a series of political unknowns that could last through much of next year.
First up is the so-called fiscal cliff, the tax increases and spending cuts set to go into effect on Jan. 1. "Many investors have already begun selling stocks and companies in anticipation of tax increases," Mr. Sorkin says. Then there is Europe. And the Middle East. And the question of who will take over for Ben S. Bernanke at the Federal Reserve. "Over the next year and a half, Mr. Bernanke's future as the Fed chairman will feed a sense of uncertainty among investors who have become accustomed to his easy money policies."
As the fight over the fiscal cliff drags on, "investors could be among the biggest losers," writes The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Unanswered questions have led one investment strategist, David Joy of Ameriprise Financial in Boston, to recommend shunning riskier investments, according to Reuters.
MORGAN STANLEY TAPS A TRADER | 
Morgan Stanley is betting that Colm Kelleher has what it takes to revive its securities unit. The firm chose Mr. Kelleher, rather than Paul J. Taubman, his partner and rival, to become the sole president of the unit in January, a job that involves persuading clients "who rely on Morgan Stanley for advice on mergers and stock sales to use it for trading services as well," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced and Susanne Craig write. Trading seems likely to remain a focus. One analyst, Glenn Schorr of Nomura, said the task of getting "fixed income right" falls "squarely in Colm's world."
The strategy contrasts with that of another firm, UBS, which is drastically scaling back its trading business, Antony Currie writes in Reuters Breakingviews. Morgan Stanley controls about 7 percent of the fixed-income market, "at best half the share of the biggest player, JPMorgan," Mr. Currie notes. The stakes are high for Mr. Kelleher, who is now positioned to be a possible successor to the chief executive.
ON THE AGENDA | The election is finally here, bringing the most expensive presidential race in the country's history to a close. Wall Street will also be watching some important Senate races closely, including in Massachusetts where Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, is facing off against the incumbent Scott Brown, a Republican. NYSE Euronext , AOL and Office Depot report earnings before the opening bell. News Corporation announces results after the market closes. AOL's chairman and chief executive, Tim Armstrong, is on CNBC at 10:40 a.m. and on Bloomberg TV at 11:15 a.m. Pete Peterson is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Simon Johnson, professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is on Bloomberg TV at 8 p.m.
GOLDMAN'S NEW DIRECTOR | Mark E. Tucker, the chief executive and president of the Asian life insurance company AIA Group, is joining Goldman Sachs's board as its 12th director. Mr. Tucker brings experience in Asia and in the banking and insurance industries, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, said in a statement. He was selected to lead AIA in July 2010 by Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive, as AIA was preparing to be spun out of A.I.G. through an initial public offering, according to a Bloomberg News article at the time.

HEADLINE: Europe's Problems Likely to Loom Post-Election

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Europe only earned a rare mention during the course of the U.S. election campaign. But the economic fate of the Continent is likely to loom large in the calculations of whoever occupies the White House for the next four years. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As Americans headed out on Tuesday to choose their next president, there was no disguising the fact that Europe was feeling singularly left out.
Europeans take an almost proprietorial interest in the U.S. political process. If the United States is leader of the free world, then Europe has liked to regard itself as at least an influential, if junior partner in that global enterprise.
In this year's election campaign, however, the Continent has barely figured, except as a negative example for the Republican campaign of all that is wrong with socialist state intervention and budgetary laxity.
"Thirty-five mentions for China, 27 for Israel and only one for the old Continent," the French newspaper Le Figaro wrote this week, recalling the final Obama-Romney foreign policy debate on Oct. 22.
From left to right, European leaders were privately rooting for Barack Obama, according to the French daily. But, with no prospect of European issues influencing the outcome, one senior official reflected: "What's the point of speculating?"
New Europe Online commented in an election-eve analysis:
As Europe keeps its eyes on the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election, it has come to the realization that the continent no longer carries the necessary geopolitical clout to influence the calculus of Washington's foreign policy in the region and beyond.
Europe may have been largely ignored during the course of the campaign, but there seemed little doubt that its chronic problems would soon land on the desk of whoever occupies the White House for the next four years.
"The euro zone is a $17 trillion behemoth, the largest economic bloc in the world, whose members are struggling to solve a complex crisis across 27 countries and nearly as many different economic cultures," according to an article in Foreign Policy magazine.
"And the debt crisis consuming the United States' largest trading partner is arguably a much more immediate threat than Iran, Libyan terrorism, or any other foreign policy issue the candidates have discussed."
According to a recent paper for the Center for European Reform: 
"Regardless of the outcome of the presidential election, the euro zone crisis will be a source of major U.S. concern. Officials in the Obama administration identify the E.U.'s inability to solve its economic travails - which threaten to harm America's economic prospects - as their biggest frustration with Europe."
Ronald H. Linden, a political scientist at Pittsburgh University's European Union Center of Excellence, noted that the European Union was by far the most important economic partner for the United States and vice versa. 
"Since job creation and the economy are the major issues for the American public, restoring growth in the European economies plays an important part in the American recovery," he wrote in an article published by the E.U's Institute for Security Studies.
If the fate of the U.S. economy is tied so closely to that of Europe, it raises the question why European issues figured so little in the campaign.
Nick Schifrin, London correspondent for ABC news, suggested in the Foreign Policy article that both candidates had an interest in not talking about the European debt crisis and that the U.S. was constrained by its own economic problems from doing much about it.
However, he concluded: "If the United States has any hope in finding a stable economic path within its own shores, the next administration will have to figure out a way out of the Euro zone debt crisis. Maybe it's time they started talking about it."

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Romney's Last Pre-Election Rally

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: At his final rally before Election Day, Mr. Romney took the stage after 11 p.m. after a brief performance by Kid Rock. The crowd shouted "U-S-A" and waved "Romney-Ryan" and "Women for Mitt" signs. The Republican candidate took it all in. 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Even Mitt Romney looked a little surprised to see a crowd of 13,000 and several thousand more waiting in the below-freezing temperatures to get into the Verizon Wireless Arena here Monday night.
At his final rally before Election Day, Mr. Romney took the stage after 11 p.m. after a brief performance by Kid Rock. The crowd shouted "U-S-A" and waved "Romney-Ryan" and "Women for Mitt" signs. Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, took it all in.
"These last months of our campaign have seen the gathering of strength of real movement across the country. It's evident in the size of these crowds like this tonight - my goodness," he said, to applause. "And I understand that there are a few thousand people outdoors who couldn't get in, too."

It was a homecoming of sorts for Mr. Romney, who kicked off his presidential campaign in New Hampshire, first in the Republican primary and then in the general election. Polls have tightened in the state recently, with Mr. Romney by most measures trailing President Obama by a few percentage points.
"This is a special moment for Ann and for me because this is where our campaign began," Mr. Romney said. "Your primary vote put me on the path to win the Republican nomination. And tomorrow your votes and your work right here in New Hampshire will help me become the next president of the United States!"
Standing in front of a giant blue sign that read "Real Change on Day One," Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of worsening the partisan divide in Washington and caring "more about a liberal agenda" than the economy. "I won't waste any time complaining about my predecessor," he said. The crowd roared.
That sentiment struck a particular chord with Stefan Skalinski, an 18-year-old high school senior who said he planned to vote for Mr. Romney on Tuesday. Mr. Skalinski, bedazzled in Romney-Ryan buttons and bumper stickers stuck on his sweatshirt, hovered by a heat lamp waiting to get into the Verizon arena.
"After the past four years Obama keeps blaming Bush, but he's done nothing," Mr. Skalinksi said. He shook his head, "He promised us so much change in 2008."
Martha Garron, 52, held a homemade sign that said, "Hope is not a plan." She shivered outside the arena waiting to clear security and get inside.
"We wanted to see Romney before he becomes president," Ms. Garon said. She said the economy was the most important issue, but that Mr. Obama had let her down on other counts. "It's everything," she said. "And Libya to boot."
As a former governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney feels a particular closeness to neighboring New Hampshire, which only carries four electoral votes but has a particularly high voter turnout and a large number of independent voters who can sway the state's electoral votes. His final campaign rally carried a mix of exhaustion (particularly by the traveling press corps who had an hourlong bus ride to Boston ahead of them when the event ended), nostalgia for previous victories in New Hampshire and anxiousness to see what Tuesday's vote brings.
"We're one day away from a fresh start, one day away from the first day of a new beginning," Mr. Romney said. "My conviction is that better days are ahead."
The size of the crowd at the Romney rally might not translate to voters. Many of the attendants said they had driven in from nearby states - Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey - to see the event.
David Perry, a 60-year-old director of development at the Boy Scouts of America, and his wife drove two-and-a-half hours from their home in Windham, Conn., to attend the Romney rally. "I've got five grandchildren and I don't want to leave an enormous debt for them," Mr. Parry said. "I think there's a real crisis going on in America."
Amanda Fiedler, a 21-year-old senior at Gordon College, a Christian school in Wenham, Mass., drove to Manchester with a few friends because she said they are scared they will not find jobs when they graduate. "Obama has had four years to improve the unemployment rate," she said. "We're all worried about getting jobs."

Mitt Romney and Barack Obama appear to agree about at least one thing on this tense Election Day: They are standing on mutually exclusive party platforms, offering Americans what Obama called "the clearest choice of any time in a generation." The candidates - and their partisans - insist voters are deciding today between a country that will be prospering or bankrupt, with a foreign policy that is firm or flaccid, and with abortion either remaining legal or abruptly outlawed. Nevertheless, after Inauguration Day, the challenges of governance, unexpected events, and the strong, confining American center will probably blur these differences.
The president, whoever he is, will frequently disregard party principles. These White House deviations will occur despite the black-and-white rhetoric inflaming our blue-vs.-red politics, in which shades of gray - once the big tent party pol's favorite color - only seem welcome on best-seller lists.
Successful presidents must be nimble not doctrinaire. They should prefer center-seeking to partisan drum-beating, respecting many Americans' historic desire for consensus and the office's constitutionally limited powers. Most foreign crises are unpredictable. Many social issues are beyond presidential reach. Five Republican presidents, from Richard Nixon through George W. Bush, failed to shake the American consensus that abortions should be safe, legal and rare - half the population might embrace the "pro-life" label but three-quarters want most abortions legal. And many of the chief executive's economic, diplomatic and military decisions and maneuvers are so complex and so constrained by other forces, that presidents sometimes even enact policies they campaigned against to become president.
In their sexist parlance, nineteenth-century Americans debated which was more important, "The Man or the Platform." By mid-twentieth-century, cynics defined the platform as "what you start by running on and end by running from." Today, the person clearly eclipses the policy positions. Political pronouncements are more postures than promises, more feints than faits accomplis. Candidates first woo the party base in primaries, then swing toward the center seeking centrist swing voters. "Issues are only a means to establish personal qualities with voters," the pollster Robert Teeter told Gerald Ford's staffers in 1976. "Personalities," he added, are "far more important."
When George Washington first stood passively for the presidency, the election nevertheless pivoted around his virtuous character. He had neither party nor platform. Awaiting the people's call in dignified silence, he feared any statement could be "construed into a vain-glorious desire of pushing myself into notice as a candidate." Once the spread of democracy produced strong parties and active candidates, the debates revolved around whether a nominee even stood by the party platform when campaigning. In 1880, the New York World claimed that most voters did not "hold a candidate responsible" for fatuous party compromises; candidates defined themselves. Today, we wonder whether the winner even stands on the platform when governing, as ideologues from the ruling party then grumble privately about their independent, pragmatic presidents.
As parties evolved from extra-constitutional improvisations that the framers feared to dominant vehicles for recruiting candidates and mobilizing voters, nominees sought independence. Increasingly parties wanted their candidates standing on platforms - originally a French term referring to a building's foundation that Americans first used to describe a church's principles. The abolitionist crusader William Lloyd Garrison then popularized the term to mean one's political foundations; so standing on the platform was a more stable and communal act, while stumping - from standing on a tree stump while campaigning - was individualistic.
The Democrats enacted America's first real party platform in 1840. Four years later, James Knox Polk, possibly America's most efficient president, articulated three goals and met them - to reestablish the Independent Treasury system, lower tariffs and acquire Oregon, California and New Mexico. But these were Polk's personal goals. The Democrats' 1844 platform never mentioned the words treasury, tariff, California, or New Mexico - an inauspicious beginning for these party manifestos.
At the time, rivals mocked candidates who were too deferential to the platform. In 1856, Republican newspapers called James Buchanan's devotion to the Democratic platform "meek and submissive demagoguism." The Republican zealot Thaddeus Stevens sneered, "There is no such person running as James Buchanan. He is dead of lockjaw. Nothing remains but a platform and a bloated mass of political putridity." Three years later, the Republican journalist E.L. Godkin observed that the failures of Buchanan and his ineffectual predecessors "convinced everybody that the man is of far greater importance than his creed."
Two Democratic debacles particularly infuriated party bosses. In 1864, General George B. McClellan reversed the Democratic platform's priorities, choosing the preservation of the union over achieving peace - prompting the New York Daily News to demand a new convention "either to remodel the platform to suit the nominee or nominate a candidate to suit the platform." Eight years later, the Democrats nominated Horace Greeley, who was already representing the renegade Liberal Republican Party trying to reform the Republican Party he helped found. But Greeley's decades of Democrat-bashing embarrassed the nominee and his new allies. As the campaign ended, Greeley moaned: "I have been assailed so bitterly that I hardly knew whether I was running for the presidency or the penitentiary."
During the Gilded Age, strengthened parties - learning from the corporations then emerging how to be more centralized - demanded more loyal candidates. Elaborate notification ceremonies, ritualized offers of the nomination by a delegation representing the convention, who were greeted with an increasingly detailed acceptance letter read publicly, bonded the nominee, the party and its platform. Politicians debated whether they preferred a Samuel Tilden, the 1876 Democratic candidate whose 4400-word acceptance letter promoted himself not the platform, or the less eloquent, less prolix, and less feisty 1880 Democratic candidate, General Winfield Scott Hancock, who preferred to "let well enough alone." Turgidly Hancock explained: "I have no right to mar the present situation of the party by a set of expressions, superfluous to its adopted platform of principles, with which I am in full accord."
This person versus principle divide was not partisan. Democrats and Republicans usually decided what kind of candidate they liked based on what kind of candidate they had, because partisans can tolerate almost anything except their rivals. Traditionalists concerned with a candidate's character opposed modernizers seeking an "educational campaign" pitched on principle. A more sophisticated nation demanded a more sophisticated campaign. In this "age of telegraphs and fast mails the people think, and know what they want," Representative Charles A. Boutelle of Maine said.
Party platforms, filled with "platitudes," generate political noise, no better than the "brass bands and torchlight processions which are expected to attract the citizens' attention, although they may not affect his judgment," said the Missouri Senator George Graham Vest in a symposium, "The Man or the Platform," the North American Review published in 1892. Voters "prefer in the candidate courage and honesty to high-sounding declamation in the platform." Representative J.C. Burrows of Michigan disagreed, arguing that the platform's "party principles" were "stronger than the convictions and purposes of any one man, and in the end will surely prevail."
Such debates rarely erupt today. The system seems shorn of ambiguity. Individuals run hard in primaries, detailing their policy stands - although critics mocked Richard Nixon's flamboyantly earnest claim in 1968 that he had issued 167 position papers: they suggested he make it an even 170 by addressing the Vietnam War, the cities, and Civil Rights. Modern conventions now mark the nominee's conquest of the party, which includes dictating the platform. Platform committees mix party ideologues trying to maintain doctrinal purity with the nominee's loyalists, who want to win. But everyone knows the platform will be scrutinized. During the recent brouhaha after the Democrats dropped their Jerusalem and God platform planks, it was hard to believe that President Barack Obama and his people had not vetted the platform. It was, however, completely believable that Obama then insisted on fixing the problem, and the Democrats accommodated their party leader.
Yet pride of authorship rarely translates into ironclad commitments - presidents from both parties have failed to move America's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem despite both party's rather consistent promises since 1972. Positions are ideological cufflinks not handcuffs. Many presidents have defied their own mandates. In foreign policy, the clarity of convention calls frequently dissolves amid the moment's messiness. That is how in 1916, Woodrow Wilson's platform declaration, "He kept us out of war," failed to keep America out of World War I. And that is why George W. Bush mocked Bill Clinton for nation-building during the 2000 campaign but after 9/11 began trying to nation-build.
The traditional American gravitational pull to the center has also reoriented many politicians once they viewed the world with Rose-Garden-shaded glasses. American presidents have succeeded best by leading from the center. Even radical sounding candidates like Ronald Reagan understood that moderates make the best presidents. The commander in chief must lead all the people not just one party, a point Obama emphasized in 2008, and which Romney followed once he started debating in 2012. This nurturing of consensus not fomenting faction explains how, running against the New Deal and promising an "economical administration" did not stop President Dwight D. Eisenhower from preserving "Democratic" programs like Social Security while building the gargantuan, National Highway System. The right-wing ideologue Russell Kirk scoffed that Eisenhower was no conservative: "He is a golfer."
Seeking the American sweet spot in leadership, that mode of muscular moderation, sent Richard Nixon to China, had Ronald Reagan and George H.W Bush raising taxes to tame the deficit, and prompted Bill Clinton to declare the era of big government "over." Thanks to this presidential tropism toward the center, and with necessity trumping ideology, the small-government-advocating conservative George W. Bush and the big-government liberal Barack Obama stimulated the economy with hundreds of millions of government dollars. Similarly, Bush, the war-on-terror conservative, and Obama, the human-rights-advocating liberal, both maintained the prison at Guantanamo Bay while hunting down Islamist terrorists aggressively.
The world looks different from the president's desk rather than from the candidates' soapbox. These Oval Office conversions reflect the American political system's strength. The nominee's most ardent supporters resist this "etch-a-sketchism," which the cowboy comedian Will Rogers once dismissed as "go in on promises, go out on alibis."
Yet the story is about resilience and pragmatism not hypocrisy and betrayal. President George Washington consistently sought a "middle course," fostering a "spirit of accommodation" and emphasizing "our common cause." Thomas Jefferson agreed that "it is necessary to give as well as take in a government like ours." And Abraham Lincoln stayed agile by insisting, "my policy is to have no policy."
Of course, significant differences remain among candidates, and choosing one candidate or another changes history. But voters should realize that campaigning presents many red (and blue) herrings highlighting differences but governing frequently obscures them. Considering that only the hard questions reach the president's desk, as Eisenhower warned his successor John F. Kennedy, the simple red-versus-blue decisions get made elsewhere - while many searing social issues like abortion appear on the Supreme Court's docket not the president's agenda.
Many of today's winner's toughest challenges, including Iran and the economy, mostly transcend ideology. So voters beware: presidential decisions rarely fit into the neat boxes ideologues and spinmeisters construct when building the party platform and campaigning. Best to learn from Will Rogers, in one of his grander moments: "We elect our presidents, be they Republican or Democrat, then start daring 'em to make good."
 Gil Troy is a professor of history at McGill University and the author of "Why Moderates Make the Best Presidents: George Washington to Barack Obama." His most recent book, "Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight against Zionism as Racism," will be published next month.

HEADLINE: Netflix's Poison Pill Has a Shareholder-Friendly Flavor

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: In seeking to prevent a sale of the company on the cheap, Netflix tries to be noncontroversial. But its battle with the activist investor Carl Icahn is far from over. 

 BODY:
Netflix's adoption of a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill, to fend off the activist investor Carl C. Icahn is no surprise. Still, Netflix, the video-streaming and DVD rental company, couldn't resist putting some unusual terms into the pill just to keep things exciting and place a shareholder-friendly spin on the event. 
The workings of a poison pill are intricate but essentially boil down to this: When a shareholder acquires a percentage of shares above a certain threshold, the pill is activated. Setting off the pill means that the poison is taken, and the net result is that every shareholder but the one who sets it off receives discounted stock. Consequently, the stake of the trigger-puller gets hugely diluted.
Because activating a pill is economically stupid - why would you cause your stake to be reduced without compensation? -- there has only been one intentional trigger of a poison pill in recent memory. The case involved the company Selectica, and it didn't go so well for the shareholder. The Delaware courts foundthe pill to be valid, and the shareholder was left with a stake worth much less than before it intentionally activated the pill. 
The threshold set by the company is thus important because it effectively places a hard cap on the number of shares an investor can buy. 
Netflix took an unusual tack in setting its threshold. For institutional shareholders who take a passive stake, the limit is 20 percent. For all other shareholders, the limit is 10 percent, just a bit above Mr. Icahn's current holdings of 9.98 percent. 
Regular pill watchers of the world will immediately see what is unusual here. Typically, the threshold for a poison pill is 15 percent for all shareholders, though a 10 percent bar is increasingly common. The twist here is that Netflix treats passive shareholders differently. 
The 10 percent cap is a symptom of increased aggressiveness by companies against activist hedge funds. Under Delaware law, to justify a pill, a company needs to show that there is a threat and that the response is proportional in relation to the threat. Lawyers call this a Unocal review, after the case that adopted part of the standard. 
In Netflix's case the threshold of 10 percent versus 15 percent or even 20 percent makes no difference in terms of working to prevent a takeover, unless the board agrees. And this consequence jibes with the traditional notion behind a pill, to prevent an unwanted takeover that undervalues the company. But setting the standard at the lower level also prevents Mr. Icahn or another shareholder from accumulating more shares to vote to influence the board to sell the company or take other strategic actions. 
Netflix is likely to justify this limitation of shareholders by the fact that Mr. Icahn has specifically mentioned his goal is a sale. In this light, the 20 percent threshold can be viewed as a public relations move, adding a shareholder-friendly gloss to the pill adoption. Netflix can argue that it is still looking out for its shareholders because it is really taking aim only at those pesky activists. The Fidelity Investments and other mutual funds of the world can still buy more shares, they just can't actively campaign against the company. 
The hedge funds are likely to counter that the threat though is misidentified because it really is all about keeping the Netflix board in power and preventing any activist from effectively running a campaign to unseat them. In this regard, their rights as shareholders are being unduly limited. 
Mr. Icahn sounded these themes on Monday when his funds stated in a filing that they "believe any poison pill without a shareholder vote is an example of poor corporate governance, and find the pill Netflix just adopted is particularly troubling due to its remarkably low and discriminatory 10 percent threshold."
Netflix's move would undoubtedly be upheld by the Delaware courts as a matter of practicality if nothing else. The Delaware judges have not been keen to side with hedge fund activists.
Moreover, the justification that Netflix would give - that it is really just trying to prevent a forced sale on the cheap -- has particular salience because Mr. Icahn has said he'd like the company to explore a sale. 
Still, while Netflix's maneuver may be justified in this case, it is part of a more aggressive tone taken by companies against shareholder activists. Expect the trend to continue. Left hanging is the question of whether it is a net benefit for boards to protect themselves in this manner. 
The other notable thing about Netflix's poison pill is how it tries to limit Mr. Icahn's contacts with other shareholders. Poison pills typically have expansive definitions, treating shareholders as a group and adding their shares together to determine if the pill is activated. The goal is to limit them from ganging up on the company. And other companies have taken aggressive positions in defining a group in order to limit conversations between hedge funds and shareholders generally. 
For example, Barnes & Noble's original pill, adopted to fend off Ronald W. Burkle, defined a group to include shareholders with "any agreement, arrangement or understanding (written or oral) to cooperate in obtaining, changing or influencing the control of the company." The provision effectively chilled almost all shareholder communication, and its validity was challenged in court by Mr. Burkle. Barnes & Noble dropped it before the court could rule. Other companies have been even more aggressive. According to a memo by the law firm Latham & Watkins, other companies have adopted group language like "acting with conscious parallelism," "acting in concert" or "cooperating" in order to prevent activist hedge funds from working together. 
But in Netflix's case, the company did not go this route. Instead, Netflix, just added the usual language that "any agreement, arrangement or understanding" among parties would lump them together. 
While a poison pill may raise shareholder rights concerns, the Netflix pill can be viewed as a nonevent because it doesn't change much. It appears that the company is going out of its way to be noncontroversial in its adoption and to put on a shareholder-friendly face. In addition, Mr. Icahn's stake is just below 10 percent, although he could have acquired more, so he will not be affected and is not likely to care.
The main event remains whether anyone will take Mr. Icahn's bait to try to buy Netflix.

HEADLINE: Obama's Night: Tops Romney For 2nd Term In Bruising Run; Democrats Turn Back G.O.P Bid For Senate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Barack Hussein Obama was re-elected president of the United States on Tuesday, overcoming powerful economic headwinds, a lock-step resistance to his agenda by Republicans in Congress and an unprecedented torrent of advertising as a divided nation voted to give him more time.
In defeating Mitt Romney, the president carried Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin, a near sweep of the battleground states, and was holding a narrow advantage in Florida. The path to victory for Mr. Romney narrowed as the night wore along, with Mr. Obama winning at least 303 electoral votes.
A cheer of jubilation sounded at the Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago when the television networks began projecting him as the winner at 11:20 p.m., even as the ballots were still being counted in many states where voters had waited in line well into the night. The victory was far narrower than his historic election four years ago, but it was no less dramatic.
''Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back,'' Mr. Obama told his supporters early Wednesday. ''We know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.'' 
Mr. Obama's re-election extended his place in history, carrying the tenure of the nation's first black president into a second term. His path followed a pattern that has been an arc to his political career: faltering when he seemed to be at his strongest -- the period before his first debate with Mr. Romney -- before he redoubled his efforts to lift himself and his supporters to victory.
The evening was not without the drama that has come to mark so many recent elections: For more than 90 minutes after the networks projected Mr. Obama as the winner, Mr. Romney held off calling him to concede. And as the president waited to declare victory in Chicago, Mr. Romney's aides were prepared to head to the airport, suitcases packed, potentially to contest several close results.
But as it became increasingly clear that no amount of contesting would bring him victory, he called Mr. Obama to concede shortly before 1 a.m.
''I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters,'' Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston. ''This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.''
Hispanics made up an important part of Mr. Obama's winning coalition, preliminary exit poll data showed. And before the night was through, there were already recriminations from Republican moderates who said Mr. Romney had gone too far during the primaries in his statements against those here illegally, including his promise that his get-tough policies would cause some to ''self-deport.''
Mr. Obama, 51, faces governing in a deeply divided country and a partisan-rich capital, where Republicans retained their majority in the House and Democrats kept their control of the Senate. His re-election offers him a second chance that will quickly be tested, given the rapidly escalating fiscal showdown.
For Mr. Obama, the result brings a ratification of his sweeping health care act, which Mr. Romney had vowed to repeal. The law will now continue on course toward nearly full implementation in 2014, promising to change significantly the way medical services are administrated nationwide.
Confident that the economy is finally on a true path toward stability, Mr. Obama and his aides have hinted that he would seek to tackle some of the grand but unrealized promises of his first campaign, including the sort of immigration overhaul that has eluded presidents of both parties for decades.
But he will be venturing back into a Congressional environment similar to that of his first term, with the Senate under the control of Democrats and the House under the control of Republicans, whose leaders have hinted that they will be no less likely to challenge him than they were during the last four years.
The state-by-state pursuit of 270 electoral votes was being closely tracked by both campaigns, with Mr. Romney winning North Carolina and Indiana, which Mr. Obama carried four years ago. But Mr. Obama won Michigan, the state where Mr. Romney was born, and Minnesota, a pair of states that Republican groups had spent millions trying to make competitive.
Americans delivered a final judgment on a long and bitter campaign that drew so many people to the polls that several key states extended voting for hours. In Virginia and Florida, long lines stretched from polling places, with the Obama campaign sending text messages to supporters in those areas, saying: ''You can still vote.''
Neither party could predict how the outcome would affect the direction of the Republican Party. Moderates were hopeful it would lead the rank and file to realize that the party's grass-roots conservatism that Mr. Romney pledged himself to during the primaries doomed him in the general election. Tea Party adherents have indicated that they will argue that he was damaged because of his move to middle ground during the general election.
As he delivered his brief concession speech early Wednesday, Mr. Romney did not directly address the challenges facing Republicans. His advisers said that his second failed quest for the White House would be his last, with his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, standing as one of the leaders of the party.
''We have given our all to this campaign,'' said Mr. Romney, stoic and gracious in his remarks. ''I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction.''
The results were more a matter of voters giving Mr. Obama more time than a second chance. Through most of the year slight majorities of voters had told pollsters that they believed his policies would improve the economy if they could stay in place into the future.
Mr. Obama's campaign team built its coalition the hard way, through intensive efforts to find and motivate supporters who had lost the ardor of four years ago and, Mr. Obama's strategists feared, might not find their way to polls if left to their own devices.
Up against real enthusiasm for Mr. Romney -- or, just as important, against Mr. Obama -- among Republicans and many independents, their strategy of spending vast sums of money on their get-out-the-vote operation seemed vindicated on Tuesday.
As opinion surveys that followed the first debate between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama showed a tightening race, Mr. Obama's team had insisted that its coalition was coming together as it hoped it would. In the end, it was not a bluff.
Even with Mr. Obama pulling off a new sweep of the highly contested battlegrounds from Nevada to New Hampshire, the result in each of the states was very narrow. The Romney campaign was taking its time early Wednesday to review the outcome and searching for any irregularities.
The top issue on the minds of voters was the economy, according to interviews, with three-quarters saying that economic conditions were not good or poor. But only 3 in 10 said things were getting worse, and 4 in 10 said the economy was improving.
Mr. Romney, who campaigned aggressively on his ability to turn around the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, was given a narrow edge when voters were asked which candidate was better equipped to handle the economy, the interviews found.
The electorate was split along partisan lines over a question that drove much of the campaign debate: whether it was Mr. Obama or his predecessor, George W. Bush, who bore the most responsibility for the nation's continued economic challenges. About 4 in 10 independent voters said that Mr. Bush should be held responsible.
The president built a muscular campaign organization and used a strong financial advantage to hold off an array of forces that opposed his candidacy. The margin of his victory was smaller than in 2008 -- he held an advantage of about 700,000 in the popular vote early Wednesday -- but a strategic firewall in several battleground states protected his Electoral College majority.
As Mr. Romney gained steam and stature in the final weeks of the campaign, the Obama campaign put its hopes in perhaps one thing above all others: that the rebound in the auto industry after the president's bailout package of 2009 would give him the winning edge in Ohio, a linchpin of his road to re-election.
Early interviews with voters showed that just over half of Ohio voters approved of the bailout, a result that was balanced by a less encouraging sign for the president: Some 4 in 10 said they or someone in their household had lost a job over the last four years.
He defeated Mr. Romney 52 percent to 47 percent in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, but only because of the number of votes he banked in the month leading up to Election Day.
Mr. Obama won despite losing some of his 2008 margins among his key constituencies, including among younger voters, blacks and Jewish voters, yet he appeared to increase his share among Hispanics and Asians. Early exit poll results showed Latinos representing about 1 in 10 voters nationwide, and voting for Mr. Obama in greater numbers than four years ago, making a difference in several states, including Colorado and Florida.
He held on to female voters, according to preliminary exit polls conducted by Edison Research, but he struggled even more among white men than he did four years ago.
Mr. Romney's coalition included disproportionate support from whites, men, older people, high-income voters, evangelicals, those from suburban and rural counties, and those who call themselves adherents of the Tea Party -- a group that had resisted him through the primaries but had fully embraced him by Election Day.
The Republican Party seemed destined for a new round of self-reflection over how it approaches Hispanics going forward, a fast-growing portion of the voting population that senior party strategists had sought to woo before a strain of intense activism against illegal immigration took hold within the Republican grass roots.
It was the first presidential election since the 2010 Supreme Court decision loosening restrictions on political spending, and the first in which both major-party candidates opted out of the campaign matching system that imposes spending limits in return for federal financing. And the overall cost of the campaign rose accordingly, with all candidates for federal office, their parties and their supportive ''super PACs'' spending more than $6 billion combined.
The results Tuesday were certain to be parsed for days to determine just what effect the spending had, and who would be more irate at the answer -- the donors who spent millions of dollars of their own money for a certain outcome, or those who found a barrage of negative advertising to be major factors in their defeats.
While the campaign often seemed small and petty, with Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama intensely quarreling and bickering, the contest was actually rooted in big and consequential decisions, with the role of the federal government squarely at the center of the debate.
Though Mr. Obama's health care law galvanized his most ardent opposition, and continually drew low ratings in polls as a whole, interviews with voters found that nearly half wanted to see it kept intact or expanded, a quarter wanted to see it repealed entirely and another quarter said they wanted portions of it repealed.
In Chicago, as crowds waited for Mr. Obama to deliver his speech, his supporters erupted into a roar of relief and elation. Car horns honked from the street as people chanted the president's name.
''I feel like it's a repudiation of everything the Republicans said in the campaign,'' said Jasmyne Walker, 31, who jumped up and down on the edge of a stone planter in a downtown plaza. ''Everybody said that if he lost it would be buyer's remorse -- that we were high on hope in 2008. This says we're on the right track. I feel like this confirms that.''

HEADLINE: Study Looks at Bias in Celebration Penalty Calls

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
A Kansas City Chiefs cornerback returns an interception 58 yards for a touchdown, then flexes his biceps in the end zone with one foot resting on the ball. A Seattle wide receiver makes a throat-slashing gesture after catching a 52-yard pass for a score. A running back for Green Bay lies on his back in the end zone and waves his legs and arms to mime a snow angel after an 80-yard scoring catch. After an 18-yard touchdown catch on Jan. 1, a Buffalo receiver exposes an undershirt that has ''Happy New Year'' written on it.
Each of these touchdown celebrations last season resulted in a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. But they had one other commonality: The fouls were called on black players. 
It cannot be determined from those few cases and limited data whether race played any role in those penalties for excessive celebration. But a study published in July in The Journal of Experimental Social Psychology by two researchers in psychology at Northwestern University tested the question of bias in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties called after touchdowns. The two researchers, Erika V. Hall, a doctoral candidate, and Robert W. Livingston, an associate professor of management and organizations, tried to gather more insight by posing a series of hypothetical situations to a group of people.
They randomly assigned 44 men and women, who were nonblack and qualified as familiar with football after answering a pretest question, to read one of several accounts of a fictional N.F.L. play, each with details that varied slightly. In one version, a wide receiver named Malik Johnson makes a spectacular fingertip catch and sprints into the end zone. Then he spikes the ball in front of a defender named Jake Biermann, goes into his signature touchdown dance, flexes his muscles and waits for a reaction from the crowd. In a second version, everything is the same, except the wide receiver is Jake Biermann and the defender is Malik Johnson.
In other variations, the stories and names are the same but when the wide receiver -- either Jake or Malik -- scores he calmly flips the ball to the referee and trots to the sideline.
None of the participants were told that the experiment involved race. Instead, they were asked to rate the players for arrogance and to say how much of a salary bonus each should be rewarded with for his catch and score.
Malik and Jake were rated equally for arrogance when they celebrated and for humility when they didn't. But when it came to rewards and penalties, the differences were stark. Biermann was rewarded about equally whether he celebrated or not. But Johnson incurred a sort of ''hubris penalty,'' receiving a significantly lower reward if he celebrated with a touchdown dance than if he gave the ball to the official and jogged off the field.
''The same pattern of blacks being punished more than whites seems to hold true both in the N.F.L. and in this experiment,'' Livingston said. ''I would conclude that the results are generalizable to N.F.L. referees.''
He added: ''These football fans reached a conclusion that was based in part on the race of the player, because everything else about the scenarios was identical. All of this happens unconsciously. No one is doing it on purpose.''
But others argue that there is almost certainly not enough data to draw conclusions about whether bias is involved. One expert not involved in the study, Joe Magee, an associate professor of management and organizations at New York University, said it would be a stretch to apply these laboratory findings to the N.F.L. But, he added: ''It's a perfectly adequate and rigorous study. We have different expectations about how people should behave depending on their social or economic group. There's a backlash when they act in ways that contradict the stereotypes.''
In any case, there has been little chance to test the hypothesis recently. So far this season, no one has been flagged for excessive celebration.

HEADLINE: Hope And Change: Part Two

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
In October 2010, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, famously told The National Journal, ''The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.'' And that's how he and his party acted.
Well, Mitch, how's that workin' out for ya? 
No one can know for sure what complex emotional chemistry tipped this election Obama's way, but here's my guess: In the end, it came down to a majority of Americans believing that whatever his faults, Obama was trying his hardest to fix what ails the country and that he had to do it with a Republican Party that, in its gut, did not want to meet him halfway but wanted him to fail -- so that it could swoop in and pick up the pieces. To this day, I find McConnell's declaration appalling. Consider all the problems we have faced in this country over the last four years -- from debt to adapting to globalization to unemployment to the challenges of climate change to terrorism -- and then roll over that statement: ''The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.''
That, in my view, is what made the difference. The G.O.P. lost an election that, given the state of the economy, it should have won because of an excess of McConnell-like cynicism, a shortage of new ideas and an abundance of really bad ideas -- about immigration, about climate, about how jobs are created and about abortion and other social issues.
It seems that many Americans went to the polls without much enthusiasm for either candidate, but, nevertheless, with a clear idea of whom they preferred. The majority seemed to be saying to Obama: ''You didn't get it all right the first time, but we're going to give you a second chance.'' In a way, they voted for ''hope and change'' again. I don't think it was so much a ratification of health care or ''Race to the Top'' or any other Obama initiative. It was more a vote on his character: ''We think you're trying. Now try even harder. Learn from your mistakes. Reach out to the other side, even if they slap away your hand, and focus like a laser on the economy, so those of us who voted for you today without much enthusiasm can feel good about this vote.''
And that is why Obama's victory is so devastating for the G.O.P. A country with nearly 8 percent unemployment preferred to give the president a second chance rather than Mitt Romney a first one. The Republican Party today needs to have a real heart-to-heart with itself.
The G.O.P. has lost two presidential elections in a row because it forced its candidate to run so far to the loony right to get through the primaries, dominated by its ultraconservative base, that he could not get close enough back to the center to carry the national election. It is not enough for Republicans to tell their Democratic colleagues in private -- as some do -- ''I wish I could help you, but our base is crazy.'' They need to have their own reformation. The center-right has got to have it out with the far-right, or it is going to be a minority party for a long time.
Many in the next generation of America know climate change is real, and they want to see something done to mitigate it. Many in the next generation of America will be of Hispanic origin and insist on humane immigration reform that gives a practical legal pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The next generation is going to need immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers from India, China and Latin America if the U.S. is going to remain at the cutting edge of the Information Technology revolution and be able to afford the government we want. Many in the next generation of America see gays and lesbians in their families, workplaces and Army barracks, and they don't want to deny them the marriage rights held by others. The G.O.P. today is at war with too many in the next generation of America on all of these issues.
All that said, my prediction is that the biggest domestic issue in the next four years will be how we respond to changes in technology, globalization and markets that have, in a very short space of time, made the decent-wage, middle-skilled job -- the backbone of the middle class -- increasingly obsolete. The only decent-wage jobs will be high-skilled ones.
The answer to that challenge will require a new level of political imagination -- a combination of educational reforms and unprecedented collaboration between business, schools, universities and government to change how workers are trained and empowered to keep learning. It will require tax reforms and immigration reforms. America today desperately needs a center-right G.O.P. that is offering merit-based, market-based approaches to all these issues -- and a willingness to meet the other side halfway. The country is starved for practical, bipartisan cooperation, and it will reward politicians who deliver it and punish those who don't.
The votes have been counted. President Obama now needs to get to work to justify the second chance the country has given him, and the Republicans need to get to work understanding why that happened.

HEADLINE: Geothermal Designs Arise As a Stormproof Resource

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Advocates for geothermal energy say that the path of destruction cut by Hurricane Sandy, which unearthed fuel tanks, ravaged cooling towers and battered air-conditioners, has already persuaded some building owners to switch to geothermal systems that use underground pipes to harness the earth's energy for heating and cooling buildings.
''We're seeing dozens of these half-empty and empty oil tanks just popping up all over the place in the flooded areas,'' said David E. Reardon, the manager of geothermal drilling for the Miller Environmental Group, an environmental response, remediation and restoration services company based in Calverton on Long Island that has been involved in poststorm environmental cleanup throughout the region.
''Those tanks become buoyant in all that water,'' he said. But since geothermal systems don't use fossil fuels or mechanical systems that are exposed to the elements, Mr. Reardon said, he started fielding calls from people asking for estimates on geothermal systems just days after the storm. ''Often it's a case where they were considering doing it, but were waiting for something to finally no longer be able to be repaired,'' he said, and the storm has ended that wait. 
Geothermal energy systems, common in countries like Iceland and China, use the constant temperature of the earth to heat and cool buildings.
Geothermal wells are dug to a depth where the earth regulates the temperature of water or a liquid circulating through the system. Geothermal systems may require one well or dozens to regulate a building's temperature, depending on the size of a building and type of system installed. While the systems are called wells, they are actually an underground network of pipes connected to heat pumps to circulate water or some other liquid.
Because digging geothermal wells can be expensive and logistically difficult, the systems have been slow to catch on in New York City. Yet, according to the Rockefeller Foundation and DB Climate Change Advisors, ''buildings consume approximately 40 percent of the world's primary energy and are responsible for 40 percent of global carbon emissions,'' said Jack DiEnna, the executive director of the Geothermal Heat Pump National and International Initiative, based in Washington.
Installing a geothermal system can significantly reduce a building's carbon footprint, and over the last decade, the number of geothermal heat pump systems in the city has grown steadily. More geothermal systems are installed in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania than anywhere else in the United States.
Most systems are being installed in institutional buildings, multifamily residential buildings and relatively small commercial buildings. There have been systems installed by several prominent organizations and sites in the city, including the American Institute of Architects, the Times Square TKTS Booth, the Brooklyn Children's Museum, the Queens Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo Lion House. In some of the outer boroughs and the suburbs, geothermal systems for single-family homes are also becoming more popular.
In all, more than 100 geothermal projects are in operation in the five boroughs, and about 90 percent of those projects are what are known as closed loop vertical bore systems, Mr. DiEnna said. A closed loop system is sealed from the ground and liquids are reused within the system, while an open loop system has discharge water it releases into a ground well or surface water.
Because building sites in the city, particularly Manhattan, tend to be small, the wells tend to be vertical, just like the buildings. Manhattan is not an ideal location for geothermal heat pump systems, because the wells must go so deep -- to depths of roughly 1,500 feet -- to reach the volume of land necessary to provide a constant temperature. In other areas with more available land, a geothermal heat pump system can be more spread out and much shallower, making it less costly to dig.
Elsewhere, larger scale geothermal projects known as enhanced geothermal systems have raised serious concerns because these larger power-production projects involve drilling wells down to tens of thousands of feet and fracturing the bedrock so water can be injected to create steam.
A few years ago, a project in Switzerland was shut down after it caused small earthquakes, and another project in Northern California was also stopped because of similar concerns. But the static, small-scale geothermal heat pump systems installed in the New York area bear little relation to these projects, said Daniel P. Schrag, a professor of geology and director of the Center for the Environment at Harvard.
''These are a totally different thing,'' he said. ''These are very shallow systems that don't involve pumping huge volumes of water in, creating steam and fracturing the rock.''
Even so, to help maintain the geological integrity of the earth, most municipalities closely regulate well drilling, especially for wells dug below 500 feet, Mr. DiEnna said. ''Manhattan is not the most ideal space for geothermal,'' he said. ''But the other four boroughs offer many opportunities to install this renewable technology.''
In New York, ''the biggest obstacle currently to geothermal energy is the initial cost, which can be more significant than a traditional furnace replacement,'' said Daniel Goodwin, a mechanical engineer with the Miller Environmental Group. However, Mr. Goodwin pointed out that since geothermal systems both heat and cool, they can replace not just the heating system but the cooling system as well.
It makes the most sense to install a geothermal system in new construction, especially given state incentives and federal tax credits for geothermal, he said. ''If you're retrofitting a building, it's going to be an initial cost,'' Mr. Goodwin said. ''But from a new construction standpoint, when you look at the numbers and the tax credits and things out there, it really becomes a no-brainer.''
But even a retrofit can quickly make economic sense. At the Brooklyn Children's Museum, an open loop geothermal system with four wells was installed in 2007 at a cost of $675,000.
That initial cost was hefty, but is being offset by savings on energy costs. The museum was initially paying $200,000 annually for heating, cooling and electricity in its 50,000-square-foot building with conventional methods.
With the installation of the geothermal system, it was able to expand to 110,000 square feet and provide energy to the additional 60,000 square feet for only $50,000 more. Donald Cramer, the museum's chief operating and finance officer, called the geothermal system ''very successful and extremely efficient.''
The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects was an even earlier adopter of geothermal technology at the Center for Architecture in Greenwich Village. The center wanted to retrofit the existing building with a system using alternative renewable energy and chose geothermal, said Rick Bell, the center's executive director.
A two-well system took three weeks to drill -- closing down three of LaGuardia Place's four lanes -- to a depth of 1,260 feet in 2003 at a cost of about $100,000, he said.
The center's needs were primarily for cooling, and installing a cooling tower on its roof would have cost about $60,000, he said. Though the center's administrators felt that the additional $40,000 for geothermal was justifiable, they sought and received financial assistance from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which has programs to encourage the use of alternative energy technologies.
''In other cities, geothermal is not a radical, what-were-they-thinking kind of technology, but something that's very common,'' Mr. Bell said. ''We said we can research those places.''
The authority eventually pitched in about $85,000 toward the 65-ton closed loop geothermal heat pump system, Mr. Bell said. But the Center for Architecture has determined that, even without that assistance, it would have moved forward because the geothermal system was projected to pay for itself in less than three years, he said.
A geothermal heat pump system, if installed correctly, can cut the annual energy bill of a building by 30 to 60 percent, said Zoe Reich, an environmental specialist who heads the sustainability department at the engineering firm Edwards & Zuck. The typical payback period for geothermal systems in New York is two to eight years, factoring in any financial incentives or tax credits, Ms. Reich said.
''That's quite a large span, but it does depend on how efficient your system is running and making sure you chose the right system for the geology of your location,'' she said. ''One very important aspect is working with a hydrogeologist to determine the best system for your location.''
If the proper system is installed, then not only does it save money in operations, but also in maintenance, Mr. Goodwin said. ''Since there's no combustion, there's no carbon fouling due to the burning of fossil fuels, it's easy to maintain,'' he said.
Also, the pipes in a closed loop vertical bore well system are warranted for 50 years, while the aboveground geothermal equipment has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years, Mr. Goodwin said. That's roughly twice the life expectancy of a furnace or other conventional system, he said.
In Manhattan, the deep bore wells needed can cost anywhere from $125,000 to $150,000 a well. For a 500-unit multifamily building, for example, 10 to 15 wells would be needed, making the cost as much as $2.25 million, said Matt Donolli, a managing partner at Edwards & Zuck.
Single-family homeowners, except possibly those in high-density areas like Manhattan, would not have to spend that much on their shallower wells, he said. A 3,000-square-foot home in a more suburban area would probably need two to three wells, at only $9,000 per well, as part of a geothermal heat pump system to heat and cool the home.

HEADLINE: Sandy Offers Lessons to Restaurateurs

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
IN the days since Hurricane Sandy shut off the lights and flooded restaurants across New York City, the reaction has been rapid and often heroic: kitchens drained, supply lines improvised, staffs reassembled, doors reopened and beleaguered diners fed.
But for many of the city's 24,000 restaurants, the work has just begun: a long-term overhaul that could change much about the way restaurants operate, even those untouched by the storm.
Owners are re-examining their buildings' infrastructure and architecture. They are questioning their industry's tradition of placing kitchens and refrigerators in basements. For the first time, many are realizing a need to set up backup power, communication systems and transportation networks.
''There is no business as usual, going forward,'' Drew Nieporent said as he stood at the mahogany bar of his eerily empty Tribeca Grill on Saturday night, hours after the power returned. The restaurant has been a Greenwich Street landmark for 22 years, and Mr. Nieporent described his shock when its subbasement boiler room suddenly took on five feet of water and the basement prep kitchen filled with six inches of slosh. 
''There are many lessons learned,'' he said, estimating that he had lost $600,000 in revenues at three closed restaurants, and $30,000 worth of spoiled food. ''We all want to be smart about this going forward. It's a time of stocktaking, after reopening.'' Which is in progress: Nobu on Saturday night, Corton on Tuesday and Tribeca Grill on Wednesday, if all goes well.
In a different part of the city and its dining spectrum, the 120-seat Bogota Latin Bistro in Park Slope, Brooklyn, suffered minimal damage. But an owner, Farid Lancheros, predicted that restaurateurs would begin reinforcing walls, installing sump pumps and making other tangible changes to deal with more-frequent and devastating storms. Hurricane Sandy ''was a very ugly package presented to us with a gift inside,'' Mr. Lancheros said. ''Maybe now restaurants will be wiser.''
David Rockwell, who has designed more than 50 restaurants in New York, said owners would now consider building or retrofitting with waterproof materials, and providing quick ways to drain and pump out water.
''Everyone is thinking not only about backup power and emergency lighting,'' he said, ''but also the whole idea of what, exactly, is an acceptable ground level.'' Some seating might have to be shifted downstairs, and kitchens and refrigeration moved upstairs.
Danny Meyer said his Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns 16 restaurants in New York City, was creating a disaster-plan task force, ''expecting that this will happen again, and looking for backup solutions,'' he said, including the purchase of generators and ''a lot of infrastructure changes.''
Mr. Meyer is renowned for his tireless efforts to communicate with customers, but the storm nearly put him out of touch with his own organization last week. When the power failed at his apartment in the Flatiron district, his office at Union Square and his downtown restaurants, he said, he established himself in a makeshift office in the bathroom of the Madison Square Club gym on Fifth Avenue at 26th Street.
''For some reason they had power,'' he said, adding, ''there was one outlet and I plugged in, and fortunately there was a chair to sit on rather than just the toilet.''
A top priority now, he said, is creating a stormproof communications system ''because in the future you can't have me running the company from the bathroom of a gym on one cellphone, relying on a cell tower.''
He and other restaurateurs would also benefit from a keener awareness of their own infrastructure, Mr. Meyer said. His North End Grill, Blue Smoke and Shake Shack in Battery Park City never lost power, he said, because ''they were on the Brooklyn electrical grid, and who knew?''
Even small design changes could make a big difference, he said. North End Grill was ''the first of our restaurants to install electrical outlets underneath the lip of the bar, and suddenly, all our customers were coming in to recharge their equipment -- something we never envisioned.''
Restaurants with employees who are scattered over the region are brainstorming new ways to reach them in a crisis, and investigating van-pooling and other transportation, including bicycling. Juan Inga, a floor captain at Nobu, couldn't find gasoline for his car, so he cycled an hour from his home in Jackson Heights, Queens, to the TriBeCa restaurant. ''It's windy and pretty cold across the 59th Street Bridge,'' he said, ''but the bike got me in.''
Restaurateurs have also realized they must be more sensitive to the trauma of employees after they return to work.
Sam Del Toro, the assistant manager of the Schnipper's Quality Kitchen outlet on West 23d Street, had two feet of water in his house in Bergen Beach, Brooklyn. He organized a cleanup, then contrived to return to work on Wednesday, only to find a powerless, gas-less restaurant with 280 pounds of spoiled meat. ''I know what our people are going through,'' he said. ''It's -- well, I've never experienced anything like this.''
Anxiously, too, the industry is casting an eye on the viability of individual businesses in the post-storm economy. ''There has been a devastating financial impact,'' said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, a trade group of more than 300 restaurants and bars. ''Long term, it's very challenging.'' His organization has become a clearinghouse for relief and recovery information.
Malcolm M. Knapp, a New York restaurant consultant, said the storm's penumbra ''is going to cut tourism in the short run, as well as trade shows, and hotels will be down, and all of that affects restaurants.'' He added that during storm week, sales in casual-dining restaurants were down 30 percent in the metropolitan area, and 50 percent in fine-dining restaurants.
Jeffrey Bank, the chief executive of the Alicart Restaurant Group, which owns Carmine's and Virgil's, projected that ''many restaurants will go under, due to this. It'll be like a Chinese water torture: a slow drip.''
Most people interviewed for this article invoked a Dickensian metaphor: a tale of two cities -- those restaurants affected by the storm, and those not. But they declined to speculate whether future entrepreneurs might avoid opening restaurants in flood-prone neighborhoods like Battery Park City, and Red Hook and Dumbo in Brooklyn.
''If there is expensive residential property there, as in Battery Park and Dumbo, well, you have to eat,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in New York. ''Operators could find it worth the risk.'' Red Hook, which is less affluent, might be more affected, he added. Rising insurance costs could also hurt some areas, he said. ''Premiums don't have a tendency to go down.''
Despite all the talk of looking ahead, many restaurateurs will shrug off the storm as an isolated event, saying, '' 'These things are out of our control,' '' said Paul Seres, an owner of the DL lounge and the new Dinner on Ludlow restaurant, on the Lower East Side. The two businesses lost about $100,000 in revenues for five shuttered days.
Mr. Nieporent said that calamity was nothing new to New York restaurateurs, mentioning the 9/11 attacks, the recent recession, Tropical Storm Irene and last year's Halloween snowstorm. ''But as they said in 'The Godfather Part II,' this is the business we've chosen.''

HEADLINE: In a Small Ohio City, an Almost Sacred Day of Civic Purpose

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio
An hour before another Election Day's dawn in Elyria, several dozen voters were already waiting for the polls to open at a church transformed into a secular space of civic duty. Deep in the snaking line were Howard and Ketty Foxman, their compatibility reflected by matching gray ponytails.
Howard, 91, had a lot on his mind. In surrender to age and the Internet, he recently closed his store, Loomis Camera, whose oversize mock camera above the door has virtually recorded life in this small Ohio city since forever. But he gave the sign to a museum in Cincinnati a couple of weeks ago and has been slowly, sadly, clearing out the shop he has occupied for the last 62 years.
Even so, with all these worries -- including the knowledge that his father died shortly after retiring -- Howard was determined to vote. With his wife carrying a water bottle and crackers in case his blood sugar dropped, he moved forward, the tip of his silver cane dotting the maroon carpet, inch by inch. 
Such a heartwarming scene of American pride. But when asked whether he thinks his vote counts, he reared up, as if to thrash the person who would ask such a stupid question. ''Of course!'' Howard barked. ''And anyone who doesn't vote is an -- ''
Let's just say that Howard strongly, strongly believes in exercising one's right to vote. Let's also just say that many in Elyria, in this swing state of swing states, feel the same way -- from the World War II veterans who meet daily for breakfast down at Donna's Diner to the young and pregnant waitress who pours their coffee.
The jaded might contend that in a presidential election, one vote among tens of millions has no meaning, that casting a ballot is like casting a pebble into the sea. But here in Elyria, about 30 miles southwest of Cleveland, residents did not need the unending bombardment of robocalls and door-to-door political salespeople to know that their vote mattered.
Voting is simply what you do.
Even if you are 91, you get up at 4:30 in the morning and eat something to keep your diabetes in check. You get into your Chevrolet sedan, in which a blue handicap-access sign dangles from the rearview mirror. Then you drive two miles to the crowded parking lot of the Cross Community Church.
You walk with some difficulty past the front door, past the reprint of the American flag taped beside the crosses etched in the glass. You sign in at one of the foldout tables that the Lorain County Board of Elections has set up along a glass partition with a close-up view of the church's pews. Then you wait with legs aching for one of the dozen voting booths to open up.
''I never go to church,'' Howard said. ''Except to vote.''
This collapse of the church-and-state divide is one of the rituals that distinguish Election Day in Elyria. Like other special days, of course, it has its own incessant music, in those political ads on the radio, and its own special decorations, in those lawn signs that enhance the November foliage: the red-white-and-blue of Sherrod Brown for the United States Senate; the blue-and-white of Ted Kalo for county commissioner; the blue-and-orange for Frank Janik for judge.
(Some of these signs all but dare you to prove with your vote that granite does not reside in your chest. ''Education First -- For Elyria's schools,'' one sign reads, while another says, ''Vote FOR Mental Health.'')
But unlike other special days, be it Memorial Day, Labor Day or the Fourth of July, Election Day has consequence. ''This is the most important day of all the days,'' Howard said, his voice rising once again toward some punctuating expletive.
According to Paul Adams, the director of the local Board of Elections, thousands here agreed. Voter turnout was especially robust, he said, and voter concentration on the many ballot measures -- including six charter amendments in Elyria -- was intense enough to require the assistance of extra staff.
After voting, Howard returned home for a little rest. Then, for one of the last times, he headed to the space formerly known as Loomis Camera, to oversee the packing of things he began accumulating during the Truman era: old cameras, coins, stamps, the once-risqué gag gifts that he kept in a back room.
Meanwhile, a few dozen yards away, in Donna's Diner, the morning regulars assembled. Here was Donna Dove, 57, the owner, who lives to cook but who struggles every month to pay her bills. Here was her waitress and granddaughter, Bridgette Harvan, 21, an unmarried college student who is six months pregnant.
And here were the workers and retirees who belong to the informal group called the Breakfast Club, including two longtime but adversarial friends: Jim Dall, 89 and Democrat, and Speedy Amos, 86 and Republican. Speedy, a Marine veteran of World War II and the Korean War, wore a button that said ''I Like Ike.'' Jim, a Navy veteran of World War II, wore a look of dismay.
Among those at Donna's, there might be the realization, or resignation, that the daily struggle for some in this city of 55,000 will continue no matter who is president. Poverty is rising, the downtown requires economic resuscitation, and the region has yet to fill the void left by all the many manufacturing businesses, now gone, that once provided prosperity.
Still, to a person, they all had already voted, or were about to.
Between serving Jim's usual breakfast of eggs over easy, rye toast, and refilling Speedy's mug, Bridgette said that she was voting -- for the first time -- as soon as her shift ended. ''I don't want to be mad at the results and know that I hadn't done anything,'' she explained.
Across the span of several generations, she found agreement from Jim, who turns 90 in a couple of weeks. He vividly recalled casting his own first vote, for Roosevelt.
''Teddy?'' asked Speedy.
But Jim said he was serious, and went on to equate the right to vote to something sacred. ''I think it's good for the soul,'' he said.
The breakfast crowd moved on, some of them to vote. Ike Maxwell, 59, a former football superstar for Elyria High School who has not been the same since a baseball-bat attack three decades ago, walked in and walked out. Then came the lunch crowd, some of them sampling items from the macaroni-and-cheese bar that Donna recently installed to reinvigorate her business.
Finally, when things quieted down, Donna slipped on her blue Donna's Diner windbreaker and slipped out the back door. She drove to a city recreation center, where voting booths were lined up along a basketball court's glassy parquet floor. After showing her identification, she stepped up to a booth and cast her ballot.
But how she voted, Donna said, is her business.

For Donna, Tuesday morning was business as usual behind the counter and in the kitchen. She struggles to pay her bills.

HEADLINE: Thomas K. McCraw, 72; Scholar of Lively Histories

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Thomas K. McCraw, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who used biography to explore thorny issues in economics, died on Saturday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 72.
He had been treated for heart and lung problems, his wife, Susan, said.
Professor McCraw, who taught from 1976 to 2007 at Harvard Business School, won the Pulitzer for history in 1985 for ''Prophets of Regulation: Charles Francis Adams, Louis D. Brandeis, James M. Landis and Alfred E. Kahn.'' The book focused on those men, of different eras, to illustrate how government regulation of industry affected the American economy from the late 19th to the late 20th centuries. 
Adams was president of the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1880s; Brandeis, the lawyer and Supreme Court justice, worked to curb the power of banks and corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Landis was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Depression, and Kahn was chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which deregulated airline fares in 1978.
The book was recognized for melding scholarship and engaging prose.
''Mr. McCraw explains sophisticated economic theory in accessible terms,'' The New York Times Book Review said, ''and he has a historian's knack for isolating such basic American traits as a mistrust of big business and for showing how regulators manipulated these traits to implement their policies.''
In ''Prophet of Innovation: Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction'' (2007), Professor McCraw examined capitalism through the life story of its leading 20th century advocate, with his Darwinian theory of ''creative destruction'': that businesses must be rendered obsolete and extinct by other, better businesses if an economy is to move forward.
In ''The Founders and Finance: How Hamilton, Gallatin and Other Immigrants Forged the American Economy,'' published this year, he wrote about how a nation born into financial ruin after the Revolution saved itself and created a stable financial system. He credited the efforts of immigrants like Alexander Hamilton, born on the Caribbean island of Nevis, who was the nation's first secretary of the Treasury, and the Swiss-born Albert Gallatin, who was the fourth Treasury secretary and whose almost-13-year tenure remains the longest in American history.
''The key feature of his work is the use of biography,'' said Geoffrey G. Jones, who succeeded Professor McCraw as the Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at Harvard. ''You hear about personal lives, motivations, but he manages to deal with issues, like regulation, that are usually left to dry textbooks. That was his real gift.''
Thomas Kincaid McCraw was born on Sept. 11, 1940, in Corinth, Miss., near where his father, John, a civil engineer for the Tennessee Valley Authority, was helping to build a dam. The family moved frequently, and Thomas graduated from high school in Florence, Ala.
He attended the University of Mississippi on a Navy R.O.T.C. scholarship and after graduation served four years in the Navy, mostly in Bermuda. He earned a master's degree and doctorate in history from the University of Wisconsin and taught at the University of Texas before moving to Harvard.
Professor McCraw lived in Belmont, Mass., with his wife, the former Susan Morehead. College sweethearts at Mississippi, they married in 1962. His other survivors include a daughter, Elizabeth McCarron; a son, Thomas Jr.; a brother, John; and three grandchildren.
Professor McCraw's other books include ''American Business, 1920-2000: How It Worked'' (2000), a compact overview.
At Harvard, he developed a standard first-year course for M.B.A. students, ''Creating Modern Capitalism,'' which enhanced the profile and popularity of business history at the school and whose syllabus became a textbook, now widely used, of the same name.
''He was a historian who made things accessible to a far wider range of people than normally read scholarly works,'' Professor Jones said. ''And not by trading down. The work isn't simplistic. It's engaged with materials in the deep sense. It's just very accessible. That's a very difficult thing to pull off. Very few academics can.''

HEADLINE: Tourism Up, Hotel Investors Flock to Miami Beach

BYLINE: By MATT HUDGINS

 BODY:
Real estate investors seem to be flocking to Miami Beach, in hopes of capturing part of the market's resurgent tourism industry by acquiring, or by expanding their investments in, the limited supply of hotel properties.
Decades of development have built up most of the potential hotel sites in Miami Beach, and virtually all of the beachfront or near-beachfront hotels on the Atlantic Ocean side of Miami Beach fall within one of several historic preservation districts. Those factors make new construction a rarity. Instead, investors seeking a piece of the hospitality pie typically acquire one of the many hotel properties on or near the waterfront and renovate to increase value and command higher room rates.
Buoyed by an economic rebound in tourism after the recession initially drove away some business, competitive bidding has pushed prices for some hotel properties to record highs. Venerable establishments along Miami Beach's Art Deco district that have undergone makeovers include the Royal Palm and the Ritz Plaza, and a renovation is under way at the former Gansevoort.
This month, the former Royal Palm at 1545 Collins Avenue will reopen as the James Royal Palm Hotel after a renovation. Denihan Hospitality Group of New York operates the 393-room property under the James brand. KSL Capital Partners, a private equity business based in Denver, owns the hotel. 
A consortium of Starwood Capital Group, the LeFrak Organization and Invesco Ltd. has changed the name of the Gansevoort Hotel at 2377 Collins Avenue to the Perry, and is investing more than $100 million in a renovation to be completed next year. The group acquired the Gansevoort early this year from a Credit Suisse subsidiary that had foreclosed on it in 2010. The mixed-use project has 334 hotel rooms, 255 residential condominium units, a rooftop pool and lounge, a restaurant and a pool plaza.
In June, the 140-room SLS Hotel South Beach at 1701 Collins Avenue opened in the shell of the former Ritz Plaza, a historic Art Deco structure. In January, St. Regis Hotels and Resorts opened the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort at the northern tip of Miami Beach, with 243 guest rooms and suites, as well as residences in three 27-story towers.
Demand for hotel rooms, dining and entertainment is sufficient to support more hotel renovation and expansion projects in Miami Beach, said Sam Bakhshandehpour, president of SBE, which owns SLS Hotels. SBE, which is based in Los Angeles, owns and operates the SLS Hotel South Beach and the two high-end restaurants on the property, The Bazaar by José Andrés and Katsuya by Starck.
Mr. Bakhshandehpour said hotels in Miami Beach were just beginning to bounce back after a pause in the recession, and would appreciate in value as other sectors of the economy gained strength.
''From a timing perspective, we're still on the cusp'' of economic growth, he said. ''The success of our property hasn't even been driven by an economic recovery.''
The recession did not hamper tourism in Miami Beach for long. The number of overnight visitors to the city dipped below 4.9 million in 2008, the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau reported, but by the end of 2009 the annual total had jumped to nearly 5.4 million. That was more than in 2007, before the bust. By the end of 2011, annual overnight stays exceeded 5.5 million.
The city's hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and stores have had a consistent inflow of dollars in recent years, reflected in steadily increasing hotel occupancy rates. This year through September, the average hotel occupancy rate reached 75.9 percent in Miami Beach, a 12-year high, said Jan Freitag, senior vice president at STR, a hospitality research business.
Healthy occupancy is generating impressive revenue gains, said Marlo Courtney, the developer and managing director of Goldman Properties. On Ocean Drive alone, room revenue rocketed to $63 million in 2011, up nearly 25 percent from $51 million in 2010, said Mr. Courtney, who is president of the Ocean Drive Association, a business group. ''That was a pretty remarkable increase in our revenues, and it was great for the Ocean Drive community and our hotels.''
Real estate investors picked up on the economic rebound in 2010, and competitive bidding has pushed prices to prerecession levels, said Christian Charre, a local real estate broker.
''They don't make any more beach, and there is a limited number of projects available, so that is creating pent-up demand,'' said Mr. Charre, who is president and chief executive of the Charre Group, a Miami company that deals exclusively in hotels.
A fully renovated hotel on one of Miami Beach's main drives along the Atlantic -- either Ocean Drive in South Beach, or Collins Avenue north of 15th Street -- would sell today for $500,000 to $900,000 per room, equivalent to prerecession prices, Mr. Charre said.
For unrenovated hotels, ''you will see transactions happening now at about $250,000 per key, but you have to consider that a significant amount of money is going to be invested in the property,'' he said. ''They'll end up at about $500,000 a key.''
The Delano, a 194-room hotel at 1685 Collins Avenue, could fetch as much as $900,000 per room, Mr. Charre speculated. Morgans Hotel Group in New York recently completed a multimillion-dollar renovation of the property and is seeking a buyer.
Keith Menin, the principal at Menin Hotels, said he was frequently surprised by prices in Miami Beach. ''Every time I think a hotel has been sold at a crazy price, another one sells,'' Mr. Menin said.
Menin Hotels, which is based in Miami Beach, owns all or part of five local hotels, including its latest project, the Gale South Beach and Regent Hotel, which is set to open in December at 1690 Collins Avenue. The property combines the shell of the original Gale Hotel, built in 1941, with a former nursing home next door to form an 87-room complex.
Boutique hotels, which offer a high level of customer service and charge accordingly, dominate Miami Beach. That compels the relatively few larger properties to provide better service to compete for customers, said Jeff Lehman, general manager of the Betsy, a boutique hotel in the South Beach neighborhood. Of the 19,000 hotel rooms in the city, 12,000 to 15,000 are in properties with 200 rooms or fewer, said Mr. Lehman, the board chairman for the Miami Beach Visitor and Convention Authority.
Beachfront hotel buyers in Miami Beach must pay extra attention to revenue and expenses to ensure a return that exceeds the market's high acquisition and operating costs, said Scott D. Berman, principal in the Miami office of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
''There has got to be an economically compelling story,'' said Mr. Berman, who monitors the hospitality and leisure industries. Because they occupy a peninsula of high-priced hospitality venues, Miami Beach hotels face costly challenges obtaining goods and services, including food, supplies and affordable labor. ''It's a really unique, eclectic geography, and you sort of throw industry standards out the door,'' he said.
Are investors in Miami Beach creating a bubble of inflated hotel prices? Not yet, say industry officials, including Saul Gross, founder and president of Streamline Properties, a local real estate company. Hotel investors today tend to buy with cash rather than with borrowed money, and most investors renovate after buying, which should make it easier to recoup their investment and generate profit over time or in an eventual resale, they said.
''I'm not as concerned at these price levels as I was before'' the financial crisis, Mr. Gross said.

HEADLINE: Winning a Second Term, Obama Will Confront Familiar Headwinds

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As President Obama turns his attention once again to filling out a cabinet and writing an Inaugural Address, this much is clear: he should not expect to bask in a surge of national unity, or to witness a crowd of millions overrun the Mall just to say they were there.
That brief moment after the election four years ago, when many Americans thought Mr. Obama's election would presage a new, less fractious political era, now seems very much a thing of the past. The generational shift Mr. Obama once embodied is, in fact, well under way, but it will not change Washington as quickly -- or as harmoniously -- as a lot of voters once hoped.
At this time in 2008, even as the global economy veered toward collapse, optimism about Washington ran surprisingly high. In polling by the Pew Research Center in November 2008, fully half the respondents thought the two parties would cooperate more in the coming year, versus only 36 percent who thought the climate would grow more adversarial. As Mr. Obama prepared to take the oath, his approval rating touched a remarkable 70 percent in some polling -- a reflection of good will across the political spectrum. 
More than anything else, Mr. Obama's election seemed to signal the closing of one generational chapter in American politics -- the cultural and ideological divide that grew out of the '60s and came to poison the Clinton-Bush years -- and the opening of another.
The country's first black president, and its first president to reach adulthood after the Vietnam War and Watergate, Mr. Obama seemed like a digital-age leader who could at last dislodge the stalemate between those who clung to the government of the Great Society, on the one hand, and those who disdained the very idea of government, on the other.
''On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics,'' Mr. Obama vowed in his Inaugural Address. He said the central question was ''not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works.''
This time around, the economic picture looks, if not exactly vibrant, then considerably more promising. And yet attitudes about Washington have never been darker or more polarized. According to Pew, partisanship is now at a record high and trust in government at a record low. (Only one in five voters in a poll last October said government could be trusted to do what is right most or all of the time -- a 10-point drop since 2007.)
Far from closing the door on the leadership of the '60s generation, Mr. Obama's presidency seems to have brought it back in full force. The Clintons, who once seemed banished to the wilds of Westchester County, are once again the most powerful family in Democratic politics, with talk of another Clinton presidency already rife in Washington.
Another Bush -- George W.'s brother Jeb -- is likely to be a big player in the Republican Party's future. And the most powerful grass-roots force in America, the Tea Party, derives its energy mostly from the same older, white voters who once vilified Bill Clinton.
In other words, the sun-filled era of ''hope'' and ''change'' looks a lot like the long boomer-led twilight that preceded it.
There are, of course, plenty of explanations for why Mr. Obama's election did not usher in a less contentious political moment. Republicans say he squandered his opportunity to remake the political climate by adopting a traditionally liberal agenda. They point to his first big initiative, the stimulus package worth more than $700 billion, and the health care law that represented an expansion of government rivaling programs from the 1960s.
Democrats, meanwhile, point out that Republicans seem to have made a conscious decision, beginning with the stimulus, to oppose anything the president put forward, dooming any chance of renewed cooperation between the parties. Mr. Obama never found a generational counterpart among conservatives in Congress like Paul D. Ryan or Eric Cantor; instead, there was a mutual animosity.
But the greater truth may be that this is simply how generational and cultural change really comes to Washington -- not in the flash of one man's election, but gradually and tumultuously, with moments in which we lurch forward interrupted by stretches that drag us back.
The best analogue may be the administration of President John F. Kennedy, which began in 1961 much as Mr. Obama's did in 2009 -- with an expectation that ''the torch had passed,'' as Kennedy put it. It did not stay lit for long. Kennedy's ambitious legislative agenda stalled in Congressional committees run by the elders in his own party. The younger liberals who had supported him, meanwhile, quickly rebelled against the slow pace of change.
''Even when you elect someone from a new generation,'' says the historian Robert Dallek, ''it's not as if you've broken faith with the old generation. They're still there.''
In other words, the expectation that Mr. Obama himself could somehow create a less embittered political culture was probably unreasonable, given that three of the four party leaders in Congress are over 70 (and the fourth, Speaker John A. Boehner, is 62). Mr. Obama's election did nothing to change the composition of either party's aging establishment.
In fact, the youngest voters in the political system, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Obama in 2008, seem to understand that a real transition is under way, even if the debate in Washington still feels like an endless rerun of ''All in the Family.''
Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais, co-authors of ''Millennial Momentum,'' point to polls showing that voters now 30 and younger are more optimistic about Washington than any other age cohort. ''You get the sense that while their optimism in the rock star Obama may have diminished when he got to the business of governance, millennials feel like we're still headed in the right direction,'' Mr. Hais says.
Mr. Winograd and Mr. Hais argue that as more Americans enter the voting pool, they will largely espouse a distinctly post-boomer philosophy -- one that embraces the essential role of an activist federal government while also leaving many details to individuals and communities.
It is the kind of modern liberalism, rooted more in choice and customization, that Mr. Obama might have been looking toward when he asked politicians in both parties to jettison ''petty grievances'' and ''worn-out dogmas.'' It is reflected, too, in some of his policies, most notably the ''Race to the Top'' education program that has won praise from reformists in both parties.
So, depending on how he chooses to govern over the next four years, Mr. Obama may yet have a chance to reset the stale debate in Washington, or at least to hasten the transition from one moment to the next. His re-election opens the door further for the post-'60s generation, even if it does not quite clear the room.

HEADLINE: Get What You Pay For? Not Always

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
The most expensive election campaign in American history is over. Executives across America can now begin to assess what their companies will get in return for the roughly $2 billion spent by business interests.
Regardless of the outcome, the conclusion is likely to be not very much. From the point of view of shareholders, corporate contributions will probably turn out to be, at best, a waste of money. At worst, they could undermine their companies' performance for a long time.
As Wall Street knows well, the pitfalls of political spending start with picking the wrong horse: the financiers who broke so decisively for Barack Obama in 2008 changed their minds after the president started labeling them fat cats and supported a financial reform law they hate. This time they put $20 million in the campaign of Mitt Romney, more than three times what they contributed to President Obama's re-election. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, once one of President Obama's favorite bankers, now calls himself ''barely a Democrat.'' 
But the bankers' collective ''oops'' is not the only reason to doubt the wisdom of Big Business's campaign spending. A rash of recent studies suggest that most businesses that invest in elections may do more than come up empty-handed. Spending on politics can do businesses lasting harm -- damaging their reputations and distorting their investment decisions.
It's hard to tell exactly how much money companies sank into the election. But it's a lot. Only $75 million of the $650 million or so raised by ''super PACS'' through the end of October to support (or, mostly, attack) candidates came from corporations directly, according to the Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group. But that's just part of the pie. Nonprofits like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which don't have to disclose their donors, spent about $300 million during the campaign -- mostly supporting Republicans. Even when companies don't contribute directly to campaigns, their executives may, often through corporate political action committees.
Campaign finance watchdogs are sifting through the data to determine just how much money was unleashed by the Supreme Court's decision in 2010 to remove limits on corporate campaign contributions and to assess the impact on American politics. They worry that the rush of corporate cash will corrupt the political process -- reshaping the political map and creating insidious bonds between elected officials and those who finance them.
Corporate watchdogs suggest another cause for concern: campaign contributions driven by corporate executives might harm the long-term interests of their shareholders.
A study published last summer by scholars at Rice University and Long Island University looked at nearly 1,000 firms in the Standard & Poor's 1,500-stock composite index between 1998 and 2008 and found that most companies that spent on politics -- including lobbying and campaign donations -- had lower stock market returns.
Another study published this year by economists at the University of Minnesota and the University of Kansas found that companies that contributed to political action committees and other outside political groups between 1991 and 2004 grew more slowly than other firms. These companies invested less and spent less on research and development.
Notably, the study determined that corporate donations to the winners in presidential or Congressional races did not lead to better stock performance over the long term. Indeed, the shares of companies that engaged in political spending underperformed those of companies that did not contribute.
And the relationship between politics and poor performance seems to go both ways: underperforming companies spend more on politics, but spending on politics may also lead companies to underperform.
Campaign spending by politically active concerns and their executives increased sharply after the Supreme Court's decision to remove limits on corporate donations. According to a study by John Coates of the Harvard Business School, the jump in spending led to a deterioration of companies' market value compared with firms that did not spend on political campaigns. ''These results are inconsistent with a simple theory in which corporate political activity can be presumed to serve the interests of shareholders,'' Mr. Coates wrote.
These conclusions don't generally apply to companies in heavily regulated sectors -- where political contributions might make sense. Mr. Coates pointed out that it was difficult to reach conclusions about the effectiveness of spending in these areas, like banking or telecommunications, because the companies all spend so much supporting candidates and lobbying.
But the recent performance of the financial industry suggests that political spending can be counterproductive even in the most highly regulated industries. A study at the International Monetary Fund found that the banks that lobbied most aggressively to prevent laws limiting predatory lending and mortgage securitization engaged in riskier lending, experienced higher delinquency rates and suffered a bigger shock during the financial crisis.
Political investments can damage a company's reputation, or anger supporters of the ''other side.'' Darcy Burner, a former Microsoft programmer running as a Democrat for Washington State's 1st Congressional District, has even proposed an iPhone app that would allow shoppers to scan a bar code to check the political spending of the companies making the products on the shelf and their top executives.
Campaign watchdogs fear that undisclosed contributions to independent groups supporting candidates will allow companies to hide their political activity. Companies worry that nondisclosure will allow independent groups to blackmail them into supporting the candidates they represent.
The Conference Board, a trade organization grouping the biggest businesses in the nation, has published an analysis of the new landscape of political spending. The title is ''Dangerous Terrain.''
The Conference Board report suggests that ''most companies will continue to play the game because their competitors are staying in.'' This is a reason that political contributions yield so little for individual firms: political spending becomes a futile arms race between companies trying to buy an edge over their rivals.
But that's not the only reason.
Corporate executives often spend on politics not to improve their companies' profitability but to serve their own objectives -- from supporting a personal ideological agenda to building a future career in politics. This kind of spending does little for their companies.
Think of all the former corporate executives in the last couple of administrations. Goldman Sachs alone gave us Robert E. Rubin, Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr. More than one in 10 chief executives get political jobs after they retire. Unsurprisingly perhaps, Mr. Coates found that the biggest political contributions came from firms with weak corporate governance, where shareholders had little control over their top executives' actions.
Poor governance explains, in part, why political spenders have worse results. But political activity itself could lead to poor business decisions. Executives involved in politics might lose strategic focus. And their political contributions might skew investments in a way that does shareholders no good.
Remember AT&T's attempt to buy rival T-Mobile last year for $39 billion? By the standard metrics used by antitrust regulators to assess market concentration, the deal was bound to be rejected. It would have taken out one of only three competitors to AT&T in the national market for mobile telecommunications. It would have sharply reduced competition in the nation's top cities.
AT&T could count on perhaps the strongest network of political connections in corporate America -- nurtured with $58 million in campaign contributions since 1990, plus $306 million in lobbying expenses, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the House, 76 Democrats signed a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department supporting the deal. Letters supporting the merger poured in from liberal-leaning beneficiaries of AT&T's largess -- including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Education Association.
Political alliances, however, were not enough to win the day, as the government rejected the merger. AT&T and its shareholders had to pay about $6 billion in breakup fees. Over all, it was a bad deal.

HEADLINE: From Frustrated to Nervous, Television Networks' Moods Explain Results

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
When a test is really, really hard, students sometimes can't resist looking at the face of the class know-it-all for signs of dismay or discomfort. And on a really, really close election night, even anchors at rival networks couldn't help sneaking a peek at the mood over at Fox News.
At one point when Florida was neck and neck, David Gregory of NBC News bolstered his point that it was too close for comfort for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, by citing signs of irritation at Fox News. He noted that Mike Huckabee, a Fox contributor, had complained that the Republicans had done a pathetic job of reaching out to minorities. 
And Fox News was the channel to watch on this election night. On most days, it presents an alternative reality to its rivals, alerting viewers to Black Panthers stalking polling stations or citing a survey that had given Mr. Romney a double-digit lead over the president he was trying to oust.
But on election night, everyone had to work with the same numbers. And in the end, Fox News called the election for Mr. Obama at the same time as CNN, even though the Romney campaign and their own expert, Karl Rove, said Fox was wrong. The subsequent dispute on-screen was, as one anchor said, ''awkward.'' Megyn Kelly left the set and marched down a corridor, a camera in tow, to interview the channel's number crunchers, who said that Mr. Romney's hopes had run out.
Throughout the night, if Fox News anchors looked less than jubilant, then that alone was a sign that President Obama was holding his own and that early polls showing him with a slight lead were accurate. Brit Hume put it this way: For Mr. Romney to win, he would have to ''draw to an inside straight.''
News divisions didn't want to repeat mistakes of elections past, so anchors were cagey and cautious. As Brian Williams said on NBC, ''We're not being coy, we know no results that we are not passing along, but we can all look at those numbers for hints of the story line that we will be covering tonight.''
Mostly, anchors deconstructed the narrative like professors in a comparative literature class, pulling apart states and putting them at different ends of screens, making the country look, physically, more divided than it really is.
And with so little to give, the networks compensated with extravagant décor. NBC turned Rockefeller Center into a ''Democracy Plaza'' with a giant election map etched into the ice of the skating rink and added another gimmick: graphics on a building facade that acted as an Electoral College scoreboard. CNN, not to be outdone, had its own version sprawled over the Empire State Building like a star-spangled King Kong.
ABC put its stamp on it capacious set, which when the camera pulled back was dominated by a huge round floor map left empty. Seated at the far edge, the anchors George Stephanopoulos and Diane Sawyer looked like ''Dancing With the Stars'' judges waiting for contestants to start the next paso doble competition.
But it was the judges whose rhythm was noticeably out of sync. Ms. Sawyer's affect seemed a bit off-kilter much of the night, with bursts of enthusiasm that didn't quite match the matter at hand, at one point joyfully congratulating a panelist when she heeded a news-alert alarm and stopped talking. Ms. Sawyer cheerfully introduced Barbara Walters, a host of ''The View,'' as someone who had interviewed presidents all the way back to Nixon, and all the first ladies ''beyond that,'' which may have sounded to some that she meant further back in time. Katie Couric monitored social media for a while but her role seemed very limited given her star power.
There wasn't nearly as much gaiety at CBS, where Scott Pelley in a gray suit seemed color-coordinated with the network's electoral map. At times, the CBS set seemed as sedate and subdued as the quiet car on the Acela. To lighten the mood, Bob Schieffer took on the Andy Rooney role of network naif, marveling over the high turnout. ''Do you suppose that because we and everyone else in the media has been saying that this all comes down to turnout, people apparently heard it and thought they better turn out?'' he asked Mr. Pelley with a chuckle.
As the night wore on, the words ''too close to call'' became fainter.
''Barack Obama will win because he did a good job of campaigning, he will not win because of the state of the economy,'' the Fox anchor Bret Baier said somberly. "But Republicans will look back starting tomorrow, for what happened.''

HEADLINE: President Obama's Success

 BODY:
President Obama's dramatic re-election victory was not a sign that a fractured nation had finally come together on Election Day. But it was a strong endorsement of economic policies that stress job growth, health care reform, tax increases and balanced deficit reduction -- and of moderate policies on immigration, abortion and same-sex marriage. It was a repudiation of Reagan-era bromides about tax-cutting and trickle-down economics, and of the politics of fear, intolerance and disinformation.
The president's victory depended heavily on Midwestern Rust Belt states like Ohio, where the bailout of the auto industry -- which Mr. Obama engineered and Mr. Romney opposed -- proved widely popular for the simple reason that it worked. 
More broadly, Midwestern voters seemed to endorse the president's argument that the government has a significant role in creating private-sector jobs and boosting the economy. They rejected Mr. Romney's position that Washington should simply stay out of such matters and let the free market work its will.
The Republicans' last-ditch attempt to steal away Pennsylvania by stressing unemployment was a failure there and elsewhere. Voters who said unemployment was a major issue voted mainly for Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney, it turns out, made a fatal decision during the primaries to endorse a hard line on immigration, which earned him a resounding rejection by Latinos. By adopting a callous position that illegal immigrants could be coerced into ''self-deportation,'' and by praising Arizona's cruel immigration law, Mr. Romney made his road in Florida and several other crucial states much harder. Only one-third of voters said illegal immigrants should all be deported, while two-thirds endorsed some path to legal residency and citizenship. The Republican approach, if unchanged, will cost them dearly in the future.
Still, Mr. Obama's victory did not show a united country. Richer Americans supported Mr. Romney, while poorer Americans tended to vote for Mr. Obama. There also remained clear divisions among voters by gender, age, race and religion.
African-Americans and Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama. White men voted for Mr. Romney; he won among those who said they opposed gay marriage, wanted to outlaw abortion, or favored mass deportation of illegal immigrants. None of those are majority positions in this country anymore.
Mr. Romney's strategy of blaming Mr. Obama for just about everything, while serenely assuring Americans he had a plan to cut the deficit without raising taxes or making major cuts in Medicare, simply did not work.
A solid majority of voters said President George W. Bush was to blame for the state of the economy rather than Mr. Obama. And voters showed more subtlety in their economic analysis than Mr. Romney probably expected. Those who thought the housing market and unemployment were the nation's biggest problems said they voted for Mr. Obama. Those most concerned about taxes voted heavily for Mr. Romney.
Significantly, 60 percent of voters said taxes should be raised either on the rich or on everyone. Only 35 percent said they should not be raised at all; that group, naturally, went heavily for Mr. Romney. The polling made it clear that Americans were unhappy with the economic status quo, and substantial numbers of voters said the economy was getting worse. But Mr. Romney did not seem to persuade voters that the deficit was a crushing problem. Only 1 in 10 voters said the deficit was the most important issue facing the country.
Republicans had to be disappointed in the results of their unrelenting assault on Mr. Obama's health care reform law. Only around a quarter of Americans said it should be repealed in its entirety.
People who were comfortable with the rightward slide of the Republican Party (as measured by their comfort with the Tea Party) voted heavily for Mr. Romney.
But Christopher Murphy's victory over Linda McMahon in the Senate race in Connecticut, Joe Donnelly's defeat of Richard Mourdock in Indiana's Senate race and Claire McCaskill's defeat of Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate race showed the price the Republicans are paying for nominating fringe candidates in their primaries.
The polls were heartening in that they indicated that a solid majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal, and that half of Americans now say their states should recognize marriages between same-sex couples.
That the race came down to a relatively small number of voters in a relatively small number of states did not speak well for a national election apparatus that is so dependent on badly engineered and badly managed voting systems around the country. The delays and breakdowns in voting machines were inexcusable.

HEADLINE: A Message in Obama's Re-election

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama's Night'' (nytimes.com, Nov. 7):
The 2012 election results should serve as wake-up call to many in the Republican Party that the future is about real inclusiveness. The America that once was, reflected in the crowds that Mitt Romney drew on the campaign trail, is a fading America that is holding onto outdated notions.
With President Obama's victory, the world has witnessed an America leading the way toward a tent where all ideas are heard and all talents are considered. That America was seen in the crowds that President Obama drew on the campaign trail. That America will lead the world in tolerance. 
ALFRED WADDELL West Dennis, Mass., Nov. 7, 2012
Before the results of Tuesday's election were known, readers weighed in on their voting experiences and on the campaign that just ended:
To the Editor:
I write this letter with icy cold hands after spending more than an hour on line outside my polling place. How can our nation invest so much time and money on federal elections, only to have the voting process be managed so ineptly?
I suspect that this is one point on which all sides will agree: It should not take hours to cast a vote in a country where we have more than 200 years of experience at the polls.
SUZANNE B. GOLDBERG New York, Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
Having pulled the lever in voting booths for many years, I voted in New York today with the new optical scanning method. I was chagrined to see that the new procedures are the death knell for a truly secret ballot.
As you approach the scanning machine, the voting officials whisk away your concealing folder and you're left holding your filled-in ballot. Anyone nearby can easily see your vote, unless you clutch it to your chest and slide it furtively into the scanner.
The clunky old voting booth was truly private. This new procedure is not. I'm troubled that this lack of secrecy may well intimidate a citizen who wants to vote for a locally unpopular candidate, but does not wish to be ridiculed by a nearby spouse or neighbor at the polling place.
GREG SCHWED New York, Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''The Real Loser: Truth,'' by Kevin M. Kruse (Op-Ed, Nov. 6):
Distortions and lies in politics aren't going to go away after today. Elections have become enormously expensive sporting events: Everyone just wants his or her own team to win and the other to lose. That mind-set doesn't care about policy, positions, even character.
People on both sides have become ''fans'' instead of citizens, a win-at-all-costs civic melee. No one is seen as fair-minded, so why should we listen to one another?
The best we common people can do to heal our nation is to be as honest about our own party's and candidates' flaws and faults as we are about the opposition's. Then maybe we will start respecting one another, and insist on honesty from our public servants.
SUSAN FIORE Verona, Wis., Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
I just returned from voting, which was my way of repudiating Mitt Romney's consistent refusal to be truthful with the American electorate.
I couldn't agree more with ''The Real Loser: Truth.'' How can we ever vote intelligently and in the best interests of our nation if our candidates will not even speak to us honestly? And how will our democracy continue if we have no way to find the truth as we try to educate ourselves for our elections?
SUSAN McCARTHY White Plains, Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
Once an entire class of high school students whom I taught was convinced that hospitals performed head transplants because they had seen it on television (in a sci-fi movie).
Politicians do not have to fool all of the people all of the time. With the presidential candidates raising a total of $2 billion in a close contest, lies swaying slim numbers can buy elections.
CHARLES MERRILL New York, Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
As a progressive who is far left on cultural issues and more center left on economic ones, I found that David Brooks's Nov. 2 column, ''The Final Reckoning,'' really captured the Obama legacy.
We on the left are disappointed not in the quality or integrity of the man, but in his political skills. He has failed to deliver the beginning of the grand transformation to a more just and equitable society.
Mr. Brooks's comments on the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan were right on target. If President Obama had embraced the plan, it would have gotten many conservatives and independents in his camp.
If Mr. Obama is re-elected, his main task should be not only to imagine a better world, but also to think how to prevent a worse one.
If Mitt Romney wins and the neoconservatives take over our foreign policy again, we can only hope that he's really a Rockefeller Republican in disguise!
GERARD M. SUMMERS Malvern, Pa., Nov. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Spirit of America'' (column, nytimes.com, Nov. 6):
I think Roger Cohen today got it just right. Our country embodies a great idea. Everyone is equal and has equal opportunity (obviously, this idea is still evolving). Simple to state; difficult to execute. Nonetheless, a cursory view of our history would demonstrate that we have made and continue to make progress toward that idea.
As I write this letter, we do not yet know who will win this election, but Barack Hussein Obama certainly exemplifies my view of the idea of the greatness, renewal and marvel of the United States.
MARC CHAFETZ Washington, Nov. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
A. A. Gill observes that the disappointment that ''Americans may be harboring over the Obama term is nothing compared with the garland-wrenching grief in Europe'' (''How Obama Lost the Europe Primary,'' Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 6). True enough.
But as a Briton who lives in the United States and travels frequently to Germany, I am struck by how poorly informed most Europeans are about the structure of American government, placing the blame for inaction on the president while failing to notice that its two other arms are equally complicit in their disappointment.
Mr. Gill might look to his own European media as much as to the president for the source of Europe's chagrin.

HEADLINE: Electorate Reverts to a Partisan Divide as Obama's Support Narrows

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN

 BODY:
With voters worn by hard times yet many of them hopeful of better times ahead, Americans reverted to more traditional lines compared with the broader-based coalition that made Barack Obama president four years ago.
President Obama held onto the demographic groups that traditionally make up his party's base -- young and unmarried people, political moderates, women, blacks, Latinos, the least and most educated, city dwellers, lower-income voters and union members -- yet struggled with others who helped sweep him to victory in 2008.
Men, political independents and suburbanites -- who backed Mr. Obama four years ago -- this time gave more votes to Mitt Romney, according to Edison Research surveys of voters leaving the polls and of telephone interviews with some of the roughly 30 million Americans who voted early. 
The president did barely hold onto college graduates and mothers, two groups that until 2008 were a mainstay of the Republican Party, and he hung onto Roman Catholics. Mr. Obama and his campaign assiduously courted the groups, just as last time. But he lost the independents who were among the most closely watched groups in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Virginia, except in Florida, where he had a narrow edge late in the evening.
Mr. Romney retained the support of most other typically Republican groups, including whites, older Americans, Southerners, rural residents, married voters, regular churchgoers and, overwhelmingly, white evangelical Christians, many of whom expressed hostility toward Mr. Romney, as a Mormon, in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns.
Perhaps indicating their antipathy to Mr. Obama, white evangelical Christians were more supportive of Mr. Romney than they were of Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee of 2008, and roughly as supportive as they were of President George W. Bush. And Mr. Obama's support among Jewish voters slipped by eight points.
Mr. Romney got the votes of more whites than Mr. McCain, and, unlike Mr. McCain, he was supported by a majority of white voters under age 30.
In short, the electorate this year looked a lot more like that of 2004, when Mr. Bush narrowly defeated Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, to win re-election, than Mr. Obama's diverse majority of 2008. The shifts among major demographic groups were first seen in the 2010 midterm elections, when the Democrats lost control of Congress as the economy sputtered. But Democrats made up a larger share of the electorate, similar to 2008, at 38 percent, with 32 percent identifying as Republicans and 30 percent as independents.
Significantly, the electorate's view of the government's role in the economy has shifted away from Mr. Obama's call for a kind of public-private partnership, and toward Mr. Romney's hands-off, free-market platform.
In November 2008, when the country was floundering in the worst recession since the Depression, Election Day surveys of voters found that 51 percent of them wanted government to do more to intervene while 43 percent said it was doing too many things better left to businesses. Now, after four years of government activism, those numbers have flipped.
In some states where government intervention like the auto bailout was palpable, however, Mr. Obama benefited. For example, Ohio voters overwhelmingly supported the 2009 federal aid to automakers, according to surveys of those who voted, and about three-quarters of them backed Mr. Obama.
This was no surprise: a big majority nationally said the economy was the most important issue. Majorities of those voters and of the smaller portion who called federal budget deficits the nation's primary issue supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama won most voters who named foreign policy or health care as their top concern.
A majority still blames Mr. Bush more than Mr. Obama for the economy's lingering problems. That helps explain how the president remained a formidable contender for a second term though no modern incumbent had won re-election with an unemployment rate near 8 percent.
So does the growing share of voters who view the economy's condition -- and their own -- as improving. Four in 10 said the economy is getting better, and they overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama. Those who said it is ''staying the same'' or getting worse backed Mr. Romney.
As in national polls before the election, just over half of voters said the country is on the wrong track. Still, 54 percent of voters approved of Mr. Obama's job performance, about the same rating that Mr. Bush had when he was re-elected.
The president was probably helped in the campaign's final week by his widely praised handling of the federal government's response to Hurricane Sandy. Nearly two-thirds of voters said it was a factor in their vote; those who called it important chose Mr. Obama.
He was seen generally as more empathetic and better able to handle Medicare and an international crisis. The two were about even when it came to who was better able to handle the economy and the federal budget deficit.
Three-fifths of voters said they opposed raising taxes to help cut the deficit, a finding that favored Mr. Romney. But almost half support higher taxes on incomes over $250,000, as Mr. Obama has proposed.
The Obama campaign's emphasis on winning Latino voters seemed to pay off. Mr. Obama maintained support among Latino voters, who are about one in 10 of the electorate, and growing, including in swing states and Republican states like Texas.
Mr. Obama got about 7 in 10 Latinos and more than 9 of 10 black voters. He also won overwhelming support from the small, growing slice of voters who are Asian-Americans.
Some Republican leaders have warned of the danger for their party as the nation becomes less white if Democrats solidify the allegiance of such ethnic groups as Latinos and Asian-Americans, or, conversely, if Republicans forfeit it by perpetuating their image as a party hostile to immigrants. A few leaders, like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, warned Mr. Romney during the Republican nomination race that his hard-line stand on immigration could backfire.
Mr. Obama, aides say, will try to enlist Republicans in Congress to overhaul immigration law, and the voter surveys provided ammunition: two-thirds said illegal immigrant workers should be ''offered a chance to apply for legal status.''
Seven in 10 voters said they made up their mind before September; they favored Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Republicans Face Struggle Over Party's Direction

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Michael D. Shear and Allison Kopicki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's loss to a Democratic president wounded by a weak economy is certain to spur an internecine struggle over the future of the Republican Party, but the strength of the party's conservatives in Congress and the rightward tilt of the next generation of party leaders could limit any course correction.
With their party on the verge of losing the popular presidential vote for the fifth time in six elections, Republicans across the political spectrum anticipate a prolonged and probably divisive period of self-examination.
The coming debate will be centered on whether the party should keep pursuing the antigovernment focus that grew out of resistance to the health care law and won them the House in 2010, or whether it should focus on a strategy that recognizes the demographic tide running strongly against it. 
''There will be some kind of war,'' predicted Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican Party consultant, suggesting it would pit ''mathematicians'' like him, who argue that the party cannot keep surrendering the votes of Hispanics, blacks, younger voters and college-educated women, against the party purists, or ''priests,'' as he puts it, who believe that basic conservative principles can ultimately triumph without much deviation.
''We are in a situation where the Democrats are getting a massive amount of votes for free,'' Mr. Murphy said.
But the debate will not just be about demographics. Ralph Reed, a veteran of the conservative movement, said that Mr. Romney's loss would stir resentment among those who believe the party made a mistake in nominating a more centrist Republican who had to work to appeal to the party's base.
''There's definitely a feeling that it would be better to nominate a conservative of long-standing conviction,'' he said.
As a party, Republicans continue to depend heavily on older working-class white voters in rural and suburban America -- a shrinking percentage of the overall electorate -- while Democrats rack up huge majorities among urban voters including blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. Not to mention younger Americans who are inclined to get their political news from Comedy Central and will not necessarily become more conservative as they age. The disparity means that Democrats can get well under 50 percent of the white vote and still win the presidency, a split that is only going to widen in the future.
According to exit polls, about 7 in 10 Hispanics said they were voting for Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney won the support of nearly 6 in 10 whites. In urban areas, white voters were split over the two candidates, but about 6 in 10 white voters in the suburbs went for Mr. Romney, as did nearly two-thirds in rural areas.
Mr. Romney won a majority of voters 65 or older, while Mr. Obama was backed by 6 in 10 Americans under 30, and won a narrow majority of those under 44.
Even as they absorbed Mr. Romney's defeat, the party's top elected officials, strategists and activists said they believed that Republicans had offered a persuasive message of economic opportunism and fiscal restraint. While the messenger may have been flawed, they argued, Republicans should not stray from that approach in a moment of panic.
''The party has to continually ask ourselves, what do we represent?'' said Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican seen as a top White House contender in 2016. ''But we have to remain the movement on behalf of upward mobility, the party people identify with their hopes and dreams. People want to have a chance.''
Matt Kibbe, the president of the Tea Party-aligned group FreedomWorks, acknowledged there would be a natural struggle for the identity of the party in the election's aftermath. But he argued that in some respects the fight had already been waged and won by the energized grass-roots forces that have shaped the contours of Republican politics in recent elections.
''You are going to see a continuation of the fight between the old guard and all of the new blood that has come in since 2010, but I don't know how dramatic it is going to be,'' he said. ''It is getting to point where you can't reach back and pull another establishment Republican from the queue like we have done with Romney.''
Besides Mr. Rubio, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the unsuccessful vice-presidential candidate, will now be seen as a chief party voice, as will Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. House Republicans particularly can be expected to gravitate to Mr. Ryan. Among others considered on the rise are Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and all can to some extent attribute their success to Tea Party-style politics with an emphasis on cutting spending and shrinking government.
As possible counterbalances, Republicans point to former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who has shown an ability to connect with Hispanic voters, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has been able to win in a blue state. But the more conservative up-and-comers seem to have the upper hand for now, even in defeat.
And while Senate Republicans did not make the gains they anticipated -- and some of their likely wins became losses in races where their candidates were deemed too extreme -- they added internally to their conservative ranks, with victories by Ted Cruz in Texas and other Republicans expected to pick off Democratic seats.
With House Republicans easily holding on to their majority, Republicans will arguably be more conservative in the 113th Congress than they were in the 112th.
The first test of whether Republicans see any political need to be more conciliatory will come quickly in the lame duck session of Congress this month, when they will face pressure from the White House, Congressional Democrats and perhaps the Senate Republican leadership to strike a deal to avert the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the beginning of automatic across-the-board spending cuts.
If rank-and-file Republicans dig in, it will be a seen as strong indication that they remain unwilling to make the kind of concessions they fear could bring them primary election challenges or cost them in a future presidential primary.
To some in the centrist wing of the party, the need to move toward the middle could not have been more obvious as Republicans came into the 2012 election cycle with built-in advantages in both the presidential and Congressional contests.
''We have to recognize the demographic changes in this country,'' said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who has watched as the number of her fellow moderate Republicans in the Senate declined. ''Republicans cannot win with just rural, white voters.''
Democrats sense a parallel to their own recent history when an increasingly liberal party seen as losing touch with mainstream America was defeated in three consecutive presidential elections, in 1980, 1984 and 1988, before Bill Clinton, who practiced a centrist style of politics, won two terms.
''They need a Bill Clinton moment,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and former top aide to both Presidents Clinton and Obama. Though many Republicans still see no impetus for drastic change, there does seem to be a growing consensus that the party needs to somehow repair its relations with the nation's Hispanics, a group that has socially and fiscally conservative tendencies and one in which Republicans enjoyed some success during the administration of former President George W. Bush.
But that support has deteriorated steadily since the 2004 election. Mr. Rubio, a Cuban-American, said his party has to begin by striking a different tone on immigration, pushing for improvements in the existing immigration system and talking more about the capacity to enter the United States legally.

HEADLINE: New Inroad for G.O.P. As Democrats Lose Statehouse in South

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
OLYMPIA, Wash. -- The Republicans on Tuesday picked up a governor's office that has recently, not to mention historically, been in Democratic Party control, in North Carolina, adding to a streak of gains in recent elections that has given the party a strong majority in state capitals.
But Democratic incumbents held on in Delaware and Vermont in an election year when many voters were distracted from governors' races by other contests and issues -- from the presidential race to the control of Congress. And Democrats also held on to the governor's seat in New Hampshire, where a popular Democratic incumbent chose not to run again. 
Pat McCrory, the longtime mayor of Charlotte, N.C., defeated the Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Walter H. Dalton. Mr. Dalton's name was linked, apparently not to his benefit with some voters, with Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat who chose not to seek a second term as her popularity sank with economic troubles and an ethics investigation of former aides. Mr. McCrory, 56, is the first Republican elected governor of his state since 1988, and only the third Republican governor of North Carolina since 1901.
In Delaware, Gov. Jack Markell, 51, a Democrat and former business executive who previously served as state treasurer, easily won a second term in office, as did Gov. Peter Shumlin, 56, a Democrat in Vermont who partly made his name by working on helping students with learning disabilities succeed in college -- work inspired, he said, by his early struggle with dyslexia.
In New Hampshire, a former state senator, Maggie Hassan, 54, defeated a Republican lawyer, Ovide Lamontagne, to replace John Lynch, the retiring Democratic governor. Mr. Lynch endorsed Ms. Hassan, but her New Hampshire roots were also unquestioned, as a longtime legislator in her own right whose husband, Thomas E. Hassan, is the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy.
Democrats had a lot more to defend this year than Republicans, with 8 of the 11 governors' offices on the ballot in Democratic control before the election. That raised Republicans' hopes, and fund-raising totals.
And Republicans, as expected, did win in some heavily red states. Gov. Jack Dalrymple, 64, of North Dakota, and Gov. Gary R. Herbert, 65, of Utah, both of whom got to office by stepping in after their states' governors resigned to take other jobs, won full terms on Tuesday. In Indiana, a Republican congressman, Mike Pence, 53, who describes himself on his Web site as ''a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,'' won the open seat being vacated by Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who was barred from running again by term limits.
But unlike 2010, when Republicans picked up six governorships in the midterm elections, to give the party 29 governors, to 20 Democrats and 1 independent, there was also much less of a national trend. State-by-state concerns, especially over the economy, dominated the airwaves and the debates.
In West Virginia, where Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, 60, a Democrat, was re-elected Tuesday -- in a state that went Republican for president -- Mr. Tomblin distanced himself from any association with the national Democratic Party, and from President Obama in particular.
Gov. Jay Nixon, 56, a Democrat of Missouri, also won re-election on Tuesday with a message that moderate politics and economic growth went together, defeating Dave Spence, a Republican businessman who spent heavily to support his campaign.
But officials at the Republican Governors Association said that even with only one certain gained seat, in North Carolina, the Republican brand was still getting through the night with its head held high and at least 30 Republican governors to show for it.
''There's no doubt that the Republican Party's strength comes from the states,'' said the group's chairman, Robert F. McDonnell, in a statement.
Colm O'Comartun, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, said in a telephone interview earlier on Tuesday, when polls were still open, that 2012 was about playing hard defense. ''Our pick-up opportunities were so difficult,'' he said.
No party has controlled more than 30 governor's offices at one time since the late 1990s, when the Republicans had 32, according to the National Governors Association. But the Republicans -- despite seesaws on the state level over the decades -- have not controlled more than 32 seats since the early 1920s.
In North Carolina, Mr. McCrory won largely on the support of a majority of men and a majority of women, as well as strong support among voters over 30, conservatives, Republicans and independents, and white evangelicals, according to preliminary results of an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Those making $50,000 or more also voted for him in large numbers.
Mr. Dalton, the Democrat, drew support from young voters, ages 18 to 29, black voters and liberals. Moderates were divided between the two candidates.
Democrats had hoped to hold the seat, and the Democratic Governors Association spent more than $3 million in support of Mr. Dalton, mostly earlier in the campaign season.

HEADLINE: Now, a Chance to Catch Up to His Epochal Vision

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
From the first time Barack Obama summoned the country's leading presidential historians to dinner, they saw that the type of discussion he wanted would be different from their talks with previous Oval Office occupants.
There was almost no small talk, for this was no idle exercise. Though Mr. Obama knew many of his predecessors' stories cold, he was no history buff: he showed little curiosity about their personalities and almost no interest in the founding fathers. His goal, the historians realized, was more strategic. He wanted to apply the lessons of past presidential triumphs and failures to his own urgent project of setting the country on a new path.
At three private annual gatherings during his first years in office, he asked pointed questions: How did Ronald Reagan engineer his 1984 re-election despite a poor economy? Where did the Tea Party fit in the tradition of American protest movements? Theodore Roosevelt bypassed Congress to launch progressive programs; could Mr. Obama do the same? 
The president was coolly eyeing American history in order to carve his own grand place in it, the guests said in interviews later. ''It was almost as if he was writing his own history book about himself,'' said David M. Kennedy, a professor at Stanford University. Becoming the 44th president of the United States, or even the first African-American to hold the post, had never been enough for Barack Obama. Just two years after arriving in the Senate, he spoke unabashedly of becoming one of the greatest presidents, a transformative figure like Abraham Lincoln or Franklin D. Roosevelt who would heal the country's divisions, address its most critical problems and turn Americans in a hopeful new direction.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama successfully wrote his next chapter, joining the club of presidents who have secured second terms. Yet the man who once envisioned himself in the pantheon of transcendent presidents enters his next term as a far more conventional, partisan leader than he intended to be. He defeated a mistake-prone challenger of unsteady popularity within his own party in an election in which he never quite explained how he would deliver on his unmet promises.
Now Mr. Obama, a specialist in long shots, faces what may be the climactic challenge of his political career: a second chance to deliver the renewal he still promises, but without a clear mandate, a healthy economy or willing Republican partners.
''He has only one thing to run for: a place in history,'' Robert Caro, another guest, said in an interview.
In their dinners together, which form a mini-history of the Obama presidency, the scholars could see the urgency and seriousness that he brought to his role, as well as his frustration that others did not see him and his priorities as he did. He seemed like a leader whose internal clock never quite matched that of the political system, who preferred to think in terms of the sweep of years rather than of the tick of hours or days.
Mr. Obama expressed impatience with his ''inability to get people to think long term,'' said H. W. Brands of the University of Texas at Austin. ''It's hard to make a case for solutions to problems where you're not going to feel either the problem or the solution,'' he recalled Mr. Obama saying.
That was why the president seemed to relish those dinners, the historians surmised: they were an antidote to the cable television news shows and moment to moment political wrangling he disparaged. Each time, he would go around the table, asking the largely left-tilting group how he was doing and what he could learn from the men they had studied, according to interviews with eight biographers who attended.
Not all of Mr. Obama's political advisers saw the point: William M. Daley, the former White House chief of staff, spent one session looking impatient. But the conversations seemed to be an escape for Mr. Obama, ''a way of yanking him back to the point of view he prefers,'' said Michael Beschloss, another historian who attended.
At the first dinner, in 2009, he exuded optimism, repeating his desire for a presidency that would transform the nation, and asked for a tutorial on timing a first-year agenda -- almost, some of the historians thought, as if learning more about the past could compensate for his Washington inexperience. Robert Dallek, one of the guests, asked for Mr. Obama's signature for his grandchildren, and Mr. Obama complied, adding a hopeful flourish: ''Dream big dreams!'' he instructed.
But as early as that first summer, Mr. Obama admitted he was having trouble communicating his vision to the country -- a problem that would become a running theme of the meetings. As they discussed how previous presidents had rallied public support, Mr. Obama would sometimes nod to the White House speechwriters he had invited as if to reinforce the points. Adam Frankel, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama, recalled that sometimes when planning an address, he would tell them to just give Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian personally closest to Mr. Obama, a call for help.
A year later, when Mr. Obama invited the scholars back to the White House, his mood had darkened. He was struggling to understand the Tea Party and a level of opposition he said was ''not normal'' by historical standards. Several of the scholars told him that the Tea Party members were like the 19th century Populists, less motivated by economic self-interest than by nativism and a fear of modernity. ''It's the politics of resentment,'' Mr. Dallek said. The president seemed to agree, Mr. Dallek recalled later, replying, ''There's something subterranean about what these folks are saying.''
As Mr. Obama's popularity fell, the dinners took on a mutually beneficial undertone: the president, who has told others that history would vindicate him, was trying to mold what biographies would eventually say, and the historians who aspired to chronicle his story were getting rare firsthand access.
But they had become counselors as well as observers. By the July 2011 dinner, as he was grappling with negotiations over the debt ceiling crisis and privately planning to attack Republicans as soon as it was over, the historians were suggesting a new role model. ''We pushed Teddy Roosevelt like crazy on him,'' said Douglas Brinkley of Rice University.
Ms. Goodwin was working on a new book about Roosevelt, and she beguiled the president with anecdotes and present-day analogies. Like Mr. Obama, Roosevelt was a Nobel Prize winner who often expressed disdain for legislators, praised universal health care and rammed a progressive agenda past a hostile Congress. Within a few months, Ms. Goodwin was helping the president's speechwriters draft an address, delivered last December and billed as the intellectual foundation for his second term, that was also a start-to-finish tribute to Roosevelt.
The historians have not seen Mr. Obama as a group since that final dinner; they figured he was too busy with his re-election campaign. When they discuss his presidency now, they credit him with winding down two wars and passing health care legislation, among other measures. Still, most of their reviews say that he did not come close to fulfilling his original aspirations: ''nothing to be ashamed of,'' ''couldn't put principles into practice,'' ''not transformative with a capital T.''
Even Ms. Goodwin, openly allied with Mr. Obama, worried that he had been so eager for lasting accomplishments that he had not forged a strong enough day-to-day connection with the nation. ''Public opinion is shaped by those cycles, and if you let it go, you may lose the shaping of the opinion,'' she said.
If the historians dine with the president again, several said, the topic will be obvious: how Mr. Obama could narrow the gap between his ambitions and his record, especially given the routinely cursed nature of second terms. ''Everyone wants to get re-elected, but almost no second term turns out well,'' Mr. Brands said.
If the president ever asked that question, it would be hard to know how to answer him, the historians said. There are no obvious lessons on how Mr. Obama can rally public or Congressional support. The Theodore Roosevelt analogy doesn't go very far, Edmund Morris said, because unlike Mr. Obama, Roosevelt won a massive popular victory that gave him a clear mandate.
If Mr. Caro could offer the president one piece of advice now, he said, he would tell him to stop looking backward and find his own road. What worked in a different time is unlikely to aid Mr. Obama now, he said, but ''there's always a way to fight for something.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Stand Firm In Controlling the House

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Deep disapproval of Congress and dissatisfaction with partisan division appeared no match for Congressional incumbency on Tuesday, as Republicans seemed to have retained a firm hold on the House of Representatives, assuring the continuation of divided government for at least another two years.
Democrats began the year with deep pockets and a plan to focus on scores of Republican freshmen, particularly those with a Tea Party imprimatur, in an effort to retake the House after losing it in 2010. But in the first Congressional election since decennial redistricting, Republicans -- thanks to their control of many state legislatures -- managed to shore up many incumbents by fashioning districts that Democrats had little chance of capturing. 
Retirements by a large number of Democratic members, and a message on Medicare that more or less fizzled, were additional impediments. Blue Dog Democrats, a group of moderates whose numbers have been dwindling, were particularly endangered as they struggled to defend districts they had long held.
In the end, the bravado of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, who earlier this year suggested that fights over Medicare and other issues would help deliver the House back to her party, was misplaced.
Republicans placed their greatest hopes on North Carolina, where their redistricting efforts targeted vulnerable Democrats more than just about anywhere else. In a seat left open by the retirement of one prominent Blue Dog, Representative Brad Miller, a former federal prosecutor, George Holding, easily defeated his Democratic opponent, Charles Malone. Another Democratic incumbent, Representative Larry Kissell, long used to fending off Republicans, lost to Richard Hudson, a former Republican staffer.
In Kentucky, Republicans got their wish and finally tossed Representative Ben Chandler, one of the last remaining Blue Dogs, from his seat. Andy Barr, who lost to Mr. Chandler by 647 votes in 2010, finally took out the incumbent, who had served since 2004.
There were some bright spots for Democrats. Alan Grayson, who lost his Florida seat in 2010 to Representative Daniel Webster, got a return ticket to Washington when he defeated the Republican Todd Long in the new Ninth District. Lois Frankel, another Democrat, prevailed in an open seat in that state, and the Democrat Joe Garcia beat Representative David Rivera, who was under federal investigation.
Illinois, where Democrats focused much of their effort, was a strong point for the party. Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost her legs in the Iraq war, easily defeated Representative Joe Walsh, a freshman and Tea Party favorite, and will become the first combat-injured woman to serve in Congress. Representative Bobby Schilling, a pizza parlor owner with no previous elected experience, joined a sea of one-termers when he was defeated by Cheri Bustos, and a long-serving Republican, Judy Biggert, fell to Bill Foster.
In New Hampshire, Ann Kuster defeated Representative Charles Bass, and in Georgia, where Republicans thought they would pick off the last white Democrat in the deep South, Representative John Barrow prevailed.
But Republicans began to count their wins Tuesday night as well. Representative Tom Latham of Iowa defeated Representative Leonard Boswell in a battle of incumbents, even though President Obama won the state. Also in Iowa, Representative Steve King handily beat back Christie Vilsack, the wife of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor. Republicans also picked up a seat in Pennsylvania,where Keith Rothfus picked off Mark Critz, a Democrat with a strong labor union following.
Democrats had a far better day over all in the Senate, maintaining their control there and ensuring that the two chambers would continue their contentious relationship through 2014.
Most immediately, with no undisputed mandate on either side of the aisle to manage fiscal policy, Congress will move to confront the so-called fiscal cliff, and simultaneous expiration of myriad tax provisions and drastic budget cuts.
It remains to be seen whether the tone and content of the bruising fight over the debt ceiling and other fiscal matters in the 112th Congress will continue into the next session, or if both parties will conclude that the only mandate lawmakers have is to finally work together and bridge the gap on those difficult issues.
''For two years, our majority in the House has been the primary line of defense for the American people against a government that spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much when left unchecked,'' House Speaker John A. Boehner said Tuesday. ''In the face of a staggering national debt that threatens our children's future, our majority passed a budget that begins to solve the problem.''
He added ''With this vote, the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising tax rates.''
Many Democrats started the cycle off in strong position, particularly after high-profile fights in Congress over issues like the payroll tax extension and student loan rates. But the environment changed significantly as time went on, with voters divided over the disparate policy prescriptions offered by the two parties on the economy, entitlements and taxes.
As the leaves began to change and the temperatures dropped, what once seemed like a Democratic surge evaporated. There appeared to be no single issue that Democrats could turn to their advantage, like the health care debate that so dominated the 2010 Congressional elections and propelled Republicans back into the majority. President Obama's coattails had little effect in many states he easily won.
The poor showing is likely to result in new questions about whether Ms. Pelosi will remain her party's leader in the House.

HEADLINE: On Fox News, a Mistrust Of Pro-Obama Numbers Lasts Late Into the Night

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Karl Rove was incredulous. His colleagues at the Fox News decision desk had called Ohio for President Obama, a move he insisted just a few minutes earlier would be premature.
''We've got to be careful about calling this when we have 991 votes separating the candidates,'' he scolded them. ''I'd be very cautious about intruding into this process.''
Silence settled over the set. 
''That's awkward,'' Megyn Kelly said, trying to break the tension. She and the co-anchor Bret Baier then offered to broker something of a compromise. One of them would walk down the hall and interview the number crunchers on the decision desk about why they made their call.
And so ensued the most bizarre on-air encounter of election night: a network anchor interrogating Arnon Mishkin, a member of the Fox News decision team and a respected voting analyst, forcing him and a colleague to defend their news judgment against Mr. Rove, one of the most powerful Republican fund-raisers and strategists.
However odd, the exchange perfectly captured one of the persistent sources of strain between the media and Republicans throughout the presidential campaign. Ever skeptical of a media bias toward Democrats, conservatives complained repeatedly that polls this year were showing an erroneous and biased edge for Mr. Obama.
As Fox News's own polling showed an advantage for Mr. Obama late in the campaign, commentators on the network questioned whether the news organization had its numbers right. (As midnight approached on Tuesday, Mr. Rove, who helped lead one of the most powerful ''super PACs'' aiding Republicans this year, did appear to soften his objections somewhat.)
Some conservatives started trumpeting the efforts of polling aggregators like UnSkewedPolls.com, which purported to ''debunk the media bias and shatter the false illusion being created by the mainstream media.'' (The Web site employs a methodology that mainstream pollsters have said is not credible.)
By early Wednesday, UnSkewedPolls.com had posted no updates and still had a headline about ''Big Election Day Romney Turnout.''
For much of the campaign, the story emanating from conservative commentators was one of mistrust. It was not only the polls that were untrustworthy. Those Labor Department numbers that showed a rosier economic picture in the final weeks of the election? The books were cooked by pro-Obama stooges, conservatives charged.
Suspicion of the other side -- by conservatives and liberals alike -- was evident in media coverage as the minutes ticked away to Tuesday's poll closings across the country.
The one conclusion people across the political spectrum seemed to agree on -- even before there was a clear winner -- was that the other side had cheated, lied or intimidated its way to victory.
Speaking on MSNBC, the former Vermont governor and Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean declared that the ''only way'' Mr. Obama could lose in Ohio ''is if people are prevented from casting their ballots, either by voting machines that aren't functioning right or other forms of harassment.''
Web sites with large liberal followings like Mother Jones, Slate and The Huffington Post highlighted a video that claimed to show a ''Romney-loving'' voting machine in Pennsylvania that was converting Obama votes into votes for Mitt Romney.
But the cries were louder on the right.
Fox News Radio reported that a man in North Carolina claimed to observe a poll worker coaxing a woman to vote for Mr. Obama. And Fox News broadcast several segments about a mural of the president, complete with his campaign logo and the words ''hope'' and ''change,'' that greeted voters at a Philadelphia school, a possible violation of a law against campaign materials at polling sites.
After Republicans went to court and won an order to have the mural covered, the network reported that the covering was insufficient. It failed to obscure the campaign logo and slogan.
The Daily Caller led its Web site on Tuesday with a story about a photo from the James O'Keefe group Project Veritas that discovered a poster of Mr. Obama, Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks just a few feet from where voters were casting ballots in Newark.
There were other scattered reports online of possible targeting of Republicans: the Michigan Republican Party claiming that a poll watcher in Detroit was threatened with a gun; a woman in Florida initially denied entrance to a polling site because she was wearing a T-shirt with ''MIT'' on it.
Though some conservatives like Mr. Rove initially doubted the election's outcome, by around 10 p.m. many in the media had turned pessimistic about Mr. Romney's chances.
John Ellis, who worked on the Fox News decision desk in 2000, was one of them. ''Obama wins. Popular vote still unclear,'' he wrote on Twitter at 9:54 p.m.
Shortly after 10, Nicolle Wallace, a Republican analyst on ABC, talked of ''soul-searching'' ahead for the GOP; Alex Castellanos, on CNN, talked as if he assumed Mr. Romney was going to lose. ''This is going to be a repudiation of the Republican Party,'' he said.
At 11:12 p.m., NBC became the first network to call the election for Mr. Obama, only 12 minutes after all the networks were able to call it for him in 2008.

HEADLINE: Transcript of President Obama's Election Night Speech

 BODY:
The following is the full text of President Obama's victory speech on Wednesday (Transcript courtesy of the Federal News Service).
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. (Sustained cheers, applause.)
Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. (Cheers, applause.)
It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people. (Cheers, applause.)
Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. 
(Cheers, applause.) I want to thank every American who participated in this election. (Cheers, applause.) Whether you voted for the very first time -- (cheers) -- or waited in line for a very long time -- (cheers) -- by the way, we have to fix that. (Cheers, applause.) Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone -- (cheers, applause) -- whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference. (Cheers, applause.)
I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. (Cheers, applause.) We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. (Cheers, applause.) In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.
(Cheers, applause.)
I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden. (Cheers, applause.)
And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. (Cheers, applause.) Let me say this publicly. Michelle, I have never loved you more. (Cheers, applause.) I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first lady. (Cheers, applause.)
Sasha and Malia -- (cheers, applause) -- before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. (Cheers, applause.) And I am so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now, one dog's probably enough. (Laughter.)
To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics -- (cheers, applause) -- the best -- the best ever -- (cheers, applause) -- some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.
(Cheers, applause.) But all of you are family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. (Cheers, applause.) And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way -- (cheers, applause) -- to every hill, to every valley. (Cheers, applause.) You lifted me up the whole day, and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. (Cheers, applause.)
I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym or -- or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.
You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. (Cheers, applause.) You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. (Cheers, applause.)
You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home. (Cheers, applause.)
That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter -- (cheers, applause) -- the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.
But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.
We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers -- (cheers, applause) -- a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation -- (scattered cheers, applause) -- with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.
We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet. (Cheers, applause.)
We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this -- this world has ever known -- (cheers, applause) -- but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.
We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag -- (cheers, applause) -- to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner -- (cheers, applause) -- to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.
That's the -- (cheers, applause) -- that's the future we hope for.
(Cheers, applause.) That's the vision we share. That's where we need to go -- forward. (Cheers, applause.) That's where we need to go. (Cheers, applause.)
Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there. As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts. It's not always a straight line. It's not always a smooth path. By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock, resolve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.
But that common bond is where we must begin. Our economy is recovering. A decade of war is ending. (Cheers, applause.) A long campaign is now over. (Cheers, applause.) And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you. I have learned from you. And you've made me a better president. And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead. (Cheers, applause.)
Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. (Cheers, applause.) You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.
And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together -- reducing our deficit, reforming out tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil. We've got more work to do. (Cheers, applause.)
But that doesn't mean your work is done. The role of citizens in our democracy does not end with your vote. America's never been about what can be done for us; it's about what can be done by us together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self- government. (Cheers, applause.) That's the principle we were founded on.
This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong. Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores. What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth, the belief that our destiny is shared -- (cheers, applause) -- that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism. That's what makes America great. (Cheers, applause.)
I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America. I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job. I've seen it in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back. (Cheers, applause.) I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm. (Cheers, applause.)
And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8-year-old daughter whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care. (Cheers, applause.) I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father but meet this incredible daughter of his. And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes because we knew that little girl could be our own.
And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright. That's who we are. That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president. (Cheers, applause.)
And tonight, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future. (Cheers, applause.) I have never been more hopeful about America. And I ask you to sustain that hope.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We got your back, Mr. President!
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'm not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the road blocks that stand in our path. I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight. I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting. (Cheers, applause.)
America, I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunities and new security for the middle class. I believe we can keep the promise of our founding, the idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love (ph). It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight. (Cheers, applause.) You can make it here in America if you're willing to try.
(Cheers, applause.)
I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)
And together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you, America. (Cheers, applause.) God bless you. God bless these United States. (Cheers, applause.)

HEADLINE: Partisans in Florida Retreat to Their Corners To Wait Out a Cliffhanger

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Lizette Alvarez reported from Miami, and Campbell Robertson from Tampa, Fla.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- The two major parties did not agree on much in Florida this year -- not the state of the economy, the panacea for a broken health care system or the overall role of government. But they did agree on this: The race for president was bitter, it was hard-fought and, all too often, it was too personal.
At times, it also appeared harrowingly close here, no surprise in a state where elections have a way of clinging to cliffs by their finger tips. As the long, draining contest drew to a close Tuesday night, Republican and Democratic political die-hards streamed into ballrooms and bars around the state to watch the returns, by turns whooping and moaning as states big and small were called through the night. 
But the largest hollers, the kind that sent people into each other's arms and caused them to break out into a frenzied dance, ultimately belonged to the Democrats. The celebration erupted shortly after 11 p.m., even as Florida remained too close to call, when the giant screens announced the news: President Obama had defeated Mitt Romney and secured re-election.
At the Obama celebration headquarters at Finnegan's River, a bar that floats on the Miami River, within eyeshot of the city's multicolored skyline, Democratic loyalists shimmied and snapped open phones. They shouted with euphoria.
''Oh my God, oh my God," said Arthur Costa, a Cuban-American Obama supporter. "My heart is palpitating. I was always optimistic, always, but I was nervous. It's exactly like four years ago, and he didn't even need Florida."
That was a good thing because in Miami, where some lines were excruciatingly long, people were still voting even 30 minutes after Mr. Obama was projected as the winner. The national election was decided, but Florida was slogging on.
In Tampa, on the Gulf Coast, where Republican supporters of Mr. Romney gathered at the Hyatt Regency for their candidate's official state party, the mood had gradually dimmed through the night as the numbers piled up for Mr. Obama.
When Fox News called the race, the room fell quiet, even quieter than it had been for the previous half-hour. Lenny Curry, the chairman of the state Republican Party, approached the lectern at the front of the room. He told the few remaining guests that Florida and even Ohio was still too close to call -- even though Fox News, which was being shown on a giant screen behind him, had already called it for Mr. Obama.
"This is going to be a long night," Mr. Curry said. "Stick around as long as you like. And pray."
As the evening unfolded, the Democrats in Miami and the Republicans in Tampa knew there would be a loser but each side hoped it would be the other guy.
''Woo, woo, woo,'' cried Mirene Charles, a lawyer and Obama campaign volunteer who canvassed Little Haiti on Election Day. Michigan had just been called for the president and the crowd at Finnegan's kicked into high gear.
Then came New York and New Jersey in quick succession. She relaxed just a bit.
''It's got to happen,'' she said. ''I don't even want to think what's going to happen in this country if Romney wins. Obama has heart. Romney is a business man.''
Soon, a map of Florida filled the television screen, a peninsula still unclaimed by either side. As of midnight, it was still unclaimed. Once again, Florida was the problem child, only unlike 2000, the race did not depend on its results.
Kathy Fernandez Rundle, a Democrat and the state attorney for Miami-Dade County, who handily won re-election, stared at the screen with the crowd at Finnegan's.
''This has been one of the most intense and bitter election cycles in my history,'' she said. ''It was unnecessarily vulgar.''
Voters, she said, showed real grit.
''Despite these efforts to deter and discourage, the people were amazing,'' she added, a reference to the state's decision to reduce the number of early voting days. ''They were the real heroes.''
Earlier Tuesday, Romney supporters in the swing city of Tampa were also confident, even giddy. At one of the city's Romney offices, a spartan suite of call banks in a run-down strip mall, dozens of volubly enthusiastic volunteers made calls or headed out to knock on doors.
''Keep smiling and keep dialing,'' shouted Joe Byrd, the field director in charge of the office.
At the official party for the Romney campaign, guests gravitated toward large TV sets in the Hyatt ballroom to watch Fox News call races (MSNBC was playing, with the sound off, in one corner). A smattering of applause could be heard as some favorable result flashed across the screen.
But things turned sour. The ballroom started to empty.
Ronald Weaver, a lawyer who said he went to Harvard Law School with Mr. Romney, said the 47 percent video may have harmed his candidate.''That's been killing him,'' Mr. Weaver said.
Beneath the MSNBC screen, three men huddled around a cellphone watching results not only nationally but locally as well. Mr. Obama won Hillsborough County, home of Tampa, by more than six percentage points.
''It's not good, it's not good,'' one man said. He was wearing a Barry Goldwater button.

HEADLINE: New York Democrats Are Poised to Gain Two House Seats After Costly Races

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Democrats in New York appeared headed for a gain of two seats in the House of Representatives on Tuesday night, capping a brutally competitive season in which both parties and their allies spent tens of millions of dollars seeking control of Congressional districts across the state.
But Republicans managed to beat back other aggressive challenges they faced, preserving most of the gains that the party made in 2010, fueled by Tea Party activists and energy. 
The results in New York, a state that figured prominently in the national battle for control of Congress, echoed a weak showing of House Democrats around the country, who failed to capture enough seats to wrest control of Congress from the Republicans.
In one of the most hard-fought House races in the state, Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican from the Syracuse area, was defeated by Dan Maffei, a Democrat seeking to reclaim the seat he lost to her two years earlier.
In the suburbs north of New York City, another first-term Republican, Representative Nan Hayworth, also came up short. Shortly after midnight, Sean Patrick Maloney, a former aide to Gov. Eliot Spitzer and President Bill Clinton, declared victory over Ms. Hayworth in a race that was dominated by cutting personal attacks in the final weeks. His election makes Mr. Maloney the state's first openly gay member of Congress.
But Republicans scored a high-profile victory of their own in western New York, where Representative Kathy Hochul, a freshman Democrat, was defeated by Chris Collins, a former Erie County executive, just 17 months after she won the seat in a nationally watched special election.
Democrats had begun the election cycle hoping for much better results in New York, maintaining that the Republicans who won in 2010 were out of step with the moderate sensibilities of their constituents, and predicting that President Obama's popularity in the heavily Democratic state would help down-ballot Democrats.
But many of the Republican incumbents who had been singled out repositioned themselves, adopting more centrist positions while hammering Democrats for what they described as reckless federal spending in a struggling economy.
''I think Democrats assumed that the Tea Party moniker would be enough to sink Republicans,'' said Nathan Gonzales, a House analyst for the Rothenberg Political Report. ''But it just hasn't resonated the way they thought it would.''
In a measure of how critically important New York had become, both major parties and the outside groups supporting them spent $30.6 million since June on House races in the state. The bulk, or about $18 million, came from the Republican Party and groups supporting its candidates.
In the only competitive House race in New York City, Representative Michael G. Grimm, a freshman Republican who took office with strong Tea Party support, beat back a challenge from Mark Murphy, the son of a former congressman, despite a federal investigation into Mr. Grimm's fund-raising practices.
In the Albany area, Representative Christopher Gibson, another Republican who swept into office in 2010, defeated a little-known Democratic rival, Julian Schreibman, a former federal prosecutor, whose campaign managed to gain significant traction in the final stretch.
In neighboring New Jersey, in a district that includes Philadelphia suburbs, Jon Runyan, a first-term Republican and former Philadelphia Eagles star, rebuffed a challenge from Shelly Adler, the widow of the man Mr. Runyan defeated in 2010, John H. Adler.
A number of Democratic incumbents also managed to fend off strong challenges in races that attracted national money and attention.
On the East End of Long Island, Representative Timothy Bishop, an eight-term Democratic incumbent, defeated Randy Altschuler, a wealthy businessman who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into his second campaign to oust Mr. Bishop.
In the Rochester region, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a 25-year incumbent and leading Democrat in the state's Congressional delegation, withstood a vigorous challenge from Maggie A. Brooks, the popular Republican executive of Monroe County, despite a broken leg that sidelined her early on in the race.
In the northernmost region of upstate New York, Representative Bill Owens, a Democrat, defeated Matt Doheny, a portfolio manager at a financial consulting firm who tried but failed to defeat Mr. Owens in 2010.
In northwestern Connecticut, the Democratic candidate, Elizabeth Esty, defeated Andrew Roraback, a Republican, in a race seen as a tossup.

For President Obama, now comes a second chance. An electorate that considers the country to be on the wrong track nonetheless agreed to renew his contract in hopes that the next four years will be better than the last.
A weary but triumphant president took the stage in Chicago early Wednesday morning before a jubilant crowd, clearly relieved to have survived a challenge that threatened to end his storybook political career. While he was speaking of America, he could have been talking about himself when he told the audience: ''We have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back.''
Mr. Obama emerges from a scalding campaign and a four-year education in the realities of Washington a far different figure from the man sent to the White House in 2008. What faces him in this next stage of his journey are not overinflated expectations of partisan, racial and global healing, but granular negotiations over spending cuts and tax increases plus a looming showdown with Iran.
Few if any expect him to seriously change Washington anymore; most voters just seemed to want him to make it function. His remarkable personal story and trailblazing role are just a vague backdrop at this point to a campaign that often seemed to lack a singular, overriding mission beyond stopping his challenger from taking the country in another direction. 
More seasoned and scarred, less prone to grandiosity and perhaps even less idealistic, Mr. Obama returns for a second term with a Congress still at least partly controlled by an opposition party that will claim a mandate of its own. He will have to choose between conciliation and confrontation, or find a way to toggle back and forth between the two.
''Will he be more pugnacious and more willing to swing for the fences on domestic issues, judicial appointments and so forth?'' asked Christopher Edley Jr., a dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime Obama friend who has been disappointed at times. ''You can react to a narrow victory by trimming your sails, or you can decide 'What the hell, let's sail into the storm and make sure this has meant something.' ''
The champagne bottles from victory celebrations in Chicago will barely be emptied before Mr. Obama has to begin answering that question. The coming end-of-the-year fiscal cliff prompted by trillions of dollars of automatic tax increases and spending cuts could force Mr. Obama to define priorities that will shape the rest of his presidency before he even puts his hand on the Bible to take the oath a second time.
Mr. Obama has expressed hope that ''the fever may break'' after the election and that the parties come together, a theory encouraged by allies like Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''I've talked with colleagues in the Senate who for months have told me they're very anxious to get beyond the gridlock and craziness,'' Mr. Kerry said.
If that proves overly optimistic, allies said, then the president's re-election puts him in a stronger position than in the past. ''I actually think he's holding a lot of cards coming off a win,'' said John D. Podesta, who led Mr. Obama's transition team four years ago. ''He can't be overturned by veto, so he can create a certain set of demands on Republicans that they're going to have to deal with.''
But even as votes were coming in, Republicans were making clear that Mr. Obama will have to deal with them, too.
''If he wins, he wins -- but at the same time, voters will clearly vote for a Republican House,'' said Representative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican who shouted ''You lie!'' at Mr. Obama during a speech to Congress. ''The consequence of that is our voters really anticipate and count on us holding firm.''
It may have been inevitable that Mr. Obama could not live up to the heavy mantle of hope and change he assumed in 2008 as the first African-American to be elected president. Inheriting an economy in crisis, he pushed through a sweeping stimulus package, the health care law and Wall Street regulatory measures, and he headed off another depression. But he failed to change the culture of Washington or bring unemployment down to healthy levels.
By 2010, amid a Tea Party revolt over rising national debt and expanding government, his party lost the House. He spent the last two years trying to hang onto the White House and preserve his accomplishments.
Now the struggle for re-election will be replaced by a struggle for Mr. Obama's political soul. Liberals who swallowed their misgivings during the campaign said they would resume pressure on the president to fight for their ideas. Other Democrats, and some Republicans, will push him to be more open to the views of those who voted against him.
''He needs to do something dramatic to reset the atmosphere and in a dramatic way demonstrate that he is very serious about finding bipartisan solutions,'' said David Boren, a former senator who now serves as the president of the University of Oklahoma and as a co-chairman of the president's intelligence advisory board. Mr. Boren suggested that Mr. Obama appoint ''a unity cabinet'' bringing together Republicans and Democrats.
Ilya Sheyman, the campaign director of MoveOn.org, said Mr. Obama's base would be hungry for action, not accommodation. ''We see the president's re-election as a precondition for progress and not progress in itself,'' he said.
Likewise, Lorella Praeli, director of advocacy and policy for the United We Dream Network, a group advocating for young immigrants, said her members would push Mr. Obama to revamp the immigration system. ''We will hold the president accountable not only on his promise on legislative relief, but also what he can do administratively,'' she said.
Mr. Obama seemed to address this tension in the closing speeches of his campaign. ''I want to see more cooperation in Washington,'' he said in Mentor, Ohio. ''But if the price of peace in Washington'' means slashing student aid, reversing his health care program or cutting people from Medicaid, he added, ''that's not a price I'll pay.''
Still, Mr. Obama arguably did not help himself with a campaign strategy that left many issues unaddressed. While he and his aides indicated occasionally in interviews that he hoped to tackle the immigration system and climate change in a second term, he rarely mentioned them in his campaign speeches. As a result, it may be hard for him to claim a mandate on those issues.
''Nothing about the campaign has approved a mandate or an agenda,'' said Ed Rogers, a White House official under President Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush who is now a top lobbyist. ''I don't think the House will meet him where he wants to be met. I'm just pessimistic about our president having much authority or much juice. Nobody's going to be afraid of him.''
Mr. Obama is acutely aware that time for progress is limited in any second term, as he increasingly becomes a lame duck. ''The first 14 months are productive, the last 14 months are productive, and you sag in the middle,'' said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, Mr. Obama's first White House chief of staff.
Given that dynamic, Democrats said Mr. Obama must move quickly to establish command of the political process. ''If you don't put anything on the board, you die faster,'' said Patrick Griffin, who was President Bill Clinton's liaison to Congress and is now associate director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. ''If you have no credibility, if you can't establish some sort of victory here, you will be marginalized by your own party and the other side very quickly.''
All of that felt a thousand miles off on Tuesday night in Chicago. After all the debates and ads and rallies, it was a moment for Mr. Obama and his team to savor. There was a time even before he became president that Mr. Obama worried about his meteoric rise, telling aides he did not want to be ''like a comet streaking across the sky'' because ''comets eventually burn up.'' For now, the comet streaks on.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Lines Are Unnecessary

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Government intervention in the gasoline market made a hard situation worse, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
When it comes to making the last week unpleasant, Hurricane Sandy got some help from government officials.
As the water from the storm began to recede, people in the New York metropolitan area wanted to repair, rebuild and get back to normal, But one of the most visible obstacles has been 1970s-style lines for gasoline. Many customers waited in line for hours only to learn that fuel had run out. Gasoline was rationed in New Jersey, where license plate numbers determined which days drivers were permitted to purchase fuel.
Waiting in line is a waste of time. The people there were certainly not helping bring more gasoline to the region and could instead be helping rebuild or could be productive in other ways.
Economists on the right and on the left agree that market prices - prices that reflect both supply and demand location by location - are much better at allocating scarce resources in extreme situations like the storm's aftermath. But state and local government regulations, in the form of antigouging laws, effectively outlawed market pricing. 
Early on, Steve Bellone, the executive of Suffolk County on Long Island, warned suppliers that he would punish anyone charging prices that were too high. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey sent similar messages. In New York City, federal officials interfered with the market by giving gasoline away; those lines were so long and contentious that New Jersey decided not to use that strategy.
If officials had allowed the price system to work, it would have alleviated lines in a number of ways. As suppliers seek the maximum profit, temporary and extraordinary prices encourage them (and make it affordable for them) to go to extraordinary lengths to get the electricity and fuel needed to have gasoline available to customers where it is needed the most.
Were they permitted, high prices would also have encouraged customers to economize creatively on their usage and acquisition of gasoline. If it had cost $10 or $15 a gallon, some people on those lines might have been willing to delay vehicle usage, leaving more for people who were willing to pay that price or who had no other choice. 
Of course, many suppliers and customers take prudent steps because they want to be helpful during a time of emergency. But why not let the market bring forth more supply and more customer conservation by adding a financial reward?
Instead, officials resorted to begging customers to conserve - Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said, "Now is not the time to be using the car if you don't need to" - and spending law enforcement resources dealing with hoarding, gouging and other crimes that would not exist if the price system had been allowed to work.
Mistakes of economics will happen sometimes, but it is too bad that government officials in the New York area are making so many when residents can least tolerate them.

HEADLINE: Maine and Maryland Say 'We Do'

BYLINE: FRANK BRUNI


HIGHLIGHT: After dozens of defeats over the last decade, same-sex marriage finally wins at the ballot box, and not just once. That's huge, and due. 

 BODY:
Updated | 1:55 a.m. 
Updated | 2:31 a.m. 
SEATTLE - In the debate over whether two men or two women should be able to make the same kind of legally recognized commitment to each other that a man and a woman routinely (and often cavalierly) do, opponents have leaned with particular enthusiasm on one argument:
The American people just aren't ready for this. Progressives are getting way ahead of them, showing contempt for true democracy and trying to subvert it. Same-sex marriage has been enacted only where legislatures or judges swooped in to make it happen. When citizens themselves, in referendums, have had a voice, they have said no, no and no yet again, more than 30 times in all, even in feel-good, sybaritic California. They have resisted.
Well, not anymore. Not even close. For making history today, for providing what I think will long be remembered as a crucial turning point, Maine and Maryland deserve a round of applause and our heartfelt thanks. They were among four states with same-sex-marriage referendums this Election Day, and if official projections are correct, they just approved it at the ballot box, where it had never succeeded before. More than that, they guaranteed an entirely different conversation from now on. 
Opponents can no longer broadly and blankly say that the growing number of politicians who support gay marriage are outside the mainstream; that President Obama is outside the mainstream; that opinion polls charting a rapidly increasing favor for same-sex marriage are somehow not reflective of the mainstream.
Tuesday night was what history looks like: the passage, for the first time, of same-sex marriage by popular vote; the reelection of the president who became the first to support same-sex marriage; the first-ever election of an openly gay or lesbian person to the U.S. Senate. That last distinction belongs to Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin, a Democrat who defeated Tommy Thompson, the state's former governor and no political slouch.
The other two states with same-sex marriage on the ballot were Washington, where I watched the returns nationally and results weren't expected Tuesday night or even Wednesday morning, and Minnesota, where voters were deciding not whether to approve gay marriage but whether to ban it in their state constitution, as 30 other states have done. 
Naysayers will look at Maryland and Maine and claim that they're exceptional, far from the heartland. Don't listen too hard to this. Maryland may be a bluer-than-blue state, but it's also a state where African-Americans, who have been less supportive of same-sex marriage than whites, represent 30 percent of the population. So the same-sex referendum was far, far from a slam dunk there, and its success suggests that citizens elsewhere may be ready at last to endorse same-sex marriage-that other states are ripe. It may well be that a popular wave in this direction began on Tuesday night.
And while Maine may not be the most representative state in America or an incessantly ballyhooed bellwether like Ohio, it's also not some goofy, freaky, Bohemian tributary of the mainstream. It's largely rural. Has a Republican governor. And for the last 18 years, both of its two senators have been Republican.
Just three years ago, when Mainers previously weighed in on the question of same-sex marriage, the vote was 53 percent against and 47 percent for. The change owes much to proponents' organization-they ran a focused, determined, well-funded campaign, spending more than opponents and putting advertising up much earlier. But it also reflects changing attitudes among Americans as time passes.
So does Baldwin's election. I'm struck less by the milestone she represents, an inevitable one, than by the campaign that preceded it. Her sexual orientation never became a big issue, eclipsed by concerns about the economy and misgivings about the lucrative lobbying career that Thompson had forged by himself, exploiting former government connections. In an election year of close attention to issues of economic fairness and income disparity, Baldwin's sexual orientation was peripheral, and she steadfastly kept it that way, not inviting gay and lesbian advocacy groups to speak up loudly for her or link themselves too visibly to her bid. I liked all of that, because it tracked with who we gay and lesbian people really are. Our sexual orientation is a part of us, not the sum of us, and not always the focus of our social, legal or political concerns.
In the wake of what happened in Maine, Maryland and Wisconsin, there really is no turning back, and that's because with the exception of a band of religious extremists and theocrats who read their ancient texts selectively and apply them inconsistently, displaying nothing that I can recognize as the true Judeo-Christian spirit, most Americans are coming to realize that to claim acceptance of gays and lesbians as equals and then deny them state-recognized marriage is a contradictory, untenable position. What makes us different is that we form our romantic partnerships with people of the same gender. If those partnerships are deemed less worthy and honorable than heterosexual ones, then we're being deemed less worthy and honorable than heterosexuals. It's that simple, and it's the pained and accurate assessment I've heard, in different language and various forms, from gays, lesbians and our supporters in Maine last month and here in Washington over recent days.
"That says to me, 'I'm OK with you existing, but you are not equal to me, I do not consider you the same level of human being'," said Molly Fitzpatrick, 19, a college student in Spokane, Wash., who is lesbian and began to accept that fact when she was 15 and realized that the intense crushes she'd been having on other girls for weren't going away. "And when a government denies marriage, it says to me, 'You are not actually citizens. You do not get to participate in this country's traditions the way other people do'."
That's what's still being said by the federal government, despite Obama's position. Same-sex couples cannot file joint federal tax returns; are not treated the same way as straight couples when it comes to estate taxes; do not get the same consideration from immigration officials that heterosexual couples do; do not get the same survivor benefits if one of the two of them was a federal worker, with a federal pension.
And that remains the separate-and-unequal status of same-sex couples in more than four out of every five states. Maine and Maryland bring to eight the number of states, along with the District of Columbia, that permit same-sex marriage. Washington could-and, I think, will-bring the number only to nine. There's much progress still to be made.
But the trajectory is clear, and on Tuesday night, as marriage-equality advocates here in Washington absorbed the news from the East, cheers went up. I saw tears in people's eyes. And I recalled a visit I made early last month to an 80-year-old gay man in Maine who was stunned - just stunned - at the prospect of his fellow citizens affirming his identity at the polls. He'd lived through so many decades of lesser regard, of undignified treatment.
He compared a successful referendum for same-sex marriage to a man setting foot on the moon: something once unthinkable, something wondrous, something exhilarating, not a step but a leap.
We took a big leap on Tuesday night. It was wondrous and exhilarating indeed and-trust me-more of a beginning than an end.
 Update | 1:55 a.m. 
Overnight Tuesday, as more and more returns came in, the news got even better.
According to the Des Moines Register, Iowans voted not to oust David Wiggins, an Iowa Supreme Court justice who was part of a 7-to-0 unanimous ruling three years ago to make same-sex marriage legal in that state. The justices ruled at the time that barring gay and lesbian couples from marrying violated the equal-protection clause of the state's constitution.
Supreme Court justices in Iowa, who are appointed by the governor, come up every eight years for what were once pro forma retention votes, and the state's citizens can weigh in. The year following the 2009 marriage ruling, three of those justices, including the chief justice, came up for such a vote, and all of them were booted from the bench. Wiggins faced the same possible fate this Election Day, when he came up for his retention vote. And like his ousted colleagues, he was targeted by religious conservatives.
But what a difference just two more years make. With nearly all of the votes counted, it appeared that Wiggins would retain his seat on the court. That development underscored the theme of the night: this country is changing, and it is changing in the direction of treating gays and lesbians-and the people who recognize them as equals-with a full measure of dignity.
 2:31 a.m. | Updated 
Here at the Westin in downtown Seattle, where the people who campaigned so hard for the Washington referendum for same-sex marriage are watching national returns, there's a potent sense of optimism.
They don't see how the attitude shift reflected in the Maine and Maryland victories won't shape what happens here in Washington, too. They don't see how they fail to become the third state-from zero states to three, in one fell swoop!-to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote.
Washington doesn't have polling stations per se; residents by and large mail in their ballots, which can be postmarked on Election Day. That means there are too many still to be counted for a definitive call to be made right now on any but the most lopsided local contests.
So we're probably going to have to wait a bit on Washington.
Polls just before Election Day and ballots counted so far suggest the referendum has a very good chance of passing. And all I can say to that possibility is: wow. If Washington joins Maine and Maryland, the number of states permitting same-sex marriage will have climbed from six before Election Day to nine afterward. That's one hell of a jump, one hell of an indication that Americans have really come around to an understanding that marriage for gay and lesbian couples is the only just course and that anything less is unequal treatment. I feel so proud of this country, for all its flaws. It has such an enormous capacity for change, and such a profound inclination toward fairness.

HEADLINE: China Fights to Go Beyond Organs Harvested From Executed Prisoners

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: China is set to implement a new organ-donation system that officials say will ease the country's dependence on organs taken from executed prisoners. But few Chinese are willing to pledge to donate their organs. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - A senior official with the Chinese Ministry of Health says the country must end its dependence on organs taken from executed prisoners even as it struggles to establish "an ethical and sustainable organ donation system."
The official, Wang Haibo, said there is now a "consensus among China's transplant community that the new system will relinquish the reliance on organs from executed convicts." 
The national system, he said, in comments in a new World Health Organization bulletin, will start in the coming months as Chinese officials phase out "the old practice." 
The old practice hasn't been working, even with China leading the world by far in executions - as many as 4,000 a year, according to human rights groups. (The exact numbers are not disclosed by Beijing.) 
Executions can hardly keep pace with the demand for organs, of course. According to official statistics, China now has around one million patients needing a kidney transplant and another 300,000 awaiting livers. Fewer than 4,000 kidneys and 1,500 livers were transplanted last year.
Between 2003 and 2009, only 130 people in China signed up as organ donors, academic researchers found. As a result, two-thirds of all organs for transplant are still taken from executed prisoners. 
From the Beijing Review:
Chinese customs call for people to be buried or cremated with the body intact. One die-hard superstition has it that if an organ is taken from a body after death, the person in question will be reborn with a handicap in that organ in his or her next life.
An investigation in 2004 by the British newspaper The Independent found a flourishing underground trade in organ sales and transplants in China, especially for Japanese patients. There was an uproar on the mainland the following year when the renowned actor Fu Biao received two liver transplants within a matter of months. Nevertheless, he died of liver cancer in August 2005.
And in 2006, a reporter from the BBC went to a public hospital in the city of Tianjin, ostensibly to arrange a liver transplant for his ailing father. The reporter said hospital officials told him a suitable liver could be available in three weeks.
Official talk about a national organ-donation system began in earnest in 2007 when a law was passed to ban the private, black-market sales of organs that had created trafficking rings that duped young or impoverished patients into having operations. Living organ donations are now statutorily limited to spouses, blood relations and people with discernible emotional or family connections.
The law also made it illegal to provide prisoners' organs to foreigners, colloquially known as "organ tourists" or "transplant tourists."
"Nevertheless, the extreme shortage of transplant organs in the U.S. continues to make organ transplantation in China an appealing option for some patients with end-stage disease," said an article in the American Journal of Bioethics. The article, from February 2010, is called "Transplant Tourism in China: A Tale of Two Transplants."
A story earlier this year about organ scams in China said living donors were being paid an average of $4,000 for kidneys, which are then sold to recipients for nearly $32,000. Doctors from public hospitals, the article said, are involved in the trade.
A 17-year-old student from Anhui Province sold one of his kidneys last year for $3,500 through a middleman, then used the money to buy an iPad and an iPhone. (The middleman, in debt due to gambling losses, received $35,000 for finding the young donor online and organizing the surgery.) 
And in March, according to news reports in China, a court in Beijing prosecuted a kidney-trafficking ring that arranged the sale of 51 kidneys worth $1.6 million.
A pilot program under the direction of the Red Cross Society of China was announced in 2009, as my colleague Michael Wines reported, to create a donation system to "benefit patients regardless of social status and wealth," according to Huang Jiefu, the vice minister of health. 
"Transplants," he said at the time, "should not be a privilege for the rich."
The Red Cross said the pilot program - located in 16 regions - has yielded just 546 organs from 207 deceased donors. A further 15,379 people also registered as organ donors.
Mr. Wang, the director of the Ministry of Health's new donation system, said China would soon match the W.H.O. standard of conduct on organs and transplants.
"Although it took decades to establish a sophisticated national organ donation system in Western countries," he said, "I am optimistic that China can leapfrog to success in a relatively short period of time given the combination of governmental support and international experience."

HEADLINE: Obama's Win Closely Watched in India

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS, VIVEK NEMANA and VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Did Hindu god Hanuman play a role? 

 BODY:
The U.S. presidential election results were closely followed in India on Wednesday morning at breakfast parties across the country, in private homes and on television news channels, which ran nonstop coverage of the event.
On the lawn of the art deco Imperial hotel in New Delhi, hundreds of Americans, Indians and people with ties to both countries gathered for a breakfast sponsored by the U.S. Embassy, watching CNN on a big screen as a band in boater hats played Johnny Cash tunes with a polka beat.
Hurricane Sandy helped President Barack Obama, said Gaurang Kanth, a New Delhi attorney who was at the Imperial breakfast. "It was divine intervention," he said. "It was all about praying to the Indian god," he added with a laugh. Before the 2008 elections, a group of Indians gifted a statue of the Hindu god Hanuman to Mr. Obama, after Time magazine reported that he carried a tiny statue of a monkey as a good luck charm. 
English-language news channels in India ran continuous, uninterrupted coverage of the election Wednesday morning from U.S. channels, and brought in experts with experience in the United States to explain what was happening to viewers. "The right-wing Tea Party thing is just not working," G. Parthasarathy, a retired diplomat who was stationed in Washington, told CNN-IBN.
At the Hard Rock Cafe in Hyderabad, American expatriates tucked into a breakfast of bacon and eggs and watched the election results on CNN. When the network declared Mr. Obama's victory, there were cheers.
Though the Internet provided minute-by-minute coverage of the election, some expatriates said it was no replacement for experiencing the race in person.
"We streamed the debates at our apartment and I read Ezra Klein every morning, but I still felt a bit disconnected trying to stay abreast of the news," said Kelsey Coates, who lived in Washington before moving to Hyderabad for a fellowship in social enterprise. "I lived in D.C. You can't trade anything for the experience of being there."
Elvin John, an official at the U.S. Consulate in Hyderabad, which organized the breakfast, said the event was a chance for Americans in Hyderabad to share the election with each other. "If you're living abroad, you want to feel at home when you're dealing with such a huge event," he said. "That's why we picked an American venue."
Just over 40,000 Americans were registered as residents in India in 2009, the latest figures available. But the number of Americans with roots in India is much higher, and strong trade and diplomatic ties are considered integral to both countries.
In New Delhi, hundreds appeared at an early morning breakfast hosted by the American Community Support Association next to the American Embassy. As they tucked into dry scrambled eggs, greasy potatoes and tasteless pancakes, many participated in an electoral version of bingo, using colored pencils provided by the association to color in maps of the United States in red and blue as the state results were announced by TV news anchors.
As the morning wore on, many of the conservatives stopped playing and drifted away. But those rooting for President Obama gleefully held on until Mr. Obama was declared the winner, at which point they let out a lusty cheer.
Piyush Shah, a U.S. citizen, arrived at the breakfast around 6 a.m. with a laptop and a desperate hope that Mr. Obama would triumph. "I thought it would be exciting to be here and see this," said Mr. Shah, who owns a software company and now lives in New Delhi. "It feels good if you're American to be around a bunch of people when these things happen."
Karuna Luthra, a 26-year-old from Seattle, brought two American friends to the club to watch the returns, and each was diligently coloring a map. "It makes me feel connected to be here," Ms. Luthra said. 
Many of those present at the club were Indian-Americans who have moved back to India for work or family reasons. Among them was Sonal Sood, a 41-year-old from Rutherford, N.J., who was wearing workout clothes but had not managed to tear herself away from the TV long enough to hit the club's gym.
"So instead of working out, I've been eating nervously and watching the returns," she said with a giggle. "It was so close in the beginning, at least until they announced Iowa."
When CNN called the election for Mr. Obama, cheers rang out on the lawn of the Imperial hotel in New Delhi, and groups of businesspeople, students and embassy staff members waved American flags. The volume on the big screen was turned down and the band's amplifiers turned up. They lit into a celebratory rendition of "Tequila."
Then the U.S. ambassador to India, Nancy J. Powell, addressed the crowd. "Election Day in America, like India, is a very special day," she told the crowd. While the United States has the world's oldest democracy, India has the largest, she noted. The election process "makes me proud to be an American, and a small-d democrat," she said.
At the World Economic Forum's annual India conference outside New Delhi, many participants were following the U.S. election on their phones and tablet computers during a speech by the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper. The group seemed to generally be supporting Mr. Obama.
Sanjay Kapoor, managing director of Genesis Luxury, a fashion company based near New Delhi, said he found the election unexciting, particularly for Indians, because he felt Mr. Obama had done little to improve U.S.-India relations and because he did not think his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, would do much for bilateral relations either.
"I don't think bilateral trade or relations with the United States have really changed with him," Mr. Kapoor said about Mr. Obama on the sidelines of the conference. "I am really concerned about us, and I don't think he has done much." But he added that even if Mr. Romney had won, he would not have expected much of a change in U.S. policy toward India.
No matter who wins, "it is not going to make a substantial difference to India," agreed Ashok Swarup, a corporate lobbyist at the Imperial Hotel breakfast. "It is a relationship that has been growing, and no President wants to rock that boat."
 Gardiner Harris and Sruthi Gottipati contributed reporting from New Delhi.

HIGHLIGHT: This word has appeared in three New York Times articles in the past year. 

 BODY:
ellipsis \i-[#x2c8]lip-s[#x259]s, e-\ noun
 : omission or suppression of parts of words or sentences
The word ellipsis has appeared in three New York Times articles in the past year, including on Oct. 8 in the Opinion piece "Vote Lincoln in 2012" by Adam Goodheart and Peter Manseau: 
The Lincoln offered by the Romney campaign is, by contrast, a mascot for laissez-faire capitalism. In the aftermath of the "47 percent" controversy last month, Peter Wehner, an adviser to the Romney campaign, wrote a blog post for MittRomney.com enlisting Lincoln in an attack against the Obama administration's alleged record of "economic stagnation, increasing dependency, and the expansion of the Nanny State." According to Mr. Wehner, Lincoln would have had none of this. As evidence, he quoted a Lincoln speech given in 1860:
"I don't believe in law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally hire men to work for him! That is the true system."
Much was left unsaid in Mr. Wehner's selective quotation. In the speech, delivered in New Haven, Conn., several months before the start of his presidential bid, Lincoln was trying to draw connections between his antislavery opinions and his support of the American labor movement. Workers at Massachusetts shoe factories had gone on strike to protest wage cuts, and Lincoln - in a section of the speech unlikely to be quoted by his fellow Republicans today - declared, "I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers CAN strike when they want to." And the ellipsis in Mr. Wehner's version leaves out Lincoln's statement, shockingly radical for its time, that "a black man is entitled" to partake in the American dream.

HEADLINE: What They Said: The U.S. Election

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Political and business leaders from India weigh in on Obama's reelection. 

 BODY:
President Barack Hussein Obama's reelection in the United States was welcomed by the Indian government, but provoked mixed reactions from business leaders, who remain concerned about Mr. Obama's business outsourcing policies for India.
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: Welcomed President Obama's second term in office, offering his "warmest congratulations." He said Mr. Obama's victory gave him a mandate to continue pursuing global peace and progress.
"I have no doubt that there is much more we can do together to further strengthen the India-U.S. partnership and thereby advance peace and stability, expand mutual economic opportunities, harness the potential of science and technology, innovation and higher education and empower our people to address global challenges," the prime minister said in a congratulatory letter posted on Twitter by a government spokesman.
 Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India: A press statement posted on the ministry website said: "India and the U.S. have developed extensive bilateral cooperation and partnership based on shared values based on belief in democracy, the rule of law and pluralism. We look forward to continuing to deepen and widen the engagement between India and the U.S. in the years ahead."
 Adi Godrej, chairman of the Godrej Group: "This is a good development for India. Between two large economies there will be issues and concerns. Outsourcing is also a concern and I hope it will be addressed soon," he said, according to a PTI report cited by Hindustan Times.
 Pramod Bhasin, former chief executive of Genpact, one of India's largest business process outsourcing companies: "I think there will be greater implications as he focusses on issues like unemployment. I just hope he remains true to free trade and all the other things that he talks about so well," Mr. Bhasin said of President Obama, in a PTI report cited by Hindustan Times.
 R. V. Kanoria, president of the Federation of India Chambers of Commerce and Industry: "We hope that the new Obama Administration will take a long-term and practical view on issues such as outsourcing which ultimately are in the US national interest because they help US companies drive down costs paving the way for expansion," he said in a statement.
 Ambassador Neelam Deo, Director of Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations:"Indians will welcome the re-election of President Obama, steeped as we are in a political dialogue that privileges the common man, and our affection for democratic left-leaning politics. Continuity in US-India policies will also strengthen bilateral exchanges. Good relations with the US will also yield dividends in our interaction with other developed western countries," she said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Relief and Hope in Asia Over Obama Victory

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER and CHARLES ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Continuity with another four years of Barack Obama, rather than a jump into the relative unknown with his challenger, is what many people appeared to prefer. Still, there was also a sense of guarded anticipation on Wednesday, as analysts, commentators and the financial markets took stock of the daunting economic that the administration faces as well as the foreign policy issues that are closest to Asia's heart. 

 BODY:
 10:59 a.m. | Updated HONG KONG - Judging by a recent global opinion poll, much of the world outside the United States would have voted to re-elect President Obama if it could have. In the end, the rest of the world got what it wanted. And as concession and acceptance speeches were held, the first of the congratulatory telegrams went out to the winner.
 "I extend my congratulations to President Obama on his re-election to office. In winning this historic election, the President has a unique opportunity to realize his vision for the United States," the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
 "On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I offer warm congratulations to President Barack Obama on his re-election and wish him every success for his second term in office," said Julia Gillard, his Australian counterpart.
 Less restrained, Daniel Flitton, a senior correspondent at the Sydney Morning Herald, one of Australia's main daily newspapers,told readers to "breathe a sigh of relief."
 "Had Mitt Romney won the day, it would have made for an ugly time with our big alliance partner," he wrote. 
 Ananth Krishnan, China correspondent for the Indian newspaper The Hindu, had this early reaction to President Obama's victory speech:
What a speech. What a man. Wow. Sigh. After this, covering the Party Congress in Beijing is going to be such an anticlimax.
 Even the Internet multimillionaire Kim Dotcom, who is awaiting potential extradition from New Zealand to the United States on copyright charges, had this to say: 
Kim Dotcom [#x200f]Congratulations @BarackObama - May the next 4 years be better than the last 4 years.
 Earlier in the day, as the polling stations began closing in the United States - around about the time that tens of millions of people were heading to work across the Asia-Pacific region - the mood in the Hong Kong was also predominantly pro-Obama.
 "It was so special when he won the last time. There was a lot of hope and I think there still is," said a woman who was heading to work in Causeway Bay, a bustling neighborhood of Hong Kong that is dominated by shopping malls." I think he can do it."
 Continuity with another four years of Barack Obama, rather than a jump into the relative unknown with his challenger, is what many people appeared to prefer.
 "I just think it's not a good time for big change," said Harris Shim, 32, who works for a bank in this Asian financial hub. "People in Asia are affected by what's going on over there, and I don't think many people would know what the effect of a new president would be."
 "I'm all about keeping it simple, so I hope he wins," echoed Benjamin Sun, 46, who works for the car manufacturer Ferrari and spent many years living in the United States before moving to Hong Kong. "He is doing all right. It could be better, but if he has another four years he might be able to do better."
Students at Mr. Obama's former elementary school in an affluent neighborhood of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, cheered his win, as did Indonesian elites gathered at a party hosted by the U.S. Embassy. On the streets, motorcycle taxi drivers raised their fists and shouting, "Obama, Obama."
 Obama's popularity with the ordinary folks outside the United States comes as no surprise.
 As our colleague Mark McDonald wrote in this recent blog post, a global opinion poll conducted by the BBC World Service showed that if the rest of the world got to vote Obama would likely be re-elected in a landslide.
 Chinese respondents preferred Mr. Obama, 28 percent to 9 percent, as did South Koreans (58 to 9); Japanese (33 to 9); Indians (36 to 12); and Malaysians (28 to 13), the poll found. In Indonesia, where Mr. Obama spent four of his boyhood years, he was favored, 59 percent to 3 percent, over Mr. Romney.
 Still, there was also a sense of guarded anticipation on Wednesday, as analysts, commentators and the financial markets took stock of the daunting economic that the administration faces, as well as the foreign policy issues that are closest to Asia's heart.
 In Hong Kong, for example, the South China Morning Post highlighted the divisiveness of the campaign that led up to election day through a cartoon showing a top-hatted Uncle Sam being sawn in half, watched over by the two contenders. 
 In China, the state-run China Daily reported that that the outcome of the election would not affect the nature of U.S.-Chinese relations. While Mitt Romney raised the specter of China as a threat to US economic prosperity Obama would try to mend the country's relationship and "initiate greater diplomacy over a range of issues to find common ground," it quoted a Chinese economics professor at New York University as saying.
The China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, which monitors the media in China, said the U.S. election had drawn millions of comments on Sina Weibo, the Twitter-like microblogging service, and offered a taste of the comments.
 In Cambodia the hope was that Obama would push for free and fair elections in the country when he is scheduled to visit later this month. The heads of Cambodia National Rescue Party Sam Rainsy, who is exile, said it was time for more international involvement in Cambodia's troubles. "Now the whole world is paying attention to Cambodia, to demand true democracy," he told Voice of America Khmer.
 Meanwhile, the English-language version of Xinhua had a clear reminder that the U.S. elections were not the only thing that matters to the world in which China's importance has grown. 
 Xingua's site was dominated by a slide show of pictures from the U.S. vote. But the site's main news story on Wednesday morning was this:
"World looks to China as key congress nears."

HEADLINE: At Watch Parties, Congressional Leaders Take In Election Results

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL and JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: With the White House and the Senate up for grabs on election night, Congressional leaders from both parties staked out corners of Capitol Hill to take in the results. 

 BODY:
With the White House and the Senate up for grabs on election night, Congressional leaders from both parties staked out corners of Capitol Hill to take in the results.
At the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, near the White House, Republicans were met with disappointment when the results began to show that they would not win 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the Senate from Democrats as they had hoped.
Guests mingled to country music and ate sliders, falafel and chicken-on-a-stick while the results came in on a large screen tuned in to Fox News. But they began leaving as the Senate moved further out of reach. By the time cable news networks began calling the presidential election for President Obama, only a few hundred guests remained.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was expected to speak but did not. Earlier, Mr. Priebus had celebrated having "a party that's functional and operational again" and promised to reappear minutes later.
"All I can say is, Wow," said Collin Raye, a country singer, who performed after the presidential race was called.
The mood had shifted dramatically from earlier in the evening, when Republicans won the House. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, his leadership job presumably secure for the next Congress, practically galloped on stage to claim the victory. "Heeeeey, Republicans!" he bellowed.
Speaking under a billowing American flag, Mr. Boehner said that over the past two years, House Republicans had defended Americans against a government that spent, taxed and borrowed too much. Going forward, Mr. Boehner said Republicans were willing to work with whoever won the White House to address pressing issues like the "staggering" national debt, and to devise laws that support small businesses, create jobs and grow the economy, just as long as the solutions don't involve raising taxes.
"With this vote, the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising tax rates," he said.
He ended by saying that Republicans were "humbled" to keep their majority and made a promise to voters that "we will never let you down."
Nearby at the Liaison Capitol Hill, a hotel, Democrats gathered in a humbler setting - a conference room. Some people sat on the floor with their legs crossed and coats draped over their laps. Cheers rippled through the crowd as the party picked up Senate seats in Indiana, Massachusetts and Missouri - tightening its hold on the chamber - and again when the networks called the presidential race for President Obama. 
"People this is what happens when your No. 1 goal is to defeat the president and not work to get legislation passed," the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said minutes after the networks began projecting Mr. Obama's re-election. He could barely get through his speech without spontaneous eruptions from the crowd. 
Eyes and ears were on Representative Nancy Pelosi though, who did not mention her role as House minority leader after the party failed once again to clinch the 25 seats needed to control that chamber. But little could dampen the crowd's spirits: House or no House, they went on to chant "four more years."

HEADLINE: The Obama Realignment

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Conservatives must face reality: the president has put an end to the Reagan era. 

 BODY:
When you do it once, it's just a victory. When you do it twice, it's a realignment.
The coalition that Barack Obama put together to win the presidency handily in 2008 looked a lot like the emerging Democratic majority that optimistic liberals had been discerning on the political horizon since the 1990s. It was the late George McGovern's losing coalition from 1972 finally come of age: Young voters, the unmarried, African-Americans, Hispanics, the liberal professional class - and then more than enough of the party's old blue collar base to hold the Rust Belt for the Democrats.
But 2008 was also a unique political moment, when George W. Bush's immense unpopularity was compounded by a financial collapse, and when the possibility of electing the country's first black president fired the imagination of the nation (and the nation's press corps). So it was still possible to regard the Obama majority of '08 as more flukish than transformative - or at the very least, to see it as a fragile thing, easily shattered by poor choices and adverse developments.
There were plenty of both during the president's first term. The Obama White House underestimated the depth of the recession, it overreached politically on the health care bill and the failed push for cap and trade and it reaped a backlash at the polls in 2010. The Republican Party, left for dead after 2008, revived itself, and at many points across the 2012 campaign season Obama's majority coalition looked vulnerable. Its policy victories seemed to teeter on the edge.
And the Obama coalition was vulnerable. I believed that at the beginning of the campaign season; I believed it in mid-October, when I thought Mitt Romney might just pull the election out; and I believe it even now that the president has won a narrow (in the popular vote) but electorally decisive victory.
But the lesson of the election is that the Obama coalition was truly vulnerable only to a Republican Party that took Obama seriously as an opponent - that understood how his majority had been built, why voters had joined it and why the conservative majority of the Reagan and Bush eras had unraveled.
Such understanding eluded the Republicans this year. In part, that failure can be blamed on their standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, who mostly ran as a kind of vanilla Republican instead of showing the imagination necessary to reinvent his party for a new era. Romney's final month of campaigning was nearly flawless, though. His debate performances were the best by any Republican since Reagan and he will go down in history as one of the few losing challengers to claim a late lead in the polls. A weak nominee in many ways, he was ultimately defeated less by his own limitations as a leader, and more by the fact that his party didn't particularly want to be reinvented, preferring to believe that the rhetoric and positioning of 1980 and 1984 could win again in the America of 2012.
You could see this belief at work in the confidence with which many conservatives insisted that the Obama presidency was not only embattled but self-evidently disastrous, in the way so many voices on the right sought to raise the ideological stakes at every opportunity, in the widespread conviction that the starker conservatives made the choice between left and right, the more votes they would win.
You could also see this conviction shaping the punditry and predictions that issued from conservatives in the days leading up this election. It was remarkable how many analysts not normally known for their boosterism (I'm thinking of Michael Barone and George Will in particular) were willing to predict that Romney would not only win but win sweepingly, capturing states that haven't gone Republican since Reagan. But even less starry-eyed conservatives - like, well, myself - were willing to embrace models of the electorate that overstated the Republican base of support and downplayed the Democrats' mounting demographic advantage.
Those models were wrong about 2012, and they aren't likely to be right about 2016 or 2020. Republicans can console themselves that they came close in the popular vote. They can look ahead to a favorable Senate map in 2014 and they do still have their House majority to fall back on.
But Tuesday's result ratifies much of the leftward shift in public policy that President Obama achieved during his first term. It paves the way for the White House to raise at least some of the tax revenue required to pay for a more activist government and it means that the Republicans let a golden chance to claim a governing coalition of their own slip away.
In this sense, just as Reagan Republicanism dominated the 1980s even though the Democrats controlled the House, our own era now clearly belongs to the Obama Democrats even though John Boehner is still speaker of the House.
That era will not last forever; it may not even last more than another four years. The current Democratic majority has its share of internal contradictions, and as it expands demographically it will become vulnerable to attack on many fronts. Parties are more adaptable than they seem in their moments of defeat, and there will come a day when a Republican presidential candidate will succeed where Mitt Romney just failed.
But getting there requires that conservatives face reality: The age of Reagan is officially over, and the Obama majority is the only majority we have.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Wakes Up to a 2nd Obama Term

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Barack Obama's victory on Tuesday was a complicated moment for the financial industry. | Elizabeth Warren, elected senator from Massachusetts, will be a new wildcard in Washington. | Mitt Romney can always return to a career in high finance, the Deal Professor writes. | BNP Paribas said its profit doubled in the third quarter. 

 BODY:
WALL STREET WAKES UP TO A 2ND OBAMA TERM | Barack Obama won a second term as president after a tension-packed election night on Tuesday. For the financial industry, it was a complicated moment. Wall Street employees had rallied behind Mitt Romney, a former private equity executive, and many were no doubt disappointed with the results.
And yet, Mr. Obama's second term "might not be a doomsday situation" for Wall Street, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write in DealBook. "In many ways, the industry has already adjusted to the new regulatory environment, and the administration might rein in its fervor for change." Democrats kept control of the Senate on Tuesday, cementing a layer of protection around the Dodd-Frank law. At least Wall Street knows roughly what to expect.
Still, there is a new wild card in Washington. Elizabeth Warren was elected senator from Massachusetts, defeating the incumbent Scott P. Brown. Ms. Warren, the Harvard professor behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is a well-known Wall Street opponent who is likely to support stricter controls on the industry (with rhetoric to make the president's "fat cat bankers" comment seem tame).
 Don't shed too many tears for Mr. Romney - he can always return to a career in high finance, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. If he wants it, Mr. Romney could probably land a high-paying job as a senior adviser (or just a professional schmoozer), following similar moves by Tony Blair, Dan Quayle, Al Gore and even Bill Clinton. At the very least, Mr. Romney, who turned down a potentially lucrative offer from Julian Robertson four years ago, may find it hard to "pass up the occasional $100,000 speaking engagement," Mr. Davidoff says.
While the president spoke of "building consensus" in his victory speech, others fear that paralyzing bickering may return. Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, proposed a solution in a blog post on Tuesday: he asked the winners to "withdraw from your respective parties and govern as independents in name and in spirit." Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's chief executive, sounded a skeptical note, writing in a blog post for The Financial Times that while investors might "continue to hope for political Sputnik moments," they were likely to be faced with the familiar set of broad economic concerns.
In the wake of the election results, stock index futures were slightly higher on Wednesday morning, suggesting a solid start to trading, according to Reuters. While a few hedge fund parties were spoiled last night, others in the industry were pleased. "I'm delighted that President Obama has won," said George Soros, a powerful Democratic donor. "Hopefully the Republicans in office will make better partners in the coming years, most urgently in avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff."
ON THE AGENDA | As the recovery continues from last week's storm, Jefferies plans to donate Wednesday's trading commissions to the relief effort. Kraft Foods, Macy's and Time Warner report earnings before the market opens. CBS and Qualcomm announce results Wednesday evening. Wilbur Ross is on CNBC at
7:15 a.m, and Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz is on CNBC at 3:10 p.m. A Claude Monet painting that was owned by the family of Herb Allen is scheduled for auction at Christie's on Wednesday evening.
BNP PARIBAS PROFIT DOUBLES | The French bank BNP Paribas said its net profit rose to 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the third quarter from 541 million euros in the period a year earlier. The bank, which has been reducing its exposure to euro zone countries, said it had reached its capital adequacy targets ahead of schedule. A strong performance in its investment banking unit bolstered income, the bank said, cautioning that last year's lackluster results made the picture this quarter look rosier, David Jolly reports in DealBook.

HEADLINE: A Change in the Weather on Wall Street

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The sense of urgency about dealing with global warming depends on where natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy strike. We should make the most of it this time. 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago I was talking to a friend who works at an environmental organization. We were discussing the absence of any talk about climate change in the presidential campaign, and joked that the United States would decide to get serious only when Wall Street found itself under water.
That turned out to be a very bad joke. There were moments last week when I grumbled that I was paying for it: like everyone else on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, my family and I spent four days with no electricity or water. But others were burying their dead. For us, Sandy was an inconvenience. For many people, it was a catastrophe.
A catastrophe, however, shouldn't be wasted. Climate change has a political problem: the countries most affected by it are not the ones in a position to do anything. The Maldive Islands are being swallowed by the Indian Ocean. Corn farmers in Kenya are seeing their crops withered by unprecedented drought. The death toll from Sandy so far in the United States stands at more than 100, but in Haiti it destroyed 70 percent of the country's crops. Between drought, tropical storm Isaac and Sandy, 90 percent of Haiti's crops have been destroyed by natural disasters this year.
The Maldives, Kenya and Haiti can do nothing to halt climate change. The United States can, but has seen no reason to - until, perhaps, last week. I don't have any fixes for climate change. We've just suffered, however, through a storm that might be a fix for the lack of political will to do something about it.

Hurricane Sandy's effect on the politics of climate change was immediate. Just three days after Sandy hit Mayor Michael Bloomberg decided to make it the focus of his endorsement of President Obama. "Our climate is changing," the mayor wrote, "and while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be - given this week's devastation - should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action." All of a sudden, climate change was the phrase of the day: New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Senator Charles Schumer and former President Bill Clinton were all talking about it.
Even though they are Democrats, it was startling to hear them discuss the subject. In March, 2009, the White House invited leaders of environmental organizations to a meeting. The invitees thought they were going to hear about the president's strategy on climate change, in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December. And they did - aides to the administration's environmental adviser Carol Browner, its green jobs adviser Van Jones and Nancy Sutley, the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, gave out a one-page memo. The key point: don't talk about climate change. Don't even use the phrase. The president was trying to pass an economic recovery bill that included $90 billion in green projects - the groups should talk about clean energy jobs instead.
Betsy Taylor, a political strategist on climate change, recalled that the only person who stood up was the author and environmental activist Bill McKibben. "This is going to come back and haunt us," he said.
"It became a mantra inside big environmental groups," said Taylor. "Talking about climate change is toxic. Some still don't use the 'C' word. The White House's intentions were good but the impact was dreadful. It set us back in a huge way."
The effect went beyond the United States. As long as the world's carbon giant was pretending climate change didn't exist, other countries had the perfect excuse for inaction. The conference in December 2009 produced a weak, nonbinding agreement.
Judging by the campaign, politicians, as well, still assume that the "C" word is toxic. Public belief in climate change and support for action did dip for several years, beginning in late 2008. In part, that fluctuation occurred because of people's experience of the weather - winters were cold. And the recession made it an unreceptive time for proposals such as a carbon tax that would probably increase the price of energy and cut jobs - at least in the short term.
But American views on the subject have also been manipulated by a campaign by energy producers - mainly the Koch brothers (who back the Tea Party) and the American Petroleum Institute - to paint climate change as an invention of anti-growth liberal tree-huggers.
Their operation has been tremendously effective at influencing news coverage of climate change - and through that, belief in the reality of climate change and support for action. The chorus of scorn from Republican primary candidates probably contributed as well. Taken together, the right wing has completely controlled the framing of the climate change debate.
But even the Koch brothers are no match for Mother Nature. This year, the extreme weather began to change American views again - even before Hurricane Sandy. Numerous surveys - here's one from George Mason and Yale universities- show that Americans now overwhelmingly believe climate change is real and caused by humans, and that it threatens people in the United States. Another survey by the same organizations found that a political position in favor of climate action wins votes among Democratic and Independent voters, and does little harm with Republican voters.
Taylor commissioned a national survey about climate change, and from that wrote a strategy paperfor advocates of action:

        
Talk about American patriotism. Americans don't shrink from a fight. Don't underestimate Americans and what we can do.
        
Talk about the world we are leaving our children.
        
Talk about the role of oil money.
Taylor says Hurricane Sandy has now added new arguments. One is that climate change is not just a threat for people elsewhere, in the future. It's here and now. Hurricane Katrina affected a part of the country that was largely poor, black and far from the centers of power. Not Sandy. "To have Hurricane Sandy hit where many powerful people live You're going to have lots of Republicans and Democrats sitting without water and light saying we can't ignore this," she said. "It's a tremendous new opportunity for us to break the stranglehold on Washington."
The other new argument is economic. Until this year, the political calculus about climate change had only one side. The oil and coal companies made sure everyone knew about the costs of action. But few people mentioned the costs of inaction. Now they cannot be ignored.
Every year, ISO Property Claim Services, which does research and risk consulting for property and casualty insurers, measures insured losses in the United States due to natural catastrophes. Last year the figure was $32 billion. This year Sandy alone may cost $50 billion - not to mention damage caused by record heat, record drought and record wildfires. And "insured losses" covers property and casualty insurance only. It doesn't include crop insurance - this year about a $20 billion to $25 billion loss, and taxpayers will cover all but $5 billion of that. It doesn't include payouts by the national flood insurance program - at least $1 billion this year even before Hurricane Sandy.
And of course, it doesn't include the expense of replacing destroyed tunnels, bridges, subways and coastal defenses. Nor the costs of cleanup, business interruption (the largest loss component of 9/11), or higher prices - drought is a big reason we are paying more for food and cotton clothing. Nor the soaring price of insurance. Areport by Ceres, an organization started after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to promote sustainable investment and business practices, details the dire threat climate change poses to the insurance industry. The threat persists even though insurers have been pulling out of the highest-risk markets entirely. In those places, states have become the insurer of last resort - and some of the payouts will come from taxpayers.
There is, of course, no simple mathematical trade-off between the cost of action and the cost of inaction: a dollar spent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions does not save us a dollar in disaster averted. Natural disasters have been around a lot longer than man-made carbon emissions, and the destruction from extreme weather we are seeing today is due only in part to climate change. (How large a part? Depends on whom you ask.) It might be too late - we could spend hundreds of billions on cutting carbon emissions and end up getting nothing for it in terms of reducing climate change. Or the reverse - we could invest now in setting the United States on a greener path, and reap the benefits for generations.
What Hurricane Sandy has made plain is that there is a balance. We're already paying for climate change, and that tax is only going to rise. Advocates for action can make the same argument as those who mock climate change: to do nothing is to be anti-jobs, anti-growth, anti-American values. "We are starting to see some acknowledgement that the numbers are enormous, but not nearly as much as we should," said Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres. "This is a fundamental economic issue. There aren't a lot of things that have shut down the stock exchange."

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Obama's Re-Election

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
 From the editorial page 
President Obama's re-election victory was not a sign that a fractured nation had finally come together. But it was a strong endorsement of economic policies that stress job growth, health care reform, tax increases and balanced deficit reduction.
No one should expect a postelection letup in the courtroom fights over state efforts to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortions.
One of the big lessons of Hurricane Sandy is that New York's hospitals are not as well prepared as they need to be.
Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai is again conjuring up scapegoats and diverting attention from what really matters.

HEADLINE: Hyundai's Fuel Economy Admission Leaves Some Car Owners Cold

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Some owners of Hyundai Motor Group cars were not surprised when the company admitted it had overstated the fuel economy of 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States. 

 BODY:
Last Friday, following an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hyundai Motor Group admitted it had overstated the fuel economy of 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States over the last two years. But for many Hyundai and Kia owners, the company was merely stating the obvious.
There had been grumbling in online forums, like Edmunds.com and others, that Hyundai was playing games with the E.P.A. testing cycle.
One reads: "Bought 2012 Elantra based on 33 m.p.g. average. After 1,000 miles I do not get 23 m.p.g. Have reported this problem to Hyundai and heard all excuses!"
Another reads: "I've clocked 9,000 km in the past 10 months I've owned this car. I get an average 24 m.p.g. (mostly city driving), which is nowhere near the figures quoted by Hyundai. This is false advertising through and through!"
Mark Gordon of Whitestone, Queens, 58, a manufacturer's representative who sells bridal gowns, was so disappointed with the fuel economy of the 2012 Elantra he bought last year and with Hyundai's response to his complaints, that he created his own Web site, my2012HyundaiElantragetslousygasmileage.com.
The Elantra is rated at 29 miles per gallon city, 40 highway and 33 m.p.g. combined. Mr. Gordon said he and his wife were lucky to get 22 m.p.g. over all.
When he called Hyundai to complain, "They told me I didn't know how to drive. They were obviously working from a script because I got many e-mails from people all across the country saying they were also getting 22 m.p.g. And they would go to the dealer, and they were told they don't know how to drive."
Because of complaints, he said Hyundai took him for a ride with an engineer. "They told me I drove too fast and that you could not let the r.p.m.'s go over 2,000. He never went into the fast lane, he always drove at 50, but when you are doing this at 2,000 r.p.m.'s, it takes you a half an hour to get up to 50 and it was an extremely unsafe way to drive."
They were able to get it to 35 m.p.g. he said and every time it went over 35 they took a picture of the fuel economy read-out on the dashboard, making him feel like a liar, he said.
A self-described loyal Hyundai owner - he has had six or seven - he contrasts driving the Elantra with driving his 2010 Chevrolet HHR, which he said is rated at 20 m.p.g. city and 30 highway.
"I get 25 m.p.g. over all no matter what I do; and on the highway I get 30 m.p.g.," he said. "I hit the number on the mark. I don't have to watch what the r.p.m.'s are; I don't have to watch whether I'm doing 70 or 30."
Barry Koopersmith said he had trouble achieving stated mileage on the 2011 Elantra GLS that he bought in March 2011. Mr. Koopersmith, 61, an information systems manager who lives in Merrick, N.Y., said in a telephone interview that he had worked at the same company for 18 years and drove to work five miles a day in stop-and-go traffic.
He has been able to achieve only 21 to 22 m.p.g. with the Elantra, he said, but got 24 m.p.g. with his 2007 Nissan Sentra 2.0 S with an identical driving pattern.
He said he noticed the problem immediately after getting the car. Every time he fills up he notes his mileage and how much gas he buys, calculates the miles per gallon and enters the information into a spreadsheet. He also had the car serviced by Hyundai every six months.
When complaining initially, he was told to give it another six months. Then they said give it 10,000 miles. When he took it in for the next service he complained that even though it was rated at 29 to 40 m.p.g. he was getting only 22 m.p.g.
The service technician told him there was nothing wrong with the car.
"He admitted it should be 22, not 29 for city traffic," Mr. Koopersmith said. "He probably won't be quoted on that, but that's what he told me."
When Stacy Bray, 52, a project manager in San Marcos, Tex., complained about the mileage on her 2013 Elantra, she said she was told she "probably had a heavy foot" or was "probably not driving that many freeway miles."
"They just come up with excuses," Ms. Bray said.
The E.P.A. did not levy fines or sanctions against either Hyundai or Kia. Instead, Hyundai announced that it would restate the fuel economy of the Elantra as 28 m.p.g. city and 38 highway, with a combined average of 32 m.p.g., which is only one or two miles per gallon less than before. That, along with the rest of the settlement, doesn't sit too well with some owners.
"I tried to figure out the difference between what the m.p.g. should be and what I'm actually getting," said Ms. Bray, who estimates her driving pattern to be 90 percent highway and 10 percent city. "I average around 30 m.p.g. I was expecting to get more like 36. But they are using a figure of two miles to the gallon difference and that's not true. No, it is not two. It's a lot more than two."
She figures she's losing $45 a month because of the difference between what the fuel economy actually is and what was advertised. Meanwhile, Hyundai is saying she might get $45 a year from the settlement.
Mr. Gordon estimates he is likely to get $55 a year under this settlement. "What gets me mad is the E.P.A. found out they fudged on the test and nobody got fined, nobody at Hyundai lost their jobs," Mr. Gordon said. "But they sold 900,000 cars fudging the m.p.g."
Jim Trainor, product public relations senior group manager for Hyundai Motor America, said the company was aware that some owners were unhappy with the compensation being offered but that others were more positive. "I've also seen a lot of people saying, 'Hey good for them for owning up to this and I'm proud to be a Hyundai owner.'"
He cited a J.D. Power & Associates study in which customers were asked to rate how happy they were with their fuel economy. "We were by far No. 1 in pleasing our customers in fuel economy," Mr. Trainor said.
Mr. Gordon says he thinks that Hyundai should be made to buy back the cars and that fines and sanctions should be levied against the automaker.
Mr. Koopersmith estimated he would get $30 a year in the settlement, which he said was not satisfactory.
He would rather have the company admit that the Elantra would get only 22 miles per gallon.
"It's just the principle of the thing," Mr. Koopersmith said. "How can they get away with advertising that and enticing you to get a car and it's not true and then getting away with admitting, 'O.K. I was only off by one.' I don't believe it."

HEADLINE: India's Outsourcing Industry Welcomes Obama Win

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI


HIGHLIGHT: Tough talk against outsourcing just "campaign rhetoric," executives say, expect U.S. economy to prosper. 

 BODY:
Even though President Barack Obama railed against outsourcing in his campaign, information technology titans and trade groups in India warmly welcomed his re-election, as they were optimistic that he would cement bilateral ties and improve the United States economy in his second term, which in turn would improve their business.
Outsourcing is a controversial topic in the United States, and in a political campaign it can be downright poisonous, as it was in this election. Bain Capital, the private equity firm that Mitt Romney once led, was criticized by President Obama for investing in companies that moved jobs overseas, and one of Mr. Obama's campaign ads nicknamed Mr. Romney the "Outsourcer in Chief."
In his victory speech, Mr. Obama brought up his plans to ensure American children grow up in a country that attracts jobs by investing in technology -- "a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow."
Most outsourcing industry leaders in India said they believed that much of Mr. Obama's criticism of outsourcing was campaign rhetoric, and that it would not actually affect his policy decisions.
"In the last four years, his policies have been pro-business," Ameet Nivsarkar, vice president global trade development for the National Association of Software and Services Companies, or Nasscom, India's technology industry association, said in an interview. "There have been no decisions that are substantially challenging for the industry."
While other countries like the Philippines and Costa Rica have recently attracted outsourcing business, the Indian outsourcing industry is still growing fast. Revenues for India's information technology and outsourcing industries are expected to cross $100 billion this financial year, up almost 15 percent from a year ago and double the revenues in 2007, Nasscom said in a report released earlier this year.
Analysts said the United States is a significant driver of growth for the Indian outsourcing industry. "It's clearly the largest partner," said Mohit Ralhan, managing partner of Indus Balaji Private Equity.
Indian business leaders and policy experts on Wednesday underscored the importance of a strong economic recovery in the United States because of the global impact it would have on countries including India.
"Now the focus will be on driving economic growth, which will lead to increased prosperity and greater job creation in the U.S., as well as act as a catalyst for growth across the world," saidN. Chandrasekaran, the chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services, in a statement. "Technology will play a strong role in driving the next phase of growth," he predicted, adding that Indian companies may play a significant role by forming partnerships with companies in the United States.
R. V. Kanoria, president of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement that he hoped the new Obama administration would "take a long-term and practical view on issues such as outsourcing, which ultimately are in the U.S. national interest" because outsourcing helps American companies drive down costs and expand.
Nasscom said it shared many of the economic goals Mr. Obama hopes to achieve and highlighted the need to work together as the global economy recovers. "It is more important than ever that India and the U.S. find ways to partner together to spur innovation, foster economic growth, develop an educated and skilled workforce and create jobs for the modern global marketplace," it said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Obama's Next Steps on Energy and Climate

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Reviewing Obama's approach to climate and energy, with a look to the next four years. 

 BODY:
In his acceptance speech after winning the election late last night, President Obama articulated many of the goals he'll pursue in a second term, including a rare and welcome reference to the risks posed by global warming:
We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.
There's much to be fleshed out, of course, particularly given the dominance of the economy among voters' concerns (swamping everything else in exit polls).
In addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the question will be how much focus Obama should put on legislative initiatives (probably not much, again given other priorities and structural blockades in the Senate), on diplomacy (the climate treaty process will mostly be "soft" diplomacy for years to come), on targeted spending and administrative moves (a lot of potential), and on basic leadership (vast untested potential).
He and Congress would do well to examine ways to cut vulnerability to climate-related hazards, whatever the mix of natural and human forces involved. A good first step would be a fresh look at perverse incentives (such as aspects of federal flood insurance policy) that end up prompting people to build in harm's way in floodplains and coastal zones.
There's plenty to consider, as laid out in manyposts following Hurricane Sandy last week.
Before I start assembling suggestions (with your help!), it's worth looking back through Dot Earth coverage of Obama's (and Congress's) approach to energy and climate change since 2008.
A sampler is below. It's particularly worthwhile to offer this review of the Obama administration's steps so far, because more than half of Dot Earth readers on a typical day are new to the blog.

HEADLINE: On Wall St., Obama's Re-election Sinks In

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN and ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: After the election, Wall Street's social media mood ran the gamut from the lighthearted to the glum, as some speculated about the future of regulation and the economy. 

 BODY:
President Obama's re-election Tuesday night came as a disappointment to the many on Wall Street who had rallied behind Mitt Romney.
Markets seemed to reflect this sentiment Wednesday morning, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average falling modestly. Both indexes were down by more than 1 percent in morning trading. Of course, the outcome of the election may have already been factored into the market.
Wall St. told pollsters that, while supporting Romney, they believed O would win. So why the sell-off?

But many looked ahead as the industry speculated about the future of regulation and the economy. 
 Analysts at Citigroup had been predicting an Obama victory for some time. The talk on Wall Street now moves to budget problems.
"What will matter now is how quickly and how successfully the politicians on both sides of the political spectrum come to an agreement about its massive fiscal cliff," Geoffrey Dennis of Citigroup said in an interview on CNBC.
Alice Ross, a correspondent for The Financial Times, summed up the bank's reaction in 140 characters or less.

- deepfoo (@deepfoo) November 7, 2012
The parody account @GSElevator, which claims to tweet snippets of dialogue overheard at Goldman Sachs, sounded glum, with posts not fit to be printed here. 
At the Blackstone Group, two executives found themselves on opposite sides of the political debate. Fortune's Dan Primack noted this on Wednesday:

Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, began speculating about the next Treasury secretary, with Timothy F. Geithner expected to step down:
@joshrosnerErskine Bowles is the right man for the job Josh, to be sure. But it is more likely to be Jack Lew. Exeunt Timid Timmy finally.
- Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert) November 7, 2012
Vincent Reinhart, the chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley, joined the guessing game on CNBC in a discussion on the Federal Reserve.
"The Fed Reserve, like the Supreme Court, pays attention to elections and they got an implied vote from the American people about policy interventionism and the weights toward resource slack versus inflation," Mr. Reinhart said. "And so in some sense it validates the more accommodative stance the Fed Reserve took starting in December." 
In another closely watched race on Tuesday, Elizabeth Warren won a seat in the Senate. Ms. Warren, a Harvard professor who has provoked anger from Wall Street with her calls to rein in banks' risky ways, is now poised to have even more influence.

HIGHLIGHT: Meet the new boss. Maybe not quite the same as the old boss. 

 BODY:
My first reaction as the numbers rolled in was that voters had conspired to play an elaborate practical joke on the country. After more than a year of frantic attention, obscene amounts of advertising, a profusion of polling, fact-checking, forecasting and analyzing, most of it predicated on the notion that America wanted change - "Big Change" as the closing Romney slogan had it - the electorate decided to basically leave things the way they were: President Obama in the White House, intransigent Republicans in charge of the House, Democrats barely in control of the Senate. After confiding to pollsters that they yearned for an end to gridlock, they reinstated the same traffic jam. Can this mean anything but four more years of acrimony and paralysis?
There are reasons to hope it can. 
First, as Carl Hulse explained in The Times, last night's outcome - the defeat of the Republican standard-bearer, the failed dream of taking the Senate - is bound to make Republicans in Congress question their strategy of obstruction and ideological purity. Certainly there will be Republicans who argue Romney failed by not being conservative enough. But there are Republicans (and I'll bet John Boehner is one of them) who understand reality, and the reality is this: Romney surged when he moved toward the middle, and might have won if he had not veered so far right in his quest for the nomination, alienating women and Latinos in particular. The wiser heads will read their fate in the demographics (Republican support rests on a diminishing base of white men), in the repudiation Tuesday of Tea Party favorites in Indiana and Missouri and elsewhere, in the turning of the tide on gay rights, in the failure of Karl Rove's SuperPAC cash to alter the balance of power, and in the electorate's consistent plea to pollsters for compromise in Washington. The economy will be the first test of whether realism has seeped into the Republican consciousness, but there will be others. For example, after the burgeoning Latino vote went nearly 70 percent for Obama, I wouldn't be surprised to see Marco Rubio rounding up Republicans for a deal on immigration reform. 
Second, Obama knows his only route to the large legacy he craves leads through the more temperate Republicans, and he knows (as a man who voraciously consumes his press reviews) that winning votes requires something he has neglected, working the room. It requires old-fashioned schmoozing and flattery and favors, accompanied by high-minded appeals to the public. My colleague Tim Egan wrote a wonderfulblog post yesterday explaining how Obama won the outspoken admiration of New Jersey's acerbically Republican governor, Chris Christie, not just by delivering flood relief, but by brokering a meet between Governor Christie and his idol, Bruce Springsteen. I'm not sure what this says about Chris Christie, but it suggests Obama is getting some political game. 
Third, if conciliatory outreach and a few rounds of golf with the majority leader fail, there is that "fiscal cliff." I've proposed before that Obama make it perfectly clear: if the Republicans continue to play stall and sabotage, if they do not respond to genuine offers of a fiscal bargain, he is prepared to let the tax cuts expire and draconian spending cuts (including defense) kick in automatically at the beginning of the year. It would not take a lot of persuading for the public to blame Congress and - as Obama recently pointed out - voting is the best revenge. Let's see how the Republicans, who have played their own game of chicken on the debt ceiling, respond when the president's headlights are bearing down on them.
Is this too much to hope for?

HEADLINE: For Deal Makers, Few Big Changes

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The state of the merger market is expected to remain the same, with possibly a bit of an uptick as the economy improves. A second-term Obama administration may affect things around the edges, but that is about it. 

 BODY:
A second term for President Obama probably means a mixed outlook for deal-making, with some possible upside as the economy continues a slow recovery. In other words, it's the status quo. 
The merger market is in a lull. For the first nine months of 2012, worldwide mergers and acquisitions activity is down 16 percent, to $1.7 trillion, from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The United States market is in a bigger slump, down 21.5 percent from the 2011 period. The number of transactions is also down 13 percent, to 7,605 announced deals from 8,790. 
We're likely at a cyclical bottom in terms of M.&A. activity, but any improvement is likely to be modest at best. That's because deal-making is generally driven by the stock market and the economy. The United States is in a mild recovery, but the outlook for Europe and Asia is weaker.
 The United States government, of course, can affect the economy and grease the wheels for deal-making. With this in mind, here are the important things that deal makers will be watching for in the Obama administration: 
 The Fiscal Cliff 
Deal makers prefer certainty. The uncertainty around "the fiscal cliff" -- the simultaneous tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January unless Congress acts -- will be a big factor in M.&A. in the next few months. 
First, the specter of higher taxes is likely to lead to a short-term flurry of deals as people rush to sell their businesses at a lower capital gains tax rate. George Lucas, for example, likely saved as much as $100 million by selling Lucasfilm this year instead of next year when the capital gains rate is scheduled to go up by at least the 3.8 percent surcharge imposed by the Affordable Healthcare Act. 
But over all, deal makers are likely to wait until there is some sort of resolution. And whether it is a grand bargain or merely kicking the can down the road again, any agreement is likely to be enough to bolster the outlook for deals.
 Taxes 
That being said, both the fiscal cliff and any legislative bargain raises the issue of tax increases generally in the Obama administration and their effect on deal-making. 
Mr. Obama is on record as wanting both an increase in the income tax rate for high earners and an increase in the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent. 
If the president wins on this issue, it still may not be a significant drag on mergers. The data on whether capital gains and tax rates generally impede deal-making is uncertain. Certainly during the Clinton administration, when taxes were higher, M.&.A. was robust. 
Regardless of what happens with capital gains and the fiscal cliff, one tax that is likely to be raised in an Obama administration is the carried interest tax on private equity. Will this lead to less deal-making? Private equity says so, but again the data is uncertain, and the industry has been expecting the tax to rise for years. And there may be very easy workarounds to avoid this tax anyway by simply having the private equity partners invest directly in the firms. So, don't expect it to change deal activity much. 
Another tax piece unrelated to the fiscal cliff is the chance that Congress will pass a tax holiday for American companies to repatriate the trillions of cash held abroad. The Obama administration has been averse to such a holiday, but the sum is getting too big for Congress to continue to ignore, and if there is such a holiday, it will provide more hundreds of billions in cash with which to do deals. 
 Regulation 
The election of Elizabeth Warren to the Senate has some talking of a further crackdown on Wall Street. But she is just one senator, and the Dodd-Frank Act sucked out a lot of the political air toward increased regulation. House Republicans would also no doubt object, and they will be the biggest impediment to more regulation.
So, at best, the Obama second term likely means more status quo in terms of putting Dodd-Frank Act into effect. The financial regulatory overhaul has been bogged down in battles among regulators and it is expected to be challenged in the courts. So there is a real possibility that some fixes to Dodd-Frank may be made that cure some minor parts of its regulatory overreach or other deregulatory bills passed. And remember that the president did sign the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act to partially deregulate the market for raising capital. 
The bottom line is that there's unlikely to be much of a change toward increased regulation of Wall Street and possibly even some deregulation. Either way, deal-making won't be much affected. 
 National Security 
This is one area where Mr. Obama's second term may have a clear upside for deal makers. Mitt Romney had said that he would name China a "currency manipulator" on Day 1 of his administration. This would have upset relations with our largest trading partner at a minimum and may have been indicative to more combative global trade policies. In today's world, where Canada, Australia and Europe are actively seeking to block deals on national securities grounds, Mr. Obama's more conciliatory approach may smooth these wheels for deal-making in an increasingly nationalistic global climate. 
 Antitrust 
The Obama administration has not been as strict as some expected in this area. Indeed, in its first two years, the administration had a similar enforcement record for mergers as the last two years of the Bush administration. Still, the Justice Department allowed Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines to combine but also blocked the AT&T/T-Mobile tie-up and H&R Block's acquisition of TaxACT. A Romney administration may have been more liberal in allowing mergers, but not much more than the Obama administration. 
All of this leads to the conclusion that things are likely to remain the same with possibly a bit of an uptick as the economy improves. A second-term Obama administration may affect things around the edges, but that is about it. 
Still, there may be a real, unexpected upside for deal-making. To be sure, Mr. Obama is not about to do what Wall Street wants and significantly reduce taxes or deregulate the industry. 
But if, now comfortable in a second term, his economic team can push through real tax reform and a longer-term resolution of the fiscal cliff, it will provide needed certainty and avoid economic contraction. 
As the housing market finally enters recovery mode, these events are likely to produce added growth. If so, then this will set the stage for further economic growth and more deal-making.

HEADLINE: Orca, Meet Obama

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on the what the re-election of the president means for Republicans, Democrats and Christmas carols. 

 BODY:
 Gail Collins: Morning David, tra-la-la.
 David Brooks: Christmas carols in early November? If you're going to be consistent with why Obama won, I'd at least be singing "Feliz Navidad."
 Gail: Barack Obama is re-elected. Do you think the Republican right can finally bring itself to refer to him as President Obama?
 David: This might be a good time for Republicans to redouble their commitment to the reality-based community. Did you see Byron York's reporting from inside the Romney campaign? They apparently had this giant computer model called Orca - named after a whale because it was bigger than anything the Democrats could imagine. It processed huge amounts of data and late in the day was still projecting a Romney victory until its head exploded. Garbage in. Garbage out. 
 Gail: The Republican Orca - stop me before I fall into a great pile of Moby Dick analogies. 
You know, the last time I was in Ohio I found the people had heard so many ads they were numb. And they'd been called by so many people, and visited by so many party workers, that I began to think they had transcended all the wonders of modern election science and were just going to do whatever they would have done if they'd been left in peace from the beginning. Perhaps that's naïve of me, but I'm wondering if we've moved into a post-political-consultant America. 
 David: I don't often get things right, but last January in the middle of the South Carolina primary, I put a sentence in a column that came back to me as the results came in. It was: "I sometimes wonder if the Republican Party has become the receding roar of white America as it pines for a way of life that will never return." 
 Gail: I actually quote that a lot.
 David: This election was mostly about demographics or more precisely about the way demographic shifts lead to cultural and political shifts. Ronald Reagan won with an electorate that was nearly 90 percent white. Now the electorate is around 72 percent white. And the white population is different - more educated, more centered in college towns, more socially diverse, more likely to live in single-person households.
That means they are less likely to subscribe to the cowboy ethos of the rugged individual. It doesn't mean they want to return to the New Deal, but it does mean that the old Republican narrative can no longer win a majority.
 Gail: I've always thought the big political division was empty places versus crowded places. People who live in crowded places just naturally appreciate how useful government is. Empty-place people don't see the point. Maybe this is the death of the empty-place vision.
 David: The conservative party is supposed to conserve. But when you do that you sometimes get on the wrong side of huge historic trends. That's what happened to the Republicans. Romney, who ran a good campaign in the final month, was the victim and sometimes perpetrator of that obsolete vision.
 Gail: Despite my excellent mood, I don't have any sympathy for Romney. If he'd been a good candidate he wouldn't have had a different campaign for every month on the calendar.
Can I say, by the way, how impressed I was with my fellow New York voters? Some of them waited for hours to vote - and you can imagine how unpleasant a hot gym packed with people wearing coats can get. They wanted to help choose a president, even though they had been assured that their vote was meaningless and their state already painted blue early Tuesday morning.
 David: It seemed like there were long lines everywhere. It's funny. Americans supposedly hate politics, but they really wanted to vote. They really wanted to watch the debates and the conventions. They haven't given up on politics, evidently. 
 Gail: Maybe they would just like it if we had presidential elections that ran for only two or three months, instead of two or three years.
But let's go back to your demographic thought. The power of the Latino vote. The gender gap. And the youth. We have seen the future, and the future is O.K. with gay marriage. Also, it appears, with small amounts of marijuana here and there.
 David: I guess I'd say this is not new. Every company in America, every school in America has transformed itself over the past 30 years, adapting to the new diversity. What's happening now is that government and politics are finally catching up. We'll have an openly lesbian Senator. Well, if you go to my kid's school, they've had openly lesbian teachers for years. If you go to companies, they've had openly gay people for years, in most cases. This is not new. This is not scary. It's just that government is a lagging indicator.
And it's not social liberalism I'm taking about. It's globalization and the effect of globalization on culture and society. It's fluidity and diversity replacing hierarchy and inflexible structures.
 Gail: You're in charge of explaining what's next for the Republican Party. Is there a civil war brewing? Everything about this season, from Mitt Romney's midcourse leftward tack to those awful loser Senate candidates, shows that the Tea Party has been a disaster. 
You'd think this would be the moment for the moderate establishment Republicans to reassert themselves. But the Republican establishment is a wreck! You can tell from the pathetic candidates they ran in places like Ohio and Florida. And look at Texas. A year or two ago, when I took up writing about the craziness of Texas politics, people said I was ignoring the vast power of the old Republican establishment. Since then, the old Texas Republican establishment has passed away, converted or taken up residence in a fashionable Austin bomb shelter.
 David: Mitt Romney outperformed his party. He is not the problem. And frankly changing the party's immigration policy, though necessary, is not a sufficient response to the problem. Let me repeat that because this is the first temptation for a lot of Republicans. It's not solely about immigration. It's about coming up with a new narrative of how to make it in America. It's about leaving behind the stale Big Government versus Small Government framework and figuring out how to use limited but energetic government to help people work harder and strive more. 
 Gail: I disagree with you about immigration. The Republicans actually insulted Hispanic-Americans with their hostility to reform. But either way, sooner or later that one will be resolved, and you'll still be left with a fast-growing chunk of the population that benefits more from the Democratic vision of how to run the country. I don't see how the Republicans win the Latino vote.
 David: I do. This country still does not like central planning. The country still faces a ruinous debt situation. The country hasn't shifted left. If this is a Democratic victory, it should go to chastened Democrats. They won because the Republicans lost. They did not win because they presented an agenda commensurate with the problems we face. That means there's an opening for Republicans.
 Gail: Was there any one election result that particularly depressed or cheered you last night? I have to admit I was perked up by the Senate race in Connecticut. I don't know if the winner, Chris Murphy, is going to be the next superstar of the chamber. But the defeat of Linda McMahon told the nation that for all the hysteria about "super PACs," you can't just buy a Senate seat. Even if you spend $100 million of your own money. Which you got from your professional wrestling empire.
 David: I felt the biggest surge of happiness when Amy Klobuchar won in Minnesota. This wasn't a surprise. She probably won by 5,000 points. But she represents the modern senator to me. Not some big-hair blowhard. But a happy regular person with an independent streak. 
 Gail: So, David, where do we go next? You were the one who predicted that the American people would express their great desire for change by re-electing the president, along with a Democratic Senate and Republican House. So here we are. What happens now?
 David: Fiscal cliff. Gridlock. Doom. Recession. Panic. Despair. But let's not think of that today. The election campaign stunk, but the day after should still be about hope.

HEADLINE: Inquiries to Watch in a Second Term

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: There are not likely to be any new, sweeping investigations involving white-collar crime in President Obama's second term, but prominent cases involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis loom. 

 BODY:
In any election, new politics and policies are often debated in much detail. The impact of the presidential election on law enforcement will be more subtle, however, especially after there was little discussion about policing the markets during the campaign.
The re-election of President Obama will result in less drastic changes than if Mitt Romney had won, but there will be turnover at several agencies. In addition, there is an inevitable reshuffling of positions as some senior law enforcement officials switch to lucrative posts in the private sector. This comes as law firms will happily pay top dollar for the access and credibility that a former official can bring.
A change in leadership at any given agency often has little effect, at least in the short term, on the day-to-day work in investigations and prosecutions. 
For example, the wide-ranging investigation of hedge funds that led to the conviction of Raj Rajaratnam, Rajat Gupta and a host of others for insider trading began under the Bush administration and came to fruition in October 2009. The change in the Justice Department leadership had no appreciable impact on the investigation.
I doubt there will be any new, sweeping investigations or legislation involving white-collar crime in the president's second term, barring another economic cataclysm or a hidden corporate fraud. Nevertheless, there are three topics I expect that the administration may address, or be forced to address, in the coming four years:
 Foreign Bribery 
In a speech the day before the election, Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said that the vigorous enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been a "signature achievement" of the Obama administration. The government has aggressively pursued a number of cases, particularly against foreign companies, over paying bribes to government officials to obtain business in their countries.
Much like the insider trading investigations, the push against overseas bribery began under President George W. Bush, but the Justice Department has made this a featured player in its corporate law enforcement efforts. More investigations are being pursued in industries that traditionally were not involved in corruption investigations, like pharmaceutical companies.
That aggressive approach seems to have ensnared a global bank. Barclays recently disclosed that the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking at payments made in connection with securing a large capital infusion from Qatar's investment fund in 2008. A number of government funds made investments during the financial crisis, so other companies and Wall Street banks may be in the cross hairs on this issue.
The question is whether there will be any pushback by multinational businesses swept up in inquiries. The United States Chamber of Commerce recruited in 2011a former attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey, to advocate for changes to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to make it more business friendly. But the recent case disclosed by The New York Times related to bribe payments in Mexico by a Wal-Mart unit seems to have derailed that effort.
The Justice Department has been promising new guidance on how it will apply the law, but nothing has been seen yet and any statement is unlikely to restrict its authority to pursue cases. The new Congress may be willing to consider potential changes to the law if a push from the Justice Department into new sectors causes companies to start lobbying for greater protection. A likely theme for any proposed changes would be that it would help create jobs by giving businesses more certainty, a claim that can be difficult to oppose.
 Closing Out the Financial Crisis 
There have not been many prosecutions of institutions or individuals from Wall Street related to the financial crisis, and the prospect for any new criminal cases is dim. The latest tactic appears to be to repeatedly sue the banks involved in making questionable mortgage loans that were sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or guaranteed by the government.
There is a good chance the banks will start to push back against the onslaught of lawsuits. The Justice Department sued Wells Fargo for fraud related to loans it made that were insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and the bank responded by arguing that the $25 billion mortgage settlement reached earlier this year precludes further claims against it for the loans.
A recent lawsuit seeking $1 billion in penalties from Bank of America over violations of the False Claims Act for loans sold to Fannie and Freddie may face problemsbecause the two mortgage giants were not, at the time, agencies of the federal government.
Despite all the civil suits and the publicity about redressing fraud during the financial crisis, no individuals have been named in the recent cases. There is a reasonable likelihood that the cases will be settled with a payment and promise not to act improperly again. 
It would have been difficult for a Romney administration to turn the page on pursuing cases from the financial crisis because of his ties to Wall Street that generated suspicion about whether he would go soft on bankers. Mr. Obama, on the other hand, does not have to worry about another election, and could just stop suing the banks over and over again if no individuals are going to be held responsible. 
There will always be a sense of frustration about the lack of prosecutions from the financial crisis, but at some point the government may decide it's ready to move on.
 The Potential for Scandal 
The second term of a president seems to lead to some type of scandal involving possible criminal violations by administration officials. We have seen investigations and Congressional hearings over Watergate, the selling arms to Iran to fund the Nicaraguan contra rebels, a relationship with a White House intern and the disclosure of the identity of a Central Intelligence Agency operative.
Will Mr. Obama be embroiled in an issue of his own during the next four years? We have already seen controversy over "Operation Fast and Furious" that led the House of Representatives to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt, but that has not caught the public's imagination like other scandals have.
Unlike in previous investigations, the law authorizing the appointment of a special prosecutor who can act independently of the Justice Department is no longer in force. But that did not stop Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the former United States attorney in Chicago, from aggressively pursuing perjury charges against I. Lewis Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.
There is no way to know whether a scandal will erupt, or where it will come from. But if history is any guide, there is a good chance that white-collar defense lawyers will be called upon to represent government officials at some point in the next four years.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Post-Election Spin

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: It comes in two basic flavors: predictable denial and bizarre denial. 

 BODY:
The Republicans' post-election spin came in two basic flavors -- predictable denial and bizarre denial.
Let's start with the predictable: the reason Americans rejected a presidential candidate who represented the right-wing of national politics was because he wasn't genuinely right wing enough. "There's definitely a feeling that it would be better to nominate a conservative of long-standing conviction," said Ralph Reed, a movement conservative who hardly ever finds an electable politician crazy enough for his tastes.
Also pushing that line was Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a "Tea Party" organization started and financed by some of the most establishment Republicans around - David Koch, Dick Armey, Jack Kemp and C. Boyden Gray, to name a few. "It is getting to point where you can't reach back and pull another establishment Republican from the queue like we have done with Romney," he said.
Richard Viguerie, who has been helping get establishment Republicans elected since 1980, said "Mitt Romney's loss was the death knell of the establishment G.O.P." He said that "the disaster of 2012 signals the beginning of the battle to take over the Republican Party" and make it even more Tea Party-like.
The problem with these theories is that Mitt Romney got all the right wing votes he could. It was the votes of the non-right, non-rich, non-whites that he failed to get.
Republicans made the not-conservative-enough argument after George H.W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and after Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton in 1996. They sort of skipped over George W. Bush, who was pretty much like Mitt Romney but he won, and then they did it again in 2008 after Mr. Obama beat John McCain.
But today's reactions went far beyond the predictable into the twilight zone of deep denial.
From Grover Norquist, the anti-tax zealot who somehow gets virtually all Republican candidates to sign his pledge never to vote for a dollar in revenue: "The election did solidify one thing. The modern Republican party is the part of the Ryan Plan: no tax hikes, Reaganesque tax reform, and entitlement reform."
It's true that the do-nothing, oppose-everything Republican majority in the House remained pretty much intact, but the main reason was incumbency. There's no rational reason to take a vote for an individual Congressman as a vote on national policy.
Mr. Norquist's reaction was not so surprising, since if Republicans start voting for sensible tax increases, he will lose his reason for being. It was a lot more distressing to hear the same misreading of the election from John Boehner, the Speaker of the House. "With this vote, the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising tax rates," he said.
Actually, the opposite seemed true. Exit polls showed that 60 percent favor raising taxes- either on the rich only or on everyone.
The Republicans need to get past the denial and isolation stage and move on, hopefully to bargaining and acceptance. They spent four years trying to keep the economy in bad shape so Mr. Obama would lose. He won anyway, and the economy is teetering on the fiscal cliff. Standing around talking about no-tax pledges and nominating more right wingers is not going to help.

HEADLINE: Boehner Strikes Conciliatory Tone on 'Fiscal Cliff'

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said he is ready to accept a budget deal that raises federal revenues as long as it is linked to an overhaul of entitlements and a reform of the tax code that closes loopholes, curtails or eliminates deductions and lowers income tax rates. 

 BODY:
The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, striking a conciliatory tone a day after the Republican Party's electoral drubbing, said on Wednesday that he was ready to accept a budget deal that raises federal revenue as long as it is linked to an overhaul of entitlements and a reform of the tax code that closes loopholes, curtails or eliminates deductions and lowers income tax rates.
Mr. Boehner's gesture was the most explicit offer he has made to avert the "fiscal cliff" in January, when billions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts go into force. And it came hours after Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, offered his own olive branch, saying "it's better to dance than to fight."
"Mr. President, this is your moment," Mr. Boehner told reporters in the Capitol. "We're ready to lead, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans." 
The offer may be enough to bring the parties to the table in the wake of an election that kept President Obama in power, strengthened the Democrats' grip on the Senate and chipped away at the still-large Republican majority in the House. 
But Democrats and Republicans are still far apart. Mr. Boehner made it clear that his vision for additional revenue includes a tax code that lowers even the top income tax rate from where it is now, 35 percent, not where it would be in January when the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire -- 39.6 percent. At least some of that additional revenue would come from economic growth that he said would be fueled by a simpler tax code.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat, has said those constructs are unacceptable. Democratic leaders say tax reform that lowers tax rates across the board would either hurt the middle class by trimming vital tax benefits like the home mortgage deduction or would not raise enough taxes to meaningfully reduce the deficit. Mr. Reid underscored Mr. Obama's contention that tax rates on the rich must rise, saying "the vast majority of Americans" support that, "including rich people."
But in language and timing, the leaders of Congress's two chambers left the unmistakable impression that they want a deal at least large enough to avert the worst economic impacts of a sudden rise in income, payroll, capital gains, dividend, interest and estate tax rates that would affect virtually every American family, working or not. Mr. Boehner has said for months that a deal to reform taxes and entitlements and substantially lower the deficit is not appropriate for a lame-duck Congress.
But facing a Congress next year that will be less Republican than the current one, he suggested on Wednesday that he would favor a deal that would serve at least as "a down payment on - and a catalyst for - major solutions, enacted in 2013."
He said he had spoken to the president on Wednesday before making his statement to reporters.
"I'm not suggesting we compromise on our principles," he said, "but I am suggesting we commit ourselves to creating an atmosphere where we can see common ground when it exists and seize it."

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, Time to Mend Fences With Obama

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE


HIGHLIGHT: Wall Street titans who supported Mitt Romney now face the prospect of developing a working relationship with the Obama administration. 

 BODY:
Del Frisco's, an expensive steakhouse with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Boston harbor, was a festive scene on Tuesday evening. The hedge fund billionaires Steven A. Cohen, Paul Singer and Daniel Loeb were among the titans of finance there dining among the gray velvet banquettes before heading several blocks away to what they hoped would be a victory party for their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.
The next morning was a cold, sobering one for these executives.
Few industries have made such a one-sided bet as Wall Street did in opposing President Obama and supporting his Republican rival. The top five sources of contributions to Mr. Romney, a former top private equity executive, were big banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wealthy financiers - led by hedge fund investors - were the biggest group of givers to the main "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney, providing almost $33 million, and gave generously to outside groups in races around the country.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Loeb, who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008, was sanguine. "You win some, you lose some," he said in an interview. "We can all disagree. I have friends and we have spirited discussions. Sure, I am not getting invited to the White House anytime soon, but as citizens of the country we are all friendly."
Wall Street, however, now has to come to terms with an administration it has vilified. What Washington does next will be critically important for the industry, as regulatory agencies work to put their final stamp on financial regulations and as tax increases and spending cuts are set to take effect in the new year unless a deal to avert them is reached. To not have a friend in the White House at this time is one thing, but to have an enemy is quite another.
"Wall Street is now going to have to figure out how to make this relationship work," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst who follows the big banks for the investment bank Nomura. "It's not impossible, but it's not the starting point they had hoped for."
Traditionally, the financial industry has tended to support Republican candidates, but, being pragmatic about power, has also donated to Democrats. That script got a rewrite in 2008, when many on Wall Street supported Mr. Obama as an intelligent leader for a country reeling from the financial crisis. Goldman employees were the leading source of campaign donations for Mr. Obama, who reaped far more contributions - roughly $16 million - from Wall Street than did his opponent, John McCain.
The love affair between Wall Street and Mr. Obama soured soon after he took office and championed an overhaul in financial regulations that became the Dodd-Frank Act.
Some financial executives complained that in meetings with the president, they found him uninterested and disengaged, while others on Wall Street never forgave Mr. Obama for calling them "fat cats."
The disillusionment with the president spawned reams of critical commentary from Wall Street executives.
"So long as our leaders tell us that we must trust them to regulate and redistribute our way back to prosperity, we will not break out of this economic quagmire," Mr. Loeb wrote in one letter to his investors.
The rhetoric at times became extreme, like the time Steven A. Schwarzman, co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, compared a tax proposal to "when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939." (Mr. Schwarzman later apologized for the remark.)
Mr. Loeb was not alone in switching allegiances in the recent presidential race. Hedge fund executives like Leon Cooperman who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008 were big backers of Mr. Romney in 2012. And Wall Street chieftains like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, who have publicly been Democrats in the past, kept a low profile during this election. But their firms' employees gave money to Mr. Romney in waves.
Starting over with the Obama White House will not be easy. One senior Wall Street lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wall Street "made a bad mistake" in pushing so hard for Mr. Romney. "They are going to pay a price," he said. "It will soften over time, but there will be a price."
Mr. Obama is not without supporters on Wall Street. Prominent executives like Hamilton James of Blackstone, and Robert Wolf, a former top banker at UBS, were in Chicago on Tuesday night, celebrating with the president.
"What we learned is the people on Wall Street have one vote just like everyone else," Mr. Wolf said. Still, while the support Wall Street gave Mr. Romney is undeniable, Mr. Wolf said, "Mr. Obama wants a healthy private sector, and that includes Wall Street.
"If you look at fiscal reform, infrastructure, immigration and education, they are all bipartisan issues and are more aligned than some people make it seem."
Reshma Saujani, a former hedge fund lawyer who was among Mr. Obama's top bundlers this year and is planning to run for city office next year, agreed.
"Most people in the financial services sector are social liberals who support gay marriage and believe in a woman's right to choose, so I think many of them will swing back to Democrats in the future," she said.
An earlier version of this article misidentified Reshma Saujani as a male.

HEADLINE: Picket Fence Apocalypse

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Political reality made for a great rending of garments and gnashing of teeth among conservatives. 

 BODY:
No, you cannot have your country back. America is moving forward.
That's the message voters sent the Republican Party and its Tea Party wing Tuesday night when they re-elected President Obama and strengthened the Democrats' control of the Senate.
No amount of outside money or voter suppression or fear mongering or lying - and there was a ton of each - was enough to blunt that message.
President Obama and his formidable campaign machine out-performed the Republicans, holding together a winning coalition that is the face of America's tomorrow: young voters, urban voters, racially and ethnically diverse voters and women voters.
According to exit polls, Obama won 60 percent of the 18 to 29 year old vote and 52 percent of the 30-40 vote. He won 69 percent of the vote in big cities and 58 percent of the vote in mid-sized cities. He won 93 percent of the black vote and more than 70 percent of both the Asian vote and the Hispanic vote. He won over half of the female vote. And he won 76 percent of the gay, lesbian and bisexual vote.
Mitt Romney won the white vote, the male vote, the elderly vote, the small cities vote and the high-income vote.
The base of Democratic support in this country is expanding. The Republican base is shrinking, becoming more racially homogenous, more rural and older.
Reality made for a great rending of garments and gnashing of teeth among conservatives.
On election night, Bill O'Reilly said: 
It's a changing country, the demographics are changing. It's not a traditional America anymore, and there are 50 percent of the voting public who want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama.
O'Reilly continued: "The white establishment is now the minority."
Ann Coulter, who activates my gag reflex whenever I type her name, said Wednesday: 
If Mitt Romney cannot win in this economy, then the tipping point has been reached. We have more takers than makers and it's over. There is no hope.
Rush Limbaugh took to the air to say that "Mitt Romney and his family would have been the essence of exactly what this country needs" and that Romney "did offer a vision of traditional America." Limbaugh went on: 
I went to bed last night thinking we're outnumbered. I went to bed last night thinking all this discussion we'd had about this election being the election that will tell us whether or not we've lost the country. I went to bed last night thinking we've lost the country.
You would think that the world came to an end Tuesday night. And depending on your worldview, it might have. If your idea of America's power structure is rooted in a 1950s or even a 1920s sensibility, here's an update: that America is no more.
Republicans are trying to hold back a storm surge of demographic change with a white picket fence. Good luck with that.

HEADLINE: Values, Not Demographics, Won the Election

BYLINE: By JOEL BENENSON. 
Joel Benenson is the president and chief executive of Benenson Strategy Group and served as , Barack Obama's chief pollster during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns.

 BODY:
MUCH of the coverage of Tuesday's results has focused on the strength of Barack Obama's coalition -- minorities, women and young voters. But that analysis misses the real point. The contours of the 2012 presidential race were shaped less by the country's changing demographics than by the underlying attitudes and values of American voters, who are always far more complex than they appear to pollsters.
The president's victory was a triumph of vision, not of demographics. He won because he articulated a set of values that define an America that the majority of us wish to live in: A nation that makes the investments we need to strengthen and grow the middle class. A nation with a fair tax system, and affordable and excellent education for all its citizens. A nation that believes that we're most prosperous when we recognize that we are all in it together.
From the 2012 campaign's earliest days, analysts focused on historic economic and political metrics to explain the steep uphill climb Mr. Obama faced in his re-election bid: no sitting president had been re-elected with unemployment higher than 7.2 percent; or the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index below 78 percent; or the ''right track'' rating for the country as low as it was. 
Such conventional indicators failed to capture the mind-set of the American people who always had a broader view of the nation's economic situation and what had happened to their lives. A national survey of 800 voters conducted by our firm -- not for the Obama campaign -- during the final weekend before Tuesday's vote, confirmed that a clear majority of Americans viewed this election in the context of the scale of the economic crisis we faced and the deep recession that ensued.
Two key data points illustrate why Americans were always far more open to President Obama's message and accomplishments than commentators assumed. By a three to one margin (74 percent to 23 percent), voters said that what the country faced since 2008 was an ''extraordinary crisis more severe than we've seen in decades'' as opposed to ''a typical recession that the country has every several years.'' At the same time, a clear majority, 57 percent, believed that the problems we faced after the crisis were ''too severe for anyone to fix in a single term,'' while only 4 in 10 voters believed another president would have been able to do more than Mr. Obama to get the economy moving in the past four years.
President Obama offered Americans a clear, forward-looking vision that focused on creating a stronger, more secure future for average Americans and their children, built on investments we need as a nation and a balanced approach to fiscal issues such as taxes and deficit reduction. Spending cuts alone could not address voter concerns -- 89 percent of those surveyed agreed that ''for my children to have the economic opportunities I've had, we need to make real investments in education, creating world-class schools and making college more affordable.'' Mitt Romney's negative drumbeat about the president's record and his insistence that our economic agenda was failing were essentially tone-deaf, missing the mark with voters to such an extent that they undermined the central premise of his candidacy -- his economic expertise. Mr. Romney was describing a reality that was disconnected from voters' lives and from the context within which they viewed the economy.
The president's forward-looking approach resonated strongly with American voters, who by a margin of 77 percent to 17 percent said that which candidate would make their life better four years from now was more important to their vote than whether they were better off four years ago. And voters simply didn't believe that Mr. Romney was on their side. When asked about a series of issues that might concern them about each candidate, voters' top worry about Mr. Romney was ''he won't do enough to restore security for working- and middle-class families,'' closely followed by ''he won't do enough to ensure that Wall Street and big corporations have to play by the same rules as everyone else.'' In fact, when voters heard him talk about ''job creators,'' 52 percent of voters thought he was talking about big corporations while only 34 percent thought he was referring to the small businesses that voters believe are the engines of economic growth and innovation. And fully 94 percent of voters say that they are ''more likely to support companies that are doing their part to help the community or people in need.''
Moreover, Mr. Obama's strength on the economy was not about ''empathy,'' as many experts asserted. Rather, for average working-class and middle-class Americans who have believed for nearly a decade that the economic system in America had fallen out of balance for people like them, the president's personal story and policies engendered trust because they connected with voters' lives, aspirations, and beliefs about what it would take to create the future they wanted. That trust was the central economic test in this election.
That is why, despite the credit given to Mr. Romney for ''understanding'' the economy -- a phrasing that spoke to a technical understanding -- Mr. Obama was always significantly more trusted on qualities that matter to working Americans. In fact, independent voters in our survey, by 54 to 40, said it was more important for a president to have ''the willingness to fight for middle-class families'' rather than a ''technical understanding of the economy.''
And when asked what the key to growing our economy was, nearly two in three voters said it was building a strong middle class over creating a ''healthy climate for business.''
The point is not that Americans don't believe in a strong private sector; they do. But our data showed that they also believe that employers care less about those who work for them than they did five years ago. Moreover, voters don't assume that the success of corporations translates into their own security -- only 18 percent strongly agree that ''the middle class always does well when big corporations do well.''
Republicans lost the election by being on the wrong side of all these issues. Their current path risks marginalizing them further as a party that cannot grow beyond its extreme wing -- especially as the electorate grows increasingly diverse.
On the eve of the election, only 44 percent of voters said that Mr. Romney's views were in line with the views of most Americans, while 48 percent said his views were out of touch. By contrast, 52 percent said Mr. Obama's views were in line and only 43 percent said they were out of touch.
This was a bellwether election. Americans made a choice to side with a set of values and principles -- and an agenda that would advance them -- that they believe will offer not just economic recovery, but a restoration of the kind of opportunity and security that America long offered the middle class and those working to join it.

HEADLINE: Molson Says Its Income Is Steady

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
DENVER -- The Molson Coors Brewing Company said Wednesday that its income was steady in its most recent quarter despite a decline in demand across its businesses. And it warned that the current quarter could be its toughest of the year. 
The company said that it faced difficult comparisons from a year ago for its Canadian and British businesses and higher costs in the United States and Central Europe.
For the quarter, however, Molson Coors said cost controls and its acquisition of StarBev earlier this year helped its profit.
The company said it earned $198.4 million, or $1.09 a share, for the three months ended Sept. 29. That compares with $197.4 million, or $1.06 a share, a year ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned $1.37 a share. Analysts expected $1.34 a share, according to FactSet.
Total sales rose 21 percent to $1.69 billion. Excluding excise taxes, revenue was $1.2 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of $1.34 a share on revenue excluding excise taxes of $1.25 billion, according to FactSet.
In Canada, the company said sales to retailers fell 5.1 percent, in part because of a shift in the calendar that moved results for Canada Day into the second quarter. In Britain, the company said sales fell by 4.8 percent because of the weaker economy.
At MillerCoors, its joint venture with SABMiller that sells both companies brands in the United States, sales fell 2.4 percent because the quarter had one less trading day. But it said higher prices and cost management lifted underlying net income for the unit by 13.5 percent.
Volume for its Central European business declined as consumer demand waned.
Shares of Molson Coors, which is based in Denver, fell $1.55, or 3.6 percent, to close at $41.65.

HEADLINE: Analysts Expect a Deal On Military Spending

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Whether President Obama or Mitt Romney won Tuesday, the top Pentagon contractors had already begun preparing for a new reality of shrinking resources for the military.
Boeing, for one, has slashed $2.2 billion in costs, including 6,300 jobs, from its huge military business since 2010. It announced Wednesday that it planned to cut an additional $1.6 billion by the end of 2015 by consolidating office space and divisions.
Boeing's actions underscored the biggest question of the day in the industry: How soon and how deep will bigger cuts come? 
For more than a year, the contractors have been pressing President Obama and the House Republicans to reach a deal to forestall $500 billion in additional military spending cuts set to start in early January.
With Mr. Obama's re-election, that issue will flare up over the next few weeks in the lame-duck Congress. Political leaders will search for ways to avert or delay the cuts while talks get under way again on a broader deficit-reduction package.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney had both promised to stop the spending cuts, and it would presumably have been easier for Mr. Romney to work that out with House Republicans than it will be for Mr. Obama.
But most military analysts say they believe that a deal will be reached that at least delays the cuts -- which would automatically lop off 10 percent of the money for nearly every weapons program -- because neither party wants to see them happen.
''I do expect a sausagelike budget deal where the really tough parts get deferred and the sequester mechanism is deferred or altered,'' said Gordon Adams, a professor of international relations at American University, who helped oversee military budgets in the Clinton White House.
But, he and other analysts said, the military budget is still likely to decline significantly in the next decade, as the war in Afghanistan ends and the military is required to share in reducing the $16 trillion debt.
Tom Captain, the United States aerospace and defense leader for Deloitte, the accounting firm, said perhaps $250 billion in military cuts could come as part of a bargain to reduce the deficit.
Mr. Adams added that in previous military drawdowns, like the one after the cold war, the Pentagon budget declined gradually in a steplike fashion, with the cuts becoming deeper than initially expected as policy makers re-evaluated the situation in preparing each year's budget.
He said he could see the current deficit-reduction efforts leading to cuts of at least 15 percent, and possibly as high as 30 percent, by the end of the decade.
The Pentagon's base budget, which soared after the 2001 terrorist attacks, has already declined modestly from a peak of about $530 billion in fiscal year 2010. Mr. Obama has proposed canceling plans for $487 billion in spending increases over the next 10 years. His plan would limit the growth in military spending to about the rate of inflation over that time.
Mr. Captain said that the biggest military contractors -- including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman -- all recognized that more cuts were inevitable and had been paring back, even though Mr. Romney had said he would sharply increase military spending. Mr. Captain said those companies and their vast networks of smaller suppliers had cut 55,000 jobs over the last two years to reduce costs.
Boeing's military unit said that it had been planning its newest cost-cutting effort for some time and that it would have made the same changes even if Mr. Romney had won. Given the reductions that started in 2010, the unit has cut nearly 30 percent of its executives and plans to reduce the number of middle managers. But the company has been able to reduce the impact of some of the cuts by transferring military workers to its thriving commercial aircraft business, a spokesman, Todd Blecher, said.
The big companies have been looking to increase foreign sales to offset the Pentagon cuts. But with other nations facing their own budget problems, Mr. Captain said, Deloitte has found that total revenue for military contractors across the globe declined by 3.3 percent last year and another 1 percent in the first six months of 2012.
So even with large weapons sales to countries like India and Brazil, he said, ''all of that is not going to make up for the difference.'' CHRISTOPHER DREW

HEADLINE: As Electorate Changes, Fresh Worry for G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Allison Kopicki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A couple of decades ago, Prince William County was one of the mostly white, somewhat rural, far-flung suburbs where Republican candidates went to accumulate the votes to win elections in Virginia.
Since then, Prince William has been transformed. Open tracts have given way to town houses and gated developments, as the county -- about a half-hour south of Washington -- has risen to have the seventh-highest household income in the country and has become the first county in Virginia where minorities make up more than half the population.
If Prince William looks like the future of the country, Democrats have so far developed a much more successful strategy of appealing to that future. On Tuesday, President Obama beat Mitt Romney by almost 15 percentage points in Prince William, nearly doubling George W. Bush's margin over Al Gore in 2000, helping Mr. Obama to a surprisingly large victory in Virginia. 
He did it not only by winning Hispanic voters, but also by winning strong majorities of the growing number of Asian-American voters and of voters under age 40. A version of his coalition in Virginia -- a combination of minorities, women and younger adults -- also helped Mr. Obama win Colorado, Nevada and perhaps Florida, which remained too close to call. He came close in North Carolina, a reliable state for Republican presidential nominees only a few years ago that he narrowly won in 2008.
The demographic changes in the American electorate have come with striking speed and have left many Republicans, who have not won as many electoral votes as Mr. Obama did on Tuesday in 24 years, concerned about their future. The Republicans' Southern strategy, of appealing mostly to white voters, appears to have run into a demographic wall.
''Before, we thought it was an important issue, improving demographically,'' said Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. ''Now, we know it's an essential issue. You have to ignore reality not to deal with this issue.''
The central problem for Republicans is that the Democrats' biggest constituencies are growing. Asian-Americans, for example, made up 3 percent of the electorate, up from 2 percent in 2008, and went for Mr. Obama by about 47 percentage points. Republicans increasingly rely on older white voters. And contrary to much conventional wisdom, voters do not necessarily grow more conservative as they age; until the last decade, a majority of both younger and older voters both tended to go to the winner of the presidential election.
This year, Mr. Obama managed to win a second term despite winning only 39 percent of white voters and 44 percent of voters older than 65, according to exit polls not yet finalized conducted by Edison Research. White men made up only about one-quarter of Mr. Obama's voters. In the House of Representatives next year, for the first time, white men will make up less than half of the Democratic caucus.
The Republican Party ''needs messages and policies that appeal to a broader audience,'' said Mark McKinnon, a former strategist for George W. Bush. ''This election proved that trying to expand a shrinking base ain't going to cut it. It's time to put some compassion back in conservatism. The party needs more tolerance, more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.''
Nothing in politics is permanent, and Republicans may soon find ways to appeal to minorities and younger voters. As Hispanic and Asian voters continue to move up the income scale, for example, more of them may turn skeptical about Democratic calls to raise taxes on the affluent.
And the Democrats may yet confront their own demographic challenges once they no longer have Mr. Obama and his billion-dollar campaign machine at the top of the ticket, guaranteeing record-breaking turnout among his new Democratic coalition. If turnout among blacks, Hispanics and younger voters -- groups that have historically had comparatively low turnout rates -- had declined slightly, Mr. Obama might have lost.
But the immediate question for Republicans, people in the party say, is how to improve their image with voters they are already losing in large numbers.
''You don't have to sell out on the issues and suddenly take on the Democratic position on taxes to win the black vote or the Latino vote or the women vote,'' said Corey Stewart, a Republican who is chairman of the Board of County Supervisors in Prince William. ''But you do have to modulate your tone.''
Mr. Stewart, who is running for lieutenant governor next year, drew some criticism in 2007 by pushing for local crackdowns by the police on illegal immigrants. That has cost him support among many Hispanic voters in the county, but he says it helped him politically among blacks who felt threatened economically by the surge of newcomers.
''The changes are stark,'' he said. ''The minority population is increasing, and the white population is stagnant.''
Mr. Stewart said he had spent much time in the county's minority areas and contrasted his political success with the failure of Mr. Romney, whose only planned visit to Prince William was in the western town of Haymarket, a wealthy, white part of the county.
''He did not go into the minority areas,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''They didn't go into the areas where they didn't feel comfortable. They tended to go to areas where they already had their votes, in heavily white areas.''
In Prince William, as elsewhere, the biggest challenge for Republicans may be among Hispanic voters, given their numbers. Mr. Obama's victories in Colorado, Nevada and Virginia came in part because Hispanics turned out in droves and voted Democratic. In Colorado, 14 percent of the voters were Hispanic, and Mr. Obama won three-fourths of them. In Florida, Hispanic voters were almost one-fifth of the electorate, and Mr. Obama won about three-fifths of them.
Mr. Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a loyal supporter of Mr. Romney's, says his party would never earn their support until it found a new to address of illegal immigration.
''We need to check off that box; we need to get immigration reform done in 2013,'' he said. ''We need to show that Republicans are willing to sit at the table and reach a compromise that is in keeping with what the Hispanic community wants and needs.''
Even that issue brings risks, though, because any immigration bill that passed in 2013 would be signed by and associated with a Democratic president. The harder challenge for Republicans will be developing proposals that minority and younger voters associate with the party -- and support.
In Prince William, the Hispanic population tripled from 2000 to 2010, much of it along the Route 1 corridor in Dale City. But Tom Davis, who used to represent Dale City as a Republican member of Congress, said that the problem for his former colleagues goes beyond just Hispanic outreach.
The party's coalition is contracting, not expanding, he says. It has to find a way to broaden its reach, in part by finding more minority and female candidates to run under the Republican banner, Mr. Davis argues. And he said the outreach had to be real: ''It's not just putting them into the photo-ops at the convention.''
Republicans like Mr. Davis -- and some inside Mr. Romney's campaign -- are quick to point out that the election this week was close, not a blowout. Mr. Davis said that it was ''not time to panic'' for Republicans. But he said Republicans must be honest with themselves about the future.
''It is time to sit down practically and say where are we going to add pieces to our coalition,'' he said. ''There just are not enough middle-aged white guys that we can scrape together to win. There's just not enough of them.''

HEADLINE: Renewable Energy Gains Some Steam

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Some of the sharpest disagreements between President Obama and Mitt Romney during the campaign were over energy policy, and the president's re-election could be viewed as a defeat for the coal industry and a win for renewable energy, with a murkier outlook for oil and gas drillers.
In his first term, Mr. Obama imposed tighter air pollution regulations on power plants, provided tens of billions of dollars in loans and other federal support for renewable power and negotiated higher fuel economy standards with the auto industry -- all attempts to reduce the country's dependence on the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels and to mitigate their impact on the global climate. 
Mr. Romney made energy a central part of his economic platform. He promised to create hundreds of thousands of jobs by promoting oil and gas drilling on federal lands, to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to bring more oil from Canada and to reverse what he called burdensome regulations on the coal industry. Oil and coal companies were generous in their donations to Republican candidates and Republican-leaning ''super PACs.''
But in the end, Mr. Obama carried both Ohio and Virginia, the two coal-producing swing states. Analysts say that a second Obama administration is likely to continue restrictions on mountaintop mining and to press forward with regulations that effectively block new coal-fired generation plants. Stock in coal mining companies fell sharply in Wednesday trading.
For oil and gas companies, the future is less clear. Mr. Obama has repeatedly criticized the roughly $4 billion of tax credits and deductions that oil and gas producers receive annually, and the government is under intense pressure to reduce the budget deficit.
''We will see President Obama once again call for higher taxes on the oil and gas industry, to remove some of the deductions and exemptions,'' said Bernard L. Weinstein, an economist at the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ''It may be part of the grand bargain to get us over the fiscal cliff.''
But during the campaign, Mr. Obama also promoted an ''all of the above'' energy strategy and praised the oil and gas drilling frenzy in shale fields across the country over the last four years. He made no suggestion that he would increase regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technique embraced by the oil and gas industry that some people believe contaminates water supplies. And he reiterated his commitment to seeking greater independence from foreign oil, even as he has supported more offshore drilling in places like Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
Mr. Obama's re-election casts some doubt over the approval of the extension of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Environmentalists oppose the pipeline, arguing that refining and burning oil from Canada's oil sands contributes to climate change.
Mr. Obama delayed approval of the pipeline during his first term, but many Democrats and oil experts predict he will now go along with it because the pipeline builder, TransCanada, has modified its route around an aquifer in Nebraska.
Administration officials have also pledged to continue promoting solar, wind and other renewable power sources. An early test will be the debate over renewing the production tax credit for the wind industry, which expires at the end of the year.
The biggest change in Washington for energy policy may be the probable replacement of the retiring Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a Democrat friendly to oil interests, with Senator Ron Wyden, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Mr. Wyden has been more critical than Mr. Bingaman of fossil fuels and nuclear power, and he is considered a stronger backer of renewable fuels, in part because Oregon relies on wind and hydroelectric power for its electricity. CLIFFORD KRAUSS

HEADLINE: Weighing Sea Barriers as Protection for New York City

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
As the storm chugged toward the Eastern Seaboard at 3 p.m. on Oct. 27, an engineering crew in Stamford, Conn., was at the ready. It was time.
With the click of a computer mouse, machinery on the seafloor groaned into action and a gate was slowly pulled from the deep, locking into place high above the surge from Long Island Sound.
Two days later, when storm waters from Hurricane Sandy ripped through the East Coast, much of Stamford, a city of 124,000, sat securely behind a 17-foot-high barrier that easily blocked an 11-foot surge.
The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the two-mile-long barrier system, completed in 1969, helped prevent about $25 million in damage to businesses and homes. The protected area encompasses about 600 acres, including downtown Stamford. 
Stamford's mayor, Michael A. Pavia, said: ''It was extremely effective in protecting areas that would have been flooded completely by this storm. It made all the difference in the world.''
The technology of movable sea barriers, from Stamford's modest flap gate to London's mighty 10-gate system in the River Thames, has long intrigued engineers and planners contemplating a solution for low-lying areas of New York City. The notion is that such a system could one day block surges from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor.
Now, in the aftermath of the devastating storm, one question is front and center: Should New York armor itself with steel and concrete at a cost of billions of dollars?
Experts whose barrier designs and studies from a conference in 2009 were issued on Monday in book form argue that anything short of sea gates would be a ''Band-Aid'' approach.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has expressed wariness about the barrier proposal, saying he is not sure the gates would work well enough. Yet, it is clear that his administration's view is evolving.
Jeroen Aerts, a researcher with the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands who was hired by New York in 2009 to assess flood risks and protections, said officials initially preferred to focus on cheaper and less-intrusive options like flood-proofing buildings and expanding wetlands to absorb more water.
The assumption, he said, was that unlike New Orleans, New York City is far enough above sea level and skilled enough at evacuations that it could prevent a major loss of lives.
The turning point was Tropical Storm Irene, which in August 2011 mostly skirted the city but pummeled other coastal areas in the region. After that storm, the mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability asked Dr. Aerts, a geographer and an expert on water risk management and climate, to compare the costs and benefits of barriers with those of smaller-scale changes like building levees around sewage treatment plants and elevating subway stations.
Dr. Aerts, who is expected to present a draft of his findings in January, estimates that any barrier system would cost $10 billion to $17 billion. New York would need $10 billion to $12 billion more to shore up the areas on the sides of the barriers, he added. Still, he said, the city should consider building the barriers.
Brian A. Colle, a professor of atmospheric science who is part of the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook University, contends that barriers would have made a big difference when the storm pounded the area last week.
He said that if gates had been placed in strategic spots like the Arthur Kill, between Staten Island and New Jersey, they would have protected some of the areas that were swamped by floodwaters, including the edges of Lower Manhattan, low-lying areas of Brooklyn and Queens and the western part of Staten Island, as well as Jersey City and Hoboken, N.J.
''The idea is that you raise these barriers, and anywhere inside of that you're basically protected,'' Dr. Colle said, adding, ''With a solid barrier, we basically can have business as usual in Lower Manhattan.''
But vexing questions remain. Would industries tolerate immense disruption from the construction of barriers in the city's busy waterways? Would residents object to the marring of vistas? With climate change advancing, can scientists accurately predict the size of hurricanes that the sea gates would one day have to withstand?
And where would the $10 billion-plus in construction money come from? Even a study -- taking into account the complexity of New York waterways, projections in the rise in sea levels and other factors -- would take years and millions of dollars.
The scientists and engineers who have worked on conceptual designs for the city say a comprehensive study is needed on what would be the most effective locations and the most practical type of barriers -- whether they swing close like a driveway gate or pivot up from the ocean floor, for example.
A feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers, which would have jurisdiction, would require authorization from Congress.
''A lot of things need to be taken into consideration before we throw up a giant wall,'' said Chris Gardner, a spokesman for the corps.
Beyond the enormous potential cost, there is no question that there are drawbacks to sea barriers. A barrier that blocks the surge on one side would cause water levels on the other to rise close to a foot, Dr. Colle said, potentially worsening flooding in other areas.
''You could have about 20 percent more water on the other side of the barrier,'' he said.
Furthermore, pollution from the runoff of storm water mixed with sewage would be trapped behind a barrier, with nowhere to go while the sea gate is closed.
There is also considerable concern about the environmental costs of disrupting tidal flows and salinity for fish and other aquatic life by building permanent infrastructure in New York Harbor and in the metropolitan area's rivers.
''The harbor, the Hudson, the Hackensack and Raritan Rivers, Arthur Kill all have thriving ecosystems that benefit us economically and in terms of recreation,'' said Paul Gallay, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper. ''We understand everything needs to be on the table dealing with the new normal, but storm surge barriers may end up doing more harm than good.''
In Stamford, where a barrier was built at a cost of $14.5 million, it took experience with deadly hurricanes to make the investment. It has been used hundreds of times for storms and high tides.
The storm last week, some skeptics argue, was not bad enough for barriers to become part of the preventive mix in New York.
''People won't accept these dramatic changes to the environment,'' said Philip Orton, a storm surge research scientist with the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. ''I don't think we've had our big disaster where hundreds of people die to make this palatable. But it certainly will change the debate.''

HEADLINE: Europe Foresees Weak Recovery Next Year

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union will experience only a very weak economic recovery next year and unemployment will remain at ''very high'' levels, according to a gloomy set of forecasts issued Wednesday by the European Commission.
The forecasts, combined with European business's general disappointment about the outcome of the presidential election in the United States, helped send stocks lower on the Continent and in London on Wednesday -- a downward drift that carried over to Wall Street. 
Gross domestic product will shrink 0.3 percent for the 27 members of the European Union as a whole this year, and 0.4 percent for the 17 members in the euro zone, the commission predicted. Growth in 2013 will be 0.4 percent across the European Union and 0.1 percent in the euro area, it said.
The figures represent a significant downgrade of expectations. In its spring economic forecast, the commission had predicted G.D.P. in the euro zone would shrink 0.3 percent this year before rebounding to growth of 1 percent next year. The spring forecast had also said growth in the European Union as a whole would remain flat this year but then rise to 1.3 percent in 2013.
Now, the commission predicts Europe will have to wait more than a year to generate ''a stronger and more evenly distributed expansion.'' It forecast growth for 2014 of 1.6 percent across the European Union and of 1.4 percent in the euro area.
Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner, sought to put a positive spin on the figures, saying they showed ''a gradual improvement in Europe's growth outlook from early next year.'' He also highlighted that ''market stress has been reduced'' since leaders began to overhaul the institutions running the euro and since the European Central Bank pledged to shore up vulnerable economies.
But Mr. Rehn acknowledged that Europe was going through a ''difficult process of macroeconomic rebalancing, which will still last for some time.'' And he highlighted a need to ''bring unemployment down from the current unacceptably high levels.''
Unemployment will peak next year at slightly below 11 percent across the European Union and at 12 percent in the euro area, according to the commission.
James Nixon, chief European economist in London for Société Générale, said the figures probably overestimated growth prospects. ''It's going to be a tough couple of years,'' he said.
In its report, the commission attributed the grim outlook in part to a ''weak starting point'' in 2012, including the likely worsening of the government debt crisis in countries like Spain during the first half of the year, which fed concerns about the viability of the euro and added to stresses in the banking sector.
''It is quite a pessimistic conclusion on Spain, which suggests that they are going to miss deficit targets by a distance,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''I think the implication of that is that we are likely to see more austerity next year, and that means that the growth outlook will be worse than predicted.
''The countries of Southern Europe are engaging in multiyear adjustment programs,'' he said. ''It is unrealistic to expect Spain and Italy to exit these programs before 2015.''
The report also underlined the hazard the European Union faces from devastatingly high unemployment, which could ''bring social hardship and a destruction of human capital detrimental to longer-term growth.''
Specific country targets reported by the commission included the following:
¶ Spain: G.D.P. shrinkage of 1.4 percent this year and next before returning to growth of 0.8 percent in 2014.
¶ Greece: a contraction of 6 percent this year and of 4.2 percent in 2013, before returning to growth of 0.6 percent in 2014.
¶ Germany: growth in the bloc's biggest economy of 0.8 percent this year and next, and of 2 percent in 2014.
¶ France: growth of 0.2 percent this year, 0.4 percent in 2013 and 1.2 percent in 2014.

HEADLINE: Obama Victory Fails to Thrill European Business

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- European citizens and political leaders welcomed President Barack Obama's re-election Wednesday. European money was less enthusiastic.
Many business executives and investors in Europe, like their counterparts in the United States, would have welcomed a president who was one of their own. They had more faith in Mitt Romney to steer the U.S. economy, by far the biggest market for European exports.
''The business community was clearly in favor of Romney, that's no secret,'' said Fred B. Irwin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany. ''The business community felt that the Obama administration ignored them.''
European stock markets initially showed little reaction to Mr. Obama's re-election Wednesday morning, then followed U.S. stocks down later in the day. The implication was that investors were unsure whether a second term for the president would bring growth that European companies, as well as U.S. firms with operations on the Continent, urgently need to help offset the dismal economy in the euro zone. 
Newly pessimistic forecasts on the region's economy from the European Commission on Wednesday added to the gloom.
Many Europeans, who never quite seemed to understand that Mr. Obama could lose his bid for re-election, on Wednesday looked for more explicit American support for economic growth and took heart in the victory of a center-left president who favors activist government and a social safety net for all citizens.
In general, European experts expressed the hope that Mr. Obama would now, in a second term, deliver on the promises of his first campaign -- a commitment to multilateralism and talks over the use of force, a negotiated deal with Iran, a better relationship with Russia and a major push for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, all issues of great concern to Europe.
And even in business circles there was, to be sure, relief Wednesday that American leaders had the election behind them and could now concentrate on urgent policy issues, particularly the looming ''fiscal cliff'' in Washington and the risk of a sudden drop in U.S. government spending. That would be an issue for companies like Siemens, the electronics and engineering company based in Munich that is a big supplier to the U.S. government.
But, based on Mr. Obama's first term, there was pessimism that he would put much priority on Europe or push forward economic projects that European businesses hold dear, like a trade agreement with the United States that would eliminate import and export tariffs, and unify regulatory approval for drugs and other products wherever possible.
Congratulations for Mr. Obama from European leaders often came wrapped around a plea for more attention to commercial ties between the two regions. ''We must continue to remove unnecessary barriers to trans-Atlantic trade and investment,'' Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, said in a statement Wednesday.
But many simply expressed relief that in a time of economic crisis, there would be a continuity of American personnel and general lines of policy, in order to avoid the confusion and months-long delays that result before any new president takes office and finally gets his cabinet confirmed.
''It feels different this time,'' said Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. ''There's not much enthusiasm in Europe but there is quite an expectation that he will do what he promised to do, and what we expected him to do in the first term. The expectation now is that this time he will act for his legacy, not for re-election.''
Europe's interest in a U.S. recovery was underlined Wednesday by new economic data. The European Commission forecast that the European Union would just barely crawl out of recession next year, while unemployment would remain high. In Germany, which has the largest economy in Europe, industrial production fell 1.8 percent in September from a month earlier, according to figures released Wednesday.
A sparkling U.S. economy would not solve Europe's deep structural and political problems, but it would help bolster demand for products ranging from Mercedes-Benz cars to Greek olive oil.
Despite the rise of China as a trading partner, the U.S. remains by far the biggest customer for European exports. Americans bought goods worth &#x20ac;172 billion, or $219 billion, from January through July, according to the most recent data from Eurostat, the E.U. statistics office.
Though many European business leaders felt affinity to Mr. Romney, there is little of the bitter animosity toward Mr. Obama found among U.S. conservatives. Indeed, Mr. Obama might find it easier to broker compromises with conservatives in Brussels than he does in Washington.
Martin Callanan, chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament, said he had supported Mitt Romney, but added in a statement, ''Our group has been pleased to enjoy a productive relationship with the first Obama administration and we look forward to working closely with the new administration in the interests of strengthening our many common interests.''
European economists are especially nervous about Washington's so-called fiscal cliff -- the automatic tax increases and huge spending cuts that could kick in early next year unless Mr. Obama reaches a compromise with Republicans in Congress.
Wolfgang Franz, who heads the German government's economic advisory panel known as the Wise Men, said he would urge Mr. Obama to start work immediately on reaching an agreement with Congress, warning that the consequences would have repercussions for economies across the globe.
''It is a question of whether the Democrats and Republics can reach a compromise,'' Mr. Franz said at a press conference in Berlin Wednesday. ''I am personally rather optimistic, as the Americans have always succeeded in finding a solution, even if it has been down to the wire.''
In Berlin and other capitals, there is considerable frustration about deadlock in Washington at the same time that the United States has criticized the way Europeans have handled their debt crisis. Mr. Obama has rarely visited Europe, but Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has been very active behind the scenes.
The attention was not always appreciated. Among German officials, there were complaints that Mr. Geithner's calls for less budget austerity were just designed to hold the euro zone together until the American election day to avoid a crisis that could hurt the U.S. economy and Mr. Obama's chances.
''But we've gotten used to Obama,'' said Mr. Perthes of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, ''gets on with Geithner now, and everyone is used to Obama,'' Mr. Perthes said. ''And since the euro crisis appears to be moving toward a resolution, continuity is good.''
Mr. Geithner's kibitzing was more appreciated in France, which also has argued for less austerity.
''It is true that this isn't an administration that has Europe foremost at heart'' because it has other concerns, Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, said Wednesday on RTL radio. ''Nonetheless,'' he added, the Americans ''have been of great assistance in addressing the euro zone crisis, and also in desiring a better balance between austerity and growth.''
Mr. Geithner has signaled he will not remain during the president's second term. European leaders and business executives are hoping his successor will be more sympathetic to their interests.
''I would like to see someone who has a reputation and good business experience,'' said Mr. Irwin of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.
Whether Mr. Romney would have moved any more quickly is questionable. Mr. Romney's low popularity among European citizens, as shown by numerous opinion polls, could have been a problem for U.S. companies operating on the Continent if his presidency had led to a surge in anti-American sentiment, as was occasionally seen when George W. Bush was president. Europeans were also uneasy with Mr. Romney's bellicose rhetoric on Russia, Iran and China.
During the campaign, moreover, Mr. Romney painted Europe as a land of decadent socialists, and warned during the first debate with Mr. Obama that America's fiscal cliff threatened to transform the United States into Spain. That remark irked even some Spaniards who sympathized with Mr. Romney's views.
Xavi Cañigueral, a 27 year-old political adviser in Barcelona's city hall and a member of the conservative People's Party, said he preferred Mr. Romney because of his commitment to less government intervention.
Yet Mr. Cañigueral said Mr. Romney's critique of Spain annoyed him even if it was true. And he said Mr. Romney's statements on foreign policy had made him nervous. ''Obama is more moderate,'' Mr. Cañigueral said. With him as president, ''there is a better chance of countries getting along.''

HEADLINE: Back to Work: Obama Greeted by Looming Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and PETER BAKER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Newly re-elected, President Obama moved quickly on Wednesday to open negotiations with Congressional Republican leaders over the main unfinished business of his term -- a major deficit-reduction deal to avert a looming fiscal crisis -- as he began preparing for a second term that will include significant cabinet changes.
Mr. Obama, while still at home in Chicago at midday, called Speaker John A. Boehner in what was described as a brief and cordial exchange on the need to reach some budget compromise in the lame-duck session of Congress starting next week. Later at the Capitol, Mr. Boehner publicly responded before assembled reporters with his most explicit and conciliatory offer to date on Republicans' willingness to raise tax revenues, but not top rates, together with a spending cut package.
''Mr. President, this is your moment,'' said Mr. Boehner, a day after Congressional Republicans suffered election losses but kept their House majority. ''We're ready to be led -- not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We want you to lead, not as a liberal or a conservative, but as president of the United States of America.'' 
His statement came a few hours after Senator Harry Reid, leader of a Democratic Senate majority that made unexpected gains, extended his own olive branch to the opposition. While saying that Democrats would not be pushed around, Mr. Reid, a former boxer, added, ''It's better to dance than to fight.''
Both men's remarks followed Mr. Obama's own overture in his victory speech after midnight on Wednesday. ''In the coming weeks and months,'' he said, ''I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together: reducing our deficit, reforming our tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.''
After his speech, Mr. Obama tried to call both Mr. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, but was told they were asleep. The efforts from both sides, after a long and exhausting campaign, suggested the urgency of acting in the few weeks before roughly $700 billion in automatic tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts take effect at year's end -- the ''fiscal cliff.'' A failure to reach agreement could arrest the economic recovery.
Corporate America and financial markets for months have been dreading the prospect of a partisan impasse. Stocks fell on Wednesday, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index closing down 2.4 percent. The reasons for the drop were unclear, given that stock futures did not drop significantly on Tuesday night as the election results became clear. Analysts cited fears about the economic impact of such big federal spending cuts and tax increases, but also about new economic troubles in Europe.
While Mr. Obama enters the next fray with heightened leverage, both sides agree, the coming negotiations hold big risks for both parties and for the president's ability to pursue other priorities in a new term, like investments in education and research, and an overhaul of immigration law.
The president flew back to Washington from Chicago late on Wednesday, his post-election relief reflected in a playful race up the steps of Air Force One with his younger daughter, Sasha. At the White House, he prepared to shake up his staff to help him tackle daunting economic and international challenges. He will study lists of candidates for various positions that a senior adviser, Pete Rouse, assembled in recent weeks as Mr. Obama crisscrossed the country campaigning.
The most prominent members of his cabinet will leave soon. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner long ago said they would depart after the first term, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, previously the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, has signaled that he wants to return to California in the coming year. Also expected to depart is David Plouffe, one of the president's closest confidants.
Mr. Obama is expected to reshuffle both his inner circle and his economic team as he accommodates the changes. For example, Jacob J. Lew, Mr. Obama's current White House chief of staff and former budget director, is said to be a prime candidate to become Treasury secretary. For the foreseeable future, the holder of that job is likely to be at the center of budget negotiations, and Mr. Lew has experience in such bargaining dating to his work as a senior adviser to Congressional Democrats 30 years ago in bipartisan talks with President Ronald Reagan.
''They've been thinking about this for some time and they're going to have a lot of positions to fill at the highest levels,'' said former Senator Tom Daschle, who has close ties to the White House.
Both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush ended up replacing about half of their cabinet members between terms, and Mr. Obama could end up doing about the same, especially since his team has served through wars and economic crisis. John D. Podesta, a chief of staff for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama's transition adviser, said, ''There's a certain amount of new energy you want to inject into any team.''
There is talk about bringing in Republicans and business executives to help rebuild bridges to both camps. The one Republican in the cabinet now, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, has said he will leave. One possible candidate, advisers say, could be Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican moderate from Maine who is retiring.
A front-runner for secretary of state appears to be Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Democrats said worries about losing his Senate seat to the Republicans in a special election had diminished with Tuesday's victories. Another candidate has been Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, but she has been a target of Republicans since she provided the administration's initial accounts, which proved to be wrong, of the September terrorist attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.
While no one in the White House blames her, ''she's crippled,'' said one adviser who asked not to be named discussing personnel matters. Another possible candidate, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, has told Mr. Obama he wants to stay in his current position, according to a White House official.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., once expected to leave, now seems more likely to stay for a while. Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, would like to be attorney general and is widely respected in the White House.
Among other cabinet officers who may leave are Ron Kirk, the trade representative; Steven Chu, the energy secretary; Ken Salazar, the interior secretary; Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, and Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency chief. But Valerie Jarrett, the president's longtime friend and senior adviser, plans to stay, according to Democrats close to her.
It may be weeks before Mr. Obama starts making personnel announcements. His first priority is policy, and its politics -- positioning for the budget showdown in the lame-duck session, to try to avoid the fiscal cliff by agreeing with Republicans to alternative deficit-reduction measures.
If Mr. Obama got a mandate for anything after a campaign in which he was vague on second-term prescriptions, he can and will claim one for his argument that wealthy Americans like himself and his vanquished Republican rival, Mitt Romney, should pay higher income taxes. That stance was a staple of Mr. Obama's campaign stump speeches for more than a year. And most voters, in surveys of those leaving the polls on Tuesday, agreed with him.
Specifically, Mr. Obama has called -- over Republicans' objections -- for extending the Bush-era income tax cuts, which expire Dec. 31, only for households with taxable income below $250,000 a year.
''This election tells us a lot about the political wisdom of defending tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everything else,'' a senior administration official said early on Wednesday.
But Mr. Boehner, in his public remarks on Wednesday, sought to avoid a White House tax trap that would have Republicans boxed in as defenders of the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.
Speaking for Republicans after a conference call with his Congressional colleagues, Mr. Boehner said he was ready to accept a budget deal that raised federal revenues, but not the top rates on high incomes. And the deal, he said, also would have to overhaul both the tax code and programs like Medicare and Medicaid, whose growth as the population ages is driving projections of unsustainable future debt.
Instead of allowing the top rates to go up, which Republicans say would harm the economy, Mr. Boehner said Washington should end some deductions and loopholes to raise revenues. The economic growth that would result from a significant deficit reduction compromise would bring in additional revenues as well, he said.
Mr. Boehner entered the ornate Capitol room with none of his usual bonhomie, walked to a lectern and spoke in formal tones from two Teleprompters. He then hastened out of the room, ignoring shouted questions.

HEADLINE: Europe's Woes And Worries Over U.S. Plans Rattle Markets

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; James Kanter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A one-two punch of worries about Congressional gridlock on urgent fiscal policies and economic weakness in Europe sent stocks reeling on Wednesday. The major United States indexes fell more than 2 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering its largest daily decline in a year.
The abruptness of the fall seemed to indicate that despite the fact that polls had been indicating for some time that President Obama was likely to win, that expectation was not shared by many financiers.
While the stock market has done well since it bottomed early in Mr. Obama's term, he aroused great hostility among Wall Streeters who opposed his call to increase taxes on high-income Americans and were concerned about increased regulation.
At a conference sponsored late last month by Wall Street's chief lobbying group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an adviser to Mitt Romney was not challenged when he said Mr. Obama had only a one-third chance of winning. 
During the election campaign, it had appeared to some analysts that the market was rooting for Mr. Obama. Share prices generally rose this fall, but they slipped in early October after Mr. Romney showed gains in the polls after his first debate with the president. But the sell-off on Wednesday indicated that some shareholders were worried about what would happen now.
Some industry sectors, like finance and managed care, were particularly hard hit on Wednesday amid worries they would be hurt by tougher regulations and other adverse policies in Mr. Obama's second term. Some also pointed to concerns that taxes on dividends and capital gains were likely to increase, making stocks less attractive.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index recorded its worst performance since June, falling 33.86, or 2.4 percent, to 1,394.53. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 312.95 to 12,932.73. It was the Dow's first close below the 13,000 level since August.
If history is any guide, the one-day loss does not necessarily bode poorly.The stock market has often sold off on the day after Democratic victories in presidential elections, particularly when there had been doubt going into the election over who would win. But the market has tended to perform better under Democratic administrations than Republican ones.
Since 1928, there have been four postelection days when the market did worse than it did this year, with the worst showing coming four years ago, when the index dropped 5.3 percent after Mr. Obama won. It fell 4.6 percent after Truman won in 1948, 4.4 percent after Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and 3.3 percent after he won a third term in 1940. But in each case, stocks rose in the following four years.
By contrast, the market climbed 1.5 percent the day after Roosevelt was re-elected in 1936, but lost value during the next four years. It rose 1.1 percent in 2004, after George W. Bush won a second term, but lost 12 percent the next four years.
Many market strategists expect that the market will remain volatile between now and mid-January. If Congress and the president cannot come up with a plan to cut the deficit, hundreds of billions of dollars in Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire in early 2013 and automatic spending cuts will sharply cut the defense budget and other programs.
The tax increases and spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, could push the economy into recession in 2013, economists say they fear.
A Barclays analyst, Ajay Rajadhyaksha, said the ''the worst outcome for the fiscal cliff negotiations was a status quo election,'' because each party could see the result as a mandate for its own policies. ''Unless one side softens its stance,'' he added, ''the chances of going off the cliff, at least temporarily, are higher'' than markets were prepared for.
But Sherry Cooper, the chief economist of the BMO Financial Group, said she expected a compromise to be reached. ''Obama is in a much stronger negotiating position now,'' she said, adding that she expected a deal that included tax increases and spending cuts.
As share prices fell, Treasury bond prices rose, an indication of a flight to safety. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.64 percent from 1.75 percent the day before. Crude oil tumbled more than 4 percent.
After Mr. Obama's re-election, companies in some sectors, like hospitals and technology, will see a short-term pop, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist with Citi. Other areas, like financial services, and coal and mining, are likely to be hurt, Mr. Levkovich said.
Coal companies were among the worst hit Wednesday. The coal industry is particularly vulnerable to new environmental regulations, as Mr. Obama has in the past pushed for more investments in renewable energy and alternative energy sources that could reduce coal demand in the long-term. Shares of Alpha Natural Resources, a coal giant, were down 12.2 percent to $8.45. Arch Coal was off 12.5 percent to $7.58.
But HCA Holdings, a hospital operator, increased 9.4 percent, to $33.85 a share. As a result of Mr. Obama's victory, Goldman Sachs said it upgraded its rating on HCA to buy from neutral, and raised its price target to $39 from $31. It also raised price targets for Tenet Healthcare and Community Health Systems, although both are still rated neutral.
A major owner of HCA -- and therefore a beneficiary of the price increase -- is Bain Capital, a private equity firm founded by Mr. Romney. Its 20 percent stake in HCA gained $261 million on Wednesday, to $3 billion.
Goldman warned that Humana and other managed care providers could be hurt as health care reform moves forward, especially new rules for health insurers that become effective in 2014. Shares of Humana fell 7.9 percent to $70.16.
Shares of Wall Street firms and big banks were also hard hit. Mr. Romney favored substantially altering the Dodd-Frank financial regulations passed in summer 2010 and easing many regulations, but Mr. Obama supported stricter rules for the financial sector. In addition, one of the industry's fiercest critics, Elizabeth Warren, was elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, unseating her Republican opponent, Scott Brown.
Bank of America fell 7.1 percent to $9.23. Goldman Sachs dropped 6.6 percent to $117.98 and JPMorgan Chase sank 5.6 percent to $40.48.
The declines in finance and coal companies was exacerbated as traders unwound soured bets that these shares might rally in the hope of a victory by Mr. Romney, said Savita Subramanian, head of United States equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
''Some people had bet on these stocks,'' she said. ''This was a reversal of that trade.''

HEADLINE: Compromise or Gridlock?

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; James Kanter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The economy has been showing signs of life lately -- more jobs, a better housing market and a pickup in spending by consumers. Will Washington put a stop to that?
As business leaders, investors and economists shift their focus away from politics to fundamentals after President Obama's re-election, fears are growing that more of the same gridlock in Washington over fiscal policy will slow the economy to a stall in the next few quarters, perhaps even tipping it into recession.
While many executives on Wall Street and in other industries supported the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, many had already factored in the likelihood of Mr. Obama, a Democrat, winning a second term. 
But traders were still unnerved on Wednesday by the continuation of a divided government in Washington and little prospect for compromise.
Some economists warned that another downgrade of the country's credit rating had grown more likely, and a major ratings agency warned that Mr. Obama would get no fiscal honeymoon.
''The bottom line is that this looks like a status quo election,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
''While we have clarity on the players now, we don't have any more clarity on what will happen in terms of the fiscal cliff,'' Mr. Maki said, referring to the package of tax increases and spending cuts set to go into effect early next year if Congress and the president can't reach a deal to reduce the deficit.
''We still have a divided government, and they haven't been able to agree on what to do,'' he added.
Going over the fiscal cliff outright would deal a $650 billion blow to the economy, Mr. Maki estimated, the equivalent of roughly 4 percent of the nation's output.
He envisions a partial compromise, with $200 billion in tax increases and spending cuts. With that, he estimates the annual rate of economic growth will dip to 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2013 from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter. Hitting the full fiscal cliff, he predicts, would lead to a contraction in the first half of next year.
Business leaders on Wednesday acknowledged that relations with Mr. Obama in his first term were sometimes frosty, but reiterated their call for action.
''I don't think there's anything more urgent than dealing with our fiscal crisis,'' said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers in a call with reporters. ''It's already having an impact on our economy.''
Compounding the jitters in the markets, European officials released a report suggesting further deterioration there. The European Union will have a weak recovery during 2013, while unemployment will remain at ''very high'' levels, according to a set of forecasts issued Wednesday by the European Commission.
This year, the gross domestic product will shrink by 0.3 percent for the 27 members of the union as a whole and by 0.4 percent for the 17 countries that use the euro, the commission predicted. Growth in 2013 will be a meager 0.4 percent across the union and only 0.1 percent in the euro area, it said.
That growth, far slower than in the United States, makes it more difficult for debt-burdened European economies to get their financial houses in order.
Nor is the United States expected to come to the rescue. Mr. Obama may be popular in Europe, but there are doubts about whether he will push policies like a free-trade agreement similar to the Nafta arrangement that links Canada, Mexico and the United States.
Just a few hours after Mr. Obama's victory speech in Chicago and Mr. Romney's concession in Boston, Fitch Ratings warned there would be ''no fiscal honeymoon for President Obama.''
While Fitch still has an AAA rating on United States government debt, it lowered its outlook to negative in November 2011, and said Wednesday that failure to avert the fiscal cliff and also raise the country's debt ceiling ''would likely trigger a rating downgrade'' next year.
In 2011, a debt limit standoff pushed Standard & Poor's to lower its credit rating for the United States to AA+ from AAA. That move unsettled markets globally, though the government has been able to continue issuing debt at extremely low rates because of the desirability of Treasuries during turbulent times.
A downgrade of United States debt has become more likely, said Jeremy Lawson, senior United States economist with BNP Paribas. ''The U.S. isn't being pressured by markets to do a deal,'' he said. ''That gives Washington the incentive to push it off.''

HEADLINE: When The Power Came Back, So Did the Crowds

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN, BEE-SHYUAN CHANG, MARY BILLARD, ALEX WILLIAMS, RUTH LA FERLA, LAURA M. HOLSON and JOHN HARNEY

 BODY:
AT 9 p.m. Friday, the Eastern Bloc, a popular gay bar in the East Village, was ready for business. The Beastie Boys' ''(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party)'' blared, and the room was bathed in a red glow.
''The power's on, the ice machine is going, we threw out all the bad fruit,'' said Matt Nasser, the bartender. ''We're cutting fresh ones and the alcohol didn't go bad.''
But not a single customer was yet in sight. Most still seemed to be at home, recovering from Hurricane Sandy by cleaning out their refrigerators and reflexively turning on every light switch and testing every household appliance, just to reassure themselves that power had really returned to Lower Manhattan. 
That would soon change. For four sleepy nights, the bars, restaurants and A-list spots that make downtown Manhattan a party capital went dark. So when the lights flickered back early Friday evening in the East Village, SoHo, Chelsea and elsewhere, bars were open practically within seconds, with patrons partying at the (aptly named) Electric Room at the Dream Downtown hotel past 3 a.m.
They were mindful, of course, that many in the region were still without power, or even homeless, but there was a need to get back as fast as possible to their old routines.
Diners trickled back to their favorite restaurants, TriBeCa and Chelsea residents swapped tales about what it had been like to live in the foreign land of the Upper East Side or Brooklyn, and a wedding went off without a hitch, even though the bridal party didn't know for sure until Saturday morning where the reception for 300 would take place that afternoon.
Around 10:30 p.m., the veteran party promoter Erich Conrad was having a drink with friends at the Bowery Hotel. He stayed there all week in the dark because at least it had cold water, which was more than he could say for his apartment. And as he told it, he'd had a blast.
''It was very 'Downton Abbey,' '' Mr. Conrad said. ''We were kind of sad when the lights went on. It was really nice to be here with people. It was beautiful, and the staff was so nice.''
Matt Misbin, 22, who was sitting at Calliope, a neighborhood restaurant, agreed. ''It was a democratizing experience,'' he said. ''Because no one had power.''
The meatpacking district, which suffered extensive flooding, was devoid of the outer-borough visitors who swarm its cobblestone streets on weekend nights. Most establishments were closed, but life was returning to the Dream Downtown just north on West 16th Street near Ninth Avenue.
By 11 p.m., a small crowd was gathering at the Electric Room, a popular underground club that decided at the last minute to hold a Sandy recovery party. ''With the name, it was just too good -- the irony,'' said Nur Khan, who runs the club.
Mr. Khan, a SoHo resident, said that he had spent the last few days holed up at the Carlyle hotel on the Upper East Side, where fashionable downtowners had camped out and partied during the blackout. It was ''going off every night'' with the ''downtown kids shaking up the stodgy, conservative scene,'' he said. ''But things closed at 12:30. I was itching to get back.''
''The scene up there is hilarious,'' added Sophie Sumner, a model who won ''America's Next Top Model: British Invasion,'' and had arrived early to the party. She, too, had fled to the Carlyle. ''You have the fashion set and then you have the 19-year-old who's Botoxed out of her mind.''
By early morning, a lively crowd had converged, ready to shake off the previous week, even as basic provisions like food were hard to come by. ''I had to ask my roommate if I could have our last can of chicken and bean soup before I came tonight,'' DJ Elle Dee said.
The mood picked up Saturday night. After power was restored to the West Village and the rest of Manhattan, and residents had time to put their apartments in order, night life came roaring back.
Over at the corner of Kenmare and Elizabeth Streets, a parking garage was transformed into a ''Power-On'' party, hosted by the owners of the Smile and Tacombi.
Downtown artists, models in short boots and fashion insiders hiked up three flights of concrete stairs and took over an entire floor of the garage, which had been decorated with a disco ball and dry ice. Chicken, pork and corn tacos were dished out of a VW bus. Vodka and fruity flavors of Red Bull, mezcal shots and beer were served. Everything was free, but the point of the party was to raise money. Donations were taken for storm relief efforts.
By 11 p.m., it was mobbed. The D.J. Roctakon played tracks by Snoop Dogg and Destiny's Child, while single women gushed about the abundance of attractive men. ''It's a dude fest in here,'' one young woman said happily.
For those already taken, the storm had provided plenty of romantic moments. ''My girlfriend wanted to kill me because I wanted to stay, but every night it was just us two: no phones and wine by candlelight,'' said Matt Kliegman, an owner of the Smile, who lives two blocks away.
There were also moments of kindness. ''I couldn't believe the people who stepped up,'' said Dario Wolos, the owner of Tacombi, who also lives nearby and stayed through the power failure. ''One of our staff is from Yonkers and he would go to his local gas station and haul in gallons of gas just so we could get around.''
And life went on, if not resiliently, then with a new lens. Carlos Quirarte, another owner of the Smile, had trained for Sunday's canceled marathon.
''Some of us guys are going to do a run tomorrow anyway, maybe a 20-miler,'' Mr. Quirarte said on Saturday. ''After that, we're going to the Rockaways to help out.''
No Reservations Needed
On Saturday morning about 4:30, Steven Abramowitz, an owner of Cafe Cluny, got a call from an employee who was spending the night inside the West Village restaurant. ''Steven,'' he said, ''the power's back on.''
Roughly three hours later, Judi Wong, another owner, was up at the Fairway market at Broadway and West 74th Street, trying to pull together a limited charcuterie menu for the restaurant's rushed reopening, with Ms. Wong being perhaps a bit too aggressive as she grabbed as much food as she could.
''Judi, these are Upper West Siders. They are going to kill you,'' Ms. Wong said her boyfriend told her as they, in her words, ''hogged the checkout line.''
By around noon, the sunlit dining room on the corner of West Fourth and West 12th Streets began to fill up, mostly it seemed, with regulars, including one couple whom Ms. Wong said had been customers on the day the restaurant opened in 2006. ''It is a special time in a special neighborhood,'' Ms. Wong said. ''We couldn't wait to get open.''
A few blocks away, Kate Todd, who had been without power in her West Village apartment for five days, was impatiently waiting for her favorite restaurant, Perla, to reopen, checking Instagram regularly for updates.
When word emerged Saturday morning that Perla would reopen that evening, Ms. Todd, an account manager for a media company who eats there at least twice a week, contacted three other friends whose power had also been out until that morning. The four agreed to meet at the Minetta Lane restaurant when the doors opened at 6 p.m.
When they got there, the coveted tables were, for a change, open to walk-ins and the four quickly settled in for a welcome meal. (Ms. Todd ordered one of her regular dishes, the roasted duck breast, as well as ''several rounds of our favorite gin cocktail, the 'Yellowjacket Opera.' '')
As patrons started filling the restaurant, ''Bonita Applebum,'' by A Tribe Called Quest, started thundering over the sound system. ''Rebirth music!'' Matt Kebbekus, the restaurant's general manager and a partner, shouted triumphantly.
For two of Ms. Todd's dining companions (Sarah Pierce and Kayla Zemsky, who are roommates in a nearby high-rise) the meal marked a celebratory end to a week of Everest-like climbs up a darkened stairwell to the 28th-floor apartment they share.
For Ms. Todd, a return to Perla felt overdue. After a traumatic week, she wanted to be among friends, and Perla was the closest thing she has to a Cheers. ''I had one of the last meals before Perla closed on Sunday, and one of the first meals when it reopened,'' she said. ''That's what it means to be a regular.''

That Glow of Shopping
There were batteries to replenish, groceries to stock and flashlights to buy. But Saturday morning found Michelle Jank, a fashion consultant who lives in the West Village, engaging in less urgent pursuits at the brightly lighted Uniqlo store on Broadway in SoHo.
''The dark puts everybody in a sullen mood,'' said Ms. Jank, who was about to buy a pair of gloves. ''In this very retail-driven city, shopping reinforces a sense of community. It puts people in very good spirits because they've got some sensory contact again.''
Despite the storm's devastation, guilt and piety were in short supply. No one seriously tried to justify a spree by claiming, as people had in the wake of 9/11, that shopping would somehow energize the economy.
''Shopping isn't necessarily what you want to do right after a storm like this,'' said Edwin Torres, a high school junior from the East Village, as he checked the racks at the rear of the store. ''But it is a stress reliever.''
It provided the retail version of a happy ending for Elana Rosenblatt and Yael Aflalo, who stopped in at Alexander Wang on Grand and Mercer Streets to replenish their winter wardrobes.
While Ms. Aflalo, flipped through racks of striped jersey dresses and leather pants, Ms. Rosenblatt, who was swaddled in a leopard-patterned coat, perched on a sofa, a tiny French bulldog nestled in her lap.
''It's kind of nice to get into the groove of life again,'' said Ms. Rosenblatt, the chief operating officer of Reformation, which sells repurposed vintage clothing. She and Ms. Aflalo, the owner, had been camping at a friend's apartment on the Upper East Side.
''Everyone on the Upper East Side is so chic,'' Ms. Rosenblatt marveled. ''Now all of a sudden Yael wants to buy a Ralph Lauren blazer with elbow patches.''
RUTH LA FERLA
Amid Families and Volvos
Some residents of Lower Manhattan sought refuge in particularly unfamiliar terrain: Brooklyn.
''I didn't move to New York 18 years ago to move to Brooklyn,'' joked Adam Rapoport, the editor in chief of Bon Appétit magazine, who decamped to a friend's home in Fort Greene when he and his family lost power in their Chelsea garden apartment. ''But we have arrived in the land of family and dogs and Volvos.''
Manhattan and Brooklyn have always had an uncomfortable rivalry: Brooklyn with its self-satisfied 20-somethings and literary types; and Manhattan with its smug professionals and establishment class. When Mr. Rapoport returned home, his attitude had softened. ''It was a nice departure,'' he said.
Mr. Rapoport learned, too, that the boroughs had more in common then he initially thought. On Thursday night, he took his hosts, the architect Elizabeth Roberts and her husband, Michael McKnight, to dinner at Roman's, an Italian-inspired restaurant on DeKalb Avenue, as a thank-you.
''The restaurant was packed and it was going to be a two-hour wait,'' Mr. Rapoport said, a hint of awe still in his voice. ''It felt like I was in Manhattan.''
By Saturday, Mr. Rapoport had packed up his family and car, bought some yogurt and eggs at Pioneer supermarket (near Fort Greene) and arrived in Chelsea around noon. With the electricity now on, he said he cleaned out his refrigerator and tidied up the house. He roasted a chicken for dinner, grateful for his friend's generosity, but pleased to be sleeping in his own bed.
''Some of my friends were making fun of me for crossing over,'' Mr. Rapoport said, with a laugh. But, he added later, ''I'm happy to be home.''
LAURA M. HOLSON
A Wedding Story
Jacqueline Polce, who was married to David Stockel at the Church of Ignatius Loyola on Saturday, had her first look at her wedding reception venue, Espace on West 42nd Street, at the same time as most of her guests -- right before the cocktail hour.
''We made it!'' she laughed during a phone interview on Sunday.
The couple's original choice, Capitale on the Bowery, had lost power along with much of Lower Manhattan last week, and as the day of the wedding quickly approached, it was unclear where exactly the reception for 315 would take place.
Seth Greenberg, an owner of Espace and Capitale, said he ''felt terrible'' when it became clear that the Capitale would not be available for the Polce-Stockel reception. But when his operations director told him that the bride was getting married ''no matter what,'' he said he decided to offer an alternative space.
Mrs. Stockel said that the staff, many of whom also worked at Capitale, and the other vendors were so thrilled that she and Mr. Stockel had persevered through one of the worst weeks in modern New York history (the couple lost power in their Chelsea apartment) that they ''went above and beyond.''
''Given the situation, everyone was so excited that we were going on with the wedding,'' she added. ''Our photographer said a lot of weddings had to be canceled.''
The Capitale, housed in an 1895 Roman Revival landmark designed by Stanford White, is back in operation. ''We're up and running,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''I assume this building has survived many a storm.''

HEADLINE: Losing Power But Finding a Way to Connect

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN and JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
WHEN a natural disaster hits, worlds collide. The ways in which Hurricane Sandy upended home life last week ranged from the truly tragic to the curious and unsettling, as neighborhoods literally and metaphorically washed into one another.
New Yorkers, parochially devoted to their neighborhoods and suspicious of others, found themselves in new and exotic parts of the city they previously might have disdained. They marveled at the customs and culture of their new, temporary locales, grateful for the ports they had found in the storm and amazed that so many disparate towns could exist on the same island.
They solved problems with New York ingenuity. (After discovering that her water-filled tub had drained, Susan Hunter, a Greenwich Village graphic designer, used a bottle of white Zinfandel to flush the toilet instead.) Frequent moves were also common. (Hanne Larsen, a single mother of four in TriBeCa who runs the Downtown Dance Factory school, invited a couple with three young children who lived in the evacuation zone in Battery Park City to stay with her, only to move her family into their apartment when hers lost power.)
Family members collided; former spouses took each other in and gritted their teeth. And some New Yorkers learned that a game of bridge could be as sweetly connective as Facebook -- or better, because it came with a piece of rugelach. 
DOES THAT SHELTER HAVE ROBES AND WI-FI?
You might think that if you found yourself without water, electricity or heat, you would be grateful for any warm, well-lighted place, but that was not always the case -- especially for Manhattanites with lovely apartments and a wide circle of generous uptown friends.
''You know that moment in your life when you have to decide who you're going to give the kids to if you die? It was like that,'' said Sybil Adelman, a humorist and mosaic artist. She and her husband, Martin Sage, a comedy writer, had to abandon their large Greenwich Village apartment the day after they lost power. ''All your nearest and dearest friends who say, 'Come and stay with us,' you start sizing them up in ways you never thought about before: 'They're workaholics. They won't have time for me. I'll be in the way,' '' she said. ''Then, when I got over all the picking and choosing, I started being kind of resentful of all the people who didn't invite me: 'Why didn't they invite me? I had them to dinner two years ago.' ''
The couple's savior from the storm? Mr. Sage's sister Annie Passer, who has a rambling three-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, an extremely generous woman who, according to Ms. Adelman, was offering showers and meals to everyone who asked.
''It's like FEMA for Jews,'' Ms. Adelman said last week, after she and her husband had happily moved in. ''She's got whitefish salad, she's got wine in all colors, she's got what to read, she's got clothes, she's got all kinds of shampoos. And she's the most relaxed about it. Looking around, I see two ironing boards and four flat-screen TVs. It's like a hotel.''
AND NO CHILDREN, IF YOU PLEASE
Anya Schiffrin, who teaches at Columbia University, is married to the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and she writes the cheeky Davos Wives blog. She has a three-bedroom, three-bathroom uptown apartment, and so had a stream of guests (or, as she put it, ''competing factions'') during the hurricane. Considering Ms. Schiffrin's excellence as a hostess (''I like my guests to feel happy: I buy organic berries, I put Ambien on the pillow''), one can see why.
''I got friends' children from the West Village, then in-laws from California who were stranded in Newark,'' she said. ''I asked my mom if she would take the overflow. She has three bedrooms on 94th. She said no way, she hates houseguests. So I pawned off some of my overflow to cousins on 75th Street. Meanwhile, the childless couple that got here first said they didn't want any young kids to stay, so they beat out my friend with the toddler who is in the East Village.''
Wait a minute: the guest gets to set terms?
''We operate on a strictly first-come first-serve basis,'' Ms. Schiffrin said.
As of last Thursday, the household included a couple from the West Village and two out-of-town cousins in their late 20s.
''You know how New Yorkers are always so busy?'' Ms. Schiffrin said. ''The upside of this is a lot of togetherness. Yesterday we all put on our pajamas and watched 'The Letter.' The younger generation had never seen a Bette Davis movie. And we ate the Halloween candy the kids didn't get.''
Throughout all of this, there is one thing that has been cracking her up, Ms. Schiffrin said.
''I am getting phone calls and e-mails from all these terrible places where you'd think we'd be worried about them: from Calcutta, Cairo, Jakarta, Uganda,'' she said. ''It was like: 'How are you doing? It looks terrible.' ''
YOUR HURRICANE SOMMELIER SUGGESTS
No doubt the oenophiles among you are wondering why Ms. Hunter, the graphic designer who used white Zinfandel to flush her toilet, chose that particular wine.
''Hate white Zin,'' said Ms. Hunter, whose husband, Jeffrey, a lawyer, supported her choice. ''It was the first to go and was an easy decision. But we had other things in the liquor cabinet that we were considering, some crème de menthe, some hazelnut liqueur. Never would have let the cabernet go down.''
LOVE THE HAIR!
Downtown, in Peter Cooper Village in the East 20s, no one bats an eye when Derrick, a mutt of unknown age and origin with a pink mohawk, goes walking with Karen Moline, a writer. Downtown, with its philosophy of live and let live, champions individuality above all.
Ms. Moline, a longtime Villager, did not want to leave her 10th-floor apartment there when the hurricane was coming, even though it abutted the evacuation zone. She might have stuck it out even after water washed through the complex on Monday night, taking out the power and the heat. But her 11-year-old son, Emmanuel, was deeply rattled by the sight of 23rd Street under water, cars unmoored and floating in the storm surge. Also, carrying Derrick up and down 10 flights of stairs four times a day got old fast.
Ms. Moline's safe (though decidedly cramped) haven was two rooms at the Doubletree Hilton in Times Square with her sister, Jacqueline, her brother-in-law and their twin 7-year-olds, whose Chelsea apartment was also powerless, and her parents, whose high-rise in the East 30s, the ominously named Rivergate, was completely flooded.
The difficulty for Ms. Moline wasn't living with eight people in two small, very expensive rooms. It was the discordance, she said, of being a native New Yorker in ''tourist-town.''
''I don't want to sound churlish,'' said Ms. Moline, grateful for the kindness of her family, who footed the bill for four nights. ''We are very lucky. But it was so weird to be among all these happy tourists in a place where quite literally they never turn the lights off.''
Emmanuel, still shaken by what happened downtown, made himself a tent out of a blanket and slept under a table for four nights. ''He said it made him feel safer,'' Ms. Moline said.
The one member of her family who truly thrived was Derrick, the pink-furred dog. He was happier in the bright, noisy ecosystem, cozying up to tourists who were eager to have their photograph taken with him and delighted to meet a real New Yorker.
AND LO, WHEN GOTHAM IS FLOODED,
DETAIL MEN SHALL MIX WITH HIPSTERS
AND THE UPPER EAST SIDE SHALL BE COOL
Uptown, at the Mark hotel on East 77th Street, dogs and children were favored guests, even those who were refugees from the suburbs. Brad and Sonia Tito were staying with his mother on the Upper East Side, waiting to move into a new house in Yonkers, where Mr. Tito is the city's director of sustainability. The hurricane caused a mortgage hiccup for the family, he said, as the bank wanted to be sure the house was still standing before closing. So their stay with his mother was a lot longer than he had anticipated.
''You try and keep out of the way, use the coasters, be neat,'' said Mr. Tito, 35, adding that he had not lived with his mother since he left for college. ''She was very gracious, but I felt guilty.''
On Friday, he, his wife and their 15-month-old son, Parker, and beagle, Bella, found the lobby at the Mark a nice respite from the closeness of the apartment. As it happens, they weren't alone in seeking solace there. ''We saw Anna Wintour, Kelly Ripa, all these people wearing black, people with spiked hair,'' Mr. Tito said. ''You could tell that something unique was happening, like the Upper East Side was the new downtown.''
Actual downtowners didn't always agree, but they seemed taken aback by how, well, nice it was up there. David Kuhn, a literary agent, and Kevin Thompson, a film production designer, live on West Ninth Street and spent the week at a friend's Park Avenue apartment. Mr. Kuhn noted the contrast between a neighborhood that was designed, as he said, ''for residential bourgeois living, and many downtown neighborhoods, which are actually fake neighborhoods.'' One friend who lives near his hosts uptown told him, ''You know, it's kind of boring, but it's also really relaxing.''
LIKE AN OLD SAD SONG
The angst of the dispossessed and the fear of being a nuisance were common threads among those displaced by the hurricane.
Jonathan Schwartz, the WNYC host, was ''de-craned,'' as he put it, when the crane that was being used in the construction of a luxury building on his block of West 57th Street snapped during high winds, causing the mandatory evacuation of Mr. Schwartz's building.
On Monday, he moved into his daughter's Greenwich Village one-bedroom, and his wife, the actress Zohra Lampert, stayed with a friend in her tiny studio. When the Village lost power, Mr. Schwartz and his daughter moved into the town house where her mother, Mr. Schwartz's ex-wife, the writer Marie Brenner, lives.
''Marie and I are very close friends, and Marie is married to a guy named Ernie Pomerantz,'' said Mr. Schwartz, who speaks in a slow, sonorous voice, and tends to melancholy digression and dramatic pauses. ''We had a very warm-spirited dinner, and afterwards I went up to the fourth floor, which meant I had moved Ernie out of where he works and dislocated everyone, but everyone was comfortable. I came down the next morning and everything was all right.''
Mr. Schwartz then left and went about his business for the day.
The following morning, however, he realized something had changed. ''There was a tension in the air,'' he said. ''And I'm sure this applies to many people.''
Mr. Schwartz said he did the inner monologue of the eager-to-please guest: '' 'I'll wash the dishes, I'll take out the garbage, I'll paint the wall.' And yet, when you come down the second morning, you realize this is over. Even if you are a relative, after a couple of days you become an inconvenience, and you cannot help but see it in your hostess's eyes.''
Mr. Schwartz paused. ''It's hidden away in the iris.'' Another pause. ''There is a certain flag that one sees in the iris, and that flag has a word on it.'' Pause. ''And the word is 'Go.' It's not that anyone is ungenerous, it's just that the mechanism of the house has been disturbed, the needle on the disc of their existence is stuck and is causing a miniature havoc.''
WHEN A HURRICANE SLAMS NEW YORK,
SOFAS SUFFER MOST
Jody Britt is the creative director of Rock Paper Photo, an online photo gallery. Last month, she had just finished decorating her studio apartment on West 75th Street in shades of white and gray. There is a white leather sofa, a soft gray rug and shiny, perfect white walls and bookshelves.
When the storm hit, Ms. Britt used Facebook to invite any displaced New Yorkers to come bunk with her. Her best friend, Jenny Dutko, a sports and entertainment marketer, appeared first. A day later, Brad Taylor and his wife, Leslie Kellner-Taylor, founders of a marketing company, arrived. The Taylors spent the days in Ms. Britt's apartment and her Midtown office, and the nights at their own home downtown. Ms. Dutko slept on the precious sofa.
Ms. Britt said that she was thrilled to have them all, but that she would be lying if she said she wasn't worried about her place.
''When they all arrived, I said something like, 'I'm so excited you're here, but could you take your shoes off?' '' she said. ''And Brad is over 6 feet tall and the sofa is tipping over and I'm telling him he's got to sit in the middle. I'm a single woman. I'm not used to having a man in the apartment. And then they're eating, and there's crumbs.''
By the end of the week, however, bonding had ensued -- so much so that the storm orphans and their host met for a celebratory dinner at Ocean Grill on Columbus Avenue on Friday night.
And the sofa, the paint job and the rug are doing just fine. ''My mother told me to Scotchgard,'' Ms. Britt said.
MAYBE THEY WERE THE GREATEST GENERATION
When the storm hit, Deb Stein and her husband, James Knudson, who live in Long Island City, N.Y., brought her mother, Ruth Stein, and her uncle and aunt, Curt and Gloria Sloan, from their homes in Bethpage, N.Y., to stay with them in their apartment.
Ms. Stein's mother and uncle were refugees from Germany during World War II who were sent to safety in America by their parents. The median age of the guests was 87. And they certainly changed the habits of Ms. Stein, a jewelry designer, and her husband, a lighting designer.
''The old folks are warm and comfortable and making me cook questionable foods they removed from their defrosted refrigerators -- most of which I threw out behind their backs,'' Ms. Stein wrote in an e-mail early in the week.
A few days passed, and she sent another e-mail. ''Great Depression conversation at noon, bridge tournament at 3, dinner at 4:45, bullet to our heads at dawn,'' she wrote jokingly. ''Now they're too warm.''
In fact, she told a reporter later, having her family together like this turned out to be a special experience. Sure, there was but one bathroom for five people, and space was tight: her aunt and uncle were in the bedroom; her mother was on the couch; she and her husband slept on an inflatable bed in the study. But she had gotten to know her relatives in ways she had never done before.
''I think the biggest change was, we sit around telling stories every night,'' Ms. Stein said. ''My aunt said, 'If you learn to play bridge when you're young, you'll never be lonely when you're old.' These people lived through the better parts of the 20th century, they have stories we never heard before and we've had time to be with them, and it's been lovely. My aunt was an Army nurse, my mother told me about coming to this country when she was 12 and she had to sleep on a cot, not knowing whether her parents were ever going to come and get her.''
She added: ''My uncle told me yesterday he was a translator during W.W. II. It had been cold, he said: 'Let me tell you something, Kid, after the Battle of the Bulge, this is nothing.' ''

HEADLINE: Business Owners Tally the Storm Damage and Ponder Its Lessons

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SATALINE

 BODY:
Few small-business owners were prepared for the wrath of Hurricane Sandy.
The storm and its tidal surge ravaged stores and restaurants, soaked inventory and stalled manufacturing throughout the New York region last week.
Food and goods not ruined by seawater and the lack of power fell victim to sewer waste and mold. Even businesses on working power grids lost an important ingredient for success: employees. Many workers faced impossible commutes because of gas shortages and spotty public transportation.
As is often the case, many business owners in the storm's path had not bought insurance beyond standard business protection -- nothing for floodwaters or business interruption. Even a week later, after hauling out sodden goods and trying to reroute shipments and find insurance brokers, some were too overwhelmed to know if their businesses could survive.
''We made a pact that we weren't going to think about it,'' said Kristy Hadeka, co-owner of Brooklyn Slate Company, which sells slate cheese boards and kitchen items. ''If you think about how the situation is, it's so incredibly overwhelming, you don't want to do anything.'' 
Ms. Hadeka, 29, and Sean Tice, 28, her boyfriend and business partner, were weeks from moving their business into a renovated storefront in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, three blocks from New York Harbor. New plumbing and electrical work had been installed, costing them more than $10,000.
They planned to have offices and a small store there, too. It would be a big step for the two-and-half-year-old company, which started in the couple's South Slope apartment and grew to $1.5 million in sales last year, including to big clients like Whole Foods.
All of that -- and $5,000 in merchandise for a holiday market -- was ruined by six feet of oily water. The company did not have flood insurance. Mr. Tice called the agent later to say, ''Add it.''
The storm ''wreaked havoc on the business,'' Ms. Hadeka said. ''We invested a lot of money in this space.''
They were just weeks from the start of the holiday season, when they expected to collect 75 percent of their revenue for the year. Mr. Tice said the company has business-interruption insurance, ''but we haven't stopped operating, so that hasn't been an issue.''
With their 10 employees scattered -- six in the city, the rest in upstate New York, where Ms. Hadeka's family owns the quarry that produces the slate -- the co-owners shouldered most of the work in the days after the storm.
Just getting to the new storefront proved taxing. With public transit suspended, Mr. Tice laced on his jogging shoes and ran the 11-mile round trip. Their New Jersey warehouse was still closed, and dozens of customers called and e-mailed, wondering when they would receive their orders.
With U.P.S. shipments halted, Ms. Hadeka said she had to work with the shipping company to issue new tracking numbers. A big shipment destined for Whole Foods in Massachusetts -- 2,500 cheese boards -- could not be found. After hours of calls, the couple discovered that the boards were on a truck parked in Elizabeth, N.J.
Ms. Hadeka wondered whether retail sales, and gift items in particular, would suffer. ''People are devastated,'' she said. ''We rely so much on people buying cheese boards for Christmas and entertaining.''
But there is little time to dwell on such thoughts. Nor does the business plan to leave a waterfront neighborhood that is filled with young people running small craft businesses. ''We have to keep going,'' Ms. Hadeka said.
When faced with another hurricane warning, Mr. Tice said, ''we'll probably take everything valuable out of there and put it on a higher floor or a storage facility.''
In Sheepshead Bay, in southern Brooklyn, many mom-and-pop businesses were destroyed. A tidal surge flooded the bay and smashed into restaurants and stores at street level. Water gutted Istanbul Restaurant, a 17-year-old enterprise owned by Riza Atas.
The day after the storm, Istanbul's interior looked like a scene from ''Titanic.'' Tables, chairs and settees were toppled. Plaster board and wallpaper hung from walls. No one could enter the kitchen; large industrial refrigerators and stoves had been thrown into the doorway.
Gawkers who entered the restaurant stood not on a floor once made of marble and granite tiles but on shards of wood and dishes. Mr. Atas lost a great deal of meat and fish. Worse, the storm destroyed the photographs, tiles and carpets from his native Turkey that he had lovingly displayed.
''We did not lose a restaurant,'' Mr. Atas said. ''We lose Turkish culture here.''
After the storm, the building's owners sent 25 contractors and helpers to pump water from his basement and to clean, but the basement started filling again. Mr. Atas could not reach his insurance broker on Long Island, where thousands of customers had no power. His kitchen appliances, including the grill and the fryer, were filled with water. And he did not know how he would keep his 10 employees. ''If we get something from the government, we have to help them, too,'' he said.
Mr. Atas said he had not yet decided whether he would reopen. He estimated he would need $200,000 and three months to do so. ''If the government or city helps, we can rebuild,'' he said.
Considering what happened elsewhere in Brooklyn, Carl Manni, chief executive and co-founder of Linda the Bra Lady, said he got ''kind of lucky.'' Although the company headquarters and his home are in Dumbo, along the East River, neither place filled with water, and he did not lose power. But with subways halted, most of his 40 employees could not get to the office or to the company's two Manhattan stores for several days.
Working solo for nearly three days, Mr. Manni said he was forced to let Web orders go unfilled. Several of his vendors' warehouses were damaged badly, which meant the company could not replenish its stock and ship to customers.
In all, Mr. Manni figured the seven-year-old business lost $50,000 last week. ''In a way, that's the same thing as physical damage,'' he said. ''It's really dollars at the end of the day.'' He said the company had business-interruption coverage that began after 72 hours, so he expected to get some money, though he did not know how much.
In the meantime, with the business closed for nearly a week, cash flow has been a struggle. ''We're just not prepared for that,'' he said. ''We don't run with a ton of cash in the bank. I've had to do incredible financial gymnastics to make sure we can pay rent and make our payroll.''
Frustrated by the transit shutdown, Mr. Manni also became creative with transportation. He dispatched the company's delivery van, which is not made for passengers, to pick up employees throughout the city.
By the end of last week, operations were getting back to normal. ''With the online business, people expect that you ship their packages and answer their e-mails,'' he said. ''We just can't stop moving because of Sandy.''
Mr. Manni said he had prepared for the storm ''as much as we could -- and it helped.'' Employees filled all of the vehicles with gas, and plumbers cleaned the storm drains.
''The rest is up to the utilities and government to make sure services don't go offline for too long,'' he said. ''Hopefully, next time this happens, they will have new systems in place to get things back up and running more quickly.'' That, he said, would minimize the economic damage.

HEADLINE: Solar Tariffs Upheld, but May Not Help in U.S.

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
When the United States International Trade Commission decided on Wednesday to uphold tariffs of about 24 to 36 percent on most solar panels imported from China, the case's proponents claimed a major victory. Domestic solar manufacturers said the duties, to be in place for five years, would make up for unfair business practices by Chinese companies that had harmed the domestic market and allow homegrown companies to hire more workers and thrive.
''This basically takes it from being just allegations of illegal activities in this industry to confirmation,'' said Gordon Brinser, the chief executive of SolarWorld Industries America, the lead company that brought the case. ''This was a growing industry just a couple years ago that has been basically decimated by the Chinese manufacturers.'' 
The Commerce Department had imposed the tariffs earlier this year after finding that Chinese solar companies had received unfair subsidies from their government and dumped solar cells below costs.
But whether the duties can help save the American solar industry is a matter of some dispute. Because they apply to panels made of Chinese-produced solar cells, Chinese companies are already avoiding the duties by assembling their panels from cells produced elsewhere, like Taiwan, even if the cell components come from China.
The case is also unlikely to have much effect on the central market dynamic that analysts say is driving companies out of business: oversupply.
About a dozen panel makers in the United States have gone bankrupt or closed factories since the start of last year. ''The economics of today, and supply and demand of today, aren't going to change because of this,'' said Aaron Chew, a renewable energy analyst at the Maxim Group, an investment bank and asset management company. ''I don't think there's actually any direct impact on the U.S. going forward.''
Many Chinese companies have adjusted their supply chains, shipping components to Taiwan or South Korea to be made into cells and then returning them to China or elsewhere for assembly into panels.
Although this has made production about 10 to 15 percent more expensive, China-based global players like Suntech and Yingli can spread that cost over all of their merchandise, not just what gets shipped to the United States, said Shayle Kann, the head of GTM Research, a unit of Greentech Media.
''We're basically nowhere near having fixed the structural problem yet,'' he said, adding that there were about 70 gigawatts worth of global production capacity but only about 30 gigawatts worth of demand. ''There have been a few bankruptcies and a few plant closures and so on, but at this point it's just a drop in the bucket.''
The industry's financial problems may stick around for a while, even as panel prices continue to drop because of the glut. Weak or indebted companies are unlikely to go out of business quickly in China, said Ocean Yuan, the president of Grape Solar, an importer of solar panels in Eugene, Ore. That is because out of the 70 cents a watt in costs for a solar panel, much less than half is for labor, materials, shipping and other variable costs. The rest are fixed costs, mostly interest payments on money borrowed to buy the highly automated Western equipment that does most of the manufacturing.
So as long as companies can cover their variable costs and earn at least some revenue to put toward interest payments, they will continue to operate even at a loss, Mr. Yuan said.
Opponents of the tariffs, which include solar developers and installers who have benefited from the abundance of cheap panels, have argued that the tariffs will actually harm the domestic industry, making it more difficult for American companies to do business abroad.
In 2010, the United States was a net exporter of solar goods to China by $247 million to $540 million (and almost $2 billion globally), according to GTM Research. The trade figures are likely to have changed since GTM's study, but American solar exports would be jeopardized by a trade war, tariff opponents say. The Chinese have already started trade actions aimed at American polysilicon exports as well as at subsidies provided to companies in Canada, Greece and Italy.
''We have more to lose,'' said Tom Gutierrez, chief executive of GT Advanced Technologies, which sells equipment for making components like polysilicon wafers. ''Instead of taking trade tariff actions that are very narrowly defined, you have to consider the unintended consequences.''

HEADLINE: Republicans, Unplugged

 BODY:
We'll leave the Republicans to their discussions in quiet rooms in the hope that at least a few are suggesting throwing out their old and failing playbook, seemingly written by and for a dwindling society of angry white men.
Much can be said about what Mitt Romney's fatal embrace of hard-core positions on immigration did to his share of the Hispanic vote. (It shriveled, to 27 percent, according to exit polls, compared with 44 percent for George W. Bush in 2004.) Mr. Romney could have followed Mr. Bush's moderation and won over many Latinos, but he lurched to the right, pushing xenophobic schemes for ''self-deportation'' and hailing Arizona as a model for immigration reform. 
Some Republicans have been warning one another for years about the stupidity of alienating a fast-growing and influential group of Americans. It's not working. The Hispanic vote went overwhelmingly to Democrats in House and Senate races as well, by roughly the same 75-to-25 split. ''We have to fix our Hispanic problem as quickly as possible,'' said John Weaver, a Republican strategist.
He's right. But the Republicans don't have a Hispanic problem. They have an America problem, a country that is growing more diverse and, on a wide range of issues, shows a sensible moderation and social tolerance far out of step with radio ranting and Tea Party rigidity. It wasn't just Hispanics who heartily rejected Republicans on Tuesday. It also was African-Americans, Asian-Americans, young people and, to perhaps the greatest effect, women.
In exit polls on Tuesday night, two-thirds of voters said undocumented immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Only about one in three said they should be deported. (At the state level, in Maryland, voters overwhelmingly approved giving in-state college tuition rates to young undocumented immigrants.) Six in 10 voters said abortion should be legal. More than 50 percent said they believed the economy favors the wealthy, and most of them supported raising taxes on people making more than $250,000.
For a party that has built itself up on explicit and implied appeals to xenophobia, cultural resentment and income-redistribution for the rich, ideological purity is not a long-term strategy for success.
It is impossible to say how harshly the opaque Mr. Romney would have governed. But he and his party still blindly espouse a rigid theology that worships at the shrine of tax cuts and filibusters. It still includes ideologues whose views on issues like women's health range from retrograde to medieval. Men like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly are willing to say in public what Mr. Romney would say only in private to donors: half of Americans are ''victims'' who feel entitled to health care, food and housing from the government.
This wretched worldview does not apply to all Republicans all the time. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey recently found things to admire in a Democratic president's big-government help in an emergency. But the talk-show host Mark Levin told him to ''shut the hell up.''
If the Republican Party turns away from self-destruction, it should do so for the right reasons. America shouldn't reform immigration because Republicans need to add slices to their shrinking loaf of Wonder Bread. It should fix immigration because the system is broken and unjust and millions of people are suffering. Republicans should embrace family values for all families, gay families, too -- along with protecting reproductive rights and access to health care -- because these are the right things to do for the country we're in, not the country they imagine it to be.

HEADLINE: The 22-Year-Old Retiree

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY -- In the end zone at Rice-Eccles Stadium, the turf below colored a familiar red, Jordan Wynn scanned the expanse of empty bleachers. A sling, a maze of straps and buckles, stabilized his left arm. That is the bionic one.
''Good times in here,'' he whispered.
Indeed. When he played quarterback at Utah, before the injuries and the operations, before the sympathy and the pity, before he retired at 22, some of the best moments of Wynn's life occurred in that very end zone.
Like his first touchdown pass this season: play-action, fake to the flat, bait the cornerback forward, lob to the tight end in the back corner. The crowd went wild. No feeling in the world like it, Wynn said. Or like that first comeback on Halloween three years ago. Like the overtime thriller against Pittsburgh. 
Nearby, a banner with Wynn's likeness hung outside the stadium. He stood underneath his former self, his body in the photo bent in the athletic position, arm cocked.
''That was the beginning,'' he said. ''This is the end.''
On his cellphone, Wynn loaded a picture of an X-ray. It was his left shoulder, the labrum torn all the way around. Staples now hold it in place, along with a pair of three-inch screws and a piece of collarbone.
The X-ray looks almost artistic, a medical Rembrandt, a shoulder stitched together by metal and science. For years, Wynn delivered passes with such force from his slight frame -- throws that whistled and stung the hands of his receivers -- that his right arm seemed somehow enhanced.
Now that his left shoulder is rebuilt, he went from bionic arm in the figurative sense to a bionic arm in the literal one. It recently set off the metal detector at the airport. And it can predict the weather. When Wynn wakes up and his shoulder aches, he knows to expect cold.
After four operations -- three on the left shoulder, one on the right -- after one shoulder or the other popped out of joint close to 100 times, Wynn retired this fall. He is not technically an assistant coach, but he helps instruct the quarterbacks.
Wynn loved football, loved Utah, loved his starring turn. But the more he talked inside a pizza joint near campus decorated with posters of the Beatles and old-school Utah Jazz pennants, the more he seemed to embody football's current crossroads. He did not appear bitter over his predicament, only sad and realistic.
As he bit into a pepperoni slice, Wynn said: ''I'm not going to let my kid play football. No way. I'm going to show him that picture, my screws. I'm going to put a putter in the crib.''
On the worst nights, Wynn leaves his apartment and climbs inside his gold 1995 Nissan Maxima, the one with 160,000 miles on the odometer that he nicknamed the Golden Child. He drives the local streets, sometimes for hours, listening to Linkin Park and 311.
''Just trying to calm down,'' Wynn said. ''Thinking about not playing anymore. Thinking about what I'm going to do.''
Wynn graduated from high school early and arrived at Utah in January 2009. His medical history foreshadowed little of what lay ahead.
The fall before, Utah sold Wynn on his official visit. He sat in the Mighty Utah Student Section, M.U.S.S. to the locals, where they proudly tally the number of false starts by opposing offenses. He wore what teammates described as a fedora and beige beach pants, Southern California to the core, and displayed what his latest offensive coordinator, Brian Johnson, labeled ''his little creepy mustache halfway grown in.''
Wynn weighed 151 pounds at first, but attacked his diet the same he way he attacked film study and practice, his energy seemingly unending. He set alarms in the middle of the night to devour protein shakes and peanut butter sandwiches. Eventually, he topped 200 pounds.
He nearly won the starting job in spring camp and came off the bench at halftime to spark a struggling offense in Utah's eighth game. The Utes trailed Wyoming, 10-3. Wynn tossed his first touchdown pass, on a wheel route. Rice-Eccles shook. Utah won. Coach Kyle Whittingham said Wynn ''looked like Woody from 'Toy Story,' '' but ''he got the job done.''
The next week, Wynn recorded 297 yards passing and 2 touchdowns against New Mexico, the best debut start for a Utah freshman quarterback. His father, Robert Wynn, watched that game from the stands, saw the hits his son absorbed and said he realized for the first time just how physical, how violent, college football was.
That season culminated at the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, near Wynn's hometown, Oceanside, Calif. Wynn racked up 338 yards and 3 touchdowns against California, a program that passed on him, and captured most valuable player honors.
Afterward, reporters asked Whittingham if Wynn should be compared to Alex Smith, the Utah quarterback from San Diego who went No. 1 over all in the 2005 N.F.L. draft to San Francisco.
Wynn said, ''I thought that was the beginning.''
Whittingham said, ''That was the pinnacle, I guess.''
The first injury occurred during the spring game of his sophomore season. Wynn dove for a fumble, arms extended, as several defensive players landed on him. His left shoulder absorbed the impact. He has gone from injury to operation to rehabilitation ever since.
The second injury took place in 2010, the third in 2011. Wynn compensated for what he lost in arm strength with changes to his throwing motion. He delivered passes earlier, with more precision. The 2012 season, Whittingham figured, ''was the year that things go right for him.''
''He was playing the most complete football he had ever played,'' Johnson said.
The hit that ended Wynn's career came Sept. 7 against Utah State, when a defender's helmet struck him square in the left shoulder. It was not a particularly forceful blow, but it was direct. It left Wynn on the field, writhing in pain. One of his receivers, his close friend Luke Matthews, said, ''You had that feeling, like, dang, this could be it.''
Whittingham: ''Heartbroken.''
Johnson: ''I just hugged him and told him I loved him.''
Utah, tabbed in one preseason poll to finish second in the Pac-12 South, lost that game to Utah State, then lost four of its next five contests.
''When he went down, it kind of deflated us,'' receiver DeVonte Christopher said. ''I wouldn't say we're still going through it, but it probably lasted more than a lot of people would admit.''
Wynn returned home and took long drives with his father. He caught up with siblings. He held a retirement news conference, which, Matthews said, ''felt strange, because you usually see something like that with Brett Favre.''
In a roundabout way, Wynn's experiences the past three years prepared him for what came next. Because he played for four offensive coordinators, he understood multiple schemes and philosophies. Because he spent much of last season injured, he watched games from the upstairs booth with the coordinator Norm Chow, a renowned offensive mind. Because his grandmother died last spring from cancer, he gained perspective. Because he already graduated with a degree in economics, Wynn could ease back into campus life.
He performed some analyst duties for ESPN. He schooled Utah's young quarterbacks. The billboard on the freeway came down. The framed Sports Illustrated cover stayed up.
The Utes decided to continue to take Wynn on the road, even if that meant they would lose one travel slot for a healthy player. That is how much Whittingham valued Wynn's input.
''You can see he's kind of built for this profession,'' Johnson said.
The experience humbled Wynn, eliminated ''that giddy-up in my step'' and ''brought me back down to earth.'' He shuttered his Twitter account after all the hatred he saw online. One comment read, ''I'm so glad Jordan Wynn is done playing football.''
Wynn is not glad. At a recent practice, he wore a parka and sweats instead of a uniform, as pads crunched and coaches screamed. Wynn stood there, his arm in that sling, still a part of it and far removed all at once.
Someday this would all make sense, what happened to him. But not today, or tomorrow, this month or next.
''This is the end,'' said the 22-year-old retiree with the bionic arm. ''And this is the beginning.''

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, Time to Mend Fences With Obama

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Del Frisco's, an expensive steakhouse with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Boston harbor, was a festive scene on Tuesday evening. The hedge fund billionaires Steven A. Cohen, Paul Singer and Daniel Loeb were among the titans of finance there dining among the gray velvet banquettes before heading several blocks away to what they hoped would be a victory party for their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.
The next morning was a cold, sobering one for these executives. 
Few industries have made such a one-sided bet as Wall Street did in opposing President Obama and supporting his Republican rival. The top five sources of contributions to Mr. Romney, a former top private equity executive, were big banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wealthy financiers - led by hedge fund investors - were the biggest group of givers to the main "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney, providing almost $33 million, and gave generously to outside groups in races around the country.
On Wednesday, Mr. Loeb, who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008, was sanguine. "You win some, you lose some," he said in an interview. "We can all disagree. I have friends and we have spirited discussions. Sure, I am not getting invited to the White House anytime soon, but as citizens of the country we are all friendly."
Wall Street, however, now has to come to terms with an administration it has vilified. What Washington does next will be critically important for the industry, as regulatory agencies work to put their final stamp on financial regulations and as tax increases and spending cuts are set to take effect in the new year unless a deal to avert them is reached. To not have a friend in the White House at this time is one thing, but to have an enemy is quite another.
"Wall Street is now going to have to figure out how to make this relationship work," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst who follows the big banks for the investment bank Nomura. "It's not impossible, but it's not the starting point they had hoped for."
Traditionally, the financial industry has tended to support Republican candidates, but, being pragmatic about power, has also donated to Democrats. That script got a rewrite in 2008, when many on Wall Street supported Mr. Obama as an intelligent leader for a country reeling from the financial crisis. Goldman employees were the leading source of campaign donations for Mr. Obama, who reaped far more contributions - roughly $16 million - from Wall Street than did his opponent, John McCain.
The love affair between Wall Street and Mr. Obama soured soon after he took office and championed an overhaul in financial regulations that became the Dodd-Frank Act.
Some financial executives complained that in meetings with the president, they found him disinterested and disengaged, while others on Wall Street never forgave Mr. Obama for calling them "fat cats."
The disillusionment with the president spawned reams of critical commentary from Wall Street executives.
"So long as our leaders tell us that we must trust them to regulate and redistribute our way back to prosperity, we will not break out of this economic quagmire," Mr. Loeb wrote in one letter to his investors.
The rhetoric at times became extreme, like the time Steven A. Schwarzman, co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, compared a tax proposal to "when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939." (Mr. Schwarzman later apologized for the remark.)
Mr. Loeb was not alone in switching allegiances in the recent presidential race. Hedge fund executives like Leon Cooperman who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008 were big backers of Mr. Romney in 2012. And Wall Street chieftains like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, who have publicly been Democrats in the past, kept a low profile during this election. But their firms' employees gave money to Mr. Romney in waves.
Starting over with the Obama White House will not be easy. One senior Wall Street lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wall Street "made a bad mistake" in pushing so hard for Mr. Romney. "They are going to pay a price," he said. "It will soften over time, but there will be a price."
Mr. Obama is not without supporters on Wall Street. Prominent executives like Hamilton James of Blackstone, and Robert Wolf, a former top banker at UBS, were in Chicago on Tuesday night, celebrating with the president.
"What we learned is the people on Wall Street have one vote just like everyone else," Mr. Wolf said. Still, while the support Wall Street gave Mr. Romney is undeniable, Mr. Wolf said, "Mr. Obama wants a healthy private sector, and that includes Wall Street.
"If you look at fiscal reform, infrastructure, immigration and education, they are all bipartisan issues and are more aligned than some people make it seem."
Reshma Saujani, a former hedge fund lawyer who was among Mr. Obama's top bundlers this year and is planning to run for city office next year, agreed.
"Most people in the financial services sector are social liberals who support gay marriage and believe in a woman's right to choose, so I think many of them will swing back to Democrats in the future," she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama's Victory, and the Day After

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama's Night'' (front page, Nov. 7):
The division of red states and blue states once again surfaced in an American presidential election. But so did an American tradition of giving a guy who has done a good job under difficult circumstances another term in office.
Moreover, Americans endorsed President Obama's overall approach to restoring the American economy for the middle class and continuing with a national guarantee of health care.
However, we will have essentially the same makeup of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Still, there is much under the direct control of the president, such as promoting us as a peacetime nation, that can bring change. Bringing home the troops will help a strapped nation in many ways. 
As for the Republicans, they must grapple with the political baggage that their radical conservative base saddles them with in national elections. Mitt Romney clearly would have been a much more appealing candidate across America had his message not been burdened with the ties to tired rejected social policies that the Republican base clings to.
Without any help from the politicians, America's political landscape has changed, with new classes of voters emerging. Like the realities of a changing climate, that new landscape cannot be ignored.
BRUCE NEUMAN Sag Harbor, N.Y., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Now that this long campaign is finally over and President Obama has won re-election, we as a nation should take some pride in our nation's progress in addressing racial inequality.
What a momentous occasion for President Obama, our first African-American president, who will be inaugurated on the day we celebrate the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. That is something that all Americans, regardless of their political leanings, should feel proud of.
EDWIN ANDREWS Malden, Mass., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
The Republicans will be relegated to an inconsequential minority party for decades unless they learn how to embrace women, Latinos and young voters. Republicans got clobbered in these demographic groups.
A good start would be to abandon their toxic positions on social issues and immigration, and focus on the debt, deficit and health care issues, which truly need to be addressed at the federal level.
You can't preach ''small'' government and then tell same-sex couples that they can't marry, or women that they can't have easy access to contraception or immigrants that they should self-deport.
Then show some Congressional flexibility (suppress Tea Party instincts to say no to everything) and true bipartisanship (Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey knew how to do it), and then, finally, find a candidate who can relay a consistent and understandable message without looking and sounding like an aristocrat. Then, and only then, will we have a real two-party system.
PETER C. ALKALAY Scarsdale, N.Y., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
I am overjoyed by the outcome of this election, but like some of the people in ''The Most Sought-After Voters Were No Longer Flattered by the Attention'' (news article, Nov. 7), I am appalled not only by the acrimony of the debate, but also by the length of the campaign, the millions of dollars spent on advertisements and the deluge of e-mails and telephone calls.
I hope that President Obama and Congress will consider setting some limits. How about this for a start: three months of campaigning; equal but limited time on major network television; equal and limited amounts of money from the government for advertisements and travel?
Just think what the huge amount of money spent on this campaign could have done for the country -- creating jobs, providing health care and education, fixing roads and damage from disasters. Where are our values?
CAROL DELANEY Providence, R.I., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Two points made repeatedly throughout this election were that President Obama never laid out a second-term agenda and that Mitt Romney never gave sufficient detail for his. As such, it is difficult to know exactly what either party wants.
Neither party is willing to lay its cards on the table because it knows it can't reach its goals openly. Instead of pursuing grandiose agendas for bigger government, smaller government or colonizing Mars, how about just fixing what we have?
Is it impossible for government to be on a truly sound fiscal footing? For health care to be truly affordable, not just mandated? For fraud and waste to be all but eliminated? For infrastructure to be in fine shape? For educators to teach fundamentals with accountability?
Most baby boomers never had to face the huge deprivations of their parents' generation. Yet their legacy seems to be to leave a mountain of debt and dysfunction to the next generation. Fixing all that would constitute a large enough agenda for anyone.
MARK R. GODBURN North Canaan, Conn., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Barack Obama triumphed in an expensive and hard-fought race that reaffirmed America's decision four years ago to elect the nation's first African-American president.
The Latino vote, which Republicans largely ignored and Democrats took for granted in earlier decades, increases its presence in every election. When the number crunching and analysis are completed, they will most likely confirm that Mitt Romney unnerved that ethnic group enough to secure a second Obama term, not unlike an uptick in Latino support for George W. Bush that may have helped determine the presidential race in 2004.
The Bush administration's support for comprehensive immigration reform and outreach to the Latino community acknowledged Latinos' increasing reach and power. It would be wise for both Democrats and Republicans to heed the Latino factor in the past three presidential elections. It is obvious that the Latino vote cannot be ignored and loyalties are not guaranteed.
WAYNE TRUJILLO Denver, Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Now that President Obama has a second term, he must make climate change his legacy.
Predictions from models tell us that we can't wait even a few more years to address climate change, if we are to minimize warming that will decimate our agriculture with droughts, and eviscerate our economy with storms and fires. We've had a preview this year. That it will get worse is unavoidable; we need to prevent it from getting much, much worse.
A Green New Deal would be America's ticket to jobs, security, economic recovery and renewing our position of global leadership. This may be the last great opportunity for the United States to avoid permanently falling behind China. Here's hoping that Mr. Obama finally finds the courage to stand firm against the oil and coal barons and lead us, our children and future generations away from the brink of climate disaster.
PETER KALMUS Altadena, Calif., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Given the closeness of popular vote and the content of Mitt Romney's concession speech, why doesn't President Obama put him to work, as he did with Hillary Rodham Clinton after defeating her in the Democratic primaries in 2008? In the spirit of reconciliation, Mr. Obama should give Mr. Romney a position in his second administration.
KAREN ANN DeLUCA Alexandria, Va., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Congratulations, Mr. Obama, on your win. My wife and I voted for you in South Carolina, even though we knew that as usual our vote will make no difference. At least it made us feel better.
We wish you success in your efforts to deal with the economy, the Congress and so on. But now that you do not have to worry about getting re-elected, I hope that you will feel braver about tackling a few other issues after you rescue us from the fiscal cliff.
Would you please add the banning of assault weapons to your list before we have more massacres? And please do not forget immigration reform -- a sensible solution that will permit the millions of immigrants who are already here to work and pay taxes, instead of trying to drive them underground and into crime.
BILSEL ALISBAH Hilton Head, S.C., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Question for the Victor: How Far Do You Push?'' (news analysis, front page, Nov. 7):
The first order of business should be a push for filibuster reform. On many occasions during the last four years, legislation that had support from a majority of senators as well as the American public died in the Senate because of the filibuster. Requiring a supermajority to pass basic legislation is unacceptable, and a major cause of the current gridlock.
No one is willing to compromise as long as the filibuster is so easily available. Tyranny of the majority is not right, but neither is tyranny of the minority.
ALLAN MARDER Sherman Oaks, Calif., Nov. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Despite Cold and Confusion, Casting a Vote'' (photo layout, Nov. 7):
Years ago a veteran told my wife that he was glad to see American flags in front of homes, but he'd much rather see long lines of voters. That's what he was fighting for.
Wherever he is, I hope that soldier saw your photo essay on voting in areas hit by Hurricane Sandy. Crowds of people wrapped in heavy coats at an unheated polling station, others walking by and through mounds of clothes, and that elderly man filling out a paper ballot by lantern light -- that's what gave me and should give all Americans hope about the future of the United States.

 BODY:
Alabama
As expected, Republicans dominated the major races on Tuesday in this reddest of states, where Mitt Romney easily won the presidential race. All seven of the state's Congressional incumbents -- six Republicans and one Democrat -- won new terms. And the last Democrat in statewide office in Alabama, Lucy Baxley, lost her race to remain president of the Public Service Commission.
Alabama voters also soundly rejected a ballot measure that would have removed racist language from the State Constitution that calls for separate schools for white and black children. Some black lawmakers had opposed the measure because they said it would leave intact a provision that the state's children do not have a right to public education.
Roy Moore, who was removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for refusing to remove a two-ton granite Ten Commandments monument in the courthouse rotunda, was once again elected to the position. 
Alaska
Republicans, who dominate Alaskan politics, took back full control of the state government on Tuesday. The party won at least 12 of the 20 seats in the Alaska Senate, which had been split evenly between Democrats and Republicans and controlled by a bipartisan coalition.
Democrats in the Senate had blocked Gov. Sean Parnell's plan to cut oil taxes on energy companies by up to $2 billion per year, and Republicans had hoped that winning back full control of the Legislature would allow them to push the tax cuts through. Redistricting left all but one of the 60 seats in the Legislature up for grabs, some in districts that were more favorable to Republicans.
Arizona
Democrats had hoped this could be the year that Arizona, considered a bastion of conservative politics since the days of Barry Goldwater, turned blue. But Republicans scored major victories in the state Tuesday night.
Mitt Romney carried Arizona, despite the state's surging Latino population, and Jeff Flake, a Republican congressman, won a comfortable victory in the race for the Senate seat being vacated by Jon Kyl, a Republican who is retiring.
Though some analysts had rated the race a tossup, Mr. Flake collected more than half of the vote compared with just 45 percent for his opponent, Richard H. Carmona, a surgeon general in President George W. Bush's administration.
Democrats still had a chance to win a majority of Arizona's nine Congressional seats, if they could win all three of tightest House races.
But in a surprising twist, Republicans appeared likely to gain the seat formerly held by Gabrielle Giffords. Ron Barber, the former chief of staff to Ms. Giffords, scored an emotional victory in the special election in June to replace his former boss, and redistricting gave him a district slightly friendlier to Democrats. But Martha McSally, a Republican former Air Force pilot, led by a little more than 1,000 votes on Wednesday morning, with all precincts reporting.
Two Democratic former representatives who were ousted in 2010, Ann Kirkpatrick and Kyrsten Sinema, also clung to narrow leads Wednesday.
Joe Arpaio, the polarizing sheriff of Maricopa County who has proclaimed himself the toughest sheriff in America, also won a sixth term. And voters rejected a statewide ballot measure that would have made permanent a temporary one-cent-per-dollar sales tax to finance education.
Arkansas
Much of the attention devoted to outside nonprofit political groups has focused on their spending on national elections, but in Arkansas, it was their influence on the Statehouse that may mark a watershed moment for them.
Groups like Americans for Prosperity and the 60 Plus Association, which have ties to the donor networks financed by Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaires, poured money into Republican campaigns at the state level. For the first time since 1874, Republicans won a majority in the state's Senate and House.
Republicans also hold all four of Arkansas's seats in the House of Representatives after Tom Cotton, a 35-year-old Army veteran, easily won a seat vacated by a retiring Democrat, Gene Jeffress, in the Fourth District.
In the Third District, the Republican incumbent, Steve Womack, did not face a Democratic challenger and easily defeated Green Party and Libertarian candidates.
That leaves Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, to cope with a Republican Legislature, and Senator Mark Pryor as the sole Democrat representing Arkansas in Washington, a sea change for the state that produced Bill Clinton.
Outside groups also had hoped to defeat a ballot measure that would impose a 5-cent tax on diesel fuel to raise money for highway improvements. That runs against the interests of Koch Industries, the company owned by the Koch family. But with more than 60 percent of the votes counted, the measure appeared headed for approval.
California
Tuesday was a big night for Democrats in California, a state that has grown even more blue in recent years. President Obama and Senator Dianne Feinstein coasted to easy victories in the state at the top of the ticket.
The party also appeared very likely to pick up seats in the Congressional delegation, and to be on the verge of picking up a two-thirds majority in both houses of the California Legislature, which would allow Democrats to increase taxes without any support from across the aisle, rendering the Republicans all but irrelevant in state government.
The biggest victory belonged to Gov. Jerry Brown. Voters approved Proposition 30, a ballot measure championed by Mr. Brown that establishes temporary tax increases, which will bring in an estimated $6 billion per year. It was the first time Californians had approved a statewide tax increase since 2004. Its failure would have triggered billions in cuts to education.
Several other ballot measures took on contentious issues in public safety. Voters rejected Proposition 34, which would have put an end to the death penalty in the state. But they approved revising California's landmark three-strikes law; now, people convicted of three felonies can be sentenced to life in prison only if the third conviction is for a serious or violent offense.
Two other ballot measures were defeated: one that would have required labels on most foods that contain genetically modified ingredients and another that would have curbed union donations to political campaigns.
Redistricting and other electoral changes ended up pitting some incumbent congressmen against each other. In the San Fernando Valley, Representative Brad Sherman soundly defeated a fellow Democrat, Howard Berman, who had been in Congress three decades.
Representative Pete Stark, the 80-year-old dean of California's Congressional delegation, who had been in Congress since the Nixon administration, also fell to a challenge from a fellow Democrat, 31-year-old Eric Swalwell.
Colorado
President Obama pulled out a victory in Colorado, a hotly contested battleground state. The Romney campaign had polled favorably in Colorado and poured substantial resources into the state, which has nine electoral votes.
Voters passed one of the highest-profile ballot initiatives in the country, legalizing the limited possession and retail sale of marijuana. The amendment allows those 21 and older to buy up to an ounce of the drug at regulated stores. Public use is prohibited, but adults will be able to grow a limited number of marijuana plants in their homes.
The state's governor, John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, strongly opposed the measure. ''Federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don't break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly,'' he said on Tuesday night.
In the House, Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, defeated a challenge from Joe Coors, a Republican from the state's beer-brewing family. Mr. Coors had sought to elevate his profile beyond voters' traditional associations with his family, saying in one television ad, ''I'm not a beer.''
Six other incumbents also kept their House seats, including Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican who has served since 2009 and fought off the Democratic challenger, Joe Miklosi, in a close race. In the state's largest district, Representative Scott Tipton, a Republican who was elected in 2010, defeated Sal Pace, the Democrats' former leader in the state House.
Connecticut
Democrats held onto a Senate seat that Republicans had high hopes of taking, and kept all five House seats in a state where the presidential result was never in doubt.
For the second election cycle in a row, Linda McMahon, a Republican who is a former professional wrestling executive, spent heavily from her personal fortune in a bid for an open Senate seat, only to come up short.
This time, the winner was Christopher S. Murphy, a representative who, at 39, will become the youngest senator. He will replace Joseph I. Lieberman, who is retiring after a career spent alternately supporting and confounding fellow Democrats.
This was one of a handful of seats Republicans had to wrest from Democrats to take control of the Senate, and exit polls showed that Connecticut voters were acutely aware of the national implications. Almost 9 out of 10 said that party control of the Senate was an important factor in their choices.
Mr. Murphy won with a double-digit lead, in a state that President Obama carried by an even higher margin.
In her two races for the Senate, Ms. McMahon spent more than $86 million. This year, she outspent Mr. Murphy by more than four to one.
Republicans had hoped to contend in some House races, but the only close one was in the Fifth District, where Mr. Murphy's run for the Senate left a vacancy. There, the Democrat, Elizabeth Esty, won with 52 percent of the vote over Andrew Roraback.
Delaware
President Obama carried Delaware, and three other Democrats -- Senator Thomas R. Carper, Representative John Carney and Gov. Jack Markell -- easily won re-election in this solidly blue state.
Mr. Carper, a pragmatic centrist, may be in line to succeed Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. His Republican opponent, Kevin Wade, a businessman, never gained traction with his criticism of Mr. Carper.
Mr. Markell, the chairman of the National Governors Association, did not face a serious threat from the Republican nominee, Jeff Cragg, a businessman and former insurance executive.
District of Columbia
Voters overwhelmingly passed measures aimed at cleaning up the ethical landscape in the District of Columbia, amending the Washington City Charter to disqualify council members and mayors from serving or running again if convicted of a crime while in office.
The charter measures come as federal prosecutors are investigating whether Mayor Vincent C. Gray's 2010 election campaign illegally paid another candidate to undermine Mr. Gray's principal opponent. And two council members resigned this year before pleading guilty to financial irregularities in unrelated investigations.
The measures passed with nearly 80 percent of the vote, but they may not do all that voters intended. As written, the measures would not apply to the two council members who resigned, Harry B. Thomas and Kwame R. Brown, because both left office before their guilty pleas.
Florida
President Obama held a slight lead in this battleground state on Wednesday, but election officials hesitated to declare a winner because he and Mitt Romney were separated by fewer than 50,000 votes out of more than eight million cast.
The outcome of the presidential election did not hinge on the state's results, as it did in 2000, and Mr. Obama did not need Florida's 29 electoral votes to clinch his re-election this year.
Though The Associated Press reported that 100 percent of the precincts had reported, election workers in some counties were still counting provisional and absentee ballots on Wednesday afternoon. Ballots were longer than usual because they included votes on many proposed amendments to the State Constitution.In the Senate race, the final tally was not as close as had been expected. Senator Bill Nelson, a centrist Democrat running for a third term, won by 12.8 percentage points, defeating the Republican candidate, Representative Connie Mack, in a race that was exceptionally bitter, nasty and personal.
In the Orlando area, Alan Grayson, a pugnacious Democrat who lost his House seat in 2010, beat his Republican opponent, Todd Long, the host of a conservative radio show. As a congressman, Mr. Grayson developed a national following among liberals who liked his provocative style.
In the 18th District, Representative Allen B. West, a Republican freshman and a Tea Party favorite, appeared to be losing to Patrick Murphy, a Democrat. The race was a test of Mr. West's fiery brand of conservatism. Mr. Murphy criticized ''the taunts, the name-calling, the bullying'' that he said characterized Mr. West's style.
In the Sarasota area, Representative Vern Buchanan, a Republican, won re-election after surviving the first phase of an investigation of his finances by the House ethics committee.
Another incumbent Republican, Representative David Rivera, lost to a Democrat, Joe Garcia, in Florida's southernmost district. Mr. Rivera faced accusations that he had tried to plant a candidate in the Democratic primary to undermine Mr. Garcia's chances. Mr. Garcia urged voters to ''turn the page on Mr. Rivera's scandals.''
Floridians rejected ballot measures that would have amended the State Constitution to block parts of the new federal health care law and to impose additional restrictions on abortion.
Georgia
Representative John Barrow withstood the Republican charge in Georgia and held onto his seat despite a redrawn map that pumped more conservatives into his 12th District.
Mr. Barrow, who is now the only white Democratic representative from the Deep South, won a fifth term with 53.7 percent of the vote, defeating State Representative Lee Anderson. Mr. Barrow hung onto the one-third of his constituents who are African-American while appealing to conservative white voters with ads that highlighted his endorsement by the National Rifle Association.
Voters handily approved a ballot measure to revamp the procedure for establishing charter schools. Those decisions will now be made by a new commission whose members will be appointed by the governor and lieutenant governor.
Hawaii
Representative Mazie K. Hirono swept to an easy victory in the Senate race in Hawaii, defeating Linda Lingle, a Republican former governor.
Just a few months ago, Republicans had targeted the Senate seat that is being vacated by retiring Senator Daniel K. Akaka as a potential pickup for the party.
Ms. Lingle, a moderate who supports abortion rights, was viewed as a strong crossover candidate in this staunchly Democratic state. But Ms. Hirono's built-in advantage, as a Democrat in a state that has not elected a Republican to the Senate in more than four decades, proved too much for Ms. Lingle to overcome.
In Honolulu, Kirk Caldwell defeated Benjamin J. Cayetano, a former governor, in a fierce race for mayor that many voters saw as a referendum on a contentious rail project on the island of Oahu. Mr. Caldwell, a former acting mayor of Honolulu, was a supporter of the project, while Mr. Cayetano had vowed to try to stop construction of the rail line.
Idaho
In Idaho, which is sparsely populated and leans firmly to the right, Mitt Romney easily won the state, while Representatives Raúl R. Labrador and Mike Simpson, both Republican incumbents, retained their seats in the House.
The fiercest fight involved ballot measures that sought to strike down three laws that the schools superintendent and Republican governor had championed to overhaul the public schools.
Urged on by the teachers' union, Idaho voters toppled all three laws, which would have eliminated tenure, limited the collective-bargaining rights of teachers and instituted a merit pay system tied to scores on state-mandated tests.
The Idaho Education Association, which represents nearly 13,000 teachers, gathered signatures to challenge those laws in a referendum. Also overturned was a new plan that, after three years of deep budget cuts, called for leasing laptop computers to every high school student.
Illinois
In President Obama's home state, the most compelling races were congressional.
Of the six House seats that were considered competitive in Illinois, five were held by Republicans. Democrats managed to regain four of those with a boost from redistricting.
In the Eighth District, Joe Walsh, a Tea Party favorite, lost to Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat and an Army veteran. One of the first women to fly combat missions in Iraq, Ms. Duckworth lost both legs when her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004. President Obama chose her to be assistant secretary of veterans affairs.
Millions of dollars poured into the race from outside the state, and the tone was often nasty. Mr. Walsh suggested his opponent was not a ''true hero.'' His stand on abortion also became news after Mr. Walsh announced that he opposed the procedure even when the mother might die.
Another candidate who generated national interest was Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a Democrat, who won re-election by a large margin, overcoming a publicized hospitalization for bipolar disorder. Mr. Jackson, the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, also faced investigations into whether he had misused campaign money and had broken ethics rules in pursuit of Mr. Obama's former Senate seat.
Mr. Jackson said in a statement: ''Once the doctors approve my return to work, I will continue to be the progressive fighter you have known for years.''
Indiana
Representative Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate, picked up a Senate seat that had long been in Republican hands.
State Treasurer Richard E. Mourdock, the Republican candidate and Tea Party favorite, was expected to win until he drew unwanted national attention for saying that a pregnancy conceived by rape ''is something that God intended to happen.'' After that, Mr. Donnelly, a House member since 2007 and a native of Massapequa, N.Y., gained significant momentum.
Mr. Mourdock won the Republican primary against the incumbent, Richard G. Lugar, who was first elected to the Senate in 1976.
Michael Pence, a Republican House member since 2001, won the governor's race, succeeding Mitch Daniels, a Republican who had to step down because of term limits. Mr. Pence's Democratic opponent was John Gregg, a former Indiana House speaker. Mr. Pence is a noted social conservative who has fought to cut funding to Planned Parenthood.
President Obama carried Indiana in 2008 by less than one percentage point, but lost on Tuesday by 10 percentage points.
In a tight Congressional race, Jackie Walorski, a Republican former member of the Indiana House, won the seat that Mr. Donnelly vacated, defeating Brendan Mullen, a businessman and Iraq war veteran.
Iowa
President Obama narrowly won the six electoral votes in Iowa, one of the most contested states and the place he credited with igniting his unlikely rise to the presidency.
In the House, Representative Steve King, a Tea Party firebrand who was first elected in 2002, held on to his seat, fending off a strong challenge from the Democrat Christie Vilsack, the wife of Tom Vilsack, the United States secretary of agriculture and a former Iowa governor.
Redistricting in the state caused two longtime congressmen to face off against each other in the Third District. In one of the country's hardest-fought races, Representative Tom Latham, a nine-term Republican, defeated Representative Leonard L. Boswell, an eight-term Democratic incumbent.
In a closely watched race, voters retained Justice David Wiggins of the state's Supreme Court.
Critics of Justice Wiggins had hoped to remove him, saying that he and his colleagues abused their power in 2009 when they unanimously struck down Iowa's ban on same-sex marriage. The conservative groups that sought to oust Justice Wiggins tried to replicate a successful effort two years ago to remove three other justices. But they faced a far more forceful campaign by the gay-rights groups and legal organizations that supported him. Those groups called his retention a victory for judicial independence.
Kansas
In this Republican stronghold, the state's six electoral votes were never seriously in doubt, with Mitt Romney winning by a wide 22-percentage point margin.
Republicans kept all four Congressional seats. Underscoring Kansas's partisan reliability, Representative Kevin Yoder, who in 2010 won what had been a Democratic seat, won re-election without a Democratic challenger despite a scandal.
Republican leaders rebuked Mr. Yoder for having skinny-dipped in the Sea of Galilee during an official trip to Israel last summer with several House Republican freshmen. Mr. Yoder, who had earlier received attention for refusing a drunken-driving test, later apologized for ''a momentary lapse in judgment.''
Meanwhile, in the Kansas Legislature, Republicans kept control of both houses but that majority pushed further to the right after an election season fraught with conflict between the party's conservative and more moderate factions.
Kentucky
In Kentucky's highest-profile race, Andy Barr, a Republican lawyer, unseated Representative Ben Chandler, a four-term Democrat who is the grandson of a former governor and United States senator. This was a rematch of 2010, when Mr. Chandler narrowly retained his seat.
The race featured nasty sparring and vicious attacks. One advertisement highlighted Mr. Barr's criminal record, which related to his using a fake ID as a teenager. Another ad, from Mr. Barr, described Mr. Chandler as a ''lowlife.''
Four Republican House incumbents -- Ed Whitfield, Brett Guthrie, Thomas H. Massie and Harold Rogers -- retained their seats, and Congressman John Yarmuth, a Democrat, easily won a fourth term.
Mitt Romney captured the state's eight electoral votes as Kentucky continued its run over the past dozen years as a Republican presidential stronghold.
Louisiana
Two incumbent Republicans, Representatives Charles Boustany Jr. and Jeff Landry, will face each other in a runoff in early December. Neither won more than 50 percent of the vote.
Mr. Boustany, a cardiovascular surgeon seeking a fifth term, is close to House Republican leaders. Mr. Landry, a Tea Party favorite, is seeking a second term. They were put together in the same district after Louisiana lost a House seat after the 2010 census.
Mr. Landry attacked Mr. Boustany as a supporter of President Obama's health care overhaul, even though both candidates have voted many times to repeal it.
Four other House Republicans -- Representatives Rodney Alexander, Bill Cassidy, John Fleming and Steve Scalise -- easily won re-election. The only Democrat in the state's House delegation, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, won a second term in a redrawn district that now stretches from New Orleans into the Baton Rouge area.
The state has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
Voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution expanding the rights of gun owners.
Maine
Former Gov. Angus King, an independent, won the Senate seat being vacated by Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate Republican who jolted the political world when she announced she would not seek a fourth term.
But his election left a mystery: Mr. King, a formidable fund-raiser who had the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, has not said whether he will caucus with the Democrats or Republicans. His opponents were the Democratic nominee, State Senator Cynthia Dill, and Charlie Summers, a Republican who is Maine's secretary of state.
Maine voters also gave the gay-rights movement a major victory when they approved a ballot initiative to legalize same-sex marriage. Fifty-three percent voted to approve. The Legislature passed a law making such unions legal in 2009, but it was repealed at the ballot box that fall.
Chellie Pingree, a Democratic House member, won a third term to represent Maine's First Congressional District, defeating Jon Courtney, a Republican businessman. Mike Michaud, a Democratic five-term incumbent, won in the Second District, beating Kevin Raye, the Republican president of the Maine Senate.
Maryland
Voters narrowly passed a measure to legalize same-sex marriage, joining Maine as the first states to approve such unions by a popular vote. The measure passed with a four-point margin with 98 percent of the precincts reporting.
Analysts and advocates credit the victory in part to relaxing attitudes toward the issue among black voters, who are one-third of the electorate in the state. Historically, blacks across the nation have been swayed by strong opposition by black religious leaders.
Voters have rejected same-sex marriage in 32 states where the issue was put on the ballot.
In House contests, John Delaney, a Democrat, beat Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Republican, for the seat Mr. Bartlett held for 20 years in the Sixth District, reshaped by the Democrat-led General Assembly last year.
Senator Ben Cardin easily won re-election to a second term, defeating a Republican opponent, Daniel Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who is now a Web design consultant, and two other candidates.
Massachusetts
In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one, Massachusetts was always considered safely in President Obama's column even though Mitt Romney was governor of the state and still lives there. In the end, the president won the state's 11 electoral votes handily.
The real drama in the days leading up to the race was who would win one of the nastier races for the Senate, the fight for the seat formerly held by Edward M. Kennedy.
Scott P. Brown, a moderate Republican who won a special election in 2010 to complete Mr. Kennedy's term after his death, lost that prize on Tuesday to Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor who set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the Obama administration. After the two ran neck and neck for months, Ms. Warren, who raised much more money than Mr. Brown and had a far more elaborate ground organization, pulled ahead late in the campaign.
Democrats won every Congressional seat, including the Fourth District, where Joseph P. Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, won the seat vacated by Barney Frank. Mr. Kennedy is the first of his generation in his family to enter Congress.
The only seat in doubt had been the Sixth District, where the incumbent, John F. Tierney, an eight-term Democrat, ultimately (and narrowly) fought off a challenge by Richard Tisei, a former state senator and an openly gay Republican who supports abortion rights.
Voters in Massachusetts also approved an initiatives to eliminate state criminal and civil penalties for the medical use of marijuana. They turned down an initiative to permit doctors to prescribe medicine to end a terminally ill patient's life.
Michigan
Debbie Stabenow, the state's two-term Democratic senator, easily won re-election, defeating Pete Hoekstra, a Republican House member from 1993 through 2011.
President Obama also won Michigan, a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans had hoped to be able to contest because Mitt Romney was born there and because Mr. Romney's father had served as the state's governor.
Kerry Bentivolio, the Republican candidate and a reindeer farmer, won the House seat vacated by Thaddeus McCotter, a five-term Republican from the Detroit suburbs who resigned after most of the signatures he submitted to get on the primary ballot were found to be fraudulent.
In the First District, Representative Dan Benishek, the Republican incumbent, held a lead of 2,297 votes over Gary McDowell, a Democrat and former state representative.
Voters rejected by a large margin a ballot initiative to enshrine the right to bargain collectively in the State Constitution. Union leaders pushed the measure, which lost 58 percent to 42 percent, with the aim of preventing Michigan's Legislature from curbing government employees' bargaining rights. Voters narrowly approved a union-backed initiative that overturned a law that had allowed the governor to appoint emergency managers for financially distressed communities and school districts. The law gave emergency managers the power to cancel union contracts.
Voters rejected a proposal to require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Legislature or a statewide vote to increase taxes.
Minnesota
With President Obama's victory, Democrats have carried the state in the last 10 presidential elections.
Minnesotans voted down a state constitutional amendment that would have limited marriage to a man and a woman. The victory for gay-rights advocates came as voters in Maine and Maryland also approved same-sex marriage initiatives. The count for a similar referendum in Washington State was still incomplete.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, handily won a second term, defeating Kurt P. Bills, a high school economics teacher.
In one of the country's most expensive and highest-profile House races, Representative Michele Bachmann, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, narrowly defeated Jim Graves, a Democrat. Mr. Graves, the founder of the AmericInn hotel chain, had depicted Mrs. Bachmann, an outspoken champion of the Tea Party and a constant cable-television presence, as too preoccupied with her national profile to focus on her constituents.
In an upset, Representative Chip Cravaack, the first-term Republican incumbent, was ousted by Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represented the state as a congressman in the 1970s. The campaign's final weeks featured attack ads suggesting that Mr. Cravaack did not live in Minnesota because his wife and two young sons moved to New Hampshire last year to be closer to her job as a pharmaceutical executive.
Mississippi
Despite the many economic and social conditions in Mississippi that would seem to favor Democrats, the state has voted for Republicans in every presidential race but one, when it went to Jimmy Carter in 1976.
This year was no exception, with Mississippi voters supporting Mitt Romney and Republican candidates in their state overwhelmingly, with one exception: Voters in the Second District sent Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, back to Washington for a 10th term.
Roger Wicker, a Republican who has been Mississippi's junior senator since 2007, when he was appointed to replace Trent Lott, retained his seat. Mr. Wicker spent more than $7 million to defeat a retired Methodist minister and former Green Beret named Albert N. Gore Jr., 82, who ran as a Democrat. The news media had fun with Mr. Gore's name, though no one has established that he is related to the former vice president.
Republicans easily won the First, Third and Fourth Districts, facing weak Democratic challengers, if any.
Missouri
Senator Claire McCaskill, once regarded as the chamber's most vulnerable incumbent Democrat, won a second term on Tuesday, buoyed by voters concerned about comments made by her Republican opponent, Representative Todd Akin, that women who are victims of ''legitimate rape'' rarely become pregnant.
Exit polls showed that women outnumbered men at the polls, 55 percent to 45 percent, and favored Ms. McCaskill by an even larger margin in one of the most closely watched and contentious Senate races in the country.
Republican hopes of unseating Ms. McCaskill derailed in August when Mr. Akin's comments squarely positioned abortion as a defining issue in the race.
Analysts had expected Mr. Akin's comments to be particularly costly among Republican women in the more affluent suburbs of St. Louis and Kansas City, who may either have ignored the race altogether or split their ticket. In exit polls, 64 percent of voters said Mr. Akin's comments were either the most important factor or one of several important factors in the race. Nearly a quarter of those voters identified themselves as Republicans.
In the race for the White House, Mitt Romney carried the state. The result was expected given that President Obama, noting Missouri's steady shift to the right, decided not to even contest what was deemed a battleground state just four years ago.
In the governor's race, the incumbent Democrat, Jay Nixon, fended off a well-financed challenge from his Republican opponent, David Spence, a St. Louis businessman, to win re-election.
Montana
When he won a Senate seat in 2006, Jon Tester, a Democrat and organic farmer, squeaked past his Republican competitor in this mostly Republican state in one of the closest races in the country. He did it again this year, defeating Denny Rehberg, a Republican who held the state's only House seat.
Mr. Tester is a distinctly Montana brand of Democrat, often at odds with the mainstream of the national party. He is against same-sex marriage and favors strengthening gun rights.
Mr. Rehberg's House seat was won by Steve Daines, a Republican, who easily defeated Kim Gillan, a Democrat.
In the governor's race, the Democrat, Steve Bullock, the state attorney general, eked out a victory over his Republican challenger, Rick Hill, a former congressman.
Voters also approved a ballot measure that would require that the parents of minors seeking abortions be notified before the procedure is performed, and a proposal to deny certain state services to immigrants who are not in this country legally.
Nebraska
Deb Fischer appeared to be the only Republican in the country to win a Senate seat held by a Democrat, easily fighting off a comeback attempt by Bob Kerrey, a former senator and governor.
Democrats had long defied the odds in this conservative state, and had hoped to keep the Senate seat that was left open by the retirement of Ben Nelson. They nominated Mr. Kerrey, a Vietnam War veteran and former presidential candidate and, more recently, president of the New School, a university in New York.
Ms. Fischer, a rancher and state legislator, defeated two better-known, better-financed rivals in the Republican primary. Democratic hopes were lifted by a recent poll showing Mr. Kerrey trailing only narrowly and by a surprise endorsement of him last week by Chuck Hagel, a Republican former senator.
But in the end, it was not close. Ms. Fischer won 58 percent of the vote, while Mitt Romney carried the state with more than 60 percent.
With Ms. Fischer's victory, Republicans will hold every statewide office and all of Nebraska's seats in Congress.
Nevada
From a distance, it appeared that Nevada could have swung to either presidential candidate. But the Democrats' political machine, which paid careful attention to Hispanic voters and women there, all but guaranteed that the state's six electoral votes would go to President Obama.
That model is likely to be studied by political operatives for the next four years, even though it was not enough to help Shelley Berkley wrest a Senate seat away from Dean Heller, the Republican who was appointed to it after John Ensign resigned during an infidelity scandal last year.
Ms. Berkley, a Democratic representative, had struggled to overcome questions raised by a House ethics investigation into whether she used her office to benefit her husband's business.
Nevada's House incumbents kept their seats in the First, Second and Third Districts. The state gained a new district after the 2010 census and is sending a fourth representative to Congress this year, Steven Horsford, a Democrat. Mr. Horsford is the State Senate majority leader.
New Hampshire
A swing state by temperament, New Hampshire firmly backed President Obama on Tuesday despite Mitt Romney's roots in the state, where he has a vacation home. Democrats have now won the state in five out of the last six presidential elections.
Three women -- all Democrats -- won races for governor and the state's two Congressional seats, where two incumbent Republicans lost. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat Ovide Lamontagne, a Republican, to become governor. In the state's Second District, Ann McLane Kuster, a lawyer and a Democrat, defeated Charles Bass, a moderate Republican who bested Ms. Kuster two years ago. Ms. Kuster raised more money in the district, which borders Democratic-leaning Vermont.
In the First District, Representative Frank Guinta was unseated by his predecessor, Carol Shea-Porter, who lost to Mr. Guinta in 2010. This time, Mr. Guinta's voting record in Washington spelled trouble.
The state will soon boast the nation's first all-female Congressional delegation, which already included Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, a Republican.
New Jersey
In a state President Obama carried easily, Senator Robert Menendez just as easily won a second full term, extending the Democrats' record of not losing a New Jersey Senate race in 40 years.
Reapportionment cost New Jersey one House seat, and it was a Democrat whose district was eliminated. The incumbent party won each of the remaining races, leaving the delegation split, 6 to 6.
The House race that drew the most attention and had the closest outcome was in the Third District, just south of the state's midsection. A first-term Republican incumbent, Jon Runyan, held off a challenge by Shelley Adler, the widow of John Adler, the Democrat Mr. Runyan unseated in 2010.
The victory by Mr. Menendez could mean a continued tense relationship between the Democratic senator and the Republican governor, Chris Christie. The governor, eager to topple an antagonist, promoted the candidacy of his friend and ally State Senator Joe Kyrillos.
But Mr. Menendez won with about 58 percent of the vote, roughly the same as Mr. Obama.
Despite New Jersey's fiscal problems, voters easily approved a measure to borrow up to $750 million to upgrade and expand the state's universities.
With the state recovering from Hurricane Sandy, turnout appeared to be down significantly from 2008. Hundreds of polling places were moved on short notice. The state extended voting until Friday for displaced residents and first responders, allowing them to vote by e-mail or fax.
New Mexico
President Obama easily carried New Mexico, taking its five electoral votes.
Representative Martin Heinrich, a Democrat who has represented the First District in Congress for the last four years, won the Senate seat being vacated by Jeff Bingaman, a five-term Democrat. Mr. Heinrich, a former state environmental official, defeated former Representative Heather A. Wilson, a Republican who worked in George H. W. Bush's administration, and Jon Barrie, an independent.
Ms. Wilson needed to attract independents and crossover Democrats to win in this state, where only one-third of registered voters identify themselves as Republicans.
Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, won the seat held by Mr. Heinrich in the First Congressional District, in the Albuquerque area. She was previously secretary of the State Department of Aging and Long-Term Services and then the State Health Department.
Representatives Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat, and Steve Pearce, a Republican, won re-election.
New York
President Obama and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand won by historic margins in one of the largest and most reliably Democratic states, and Democrats expanded their lead in the House delegation.
New York was a crucial congressional battleground, with eight close House races. The state lost two seats to reapportionment, but Democrats maintained 21, while the number held by Republicans dropped to six from eight.
Three first-term House members went down to defeat. In the Hudson Valley, Nan Hayworth, a Republican, lost to Sean Patrick Maloney. Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican in cental New York, lost to former Representative Dan Maffei, the Democrat she unseated two years ago. And in western New York, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, lost to Chris Collins, a Republican.
Among the incumbents who survived close races was Michael Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island who has been dogged by scandal.
Two State Senate races remained too close to call, with control of the chamber in the balance.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, turnout appeared to be down, particularly in parts of Long Island and New York City where residents were coping with storm damage, relocated polling places and long lines to vote.
With nearly all precincts counted, President Obama had 63 percent of the vote, one of the highest presidential marks in state history. Ms. Gillibrand won her first full term with 72 percent, a record for any statewide race.
North Carolina
Of the 11 races for governor this year, the contest in North Carolina was among the most fiercely fought. Pat McCrory, a Republican and the former mayor of Charlotte, won it easily, ending two decades of Democratic control.
President Obama failed to replicate his 2008 win in the state, which became the only swing state to hand its electoral votes to Mitt Romney.
The Republicans also picked up at least three House seats in North Carolina, thanks to redistricting that altered constituencies so significantly that some incumbents simply walked away and others were all but forced to disavow the Democratic Party to have any hope of winning re-election.
Empty seats in Districts 11 and 13 that had been held by Democrats were picked up by two Republicans: Mark Meadows, a real estate developer, and George E. B. Holding, a United States attorney.
In the Seventh District, Larry Kissell, a Democrat, lost his bid for a third term Richard Hudson, a Republican. In the Eighth District, Mike McIntyre, a Democrat, was heading for a recount with just a few hundred votes separating him from David Rouzer, the Republican challenger.
North Dakota
In one of the most solidly Republican states, Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, won a surprising victory in a Senate race, defeating Rick Berg, a Republican who narrowly won a Congressional seat two years ago.
The seat was being vacated by Kent Conrad, a Democrat whose announcement that he would not to run for re-election provoked assumptions that the seat would be easily won by Republicans. But Ms. Heitkamp, a former state attorney general who connected well with voters, ended up winning by nearly 3,000 votes, or 1 percentage point.
Republicans retained the state's lone seat in the House of Representatives, with Kevin Cramer trumping Pam Gulleson, a Democrat.
Ohio
In the end, the $85 billion auto bailout may have been the most influential money spent in the 2012 election. Exit polls in Ohio showed strong support for the president's program to support the auto industry, and voters turned out in droves to thank him for it.
They also helped the Democrats retain their hold on the Senate, voting to keep Sherrod Brown, a true-blue Democrat, in his seat despite a bruising, expensive fight with the Republican state treasurer, Josh Mandel.
The loss of two House seats after the 2010 census and redistricting favored Republicans in the House races.
In the hotly contest 16th District, two sitting House members, James B. Renacci, a Republican, and Betty Sutton, a Democrat, were forced to square off in an expensive race that Mr. Renacci ultimately won.
Bob Gibbs, a Republican who will lose his seat in the 18th District to redistricting, won the seat in the Seventh District that was left empty when Representative Steve Austria was cut out of it by the shift in district lines.
Similarly, Representative Bill Johnson held on to his seat in the Sixth District.
Samuel Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber, the outspoken citizen who was embraced by John McCain and Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign, lost his bid for a House seat to Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat, who will start her 16th term in January.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma is a very red state.
It delivered its seven electoral votes to Mitt Romney and will be sending Republicans to the House of Representatives in all five of its districts.
The Congressional delegation will include one newcomer, Markwayne Mullin, a Republican businessman, who defeated Rob Wallace, a Democrat who has been a state and federal prosecutor. They were competing for the seat now held by a Democrat, Representative Dan Boren, who announced last year that he would not run again in the Second Congressional District in eastern Oklahoma.
Voters also approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw affirmative action in state decisions on hiring and contracts.
Oregon
Democratic presidential candidates carried Oregon in the last seven elections, and President Obama easily won the state's seven electoral votes.
Incumbents retained Oregon's five Congressional seats, with four in the Democrats' column and one in Republican hands.
Democrats also took control of both chambers of the Legislature, retaining a 16-to-14 edge in the Senate and taking a 34-to-26 edge in the House of Representatives, compared with the 30 seats each party has now. Gov. John A. Kitzhaber is also a Democrat.
Among the measures on the ballot, voters rejected an initiative to allow individuals to grow marijuana without a license and to establish a commission to regulate its commercial cultivation and sale. Supporters claimed those measures could raise tens of millions of dollars in taxes and reduce law-enforcement costs. Voters in Colorado and Washington approved similar laws.
An initiative that would have prohibited new real estate transfer taxes was approved.
Pennsylvania
President Obama carried the state, and another incumbent Democrat, Senator Bob Casey, survived a late charge from his Republican challenger, Tim Smith, in a bitterly fought race that polls showed narrowing in the final month.
Democrats had reason to worry. Pennsylvania had voted Democratic in the last five presidential elections. But the 2010 midterm elections -- when Republicans won the governorship, picked up a Senate seat and gained five seats in the House of Representatives -- jolted the old order.
Mr. Smith, a former owner of a coal mine, spent millions of his own fortune on ads depicting Mr. Casey as ''Senator Zero,'' because none of the 300-some bills he had proposed were enacted. Mr. Casey fired back, painting Mr. Smith as a Tea Party extremist.
In the race for state attorney general, Kathleen Kane, the Democrat, defeated David Freed, a Republican, an outcome that could add a new chapter to the sexual abuse scandal surrounding Penn State. Ms. Kane promised that if elected, she would investigate Gov. Tom Corbett's handling of child-molesting accusations against Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach.
Democrats have accused Mr. Corbett, a Republican, of slowing the investigation while he was attorney general to avoid alienating Penn State alumni during his 2010 campaign for governor. Mr. Corbett has denied the accusations.
Rhode Island
In one of the most reliably Democratic states in the nation, Representative David Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, won an unexpectedly closely contested race in the First District, defeating the Republican, Brendan Doherty, a former state police official.
Republicans saw the contest as an opportunity to pick up a seat in a state that President Obama won easily, and they poured money into the race in the final weeks of the campaign.
Two other Democrats, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Jim Langevin, prevailed by large margins. Mr. Whitehouse won a second term in the Senate over Barry Hinckley, a Republican businessman. Mr. Langevin won a seventh term in the House, coasting to victory over Michael Riley, a Republican investment adviser.
South Carolina
South Carolina is reliably Republican, and its residents voted true to form, giving Mitt Romney nearly 55 percent of the vote. Four of the state's House members, Jeff Duncan, Tim Scott, Mick Mulvaney and Trey Gowdy, were freshmen Republicans, and all of them easily won re-election. Joe Wilson, a six-term Republican representative, ran unopposed.
A new Congressional district was captured by the Republican candidate, Tom Rice, an accountant who is chairman of the Horry County Council. His Democratic opponent was Gloria Bromell Tinubu, an economist.
South Carolina's only Democratic House member, James E. Clyburn, who has served since 1993, also won. Mr. Clyburn, a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, faced a Green Party challenger but no Republican challenger.
South Dakota
Much of the attention in South Dakota was focused on ballot measures addressing some of the same questions debated around the country -- taxes, school reform and government spending.
Mitt Romney won handily here, taking 58 percent of the vote, which was no surprise in a heavily Republican state that was not really contested by either side. Kristi Noem, a Republican who narrowly won South Dakota's only seat in the House of Representatives two years ago, won a second term.
Voters rejected by two to one an education-overhaul plan supported by Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, and opposed by the teachers' union. It would have created a system for evaluating teachers and principals, awarded bonuses to teachers who were judged to be high performing, allowed school districts to end tenure for teachers and offered financial incentives to people to teach subjects in which teachers are in short supply. Voters also soundly defeated a proposed sales tax increase to support schools and Medicaid. And in a victory for Mr. Daugaard, they approved a constitutional amendment requiring the state to balance its budget.
Tennessee
Tennessee Democrats had little to celebrate on Tuesday. As expected, Mitt Romney claimed the state's 11 electoral votes, while Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, trounced the Democratic challenger, Mark Clayton.
Republicans also managed to hold onto the Tea Party-infused gains they made in 2010 in the House of Representatives and the State Capitol.
Two Democrats, Jim Cooper of the Fifth District and Steve Cohen of the Ninth District, won re-election.
The race that generated the most excitement was in the Fourth District, where Representative Scott DesJarlais, a staunchly conservative doctor who opposes abortion, was caught up in a late-breaking scandal. In October, a transcript of a phone call between Mr. DesJarlais and a patient with whom he had an affair while he was married appeared to show that he had pressured the woman to have an abortion.
After the revelation, the state's largest and most senior conservative group, the Tennessee Conservative Union, called for Mr. DesJarlais to resign. And Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, filed a complaint saying that the congressman had violated Tennessee law by having sex with a patient.
But his long-shot Democratic competitor, State Senator Eric Stewart, was unable to turn the affair to his advantage, despite late polling that injected optimism into his campaign headquarters, and Mr. DesJarlais coasted to victory.
Texas
Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite, won a seat in the United States Senate. Mr. Cruz, the state's former solicitor general, defeated the Democratic candidate, Paul Sadler, a former state representative, for the seat held by Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is retiring. A tougher battle for Mr. Cruz was in the primary, when he defeated David Dewhurst, the lieutenant governor and the choice of Gov. Rick Perry.
Mr. Perry ran unsuccessfully for president this year and was not up for re-election for the governor's post.
Some questions remain. Will there be consequences for Mr. Perry after his defeat in the presidential primaries? His influence over the Legislature has been strong, but he may meet with resistance if lawmakers sense any political weakness. According to The Texas Tribune, based on unofficial results reported by the Texas secretary of state's office, the new Legislature will not hold a supermajority. The current House has 102 Republicans and 48 Democrats; the new one, which will begin its session in January, will have 95 Republicans and 55 Democrats.
In one of the most closely watched races, Nick Lampson lost his bid to return to Congress. He has had an up-and-down career: He was a congressman until redistricting forced him out in 2004. He went on to win the Houston-area seat vacated by Tom DeLay in 2006 but was defeated after a single term. On Tuesday he lost to Randy Weber, a Republican.
Democrats accused officials in Galveston County of mismanaging the election, after numerous polling sites experienced delays in opening. A judge issued an order extending voting by two hours Tuesday night in response to the delays.
Many of the problems stemmed from the failure of poll workers known as election judges to allow enough time to set up electronic voting machines and from the preparation of the machines taking longer than anticipated, county officials said.
Lloyd Criss, chairman of the county's Democratic Party, said he was considering filing a lawsuit against the county clerk, Dwight D. Sullivan.
Utah
Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat, won by the slightest of margins in Utah's new Fourth District, defeating Mia Love, who would have become the first black person to represent Utah in a national office and the first black female Republican in the House.
With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Matheson held a 2,646-vote lead with provisional and mail-in ballots yet to be counted. But Ms. Love, a Brooklyn-born Mormon convert of Haitian descent who catapulted herself onto the national stage with her unyielding criticism of President Obama, conceded defeat.
''It was a close race, but ultimately the voters of Utah have spoken,'' The Salt Lake Tribune quoted Ms. Love as saying.
Mr. Matheson, a fellow Mormon, was a popular six-term Democrat in Utah's Second District. But he decided to run in the Fourth District after the Republican-controlled Legislature redrew the state's Congressional boundaries last year, diluting his support base. Polls showed him and Ms. Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, a small farming community 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, neck and neck late in the race as both Tea Party members and mainstream conservatives rallied behind her.
The hotly contested race drew plenty of outside money for both candidates.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican, was elected to a seventh term, making him the most senior Republican in the Senate.
Vermont
Vermont, a steadily blue state, gave its three electoral votes to President Obama, with voters choosing Mr. Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of more than two to one.
The state's voters also re-elected Bernie Sanders, an independent, to the United States Senate, almost three to one over the Republican candidate, John MacGovern.
Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, defeated Randy Brock for re-election. Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat, also was re-elected.
There were no ballot measures before Vermont voters this year.
Virginia
Tim Kaine, a former governor and a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was elected to the United States Senate on Tuesday, denying a bid by George Allen, a former senator, to regain the seat he lost in 2006.
Virginia is historically very conservative, but the northern suburbs near Washington, where many government workers live, have bolstered Democrats' numbers. They did that again on Tuesday night when President Obama pushed past Mitt Romney to carry the state, as he did in 2008.
Both the Senate race and the presidential race were tight to the end, but in the final count, Mr. Kaine led by almost five percentage points over Mr. Allen, and Mr. Obama led by three percentage points over Mr. Romney.
Six in 10 voters surveyed as they left the polls said the economy was the most important issue facing the country, with health care and foreign policy far behind. Forty percent of those polled said unemployment was the biggest economic problem facing people like them, followed by rising prices.
Virginia voters were split on taxes and on whether the Obama health care plan should be repealed. Washington
Washington voters legalized marijuana for people over 21. The ballot initiative legalizes the drug not only for those who need it for medical reasons, but also for those who want to use it recreationally.
The new law, which may face a challenge from the federal authorities that continue to classify marijuana as an illegal drug, limits how much of the drug's component chemical, THC, a person may have in the blood in order to drive legally.
A referendum to legalize same-sex marriage also passed, with 51.8 percent of the vote. Gov. Christine O. Gregoire, a Democrat, signed same-sex marriage into law last winter, but it was not enforced after opponents, backed by nearly 250,000 signatures, submitted petitions for a referendum.
The marriage proposition had become a top talking point among those seeking to replace Ms. Gregoire, who is retiring. Former Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat, supports same-sex marriage, while his competitor, Rob McKenna, the state attorney general and a Republican, is opposed.
By Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Inslee was ahead of Mr. McKenna with about half of precincts reporting.
West Virginia
Huge numbers of West Virginians split their ballots, handing Mitt Romney the state's five electoral votes, and re-electing Senator Joe Manchin III and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, both Democrats.
Mr. Romney's victory there was no surprise. He held a double-digit lead in the polls going into Tuesday.
But Mr. Manchin's and Mr. Tomblin's races were tighter. Tuesday's results suggested that both incumbents catered just enough to Republicans' concerns to persuade them to keep the Democrats in office.
Mr. Tomblin, a former State Senate president who won office last year in a special election, faced Bill Maloney, a Republican and a former drilling company owner.
In the Senate race, Mr. Manchin, a former governor, beat John Raese, a Republican businessman, in a reprise of the 2010 special election to fill the seat held for a half-century by Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died that year.
Wisconsin
If there was an election night outcome that was all but certain, it was that Representative Paul D. Ryan stood a good chance of remaining in Washington. The vice-presidential candidate would have done so if Mitt Romney had been elected president. But if the Republican presidential ticket lost -- as it ultimately did -- Mr. Ryan knew he would probably retain his seat representing the state's First Congressional District. He won re-election handily on Tuesday.
Despite Mr. Ryan's Wisconsin pedigree, President Obama won the state by nearly six percentage points, thanks, at least in part, to support from labor unions and voters who approved of the auto industry bailout. A majority of voters in exit polls also blamed President George W. Bush, not Mr. Obama, for the economy's problems.
Mr. Obama's victory helped Tammy Baldwin win the Senate seat vacated by Herb Kohl, a four-term Democrat. Ms. Baldwin, a Democratic representative, beat Tommy Thompson, a former Republican governor and a secretary of health and human services under President Bush. Ms. Baldwin will become the first openly gay member of the Senate.
Of Wisconsin's eight Congressional races, three were safely retained by Democrats and three by Republicans, including Mr. Ryan.
The Seventh District seat, once held by David R. Obey, the senior Democrat, was won by the Republican incumbent, Sean P. Duffy, who has served in the House since 2010. Mr. Duffy, who appeared on MTV's ''The Real World,'' faced former State Senator Pat Kreitlow, a onetime television anchor. Redistricting made the district more Republican.
Wyoming
Wyoming is so reliably Republican that its three electoral votes were scarcely in doubt.
Mitt Romney carried the state, as did the Republican candidate for United States Senate, John Barrasso, and the Republican who held the state's Congressional seat, Cynthia Lummis.
This will be Mr. Barrasso's first full term; he was appointed by the governor to fill the seat of Senator Craig Thomas, who died of leukemia in 2007, and elected the next year to finish the final four years of Mr. Thomas's term.
Voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment that would block any government action that would force the state's residents to buy health insurance -- a law intended to allow the state to come up with alternatives to the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. They also voted to place a ''personal right'' to hunt in the State Constitution.

HEADLINE: Back to Bargaining Table, With Fiscal Cliff Dead Ahead

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JACKIE CALMES; Jonathan Weisman and John H. Cushman Jr. contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, striking a conciliatory tone a day after the Republican Party's electoral drubbing, said on Wednesday that he was ready to accept a budget deal that raises federal revenue as long as it is linked to an overhaul of entitlements and a reform of the tax code that closes loopholes, curtails or eliminates deductions and lowers income tax rates.
Mr. Boehner's gesture was the most explicit offer he has made to avert the ''fiscal cliff'' in January, when billions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts go into force. And it came hours after Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, offered his own olive branch, saying ''it's better to dance than to fight.''
''Mr. President, this is your moment,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters in the Capitol. ''We're ready to be led, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans.'' 
The offer may be enough to bring the parties to the table in the wake of an election that kept President Obama in power, strengthened the Democrats' grip on the Senate and chipped away at the still-large Republican majority in the House.
But Democrats and Republicans are still far apart. Mr. Boehner made it clear that his vision for additional revenue includes a tax code that lowers even the top income tax rate from where it is now, 35 percent, not where it would be in January when the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire -- 39.6 percent. At least some of that additional revenue would come from economic growth that he said would be fueled by a simpler tax code.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat, has said those constructs are unacceptable. Democratic leaders say tax reform that lowers tax rates across the board would either hurt the middle class by trimming vital tax benefits like the home mortgage deduction or would not raise enough taxes to meaningfully reduce the deficit. Mr. Reid underscored Mr. Obama's contention that tax rates on the rich must rise, saying ''the vast majority of Americans'' support that, ''including rich people.''
But in language and timing, the leaders of Congress's two chambers left the unmistakable impression that they want a deal at least large enough to avert the worst economic impacts of a sudden rise in income, payroll, capital gains, dividend, interest and estate tax rates that would affect virtually every American family, working or not. Mr. Boehner has said for months that a deal to reform taxes and entitlements and substantially lower the deficit is not appropriate for a lame-duck Congress.
But facing a Congress next year that will be less Republican than the current one, he suggested on Wednesday that he would favor a deal that would serve at least as ''a down payment on -- and a catalyst for -- major solutions, enacted in 2013.''
He said he had spoken to the president on Wednesday before making his statement to reporters.
''I'm not suggesting we compromise on our principles,'' he said, ''but I am suggesting we commit ourselves to creating an atmosphere where we can see common ground when it exists and seize it.''
Mr. Obama enters the next fray with heightened leverage, both sides agree, especially on what he sees as the most immediate issue: Whether Republicans will relent and extend the Bush-era income tax cuts, which expire Dec. 31, except for households with taxable income above $250,000 a year.
Yet if Mr. Obama received a mandate for nothing else after a campaign in which he was vague on second-term prescriptions, he can and will claim one for the proposition that the wealthiest Americans like himself and Mitt Romney should pay higher income taxes. That stance was a staple of Mr. Obama's campaign stump speeches for more than a year. And in surveys of those leaving the polls on Tuesday, voters overwhelmingly agreed with him.
''This election tells us a lot about the political wisdom of defending tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everything else,'' a senior administration official said early on Wednesday.
In his victory speech, Mr. Obama offered what the White House intended as an early olive branch. ''In the coming weeks and months,'' he said, ''I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together: reducing our deficit, reforming our tax code, fixing our immigration system, freeing ourselves from foreign oil.''
Much pre-election speculation held that a result like what occurred -- essentially maintaining the status quo with Mr. Obama in the White House; Democrats in control of the Senate, though now with an unexpectedly padded majority; and Republicans still leading the House -- would make for continued gridlock and a fall off the fiscal cliff at some cost to the recovery.
Yet there are counter views. For one thing, had Mitt Romney won, the rough consensus in both parties was that he and Congress would have delayed the scheduled imposition of automatic tax increases and spending cuts for at least six months and up to a year to give Mr. Romney time to staff his administration and outline a plan. And that delay would have been compounded by an all but certain standoff between a new president dedicated to cutting taxes deeply, not raising them, and Democrats in Congress intent on getting tax increases on high incomes in exchange for their assent to future reductions in Medicare and Medicaid.
Also, as the administration and a few other optimists in both parties see it, with the same division of power, the two sides can immediately take up where they left off in 2011. That year, repeated efforts for a bipartisan budget deal ultimately collapsed on the tax issue and on Democrats' refusal to consider reductions in the fast-growing entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid unless Republicans compromised.
Each side said the voters would decide in November 2012. Now they have, and Mr. Obama and the two parties in Congress can get back to the bargaining table, where their differences remain in place but so, too, do some tentative agreements on spending cuts. Had Mr. Romney won, the two sides would have faced months of start-from-scratch, get-acquainted bargaining, farther apart than ever on the matter of taxes and entitlement benefits.
Mr. McConnell, in his statement congratulating Mr. Obama early Wednesday, said, ''Now it's time for the president to propose solutions that actually have a chance of passing the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a closely divided Senate.''
He added: ''To the extent he wants to move to the political center, which is where the work gets done in a divided government, we'll be there to meet him halfway. That begins by proposing a way for both parties to work together in avoiding the 'fiscal cliff' without harming a weak and fragile economy, and when that is behind us, work with us to reform the tax code and our broken entitlement system.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, his hand strengthened somewhat, called for Congress to work quickly to resolve the looming fiscal issues in the lame duck session.
''I am going to do anything in my power to be as conciliatory as possible,'' he said Wednesday in a news conference on Capitol Hill. ''I want to work together. But I want everyone also to understand, you can't push us around.''
Mr. Reid said the election showed that the public wanted the richest taxpayers to pay more taxes, and he gave no hint of compromise on that matter, perhaps the central point on which the presidential campaign hinged. He also said that a temporary fix for the fiscal impasse was not a good idea.
''I am not for kicking the can down the road,'' he said. ''Waiting for a month, six weeks, six months, that is not going to solve the problem.''

HEADLINE: Triumphant Obama Faces New Foe in 'Second-Term Curse'

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Now that President Obama has overcome Mitt Romney, ''super PACs'' and a sluggish economy, he faces a challenge with deep roots in political history: what historians and commentators call the ''second-term curse.''
It is almost a truism that second terms are less successful than first terms, especially domestically. Franklin Delano Roosevelt lost his hold on Congress with his 1937 plan to pack the Supreme Court. Ronald Reagan faced the 1986 Iran-contra scandal. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. Richard Nixon resigned to avoid that fate in 1974.
Even George Washington had angry mobs surrounding his house in Philadelphia to denounce him for the Jay Treaty with Britain dealing with the aftermath of the Revolutionary War; they wanted him to side with France.
But despite these and other failures, most second-term presidents also have accomplishments to be proud of, though perhaps shadowed by a tinge of failure. 
Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a veteran of the Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations, said there were several explanations for the second-term curse.
One is that presidents try to push their best ideas when they first take office, often leaving them, he said, without ''a whole new set of ideas'' for the second.
Presidents also select the best members of the White House staff or cabinet when they first take office. When the pressure cooker of Washington or better jobs lead those first choices away, their successors are often not their equals.
Roosevelt may have had the most accursed second term. The biographer Jean Edward Smith called it ''a disaster.'' After the 1936 death of Louis Howe, his closest adviser for years, he had no one to tell him what a bad idea the court-packing scheme was. It split his party. Conservative Democrats deserted him and allied with Republicans to deny him almost all domestic legislation.
And while that hurt Roosevelt politically -- Mr. Smith said he ''shot himself in the foot'' -- he followed with an even worse decision, cutting federal spending in the belief that the Depression was conquered. That brought on a deep recession. With that decision, Mr. Smith wrote, Roosevelt ''shot the country in the foot.''
Overwhelming victory can often lead to second-term hubris, persuading a president that the country thinks he can do no wrong. As Lou Cannon, the Reagan biographer and Washington Post White House reporter, observed: ''Landslides are dangerous to the victor.'' Roosevelt lost only two states in 1936; Nixon lost only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia in 1972.
Reagan lost only one state in 1984, and the next two years were ''the least successful of Reagan's 16 years in office,'' including his years as governor of California, Mr. Cannon said. Even a narrow victory can create overconfidence. In 2004, George W. Bush won 50.7 percent of the vote, which was no landslide (even compared with his 48.3 percent share four years earlier). But he treated the victory as a huge mandate, and plunged ahead with a plan to privatize Social Security in 2005, as he had promised during his re-election campaign.
But the Social Security plan went nowhere. Republicans cringed, and Democrats eagerly united in opposition.
Second-term presidents are also lame ducks, parrying ambitious would-be successors in the opposition and in their own party. Dwight Eisenhower often complained of the recently enacted 22nd Amendment, limiting presidents to two terms. But earlier presidents faced the same problem, because tradition back to George Washington had established the same term limit, until Roosevelt ran for his third term.
But are second terms inevitably cursed?
Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar at George Mason University, argues for a more nuanced approach to measuring them.
Eisenhower, who easily won re-election, is his prime example. He lacked new ideas, and he lost key cabinet officers and his chief of staff, Sherman Adams. He was embarrassed when a U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and Nikita Khrushchev scuttled a Paris summit meeting in response.
But Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock in 1957 to keep Gov. Orval Faubus of Arkansas from thwarting court-ordered school desegregation. And his 1961 farewell address classically warned, ''We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.''
Most important, Eisenhower kept the peace with the Soviet Union, an accomplishment hardly predictable in the '50s.
For President Clinton, there was the first balanced budget in decades, achieved in 1997 because Republicans wanted an accomplishment that they, too, could claim. And Mr. Clinton gained international respect for forcing the Serbs to halt a genocidal campaign in Kosovo without putting NATO troops on the ground. But impeachment was a grave scar, not only for him, but for his accusers as well. Months of debate over the issue led to Democratic gains in the House in the midterm 1998 elections.
Roosevelt accomplished little domestically in his second term, beyond the appointments of Supreme Court justices who shaped the law for many years. But his oratory and cunning moved an isolationist nation and Congress to side with Britain and France against Germany. And he began rebuilding the nation's military as World War II loomed. He also made a brilliant personnel choice, bypassing senior generals to elevate Gen. George C. Marshall to the post of Army chief of staff.
President Bush failed to achieve many legislative goals -- privatizing Social Security, liberalizing immigration and overhauling the tax code. But he did win a vast increase in spending on AIDS treatment and prevention in Africa and a modest stimulus measure in 2008. And his most substantial achievement was the Troubled Assets Relief Program, a $700 billion program to rescue banks caught in the subprime mortgage mess.
Nixon achieved little domestically in his foreshortened second term. But after the Paris Peace Accords were signed just after his second inauguration in 1973, American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam and prisoners of war were released. In the Middle East, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy that fall ended the Arab-Israeli war. Nixon also believed that the role of the United States in overthrowing President Salvador Allende of Chile was a signal success, though today it seems a grave mistake.
For Reagan, the troubles of his second term were offset by the 1986 tax law, which closed loopholes and used the savings to lower tax rates, and his arms control agreements with Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
Presidents cannot control everything in their second terms, and President Obama has a few obstacles that are special to him. The president and Congress must be willing to work together, which in a deeply partisan Washington may be difficult to accomplish in the next four years. And like other modern presidents, Mr. Obama must cope with a ''snarky'' news media, said Mr. Smith, the George Mason University scholar, which glare at a president, magnifying anything that looks like success, or, especially, failure.

HEADLINE: A Panoply of Relationships for Obama to Strengthen and Redefine

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If history is any guide, President Obama will cast his eye abroad over the next four years, hoping to put an imprint on the world that matches the sweeping domestic programs of his first term. From Iran and Russia to China and the Middle East, there are plenty of opportunities, but also perils, for a leader seeking a statesman's legacy.
Many of the issues Mr. Obama will have no choice but to address. For months, decisions on a number of festering problem areas have been deferred by administration officials until after the election. And yet as Richard M. Nixon did in opening ties to China or Ronald Reagan in embracing arms control, Mr. Obama could see the foreign policy arena as a place to achieve something more lasting in a second term than crisis management and more satisfying than the gridlock that has bedeviled his domestic initiatives. 
Atop Mr. Obama's list, administration officials and foreign policy experts agree, is a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program. The United States is likely to engage the Iranian government in direct negotiations in the next few months, officials said, in what would be a last-ditch diplomatic effort to head off a military strike on its nuclear facilities.
Officials insist they have not set a date for talks nor do they know if Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has blessed them. But with Iran's centrifuges spinning and Israel threatening its own strike, the clock is ticking, and it may put pressure on the Iranians to make a deal, particularly between now and Iran's presidential elections next June.
''If they can achieve something during that period, it would create a new dynamic and create a very promising opening,'' said Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group based in Washington that favors diplomacy.
While Mr. Obama can scarcely hope for something as seminal as President Nixon's famous journey to Beijing, experts say he has the chance to forge a new relationship with China that takes into account its rising economic might.
Last year, the president articulated a ''strategic pivot'' from the Middle East to China and Asia. Critics said there was less to the initiative than met the eye. But with four more years, Mr. Obama could put meat on the bones of an ambitious, if incomplete, policy.
To be credible in Asia, experts said, the United States will need a robust military presence from the Yellow Sea to the South China Sea. But unless the White House and Congress strike a fiscal deal, the Pentagon will face deep budget cuts, depriving it of the ability to project such power. The challenge will be to assert a big role without precipitating a clash with Beijing. ''It's going to have to be very deft and subtle in its implementation because there's going to be pushback from the Chinese,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state who teaches at Harvard.
There may also be an opening for Mr. Obama with Russia on one of his most cherished issues: nuclear nonproliferation. Among the most intriguing congratulatory telegrams the president received this week was from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who had taken a bristling tone toward the United States for much of the last year. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin and his surrogates signaled a willingness to make deals with the United States.
In his infamous remark to then-President Dmitri A. Medvedev last March, picked up by an open microphone, Mr. Obama promised ''flexibility'' after the election on a missile defense system based in Europe -- a concession Mr. Putin, who succeeded Mr. Medvedev last May, has long sought. In Washington, a government review group has been quietly preparing strategic arms-reductions proposals.
''It's teed up for the president to make the decision,'' said Steven Pifer, director of the Arms Control Initiative at the Brookings Institution. ''If you think about what his legacy would be, this is something he would like to leave behind.''
For Mr. Obama, the Middle East is generally less a landscape for bold new initiatives than a place for triage. On situations as varied as the crackdown in Syria and the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, the president will have to fight to keep intact even the vestiges of the overture he made to the Islamic world early in his presidency.
But other unfinished business remains there -- not least Mr. Obama's frustrated efforts to broker a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. But several experts expressed doubt that the president would thrust himself again into the role of Middle East peacemaker.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has had a fraught relationship with Mr. Obama, seems likely to stay in power with a right-wing government.
''Because he got his fingers burned and was outmaneuvered by Netanyahu, he will wait to see the outcome in the Israeli election,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel.
Mr. Obama will not be able to avoid one issue. Over American and Israeli objections, the Palestinian Authority's president, Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, is likely to petition for nonstate membership in the United Nations next month -- a step he had put off for the election. If the United Nations were to grant that, it would cause Congress to cut off aid not only to the Palestinian Authority but also to the United Nations.
''He doesn't have an easy way to head off this vote,'' said Mr. Indyk, one of the authors of a book about Mr. Obama's foreign policy, ''Bending History.'' ''But if Obama sends a message to Abu Mazen that he is going to reinvigorate the peace process, this could give Abu Mazen a way to climb down from the tree he's in.''

HEADLINE: Long Retired, Ex-Leader of China Asserts Sway Over Top Posts

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Amy Qin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In a year of scandals and corruption charges at the commanding heights of the Communist Party, a retired party chief some had written off as a spent force has thrust himself back into China's most important political decisions and emerged as a dominant figure shaping the future leadership.
The resurgence of Jiang Zemin, the 86-year-old former leader, is all the more striking because he was said last year to be near death. But over recent months, Mr. Jiang, who left office a decade ago, has worked assiduously behind the scenes, voicing frustration with the record of his successor, Hu Jintao, and maneuvering to have his protégés dominate the party's incoming ruling group. He even weighed in on how to deal with Bo Xilai, the populist political figure who was caught up in a major scandal and was investigated after his wife was accused of murdering a British businessman.
Mr. Jiang has also sought to shape policy, party insiders say, by proposing changes to an agenda-setting report presented Thursday at the start of the 18th Party Congress, the weeklong meeting that precedes the naming of Mr. Hu's replacement and a new generation of leaders. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu arrived together at the Great Hall of the People, before others in the senior leadership -- another sign of Mr. Jiang's influence. 
Mr. Jiang's goal, those insiders say, appears to be to put China back on a path toward market-oriented economic policies that he and his allies argue stagnated under a decade of cautious leadership by Mr. Hu, a colorless party leader who favored more traditional socialist programs and allowed gargantuan state-owned companies to amass greater wealth and influence. Many see Mr. Jiang, who brought China into the World Trade Organization and rebuilt ties to the United States after a breakdown in 1989, as favoring deeper ties to the West and more opportunities for China's private sector.
Mr. Jiang was able to outflank Mr. Hu to shape a new lineup for the Politburo Standing Committee, the top decision-making body, which appears to have Jiang allies chosen for five of the projected seven seats, according to party insiders. The most prominent is Xi Jinping, the designated heir to Mr. Hu as party chief and president.
''Look at the final seven people and you know who the big winner is: Jiang, or Jiang and Xi,'' said an editor at a party media organization. ''The loser is Hu.''
That Mr. Jiang has been able to insert himself so boldly shows how diluted power has become at the apex of the Communist Party, just as policy makers and intellectuals from all quarters say the nation needs strong leadership to guide it through a period of a slowing economy and rising social discontent.
Some supporters of Mr. Jiang say his involvement might give greater confidence to policy makers who could prove more amenable than Mr. Hu to loosening the hold of state-owned conglomerates in some crucial sectors, like finance and transportation, and also more inclined to establish a credible legal system that operates with a degree of autonomy from the party.
Such steps could inject vigor into the economy, while also signaling modest steps toward accountability demanded by China's expanding middle class.
Even so, Mr. Jiang's return to the center of party politics also exposes fundamental weaknesses in a system that relies on factional alliances and aging patriarchs to make crucial decisions.
China's ambitions to rise to be a modern global power remain yoked to a secretive political system in which true authority resides in hidden recesses. That could spell trouble for Mr. Hu's presumed successor, Mr. Xi, who has yet to establish his own credentials as the party's ultimate authority. When the congress ends next week, there will be 20 retired Standing Committee members, most of whom expect some say in running the country and appointing allies.
Mr. Jiang does not possess the indomitable behind-the-scenes power once held by Deng Xiaoping, who ushered in market reforms after the death of Mao Zedong. But a year of division and uncertainty has created openings for Mr. Jiang to shape important decisions.
''The atmosphere seems very tense,'' said Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. analyst now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who recently visited Beijing. ''The problem is that there's no senior figure in charge -- there's no revolutionary elder to act as arbiter and manage the different groups.''
''My sense of the games that Jiang is playing is, 'This is my last hurrah, and I want to show that I still matter,' '' Mr. Johnson said.
Mr. Jiang retired as party secretary in November 2002 and stepped down as state president the following March. He remained the chief of China's military until late 2004, which led to impatience among many party officials. His relationship with his successor has been a delicate one, shaped by the fact that Mr. Hu was put on the path to the top leadership by the party patriarch, Mr. Deng, leaving Mr. Jiang with no independent choice over who would succeed him.
The decade-long rule of Mr. Hu and Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, has been criticized as a period when China's leaders, despite robust economic growth over much of that period, bolstered state enterprises, expanded the security apparatus and eroded basic legal protections. Mr. Jiang has been the most powerful voice privately criticizing the Hu administration's policies.
''His line of attack has been that Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have been too cautious about reform, and the slowdown in growth might have been mitigated by more aggressive reforms earlier on,'' one official said.
Any calls for reform in China encompass a broad array of possibilities. Some intellectuals and policy advisers are seeking a significant relaxation of China's authoritarian political system, but there is no sign Mr. Jiang backs any such transformation. Instead, he seems primarily focused on economic issues.
Mr. Jiang was able to raise his concerns about the direction of policy when invited to comment on a draft of the political report that was presented to the congress, two party insiders said. That report is intended to sum up the achievements under Mr. Hu, but also to sketch out future priorities. After Mr. Hu gave a 100-minute speech on the report on Thursday, delegates applauded for several seconds, but Mr. Jiang clapped faintly just a few times.
Political insiders said Mr. Jiang's involvement in determining the new Standing Committee, expected to be announced at the end of the congress next week, is his clearest expression of impatience with Mr. Hu's policies and faction. Months ago, analysts had expected the incoming committee to be almost evenly balanced between Hu and Jiang allies. But Mr. Jiang's power plays, aided by scandals this year, including one that weakened Ling Jihua, a powerful aide of Mr. Hu's, have changed that.
One recent move by Mr. Jiang was to strongly back Yu Zhengsheng, the party chief of Shanghai, for a Standing Committee seat. Other Jiang allies expected to join the committee are Zhang Dejiang, a vice prime minister and party chief of Chongqing; Zhang Gaoli, the party chief of Tianjin; and Wang Qishan, another vice prime minister.
Of the favorites for the committee, only Li Keqiang, the designated prime minister, and Liu Yunshan, director of the party's propaganda department, are considered allies of Mr. Hu's. But even Mr. Liu received a career lift under Mr. Jiang.Five of the seven would retire after one five-year term because of an age limit.
Mr. Jiang's motives are not entirely clear. While several people say he mounted his political offensive in the name of reform, some say his allies in crucial party posts previously hindered any bold moves by Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen. And the proposed lineup that bears his imprint appears to be short of officials known to advocate market-driven growth and less state meddling. The two Zhangs are reputed to be conservative, and Mr. Wang, a supporter of a more open financial sector, looks unlikely to be given a major role in economic policy.
In principle, Mr. Jiang and other leaders are supposed to retreat from any public role in setting policy after leaving office. Since retiring, Mr. Jiang has been following a regimen of swimming, listening to tutorials with scholars, and preparing his biography and other publications, an aide to a prominent official said.
But Mr. Jiang has also used a succession of statements and appearances to signal that he remains active in politics. A preface he wrote to a history textbook published in July served to remind readers that he was paying attention to the party's future. Despite China's spectacular growth and rising power, he wrote, ''we must clearly recognize that there are still many hardships and challenges on our road forward, in both domestic and external conditions.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Grapple for Answers After Loss

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
It was the morning of the Republican hangover.
After four years in which the jobless rate never dipped below 7.8 percent, with millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed and median household income falling, Republicans still failed to unseat President Obama and, for the second election in a row, fell short in their efforts to win control of a Senate that seemed within reach. The Wednesday-morning quarterbacking began quickly.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, captured the feelings of many Republicans when he said in a statement that ''we have a period of reflection and recalibration ahead for the Republican Party.'' 
''While some will want to blame one wing of the party over the other,'' Mr. Cornyn said in a statement, ''the reality is candidates from all corners of our G.O.P. lost tonight. Clearly we have work to do in the weeks and months ahead.''
There was no shortage of theories -- sometimes contradictory -- from inside and outside party in the first hours after the 2012 elections.
Some analysts and Republican strategists argued that the party could not win while alienating the growing Hispanic vote with its tough stance on immigration, could no longer afford to nominate candidates who fired up its conservative and Tea Party wings but turned off the more moderate voters in general elections, and that it had to find ways to win more support from women and young voters. But some conservatives took the opposite view, arguing that Mitt Romney had been essentially too moderate, a candidate who had won the minds if not the hearts of the party's base.
But a number of Republican strategists who have worked on recent presidential campaigns argued that demography is destiny, and that the party was falling out of step with a changing country.
John Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., has long argued that the party's reliance on the votes of older white men was putting it on a demographically unsustainable path.
''We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men, or we can fight to become a national governing party,'' Mr. Weaver said in an interview. ''And to do the latter we have to fix our Hispanic problem as quickly as possible, we've got to accept science and start calling out these false equivalencies when they occur within our party about things that are just not true, and not tolerate the intolerant.''
Matthew Dowd, who was a top adviser in the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, said on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' that the Republican Party had become a '''Mad Men' party in a 'Modern Family' America.''
And Mark McKinnon, another former strategist for President Bush and Mr. McCain, argued that the party ''needs messages and policies that appeal to a broader audience.''
''This election proved that trying to expand a shrinking base ain't gonna cut it,'' Mr. McKinnon said in an e-mail. ''It's time to put some compassion back in conservatism. The party needs more tolerance, more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.''
But not everyone was urging the party to run to the center. ''No doubt the media will insist that Republicans must change, must sprint to the center, must embrace social liberalism, must accept that America is destined to play a less dominant role in the world,'' Fred Barnes wrote on the blog of The Weekly Standard. ''All that is hogwash, which is why Republicans are likely to reject it. Their ideology is not a problem.''
''But there is also a hole in the Republican electorate,'' he continued. ''There aren't enough Hispanics. As long as two-thirds of the growing Hispanic voting bloc lines up with Democrats, it will be increasingly difficult (though hardly impossible) for Republicans to win national elections. When George W. Bush won a narrow re-election in 2004, he got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. If Romney had managed that, he would have come closer to winning. He might even have won.''
And Erick Erickson made this plea at RedState.com: ''Just please, G.O.P., please -- in four years let's not go with the 'he's the most electable' argument. The most electable usually aren't.''
Richard A. Viguerie, the chairman of ConservativeHQ.com and a pioneer in the field of political direct mail, released a statement saying that the party should never again nominate ''a biggovernment establishment Republican'' for president.
''Mitt Romney's loss was the death rattle of the establishment G.O.P.,'' Mr. Viguerie said in the statement. ''Far from signaling a rejection of the Tea Party or grass-roots conservatives, the disaster of 2012 signals the beginning of the battle to take over the Republican Party and the opportunity to establish the G.O.P. as the party of small-government constitutional conservatism.''
But there were bright spots for the party. Aided by redistricting, Republicans kept their hold on the House, and Speaker John A. Boehner announced that he would be speaking Wednesday afternoon about the ''fiscal cliff and the need for both parties to find common ground.''
Republicans extended their dominance in state government, picking up at least one governor's seat Tuesday night and increasing the number of Republican governors to 30, the most there have been in more than a decade. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said that the state-level gains Republicans made in ''provides optimism for the future.''
And of course, even two years in politics is a long time. Just after Mr. McCain lost the 2008 elections there was similar hand-wringing in the party. Two years later, Republicans made historic gains in the midterm elections.

HEADLINE: For Leaders Struggling With Europe's Economic Stress, Election an Ocean Away Hits Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maïa de la Baume and Scott Sayare contributed reporting from Paris, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The victory of President Obama after a campaign that turned partly on the role of government in the American economy is likely to resonate in some unusual ways across the Atlantic, where European leaders remain locked in a contentious struggle over austerity, slow growth and the future of the European welfare state.
Though European politics have their own dynamic, the role of government in a time of economic stress, which figured prominently in the campaign, is deeply divisive here as well. European experts said both President François Hollande, a pro-growth Socialist who just proposed a $25 billion cut in business taxes for France, and Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy seemed to gain the most politically from Mr. Obama's victory. 
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and the high priest of European austerity, may have more to lose. Austerity has significantly deepened Europe's slump this year, many economists say, and Ms. Merkel is facing a tougher challenge from fellow European leaders as well as her own opposition Social Democrats in Germany, who could gain from the re-election of a Democratic president in the United States who favors national health care and fiscal stimulus.
For the British prime minister, David Cameron, who championed austerity, the re-election of Mr. Obama may deprive him of an economic soul mate, but it also leaves in place a firm ally on issues of free trade and security.
The impact of Mr. Obama's re-election may be limited to a degree by his faded appeal around the Continent compared with 2008, when he was hailed as a hero.
''This is a president whose policies are closer to European policies,'' said Laurence Nardon, head of the United States program at the French Institute for International Relations. ''The French adore Obama but in a strange way, because he is not very warm and he hasn't truly clicked with European countries.''
He is seen as generally supportive of European efforts to deal more firmly and quickly with the euro crisis, sending Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to hector European leaders to act fast and not rely only on austerity measures to deal with fiscal debt. For a time, Mr. Geithner's name was reviled by some Europeans, especially Germans, as someone handing out advice while letting the American debt balloon far beyond European levels.
There was greater appreciation in Italy from supporters of Mr. Monti, who found a quiet ally in Mr. Obama against the austerity dogma of Germany.
''I think Mario Monti found a good talking partner in Obama,'' said Sergio Romano, a columnist for the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera and a former ambassador. ''Even if Obama is not particularly involved in European issues, the resolution of E.U. woes has been essential to his economic policy, and Monti offered him a guarantee that Italy was acting. On the other hand, Monti needed to restore Italy's political, economic and financial credibility at the international level, and Obama offered him a chance to do so.''
Mr. Hollande summed up the hopes of the European left neatly in his official congratulations to Mr. Obama, which he sent to ''Cher Barack.'' ''Your re-election is a clear choice in favor of an America that is open, united, fully engaged on the international scene and conscious of our planet's challenges: peace, the economy and the environment,'' Mr. Hollande said. He added that he hoped the election result would bring a renewed focus on ''economic growth to battle against unemployment in our countries.''
Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said Ms. Merkel, who is up for re-election this year, ultimately has a decent working relationship with Mr. Obama, despite their clear differences.
''Merkel and Obama embrace very different economic philosophies,'' Mr. Perthes said. ''She doesn't much like Keynesianism and quantitative easing. But it's easier for them to work with the people they know.''
In any case, the German model of social market capitalism that Ms. Merkel favors remains left-wing in American terms, reliant on a large state welfare system and national health care. ''There would not have been much fun between Merkel and Paul Ryan,'' Mr. Perthes said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain Modestly in Europe and Asia

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Stocks fell in Europe and were mixed in Asia on Wednesday after President Barack Obama's re-election and a gloomy forecast for Europe from the European Commission. 
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was down 1.6 percent after early gains, while the FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.8 percent.
Trading on Wall Street was also lower, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were down 1.4 percent, as was the Dow Jones industrial average.
The S.&P./ASX 200 in Australia closed up 0.7 percent, as did the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong. The Nikkei 225 stock average ended Japan trading little changed.
The currency market was calm, with the dollar trading at 80.26 yen, little changed, and the euro ticking up 0.3 percent from Tuesday's New York close, to $1.2848.
In a significant downgrading of expectations, the European Commission said gross domestic product would shrink by 0.3 percent for the 27 members of the Union as a whole and by 0.4 percent for the 17 countries in the euro area. Growth in 2013 will be a meager 0.4 percent across the Union and only 0.1 percent in the euro area, it said.
Analysts also pointed to the continuing political deadlock in Washington as a cause for concern, as Republicans held on to the House of Representatives and Democrats the Senate.
Investors have been keeping a close eye on the spending cuts and tax increases at the federal level that will come into force at the start of next year unless politicians can agree to an alternative in the next few weeks. That ''fiscal cliff'' has begun to overshadow worries about the euro zone's problems and questions about the Chinese economy.
''This essentially means that we are faced with a political landscape very much as discounted by consensus and the polls in advance of the outcome,'' Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds Banking in London, said in a research note. While history suggests that having the two houses of Congress split between the parties would be market-positive, this time, ''the debate will now swing towards the prospects for the fiscal cliff and whether a deal can be done to ameliorate some of its more dramatic effects.''
Mr. Obama is much less likely to procrastinate, he wrote, and ''a degree of fiscal austerity is the most likely outcome.''
John Greenwood, chief economist of Invesco, said that the gridlock would probably result in ''a minimum of new legislative plans'' but that ''we can expect a continuation of the slow, gradual recovery of the U.S. economy, albeit alongside a continuous rise in the size and cost of government program such as Medicare.''
Andrew Swan, head of Asian fundamental equities at BlackRock, said Mr. Obama's victory would most likely encourage the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue its ultra-easy monetary policy, ''which should be supportive for Asian equity markets, given the resulting increased global liquidity and a relatively weak U.S. dollar.''
Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures slipped 44 cents to $88.27 a barrel. Comex gold futures rose 0.6 percent to $1,724.70 an ounce.
Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Can Republicans Adapt?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
This was one that the Republicans really should have won.
Given the weak economy, American voters were open to firing President Obama. In Europe, in similar circumstances, one government after another lost re-election. And, at the beginning of this year, it looked as if the Republicans might win control of the United States Senate as well.
Yet it wasn't the Democrats who won so much as the Republicans who lost -- at a most basic level, because of demography. A coalition of aging white men is a recipe for failure in a nation that increasingly looks like a rainbow. 
Schadenfreude may excuse Democrats' smiles for a few days, but these trends portend a potential disaster not just for the Republican Party but for the health of our political system. America needs a plausible center-right opposition party to hold Obama's feet to the fire, not just a collection of Tea Party cranks.
So liberals as well as conservatives should be rooting for the Republican Party to feel sufficiently shaken that it shifts to the center. One hopeful sign is that political parties usually care more about winning than about purism. Thus the Democratic Party embraced the pragmatic center-left Bill Clinton in 1992 after three consecutive losses in presidential elections.
That was painful for many liberals, who cringed when Clinton interrupted campaigning in the 1992 primary to burnish his law-and-order credentials by overseeing the execution of a mentally impaired murderer. But it was, on balance, less painful than losing again.
You would expect the Republican Party to make a similar lurch to the center. But many Republican leaders still inhabit a bubble. It was stunning how many, from Karl Rove to Newt Gingrich, seemed to expect a Mitt Romney victory. And some of the right-wing postmortems are suggesting that Romney lost because he was too liberal -- which constitutes a definition of delusional.
Imagine what would have happened if the Republican nominee had been Gingrich or Rick Santorum. We surely would have seen a Democratic landslide.
On the other hand, if the Republicans had nominated Jon Huntsman Jr., they might have been the ones celebrating right now. But he had no chance in Republican primaries because primary voters are their party's worst enemy.
Part of the problem, I think, is the profusion of right-wing radio and television programs. Democrats complain furiously that Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity smear the left, but I wonder if the bigger loser isn't the Republican Party itself. Those shows whip up a frenzy in their audience, torpedoing Republican moderates and instilling paranoia on issues like immigration.
All this sound and fury enmeshes the Republican Party in an ideological cocoon and impedes it from reaching out to swing-state centrists, or even understanding them. The vortex spins ever faster and risks becoming an ideological black hole.
In 2002, a book was published called ''The Emerging Democratic Majority.'' It argued that Democrats would gain because of their strength in expanding demographics such as Hispanics, Asian-Americans and working women. It seemed persuasive until Republicans clobbered Democrats in the next couple of elections.
But perhaps that book was ahead of its time. This was the first election in which Hispanic voters made up a double-digit share of the electorate, according to CNN exit polls -- 10 percent, doubled from 1996 -- and more than 7 out of 10 Hispanic voters supported Obama.
That wasn't inevitable. In 2004, exit polls suggested that President George W. Bush received 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. But Republicans became obstructionist on immigration and then veered into offensive demagogy in opposing the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. The Hispanic vote tumbled by increasing numbers into the Democrats' laps.
Then there are women. The paternalistic comments about rape by a few male Republican candidates resonated so broadly because they reflected the perception of the G.O.P. as a conclave of out-of-touch men. As Representative Todd Akin of Missouri might put it, when a candidate emerges with offensive views about rape, ''the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.'' Namely, they vote Democratic.
America is changing. After this election, a record 20 senators will be women, almost all of them Democrats. Opposition to same-sex marriage used to be a way for Republicans to trumpet their morality; now it's seen as highlighting their bigotry.
An astonishing 45 percent of Obama voters were members of minority groups, according to The Times's Nate Silver. Many others were women or young people. That's the future of America, and if the Republican Party remains a purist cohort built around grumpy old white men, it is committing suicide. That's bad not just for conservatives, but for our entire country.

HEADLINE: Abroad, Obama Victory Brings a Welcome for the Familiar and Demands for Attention

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Reporting was contributed by Jane Perlez and Keith Bradsher from Beijing; Hilda Wang from Hong Kong; Isabel Kershner and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem; Ellen Barry and Andrew Roth from Moscow; Sara Schonhardt from Jakarta, Indonesia; Scott Sayare from Paris; Dan Bilefsky from Barcelona, Spain; Tim Arango and Hwaida Saad from Antakya, Turkey; Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul; Sarah Lyall from London; Lydia Polgreen from Johannesburg; Nicholas Kulish and Chris Cottrell from Berlin; Jeffrey Gettleman from Nairobi, Kenya; Graham Bowley from Kabul, Afghanistan; Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan; Ramtin Rastin from Tehran; Thomas Erdbrink from Amsterdam; Simon Romero and Taylor Barnes from Rio de Janeiro; and David D. Kirkpatrick and Mayy El Sheikh from Cairo.

 BODY:
LONDON -- World leaders sought comfort from the familiar on Wednesday after President Obama's re-election but, with the global political landscape substantially unchanged and crises on hold while the vote unfolded, many vied with new vigor for his attention and favor as he embarks on a second term.
In marked contrast to a euphoric surge four years ago, when many hailed Mr. Obama's victory as a herald of renewal, the mood was subdued, reflecting not only the shadings of opinion between the American leader's friends and foes but also a generally lowered expectation of America's power overseas.
Mr. Obama, one French analyst said, is ''very far from the hopes that inflamed his country four years ago.'' 
Even in Kenya, where Mr. Obama's father was from, the energy surrounding this election was just a shadow of what it had been in 2008, when it seemed as if the entire African continent was cheering him on. Many Kenyans have been disappointed that Mr. Obama has yet to visit as president, part of a broader feeling on the continent that Africa has not been a priority, certainly not compared with the unfolding nuclear debate in Iran and the civil war in Syria.
Some were quick to list their conflicting requirements, signaling the diplomatic shoals ahead.
Iranian officials hinted that talks were possible between Iran and the United States. ''If it benefits the system, we will negotiate with the U.S.A. even in the depths of hell,'' Mohammad Javad Larijani, one of several brothers with key positions in the ruling elite, told the semiofficial Mehr news agency, saying bilateral talks were ''not taboo.''
Last month, some Obama administration officials said such talks had been agreed to in principle, but that was later denied in Washington and Tehran.
Danny Danon, the deputy speaker of the Israeli Parliament, who is regarded as a staunch ally of the Republicans, evoked ''the existential threat posed to Israel and the West by the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran.''
''Now is the time for President Obama to return to the wise and time-honored policy of 'zero daylight' between our respective nations,'' Mr. Danon said.
Mr. Danon is a member of the conservative Likud Party, led by Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has tense relations with Mr. Obama and who was widely perceived in Israel and the United States as having supported the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney.
Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, said in a brief statement that he hoped that Mr. Obama would press for peace in the Middle East.
That call seemed mirrored in Malaysia, where Prime Minister Najib Razak urged Mr. Obama to ''continue in his efforts to foster understanding and respect between the United States and Muslims around the world.''
But, after the upheaval of the Arab Spring, such overtures now seem more complex. In Cairo, where Mr. Obama committed himself three years ago to ''a new beginning'' with the Arab world, Essam el-Erian, a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, said in an online posting as the results became clear, ''We have to realize that after the Arab revolutions, we can reduce foreign interference in our domestic affairs and our foreign policy -- with American interference first on the list.''
Before the outcome was known, Chinese analysts had summed up what seemed to be a widespread calculation that the Chinese leadership, itself scheduled to change in two days' time, favored Mr. Obama ''because he's familiar,'' said Wu Xinbo, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. A victory for Mr. Romney would have made China ''a little nervous because he might bring new policies.''
President Hu Jintao of China praised the ''hard work of the Chinese and American sides'' in creating ''positive developments'' in their relationship during Mr. Obama's first term.
''With an eye toward the future, China is willing, together with the United States,'' he said, ''to continue to make efforts to promote the cooperative partnership between China and the United States so as to achieve new and even greater development, bringing better benefits to the people of the two countries and the people of the world.''
China's response was colored by a pre-election pledge from Mr. Romney to label Beijing a currency manipulator. ''With Obama continuing,'' said Poon Tsang, a street market vendor in Hong Kong, ''there should be some stability in his relationship with China.''
Across Europe, many greeted news of Mr. Obama's re-election with a sense of mild relief, though it was not immediately clear whether those feelings were accompanied by any enhanced expectation that armed with a new mandate, the Obama administration would find solutions to the huge challenges still facing it in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Syria and the Middle East.
Imran Khan, a prominent Pakistani politician, urged Mr. Obama to ''give peace a chance'' after a first term marked by ''increased drone attacks, a surge in Afghanistan, increased militancy in Pakistan as a result of that.''
Most Afghans appeared pleased by the election result, welcoming the continuity it offered in a country buffeted violently by change and conflict over the past few years, although many were worried that Mr. Obama could accelerate the withdrawal of American troops from the country, due to conclude in 2014.
Mr. Obama is also under pressure to increase his involvement in ending the Syrian war.
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Jordan, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said early on Wednesday, ''One of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.''
On the ground in Syria, rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad seemed divided over the effect of a second term for Mr. Obama. A commander who asked to be identified only by his first name, Maysara, said he expected Washington to take a much clearer stance within 10 days. ''If they don't, Syria will become like Somalia,'' he said.
By contrast, Fawaz Tello, an opposition figure living in Germany, referred to a Romney proposal to help the rebels while ''Obama made no clear proposals.'' A second term for Mr. Obama, he said, is ''not a good sign.''
Some of the favorable responses to Mr. Obama reflected campaign blunders by Mr. Romney, who drew barbs from both Britons and Spaniards for remarks about their countries.
''We in Spain wanted Obama to win because he is more like us; we still see him as a transformative leader,'' said Manel Manchon, a political scientist. ''Romney insulted Spain, and you can't just blame Spain for this crisis.''
Like most Western Europeans, Britons are broadly more liberal than Americans; even most British conservatives sympathize far more with Democratic than with Republican views on social issues like abortion, the death penalty and health care.
There is also a perception in Britain and elsewhere in Europe that a Romney government would have been parochial, suspicious of foreigners and untested in world affairs, while Mr. Obama's victory, as the left-leaning Guardian newspaper put it, ''is good for Americans, good for America, and good for the world.''
Mr. Obama's standing elsewhere seemed more ambiguous.
After his election in 2008, for instance, Mr. Obama promised a ''reset'' with Moscow. But the United States and Russia took opposing positions on the Libyan and Syrian crises and the Kremlin has depicted the American response to antigovernment protests in Moscow as undermining President Vladimir V. Putin's return to power.
However, after Mr. Obama's victory became clear, Russian officials issued the most optimistic comments to be heard in months about relations with the United States.
Dmitri S. Peskov, spokesman for Mr. Putin, said, ''In general, the Kremlin took the news about Barack Obama's victory in the elections quite positively.''
In Indonesia, where Mr. Obama spent some of his childhood, students at his former elementary school cheered his victory, as did elite Indonesians gathered at a party hosted by the American Embassy. On the streets, motorcycle taxi drivers raised their fists, shouting, ''Obama, Obama.''
For some Europeans, the victory offered an object lesson in the politics of economic hardship that has cost leaders in France, Spain and Britain and elsewhere their jobs.
''Obama has succeeded where Sarkozy, Zapatero and Brown failed -- to be re-elected amid a major economic crisis,'' François Sergent, a deputy editor, wrote in a special edition of the leftist newspaper Libération in France, referring to the former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy; José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the former prime minister of Spain; and Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister.
The sense that Mr. Obama's second term would be less constrained by electoral considerations offered analysts a rich theme. ''For all the criticism of Obama, he now has the tail wind and the independence of not having to seek re-election,'' Philipp Missfelder, a leading member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said in an interview. ''He can use that for foreign policy, too.''
But there was unease in Germany that Mr. Obama's focus on Asian issues, in particular the rise of China, had sapped trans-Atlantic ties with Europe. ''I hope he will not only be the Pacific president, but also the trans-Atlantic president,'' Mr. Messfelder said.
In South Africa, whose prism is shaped by the decades of apartheid, Mathews Phosa, a senior member of the ruling African National Congress, said the outcome made Mr. Obama a potent symbol of the triumph of merit over race. ''There is hope for the future if we all transcend racial patterns and look at people as people on their merits,'' he said.
And Mr. Obama's re-election brought relief and some economic concern in Brazil, where he is broadly popular and seen as more cautious in foreign policy than his Republican challengers.
''Everything that happens in the United States influences every other country, in both positive and negative ways,'' said Rogério Antonio, 31, a salesman in an optical store in Rio de Janeiro. ''It's as though someone threw a pebble in the water and you sit waiting for the ripples to come out your way.''

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, Suddenly Making Nice With Obama After Backing Romney

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Wall Street is moving to Plan B.
After throwing its weight behind Mitt Romney, the financial industry is now confronting the reality of four more years with President Obama.
During Mr. Obama's second term, lobbyists will tackle a now-familiar slate of issues like the fiscal cliff and the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis. But they are likely to soften their approach, even as Wall Street pushes to temper rules and influence the makeup of crucial Congressional committees and regulatory agencies.
''Wall Street is going to work now to recalibrate its relationship with the president and his administration,'' said Tom Block, an industry consultant and former head of government relations for JPMorgan Chase. 
In his second term, Mr. Obama has gained a modest advantage.
The Obama administration owes little to the banks and hedge funds that embraced Mitt Romney's campaign. Democrats expanded their control of the Senate, too, cementing a layer of protection around Dodd-Frank.
The financial industry will have to strike a conciliatory tone. On Wednesday, financial lobbying groups circulated statements calling for cooperation with the White House. Industry organizations, including the Financial Services Roundtable, called to congratulate Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, on her Senate victory in Massachusetts.
Still, the mood was grim on some trading floors on Wednesday morning. As the market plummeted, a trader at Citigroup sarcastically bellowed, ''Thank you, Obama.''
For all the hand-wringing, Mr. Obama's second term is unlikely to present a doomsday situation for the nation's biggest banks. Many institutions had already resigned themselves to Dodd-Frank, and many new rules are already baked into corporate strategy.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, for example, have shuttered their proprietary trading desks, which were banned under the law.
The industry's next step is to assess the implications of the election. By dawn on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley's government relations team had dispatched a memo to 50,000 clients and employees outlining the financial challenges ahead for Washington. On Thursday, the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel will host a conference featuring executives from UBS and Bank of America.
With the broad regulatory landscape unlikely to change, Wall Street expects to take aim at the law's most contentious rules, rather than attacking Dodd-Frank in its entirety. A central goal, lobbyists say, is to tame unfinished rules that rein in derivatives trading. Wall Street, in particular, is preparing a lobbying frenzy over plans to apply derivatives rules to American banks trading overseas.
The banks, however, will most likely adopt a gentler approach this time around. ''Some clients are worried that they will be portrayed as seeking loopholes or trying to do away with regulation, when they are actually simply asking for clarity,'' said Anna T. Pinedo, a partner with Morrison Foerster.
In some ways, President Obama provides more certainty for the banks. Even as they have tried to delay rule-writing, banks have complained that only a third of Dodd-Frank is complete. Without the regulatory details, banks contend they cannot easily plan for the future.
''The banks say, 'Just tell us what the rules are; we'll figure out how to manage this,' '' said Brian Gardner, a Washington research analyst at KBW.
On a more aggressive front, the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business trade groups are marshaling teams of lawyers at Gibson Dunn and other firms to file lawsuits against parts of Dodd-Frank. The financial industry expects to challenge the so-called Volcker Rule, which bars banks from making many risky bets with their own money.
Lobbyists are also appealing to more sympathetic members of Congress, urging them to apply pressure on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has proved to be an aggressive foe of the banks. Financial trade groups are expected to line up behind a new bill in Congress that would undercut the authority of agencies like the trading commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
As Wall Street looks to influence policy, it will focus on shifts in regulatory personnel.
Gary Gensler, the chairman of the futures trading commission, can continue to serve through 2013 unless the White House reappoints him to another term, an outcome that lobbyists at several New York banks hope to avert. Mary L. Schapiro, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is widely expected to leave early next year.
The makeup of Congressional committees presents another wild card to Wall Street.
Ms. Warren, the senator-elect from Massachusetts, could grab a seat on the Senate Banking Committee. Ms. Warren, a Democrat, made her name in Washington as a fierce critic of Wall Street and the chief architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
''Wall Street C.E.O.'s, the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs,'' she said at the Democratic convention in August, ''still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.''

HEADLINE: Can Obama Give Us Confidence?

BYLINE: By RON SUSKIND. 
Ron Suskind is the author, most recently, of ''Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President,'' and the senior fellow at the Harvard University Center for Ethics.

 BODY:
A CLOSE vote by a split electorate has handed President Obama a second term. He steps up, revived and renewed, to preside over a divided nation that often seems to agree on only one thing: today's children will live less well than their parents. This pervasive loss of confidence, though hard to precisely measure, is of enormous consequence. It's what sinks civilizations.
Mr. Obama understands this, but hasn't fashioned a coherent response -- and it nearly resulted in his defeat. The problem was starkly visible to 70 million viewers in that disastrous first debate when Mitt Romney showed many voters that he was confident about the future of the country. Mr. Obama seemed at a loss, conflicted and hesitant, as though he'd been found out. 
To understand what was happening behind that lectern and the challenge Mr. Obama faces in his new term, it's useful to consider what the president told me in a February 2011 interview in the Oval Office. Mr. Obama spoke of a president's power to instill confidence in the people as something of a coin of the realm.
Citing Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, he talked about how both men, regardless of their policies, were masterly at helping Americans ''believe in themselves.'' Ronald Reagan, he said with a hint of envy, ''was very comfortable in playing the role of president,'' with his actor's background.
The president summed up what he'd learned after an optimism-bruising two years in office: ''I think where the evolution has taken place,'' he said, ''is understanding that leadership in this office is not a matter of you being confident. Leadership in this office is a matter of helping the American people feel confident.''
Exuding confidence while not feeling it? That straddle is particularly difficult for Mr. Obama, who's long wrestled with a dual role as appraising narrator, with those writerly skills, and main actor in the great play of events. Reconciling that split is what held him back in the campaign and left him tongue-tied when he tried to paint an alluring vision of the future. Obama the Narrator wouldn't let Obama the Actor sell a confidence he didn't feel, even if it's what people were yearning for.
Now, the re-elected president must find some way to tell us how he, and the country, can rightfully feel optimistic.
To manage it, Mr. Obama will have to evolve. How? Speak from the heart and then act. It's dangerous for anyone, even someone who published his autobiography at 33, fashioning a personal narrative that helped propel him to the presidency, to be so fixated on the storyteller's third-person view, which looks down from the ceiling. It slows one's step and adds a level of calculation -- of how things will play -- that undermines improvisations, the lightning reactions, the twists and surprises of a more dynamic leadership. It's the difference between writing about history and shaping it.
Focusing on legacy, which is the endgame of the story, Mr. Obama has often missed what's happening before his eyes. The great mishap of the first term was failing to direct, as a new president with a sky-high approval rating, a sea of enthusiasts. After all, before the Tea Party arose, there was an army many times its size -- Obama's Army -- that he abandoned, leaving a tattered remnant that, in 2011, supported Occupy Wall Street. By then, the Tea Party had been embraced by Republicans and become an electoral force; still, Mr. Obama kept Occupy Wall Street at arm's length.
He now has won a new first 100 days. In hopes of harvesting a few lessons, it's worthwhile to note what he did the first time, with all that political capital. Thinking of his legacy -- the passage of health care reform -- he missed opportunities presented by the twin crises of a collapsing economy and the banking meltdown to restructure the American financial system. He did not push for the creation of a sound and sustainable foundation for investing, in place of speculative trading. Then, by failing to use Obama's Army to drive the health care debate, he ceded ground to the Tea Party and had to limp across the finish line, a year later, with only a starting point for comprehensive health care reform -- really, a widened coverage mandate by government.
Maybe Mr. Obama will feel the valuable bite of those early, missed opportunities in the weeks to come, as he has to negotiate terms to avoid the looming ''fiscal cliff'' and the demands of Tea Party representatives. We have, indisputably, entered an age of wild participatory energies, bubbling up and driving a kind of relentless direct democracy. These voices will write the narrative for the coming days. And they're looking for a lead actor.
In our interview on that wintry day in 2011, Mr. Obama said that the key thing a president should do ''is tell a story to the American people'' -- something he said again to Charlie Rose this past summer. As someone who's been writing narratives for a few decades, I can't help but think of the standard told to generations of reporters: show, don't tell.
Don't tell the story. Be the story, of a president who both rode and guided history's wave and fairly earned that coin of the realm: confidence.

HEADLINE: Little to Show For Cash Flood By Big Donors

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and JESS BIDGOOD; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At the private air terminal at Logan Airport in Boston early Wednesday, men in unwrinkled suits sank into plush leather chairs as they waited to board Gulfstream jets, trading consolations over Mitt Romney's loss the day before.
''All I can say is the American people have spoken,'' said Kenneth Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and one of Mr. Romney's top fund-raisers, briskly plucking off his hat and settling into a couch.
The biggest single donor in political history, the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, mingled with other Romney backers at a postelection breakfast, fresh off a large gamble gone bad. Of the eight candidates he supported with tens of millions of dollars in contributions to ''super PACs,'' none were victorious on Tuesday.
And as calls came in on Wednesday from some of the donors who had poured more than $300 million into the pair of big-spending outside groups founded in part by Karl Rove -- perhaps the leading political entrepreneur of the super PAC era -- he offered them a grim upside: without us, the race would not have been as close as it was. 
The most expensive election in American history drew to a close this week with a price tag estimated at more than $6 billion, propelled by legal and regulatory decisions that allowed wealthy donors to pour record amounts of cash into races around the country.
But while outside spending affected the election in innumerable ways -- reshaping the Republican presidential nominating contest, clogging the airwaves with unprecedented amounts of negative advertising and shoring up embattled Republican incumbents in the House -- the prizes most sought by the emerging class of megadonors remained outside their grasp. President Obama will return to the White House in January, and the Democrats have strengthened their lock on the Senate.
The election's most lavishly self-financed candidate fared no better. Linda E. McMahon, a Connecticut Republican who is a former professional wrestling executive, spent close to $100 million -- nearly all of it her own money -- on two races for the Senate, conceding defeat on Tuesday for the second time in three years.
''Money is a necessary condition for electoral success,'' said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. ''But it's not sufficient, and it's never been.''
Even by the flush standards of a campaign in which the two presidential candidates raised $1 billion each, the scale of outside spending was staggering: more than $1 billion all told, about triple the amount in 2010.
Mr. Obama faced at least $386 million in negative advertising from super PACs and other outside spenders, more than double what the groups supporting him spent on the airwaves. Outside groups spent more than $37 million in Virginia's Senate race and $30 million in Ohio's, a majority to aid the Republican candidates.
The bulk of that outside money came from a relatively small group of wealthy donors, unleashed by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which allowed unlimited contributions to super PACs. Harold Simmons, a Texas industrialist, gave $26.9 million to super PACs backing Mr. Romney and Republican candidates for the Senate. Joe Ricketts, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, spent close to $13 million to bankroll a super PAC attacking Mr. Obama over federal spending.
Bob Perry, a Texas homebuilder, poured more than $21 million into super PACs active in the presidential race and the Senate battles in Florida and Virginia, where Democrats narrowly prevailed. A donor network marshaled by Charles and David Koch, the billionaire industrialists and conservative philanthropists, reportedly sought to raise $400 million for tax-exempt groups that are not required to disclose their spending.
Mr. Adelson's giving to super PACs and other outside groups came to more than $60 million, though in public Mr. Adelson did not seem overly concerned about the paltry returns on his investment.
''Paying bills,'' Mr. Adelson said on Tuesday night when asked by a Norwegian reporter how he thought his donations had been spent. ''That's how you spend money. Either that or become a Jewish husband -- you spend a lot of money.''
Flush with cash, Republican-leaning groups outspent Democratic ones by an even greater margin than in 2010. But rather than produce a major partisan imbalance, the money merely evened the playing field in many races.
In several competitive Senate races, high spending by outside groups was offset to a large extent with stronger fund-raising by Democratic candidates, assisted at the margins by Democratic super PACs. For much of the fall, Mr. Obama and Democratic groups broadcast at least as many ads, and sometimes more, in swing states than Mr. Romney and his allied groups, in part because Mr. Obama was able to secure lower ad rates by paying for most of the advertising himself. Mr. Romney relied far more on outside groups, which must pay higher rates.
Haley Barbour, a former Mississippi governor who helped Mr. Rove raise money for American Crossroads and its sister group, Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, said that without a blitz of coordinated anti-Obama advertising in the summer, the campaign would not have been as competitive.
''I believe that some of that money actually kept Romney from getting beat down by the carpet-bombing he underwent from the Obama forces,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''I did look at it more as us trying to keep our candidates from getting swamped, like what happened to McCain.''
Some advocates for tighter campaign financing regulations argued that who won or lost was beside the point. The danger, they argued, is that in the post-Citizens United world, candidates and officeholders on both sides of the aisle are far more beholden to the wealthy individuals who can finance large-scale independent spending.
''Unlimited contributions and secret money in American politics have resulted in the past in scandal and the corruption of government decisions,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a watchdog group. ''This will happen again in the future.''
But on Wednesday, at least, the nation's megadonors returned home with lighter wallets and few victories.
As the morning wore on at Logan Airport, more guests from Mr. Romney's election-night party at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center trickled in, lugging garment bags and forming a small line at the security checkpoint.
''It's going to be a long flight home, isn't it?'' said one person, who asked not to be identified.
The investor Julian Robertson, who held fund-raisers for Mr. Romney and gave more than $2 million to a pro-Romney super PAC, arrived with several companions. Mr. Robertson spotted an acquaintance: Emil W. Henry Jr., an economic adviser and a fund-raiser for Mr. Romney, to whom Mr. Robertson had offered a ride on his charter.
''Aww, group hug,'' Mr. Henry said.

HEADLINE: 'Skyfall' Lands, Finally, in the U.S.

BYLINE: JAN BENZEL


HIGHLIGHT: The latest James Bond movie opens in American movie theaters Thursday, having already made a lap or two around the world. Have you seen it yet? Where did you see it, and what did you think? 

 BODY:
Beyond the festival circuit, moviegoers in Europe are often playing catchup with Americans, waiting weeks and sometimes months for films to arrive at the local cinema. Not so with the latest James Bond film "Skyfall," which began its sweep - a victorious one - with a premiere in London on Oct. 23 and opened in dozens of countries around the worldover the course of the next several days. 
 It being the 50th anniversary year for 007, the drum roll has been long and loud, as the franchise's fans everywhere debate the best cinematic Bond. (Daniel Craig, who stars in this one, comes out pretty well, although Sean Connery seems to have the edge.) 
Reviews for "Skyfall" have been largely glowing. On the movie Web site Rotten Tomatoes it rates an astronomical 92 percent on the Tomatometer. Paris Match gave it a rare four stars, and The Economist had high compliments, albeit some of them backhanded:
In contrast to the relentlessly bleak "Quantum of Solace," Sam Mendes, the director, has taken the bold step of reintroducing humour, with the occasional joke worthy of Roger Moore. Luckily, Mr. Craig seems just as comfortable delivering puns as he is digging shrapnel from his chest.
 In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw was bowled over by Judi Dench as M, calling her the "Bond girl to end all Bond girls."
M is an imperious, subtly oedipal intelligence-matriarch with the double-O boys under her thumb. She's treating them mean. She's keeping them keen. And she is rewarded with passionate loyalty, varying with smouldering resentment. It's a combination with its own unspoken eroticism, and it has also created the conditions for one of the most memorable Bond villains in recent times.
The film opens Thursday in the United States, where critics have been adding their voices to the choir, and where the aggregating site Metacritic has a countdown clock ticking off the seconds until the film's release. (There are some dissenters: David Denby writes in The New Yorker that "It would be lovely to announce that the new Bond movie is scintillating, or at least rambunctiously exciting, but 'Skyfall,' in the recent mode of Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' films, is a gloomy, dark action thriller, and almost completely without the cynical playfulness that drew us to the series in the first place.")
The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis relished the film: 
Directed by a surprisingly well-equipped Sam Mendes, "Skyfall" is, in every way, a superior follow-up to "Casino Royale," the 2006 reboot that introduced Mr. Craig as Bond. "Skyfall" even plays like something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. The tone is again playful and the stakes feel serious if not punishingly so. This is a Bond who, after vaulting into a moving train car, pauses to adjust a shirt cuff, a gesture that eases the scene's momentum without putting the brakes on it.

HEADLINE: Socialism!

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: If everything good is "socialism", don't be surprised if socialism gets a good name. 

 BODY:
I have to say, the gnashing of teeth and rending of garments on the right comes as a surprise. We knew that they would be upset; but the extent to which they were really, truly unprepared for the obvious possibility that Obama would be reelected is remarkable. I suspect that it comes down to two things: self-definition in terms of always being the people with the power, and the right-wing information bubble, which left them completely unaware of information they didn't want to hear.
One thing that caught my eye, in particular, has been the wailing that Americans have turned socialist. (Conservatives haven't failed America -- America has failed conservatives!) Thus John Hinderaker of Bush is a genius fame declares,
To me, the most telling incident of the campaign season was a poll that found that among young Americans, socialism enjoys a higher favorability rating than free enterprise. How can this possibly be, given the catastrophic failure of socialism, and the corresponding success of free enterprise, throughout history? The answer is that conservatives have entirely lost control over the culture. 
Oddly, he doesn't even seem to consider the more obvious possibility: after decades in which right-wingers have attacked long-established institutions -- Social Security, progressive taxation, unemployment insurance -- as "socialism", a lot of young people now believe them, and think that this "socialism" thing really isn't so bad. A case in point: Sheldon Adelson's Israeli newspaper just ran the headline "America chooses socialism", referring to the reelection of a president who enacted a health care reform originally proposed by the Heritage Foundation.
Meanwhile, Karl Rove is accusing Democrats of suppressing the vote. How? By the heinous crime of running negative ads. Cue Monty Python on sarcasm:

HEADLINE: Goodbye to Rachel From Cardholder Services

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Trade Commission is moving to disconnect Rachel from Card Services and other robocallers. 

 BODY:
 11/9/12 | Updated to make clear that calls from "Rachel" may continue from other firms outside of the F.T.C.'s latest action. 
So long, Rachel. I certainly won't miss you or your annoying phone calls from "Cardholder Services."
The Federal Trade Commissionrecently acted to shut down five "robocalling" firms in Arizona and Florida that it says are responsible for millions of illegal telemarketing calls, including the familiar pre-recorded messages from "Rachel."
"At the F.T.C., Rachel from Cardholder Services is public enemy No. 1," Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said in a statement.
Actually, Rachel is a voice recorded years agoand recycled by various firms, according to an article in June in The New York Times. While the F.T.C.'s action may put a dent in Rachel's productivity, other companies continue to use her message.
"I'd be as delighted as everyone else to see her disappear," said C. Steven Baker, director of the F.T.C.'s Midwest region. "We're working on it."
Federal courts granted the agency's request to temporarily halt the operations of the five firms. The agency asserted that they tricked consumers into paying hundreds of thousands of dollars by making phony claims that they could reduce credit card interest rates in return for a fee -- sometimes as high as $3,000 -- paid up front.
I admit I wasn't aware of what exactly Rachel was pitching, since if I immediately hung up when I heard her greeting. But many other consumers apparently listened, and even pressed a number to hear more from a live person.
After the telemarketer "approved" the consumers for a "program" to get rates as low as 0 percent, according to the F.T.C., the telemarketer informed them that there was an upfront fee, ranging from several hundred dollars to nearly $3,000. To persuade consumers to pay the fee, the F.T.C. said, telemarketers would often say that it would be more than offset by the money the consumer would save through the program.
In some cases, the F.T.C. asserted, consumers' credit cards were charged, even if they didn't agree to pay for the service. In other cases, the F.T.C. contended, the telemarketers did not disclose a fee at all, or claimed there would be no fee.
After consumers paid the fee, the F.T.C. alleged, they typically found -- surprise, surprise! -- that the companies did little or nothing to lower their credit card interest rates. And they often reneged on promises to refund the fees.
The F.T.C. is trying to crack down on robocalling, and is even offering cash prizes for proposals for innovative technology to curtail the practice. (Some robocalls, like those from political candidates or charities seeking donations, are allowed, the F.T.C. says. But if the recording is a sales pitch, and you haven't given written permission to get the calls, it's illegal -- and most likely a scheme.)
The agency also provided tipson what to do if you get unwanted automated telemarketing calls. Hanging up is at the top of the list.
Did you ever hear from Rachel? Did you end up getting charged a fee?

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Opposes Effort to Change Online Royalties

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: In a letter to members of Congress, the organization argues that the Internet Radio Fairness Act, a federal bill supported by Pandora, Clear Channel and others, would deprive artists and performers of fair pay for their work. 

 BODY:
The Internet Radio Fairness Act, a federal bill supported by Pandora, Clear Channel and others that would change the way online radio royalties are set, has come under new opposition from the N.A.A.C.P., which said in a letter to members of Congress that the bill would "unfairly deprive artists and performers of fair pay for their hard work."
The bill, introduced in September, would direct a panel of federal judges to use the same standard in setting royalty rates for Internet radio that they use for satellite and cable radio services, a change that Pandora and others believe would substantially lower their rates.
It already has been opposed by music industry groups, as well as by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. But the N.A.A.C.P. letter, dated last Friday and publicized by a music industry coalition on Thursday, adds new pressure, portraying the issue not just as a business dispute, but as a civil rights matter.

"Quite frankly, the I.R.F.A. bill fails the basic test of economic fairness and discriminates against singers and musicians by slashing the compensation they receive when their work is played over digital online radio," says the letter, which was signed by Hilary O. Shelton, director of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Washington bureau.
Members of the Internet Radio Fairness Coalition, which in addition to Pandora and Clear Channel includes the Digital Media Association and the Consumer Electronics Association, argue that the current royalty system is unfair and impedes the development of the industry.
Pandora, for example, has paid a much higher portion of its revenue in royalties than satellite and cable radio services. The new bill would make a number of other alterations to the rate-setting procedure, including a change in the way the copyright royalty judges are appointed.
This week, Pandora also started a new front in its campaign to lower royalties when it sued Ascap, a performing rights group that represents songwriters and publishers.
A spokeswoman for Pandora did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.

HEADLINE: The Rise of the Quants in Political Prognostication

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: Nate Silver and his ilk were vilified by pundits who accused the number crunchers of bias. But, after correctly predicting the shape of Obama's victory, they're vindicated. 

 BODY:
As President Barack Obama celebrated re-election, number-crunching geeks everywhere could revel in redemption.
For months, political pundits and reporters said that the race between Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney was too close to call.
Not so, insisted a new breed of political analysts who rejected intuition and relied instead on data - vast amounts of it, run through computer algorithms - to arrive at their election predictions. Many of these models showed that Mr. Obama would win with relative ease. The forecasts drew rebukes from Republicans and other critics who insisted that the statisticians were biased.
The highest-profile of these forecasters is Nate Silver, whose blog, FiveThirtyEight, is licensed by The New York Times. Mr. Silver, a former baseball statistician who made a name for himself by correctly predicting the results of the electoral college votes in 49 of the 50 U.S. states in the 2008 election, did at least as well this time around. If the close result in Florida goes Mr. Obama's way, Mr. Silver will have gotten all 50 states right.
Mr. Silver is not the only so-called quant who had a good night. Simon Jackman, a Stanford University professor whose work is published by The Huffington Post, and Drew Linzer, a professor at Emory University who runs a Web site called Votamatic.com, predicted the exact number of electoral college votes that Mr. Obama received - 332, assuming the Florida victory is confirmed.
Another widely followed analyst, Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium, predicted 303 electoral votes, the total that Mr. Obama will receive if it turns out that he actually lost Florida.
Mr. Linzer appears to have been especially prescient, because he was predicting 332 electoral votes for Mr. Obama as long ago as June.
''We are all using the same data (more or less) and so it doesn't surprise me that we're all reaching similar conclusions,'' Mr. Linzer wrote on Votamatic.com on Election Day. ''The real challenge is producing meaningful and accurate forecasts early in the campaign.''
The number-crunchers made some old-fashioned pundits, relying on less scientific means, look silly. In the build-up to the elections, Joe Scarborough, a talk-show host on MSNBC, an American television channel, said of Mr. Silver and other data-driven analysts: ''Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next 10 days, because they're jokes.''
Instead of gut instinct, Mr. Silver relies on polls, emphasizing the data from individual states, in conjunction with the national surveys. This is because a U.S. presidential election is, in effect, a series of state elections, in which the winning candidate must post a majority in the electoral college, whose members reflect the choice of voters in the individual states.
While the national polls showed a close race, with some favoring Mr. Romney and others Mr. Obama, the new-school analysts had been saying that the state-by-state calculus made it a near certainty that Mr. Obama would stay in office. On Election Day, Mr. Silver put a 90.9 percent chance on this probability. Mr. Wang was even more certain, predicting a 98 percent likelihood.
''On the whole, the polls had it - were quite good,'' Mr. Silver said in a video posted on The New York Times Web site. ''The polls are usually quite good. A number of cycles in a row now, any one poll is often a little bit dubious, but when you average them together they seem to do a better job of kind of calibrating where the average voter is.''
To avoid aberrations in individual polls, Mr. Silver's model crunches numbers from a variety of voter surveys, and also incorporates other data, including economic statistics.
Mr. Silver has not always gotten it right. In 2010, for example, he overestimated the number of Parliamentary seats that the Liberal Democratic Party would win in British elections.
During the 2012 U.S. campaign, he was rebuked by the public editor of The New York Times, Margaret Sullivan, over his response to the provocation from Mr. Scarborough. On Twitter, Mr. Silver challenged the television host to a $1,000 bet that Mr. Obama would win; he later raised this to $2,000, though Mr. Scarborough did not respond.
This prompted Ms. Sullivan to write that ''the wager offer is a bad idea - giving ammunition to the critics who want to paint Mr. Silver as a partisan who is trying to sway the outcome.''
Mr. Silver writes for The Times and has a desk in its newsroom but is not on the paper's staff. He has said that in 2008, before his blog was licensed by The Times, he supported Mr. Obama's presidency.
On Monday, the day before the election, one in five visits to The Times's Web site included a visit to Mr. Silver's blog, the newspaper said.
After Mr. Obama's re-election, Mr. Silver was being congratulated, too. ''Nate Silver wins & data is vindicated,'' the Poynter Institute, a journalism research group, wrote on Twitter. ''So who's an embarrassment to journalism now?''

HEADLINE: Societe Generale Profit Plunged in Third Quarter

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: The French bank Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale said third-quarter net profit fell 86 percent, to $108 million, as it booked large one-time charges. 

 BODY:
 9:53 a.m. | Updated 
PARIS - Société Générale, the big French bank, said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit plunged as it booked large one-time charges.
The bank reported that net income fell 86 percent, to 85 million euros ($108 million), from 622 million euros in the period a year earlier - well below the 139 million euros analysts surveyed by Reuters had been expecting. The bank said net revenue declined 17 percent, to 5.4 billion euros.
Société Générale, based in Paris, said its bottom line was hurt by one-time charges that included a cost of 389 million euros for revaluing its own debt. It also wrote down good will and had losses on the sale of assets in Greece and the United States. Excluding those items, the bank said underlying net income was 856 million euros.
Frédéric Oudéa, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the bank's businesses "have once again demonstrated their resilience and capital-generating capacity. The quality of our portfolios and the attention we pay to managing our risks have enabled us to limit the cost of risk in a strained economic environment."
Société Générale said its corporate and investment banking unit had completed a loan-disposal plan begun in June 2011, having sold or amortized 16 billion euros worth of assets and cutting the units legacy assets by about two-thirds. Its legacy assets below investment grade were reduced to 3.2 billion euros by mid-October.
The bank came under market pressure last year because of its exposure to so-called peripheral euro zone nations and has been scaling back in that region. 
It said in September it would sell its 99 percent holding in its Greek subsidiary, Geniki Bank, to Piraeus Bank. It also announced plans to sell TCW, an American asset-management business, to Carlyle Group and TCW's management. A California judge has issued a tentative order that could block or delay the TCW deal as he considers whether to allow a lawsuit by EIG Global Energy Partners to proceed.
Société Générale said its core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of a firm's ability to weather financial shocks, rose to 10.3 percent at the end of September, based on so-called Basel 2.5 capital adequacy rules - a slight improvement from the second quarter. It said it expected to achieve a Basel III core Tier 1 capital ratio "of between 9 percent and 9.5 percent" by the end of next year.
French banks, though, continue to face significant worries. 
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's changed its outlook in October on Société Générale to negative from stable, citing a growing level of economic risk to the country's banking system, both from the slumping euro zone economy and the likelihood of a downturn in the French housing sector. S.&P. also cut its credit rating on the largest French bank, BNP Paribas, by one notch to A+/A-1, the same level as Société Générale.
An earlier version of this post misstated a capital measurement system to which Société Générale referred. The bank said it expected to achieve a target of a Basel III core tier 1 capital ratio, not a Basel II core tier 1 capital ratio.

TURNING TO DAMAGE CONTROL IN WASHINGTON | Wall Street bet big against President Obama, and lost. Now the industry "has to come to terms with an administration it has vilified," Susanne Craig and Nicholas Confessore write in DealBook. It's a critical time to be on amicable terms with the White House, with regulations being finalized and with possible tax increases on the horizon. "Wall Street is now going to have to figure out how to make this relationship work," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura.
If recent studies are a guide, Wall Street's political spending may be an ominous sign for its business, Eduardo Porter writes in The New York Times.
Even as the industry tries to strike a more conciliatory tone, lobbyists are making an effort to temper rules, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. In particular, trade groups are "expected to line up behind a new bill in Congress that would undercut the authority" of agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
There was a sense of disappointment on Wednesday, when some of Mitt Romney's biggest donors gathered at the private air terminal at Logan Airport in Boston to board Gulfstream jets, The New York Times reports. One economic adviser and fund-raiser for Mr. Romney, Emil W. Henry Jr., encountered the hedge fund titan Julian Robertson and offered a "group hug."
The hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, who joined other titans of finance at a dinner in Boston on Tuesday, sounded sanguine. "Sure, I am not getting invited to the White House anytime soon, but as citizens of the country we are all friendly," said Mr. Loeb, who switched his allegiance to Mitt Romney from Mr. Obama. Still, the industry "made a bad mistake" in pushing so hard for the Republican candidate, one senior Wall Street lawyer told DealBook. "They are going to pay a price," he said.
ON THE AGENDA | A report on the United States international trade deficit for September is released at 8:30 a.m. The Bank of England kept its benchmark rate at 0.5 percent. A decision by the European Central Bank on rates is due on Thursday morning. Duke Energy, Vulcan Materials, Kohl's and Siemens report earnings before the opening bell. Groupon and the Walt Disney Company announce results on Thursday evening. Barry Knapp, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays, is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Robert A. Iger, chief executive of Disney, is on Bloomberg TV at 4:15 p.m.
NOTED | The market was down on Wednesday, but shares of Best Buy were up more than 3 percent. Investors may have been betting on a possible buyout bid from the founder, Richard Schulze.
CARLYLE SWINGS TO PROFIT | The Carlyle Group reported economic net income of $219 million in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $191 million in the period a year earlier. The private equity firm, which has announced a string of big deals in recent months, reported that its assets under management grew 0.8 percent during the quarter, to $157.4 billion. Carlyle said it was returning some money to investors.
INVESTORS PONDER GLENCORE-XSTRATA | With a vote set for Nov. 20, Xstrata shareholders are getting conflicting signals on whether to approve the takeover offer by Glencore International. The latest advice came from Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, a British group that recommended rejecting the deal. The adviser cited concerns about a lack of "more extensive due diligence" and said the "level of independent representation on the board is insufficient," according to Bloomberg News. Institutional Shareholder Services, on the other hand, had come out in support of the takeover. For a refresher on the vote, see Steven M. Davidoff's Deal Professor column.

HEADLINE: The Importance of Elizabeth Warren

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: In Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts has sent to the Senate a forceful advocate for consumers who is willing to stand up to the financial sector, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
One of the most important results on Tuesday was the election of Elizabeth Warren as United States senator from Massachusetts. Her victory matters not only because it helps the Democrats keep control of the Senate but also because Ms. Warren has a track record of speaking truth to authority on financial issues - both to officials in Washington and to powerful people on Wall Street.
During the campaign, Ms. Warren's opponent and his allies made repeated attempts to portray her as antibusiness. In the most bizarre episode, Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS ran an ad that contended that she favored bailing out large Wall Street banks. All of this was misdirection and disinformation.
Ms. Warren has long stood for transparency and accountability. She has insisted that consumers need protection relative to financial products - when the customer cannot understand what is really on offer, this encourages bad behavior by some companies. If this behavior spreads sufficiently, the entire market can become contaminated - damaging the entire macroeconomy, exactly as we have seen in the last decade.
Honest bankers should welcome transparency in all its forms. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Ms. Warren helped to establish, has made major steps in this direction.

Ms. Warren has strong support from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and her resistance to sharp practices by big banks resonates across the political spectrum. (Disclosure: James Kwak and I wrote positively about Ms. Warren and her approach in "13 Bankers.")
She has also established an impressive track record for effective oversight in Washington. As the chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, she drew bipartisan praise (until, of course, she decided to run for public office).
How much can a new senator accomplish? Within hours of her victory, some commentators from the financial sector suggested that no freshman senator could achieve much.
This is wishful thinking on their part. A newly elected senator can have a great deal of impact if she is well informed on relevant details, plugged into the policy community and focused on a few key issues. It also helps if such a senator can bring effective outside pressure to bear - and Ms. Warren is a most effective communicator, including on television. She has an unusual ability to cut through technical details and to explain the issues in a way that everyone can relate to.
Ms. Warren is a natural ally for Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Carl Levin of Michigan, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and other sensible voices on financial sector issues (including some on the Republican side who have begun to speak out). My expectation is that Ms. Warren will work effectively across the aisle on financial sector issues without compromising her principles - and this could really be productive in the Senate context.
Hopefully, Ms. Warren will get a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, where at least one Democratic slot is open. 
President Obama should now listen to her advice. Senator Warren should have been appointed head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 - but was opposed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Unfortunately, the president was unwilling to override Treasury.
If President Obama wants to have impact with his second term, he needs to stand up to the too-big-to-fail banks on Wall Street.
The consensus among policy makers has shifted since 2010, becoming much more concerned about the dangers posed by global megabanks. That has been clear in recent speeches by the Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo; Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; and Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England (all of whom I have covered in this space - including last week).
At the same time, we should expect a renewed effort against all recent attempts at financial sector reform - a point made by American Banker, a trade publication, immediately after the re-election of President Obama.
Scandals of various kinds will be thrown into this mix. The full extent of money laundering at HSBC is only now becoming apparent. Complicity of various institutions in rigging Libor should also become clearer in coming months. No doubt there will be big unexpected trading losses somewhere in the global banking community. The European macroeconomic and financial situation continues to spiral out of control.
Senator Warren is well placed, not just to play a role in strengthening Congressional oversight but also in terms of helping her colleagues think through what we really need to make our financial system more stable.
We need a new approach to regulation more generally - and not just for banking. We should aim to simplify and to make matters more transparent, exactly along Senator Warren's general lines.
We should confront excessive market power, irrespective of the form that it takes.
We need a new trust-busting moment. And this requires elected officials willing and able to stand up to concentrated and powerful corporate interests. Empower the consumer - and figure out how this can get you elected.
Agree with the people of Massachusetts, and give Elizabeth Warren every opportunity.

HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. and the European Union are expected to open talks early next year on a free-trade agreement that could help boost growth on both sides of the Atlantic. But will President Obama's opponents try to obstruct a deal in Congress? 

 BODY:
LONDON - European leaders are hoping that President Obama's re-election will spur progress toward a free trade agreement that could bolster economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
The United States and the 27-member European Union have the world's biggest trade relationship, worth $700 billion a year in goods and services. Together, they account for almost a third of all global trade.
Officials from both sides are considering measures that would increase their trade by allowing European and American companies to operate in a single market.
By extending existing trade arrangements to further ease regulation, measures being proposed would bring down barriers that inhibit an even closer trading relationship.
"A car tested for safety in the United States could be sold in Europe without further tests, while a drug deemed safe by Brussels would not have to be approved as well by the U.S. government," according to a Reuters report that cited examples of the benefits of a free trade agreement.
Karel De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner, said on Wednesday that he anticipated a green light from President Obama and European leaders to open trade negotiations early next year on an agreement that would "unlock the unparalleled potential of the transatlantic market."
Trade is a vital issue for European politicians struggling to stimulate their stalled economies. 
David Cameron, the British prime minister, singled it out in a congratulatory message to Mr. Obama in which he said, "We need to kick start the world economy and I want to see an E.U.-U.S. trade deal."
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, another prominent proponent of an E.U.-U.S. free trade agreement, referred in her post-election message to the President to their cooperation in overcoming the global financial and economic crisis.
Mr. Obama's trade team has been quietly working out the details for a transatlantic free trade agreement and would be interested in pursuing it in earnest next year, according to Tyson Barker, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, writing in the German magazine Der Spiegel this week.
Mr. Barker, the Washington-based director of transatlantic relations at the Bertelsmann Foundation, cautioned, however, that Congress could act as a wildcard in the moves toward free trade.
He said the desire of Congressional Republicans "to prevent Obama from accumulating political 'wins' could keep them from authorizing the administration to conduct wide-ranging treaty negotiations."
The elected European Parliament has already given E.U. officials the go-ahead to begin the trade talks with the United States. 
Its legislators say European and U.S. output could be lifted by (EURO)163 billion, or $208 billion, by 2018, if just half the existing nontariff barriers were removed.
But there are significant obstacles to a closer trading relationship in some areas, including agriculture, where the two sides disagree on the use of genetically modified crops.
Some were skeptical about whether the Obama victory made much difference to U.S. trade policy in general. Few observers of international economics or trade had expected a sharp difference between an Obama and a Romney administration, according to Alan Beattie at The Financial Times.
Mr. Beattie, writing from Washington, said it might actually have been easier for Mr. Romney to fast-track a new trade deal through Congress. "Mr. Obama will very likely have to present an almost-finished trade deal to Congress first," he wrote.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
President Obama is back to work at the White House after winning his re-election campaign. Jackie Calmes and Peter Baker write that Mr. Obama has begun trying to wrap up the unfinished business of his first term, phoning party leaders on Wednesday to nudge them toward a budget deal to avoid roughly $700 billion in automatic tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts that could damage the economic recovery. With his second term approaching, he will also be looking at ways to reshuffle his cabinet, as several high-profile members are set to depart.

        
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is returning to the House, where his elevated profile and position as chairman of the Budget Committee give him a central role in Republicans' negotiations with President Obama and Democrats. But Trip Gabriel writes that Mr. Ryan will face grumbling from some Republicans who believe his efforts to steer the party rightward cost them moderate voters and the presidential election. As a potential presidential contender in 2016, Mr. Ryan's viability might hinge on whether the party wants to continue rightward or follow the more moderate direction of the country and its demographics.

        
After the Supreme Court relaxed campaign finance rules in 2010, some wealthy donors poured millions of dollars into the most expensive election in history through outside spending groups known as "super PACs." But Nicholas Confessore and Jess Bidgood tell how some megadonors, like Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, invested heavily in the election and emerged with few prizes.

        
If the electorate of Prince William County, Va., looks like the electorate of the future, then Democrats hold a sizable advantage over Republicans. Michael D. Shear writes that Republicans' strategy of appealing mostly to white voters has run into a wall of demographics that include minorities, women and voters under age 40. Those groups helped Mr. Obama win Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and perhaps Florida.

        
Republicans must also contend with a gender gap that was underscored by their Senate losses on election night in states like Missouri, Wisconsin and Connecticut. Jennifer Steinhauer explains how Republicans' stance on social issues affecting women, the poor and immigrants turned off female voters and cost the party some House seats as well.
 Happening in Washington: 

        
Economic data expected today include international trade for September and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by third-quarter mass layoffs and weekly mortgage rates.

        
President Obama is taking it easy with one item on his schedule: the daily briefing.

HEADLINE: Will Storm's Wall Street Impact Influence U.S. Carbon Policy?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at the idea that Hurricane Sandy will finally spur meaningful greenhouse policy. 

 BODY:
 Nov. 9, 9:39 a.m. | Updated below | 
I encourage you to read Tina Rosenberg's Fixes post, "A Change in the Weather on Wall Street."
The piece nicely summarizes why this storm, unlike other recent weather disasters with a climate-change component, has prompted so many politicians, including President Obama, to end their self-imposed silence on global warming. One reason, she writes, is that it disrupted the lives of Wall Street titans along with the common folk in the region. That cut through the reality of the rich-poor "climate divide."
So climate may no longer be the "C word." As Rosenberg writes, that's energizing climate campaigners, including Betsy Taylor, a strategist for foundations and nonprofit groups:
This year, the extreme weather began to change American views again - even before Hurricane Sandy. Numerous surveys - here's one from George Mason and Yale universities - show that Americans now overwhelmingly believe climate change is real and caused by humans, and that it threatens people in the United States. Another survey by the same organizations found that a political position in favor of climate action wins votes among Democratic and Independent voters, and does little harm with Republican voters.
Taylor commissioned a national survey about climate change, and from that wrote a strategy paper for advocates of action:

        
Talk about American patriotism. Americans don't shrink from a fight. Don't underestimate Americans and what we can do.
        
Talk about the world we are leaving our children.
        
Talk about the role of oil money.
Taylor says Hurricane Sandy has now added new arguments. One is that climate change is not just a threat for people elsewhere, in the future. It's here and now. Hurricane Katrina affected a part of the country that was largely poor, black and far from the centers of power. Not Sandy. "To have Hurricane Sandy hit where many powerful people live You're going to have lots of Republicans and Democrats sitting without water and light saying we can't ignore this," she said. "It's a tremendous new opportunity for us to break the stranglehold on Washington."
The other new argument is economic. Until this year, the political calculus about climate change had only one side. The oil and coal companies made sure everyone knew about the costs of action. But few people mentioned the costs of inaction. Now they cannot be ignored.
But will this shift in perceptions and evidence affect prospects for meaningful action on greenhouse gases -- which of course is a much tougher challenge than the near-term imperative of girding against future damage from such storms?
The piece makes the case for a yes answer.
I agree that breaking the silence is valuable (I long thought President Obama's climate sidesteps were a problem). And I see opportunities to build, locally and nationally, from concern about vulnerability to climate and coastal hazards to the challenge of moving beyond widespread dependence on coal and oil.
But a closer look at the tail end of Rosenberg's piece shows why no one should expect an easier path ahead than in previous years. (And the issues go far deeper than reform of the Senate.) Here's a deconstruction of a few sections, first on the role of greenhouse-driven warming in causing such losses and the impact of a greenhouse policy on stemming them: 
Natural disasters have been around a lot longer than man-made carbon emissions, and the destruction from extreme weather we are seeing today is due only in part to climate change. (How large a part? Depends on whom you ask.)
It might be too late - we could spend hundreds of billions on cutting carbon emissions and end up getting nothing for it in terms of reducing climate change.
Indeed, in the case of Hurricane Sandy, any role for greenhouse gases was a background influence, even according to Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who's been one of the most vocal scientists using extreme weather to make a case for emissions action. But of course, the extent of destruction from the storm surge came because a tiny bit of extra sea height can hugely amplify a storm's impact.
In the end, there's sufficient nuance in the science that a disaster of this sort can, like a Rorschach inkblot, be what anyone with a predisposition on global warming wants it to be. This was one point made by the climate communicator and campaigner George Marshall here earlier this week.
And Rosenberg's second point, that even a perfect greenhouse policy is unlikely to have a measurable influence on such threats, is buttressed by Brad Plumer's relevant recent Washington Post analysis of how little even aggressive carbon dioxide reductions would affect the pace at which sea levels rise: "Can we stop the seas from rising? Yes, but less than you think."
Rosenberg then provides a fresh framing of the economic argument for action against the argument favored by many of those favoring sustained dependence on fossil fuels:
Or the reverse - we could invest now in setting the United States on a greener path, and reap the benefits for generations. What Hurricane Sandy has made plain is that there is a balance. We're already paying for climate change, and that tax is only going to rise. Advocates for action can make the same argument as those who mock climate change: to do nothing is to be anti-jobs, anti-growth, anti-American values.
Framing climate-change costs as the equivalent of a hidden rising tax could be useful in debates over a climate response.
But this wouldn't preclude the inevitable fight over the costs and benefits of continued reliance on fossil fuels.
In revealing that the policy debate will inevitably come down to finding a balance, Rosenberg's piece helpfully reminds readers that climate science only frames this question, but does not offer a clear answer on what to do.
This is the difference between scientific description of a problem and prescriptions for addressing it - the philosopher David Hume's "is-ought" divide. As the climate scientist Ken Caldeira (who studied philosophy in college) reminded me years ago, "You can't get an ought from an is."
Also relevant is this thought from Richard Betts, a climatologist for Britain's climate agency:
Asking a climate scientist to define a "safe" or "dangerous" level of global warming is like asking a weather forecaster to decide whether you should cancel your wedding, school sports day, or other event because he's issued a severe weather warning. [ Relevant post ]
So, I encourage you to consider Rosenberg's column - not to mention Naomi Klein's potent post-Sandy indictment of "disaster capitalism" in The Nation -- with these ideas in mind as you weigh next steps on American climate policy.
Whether or not you or I like it, the path forward will remain largely shaped by a perpetual "slo-mo pushmi-pullyu fight" that is only partly determined by who has more money and influence (although those forces are real).
Our divergent value sets, from liberal to libertarian (social scientists use terms like communitarian and individualist to describe the same range), guarantee division on where to set the balance.
And therein lies just one of the reasons climate policy is "beyond super wicked," as I've said before. Just "super wicked" is bad enough, as Richard Lazarus of Harvard Law School explained in an important paper several years ago that had this sub-heading: "Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future." * 
Just reading that line gives you a good sense of how hard this will be.
Watch this video of this week's Duke University debate between carbon campaignerBill McKibben and carbon defender Alex Epstein to see how this plays out.
Who won?
Given that they argued their positions using entirely different framings of costs and benefits, victory is in the eyes of the viewer.
[* I usually am careful to note that this paper builds on a vitally important earlier paper and continuing line of research by Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, Steven Bernstein and Graeme Auld. Click here for their 2010 paper. Here's the latest iteration: "Overcoming the tragedy of super wicked problems: constraining our future selves to ameliorate global climate change." And here's a summary of a 2011 workshop at Yale (which I participated in): "Intervening to Constrain our Future Selves: Strategic Policy Interventions to Address the Super Wicked Problem of Climate Change."]

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Intelligence Help in War on Wildlife Traffickers

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Hillary Clinton describes new tactics, including the use of intelligence agencies, in the fight against global wildlife trafficking. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration, and the State Department in particular, face a long list of urgent issues, from Iran's nuclear weapons program to trade disputes with China. That makes it hard to maintain a focus on the environment, whether the issue is new approaches to climate diplomacy or endangered species.
That's why it was encouraging to see Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton take an hour today at State Department headquarters to stress the importance of stemming the booming illicit global trade in wildlife. She spoke to an audience of ambassadors, government officials, conservationists and scientists, noting that while much of the focus of late has been on Asian markets, the fast-growing middle class around the world - including in the United States - has created a huge market for a wide range of rare species and products derived from them. Shen announced several new initiatives, including having United States intelligence agencies to produce "an assessment of the impact of large-scale wildlife trafficking on our security interests." (The Times has launched a series on the connection between African poaching and insurgent groups on that continent.)
National Geographic has posted a report on the event. During a panel discussion at the event, Cristián Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, summarized things this way: "We need to protect the source, break the chain and stop demand."
Here's are excerpts from a transcript of Clinton's remarks:
[O]ver the past few years wildlife trafficking has become more organized, more lucrative, more widespread, and more dangerous than ever before.
As the middle class grows, which we all welcome and support, in many nations items like ivory or rhinoceros horn become symbols of wealth and social status. And so the demand for these goods rises. By some estimates, the black market in wildlife is rivaled in size only by trade in illegal arms and drugs. Today, ivory sells for nearly $1,000 per pound. Rhino horns are literally worth their weight in gold, $30,000 per pound.
What's more, we are increasingly seeing wildlife trafficking has serious implications for the security and prosperity of people around the world. Local populations that depend on wildlife, either for tourism or sustenance, are finding it harder and harder to maintain their livelihoods. Diseases are spreading to new corners of the globe through wildlife that is not properly inspected at border crossings. Park rangers are being killed. And we have good reason to believe that rebel militias are players in a worldwide ivory market worth millions and millions of dollars a year.
So yes, I think many of us are here because protecting wildlife is a matter of protecting our planet's natural beauty. We see it's a stewardship responsibility for us and this generation and future generations to come. But it is also a national security issue, a public health issue, and an economic security issue that is critical to each and every country represented here.
We all, unfortunately, contribute to the continued demand for illegal animal goods. Wildlife might be targeted and killed across Asia and Africa, but their furs, tusks, bones, and horns are sold all over the world. Smuggled goods from poached animals find their way to Europe, Australia, China, and the United States. I regret to say the United States is the second-largest destination market for illegally trafficked wildlife in the world. And that is something we are going to address....
First, on the diplomatic front, we are working with leaders from around the world to develop a global consensus on wildlife protection .
Secondly, we are reaching beyond governments to enlist the support of people. As part of this effort, Under Secretary Tara Sonenshine, our Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy, is spearheading a global outreach campaign which we will launch December 4th on Wildlife Conservation Day. Our embassies will use every tool at their disposal to raise awareness about this issue, from honoring local activists, to spreading the word on Facebook and Twitter. We want to make buying goods, products from trafficked wildlife, endangered species unacceptable, socially unacceptable. We want friends to tell friends they don't want friends who ingest, display, or otherwise use products that come from endangered species anywhere in the world.
Third, we're launching new initiatives to strengthen and expand enforcement areas. USAID has already provided more than $24 million over the past five years on a range of programs that combat wildlife crimes. Last year, they launched the ARREST program, which is establishing regional centers of expertise and expanding training programs for law enforcement. We really want to work with all of you, and we want both from countries that are victimized by trafficking to countries where consumers are the end-buyers of such products.
Finally, this is a global issue, and it calls, therefore, for a concerted global response. So I hope every government and organization here today will join the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking. That is the global partnership for sharing information on poachers and illicit traders. We'll also be convening meetings with traditional stakeholders like NGOs and governments and with less traditional stakeholders like air and cruise line companies to discuss new potential partnerships .
I want to mention one last step we're taking. Trafficking relies on porous borders, corrupt officials, and strong networks of organized crime, all of which undermine our mutual security. I'm asking the intelligence community to produce an assessment of the impact of large-scale wildlife trafficking on our security interests so we can fully understand what we're up against. When I was in Africa last summer, I was quite alarmed by the level of anxiety I heard from leaders. It is one thing to be worried about the traditional poachers who come in and kill and take a few animals, a few tusks, a few horns, or other animal parts. It's something else when you've got helicopters, night vision goggles, automatic weapons, which pose a threat to human life as well as wildlife.
The full speech and video are on the State Department Web site.

HEADLINE: For Obama, Housing Policy Presents Second-Term Headaches

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's economic team has consistently said it wants the housing market to work without significant government support. But it has taken few actual steps to advance that idea. 

 BODY:
A second-term president may be just the person to tackle America's housing problems.
When President Obama first came into office, home prices were crashing, foreclosures were soaring and the previous Bush administration had just initiated the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed entities that agree to repay mortgages if the original borrower defaults.
With the market in shambles in 2009, the Obama administration pursued a tentative housing policy, for the most part avoiding big moves that might have further weakened the housing market or banks. Eventually, there were some bolder initiatives, like the national mortgage settlement with big banks as well as the Treasury Department's aid programs for homeowners.
But as President Obama's first administration comes to an end, the government is still deeply embedded in the mortgage market. In the third quarter, various government entities backstopped 92 percent of all new residential mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a publication that focuses on the home loan industry.
Mr. Obama's economic team has consistently said it wants the housing market to work without significant government support. But it has taken few actual steps to advance that idea.
"I think Obama is absolutely committed to reducing the government's role," said Thomas Lawler, a former chief economist at Fannie Mae and founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, an industry analysis firm. "But no one's yet found a format to do that."
Housing policy is hard to tackle because so many people have benefited from the status quo. The entire real estate system - the banks, the agents, the home buyers - all depend on a market that provides fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages that can be easily refinanced when interest rates drop. That sort of loan is rare outside of the United States. And any effort to overhaul housing and the mortgage market could eventually reduce the amount of such mortgages in the country, angering many and creating a political firestorm.
In other words, the best person to fundamentally change how housing works may be a president who won't be running for office again.
Most immediately, the housing market has to be strong enough to deal with a government pullback. Some analysts think it's ready. "I think the housing recovery is far enough along that they can start winding down Fannie and Freddie," said Phillip L. Swagel at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
The administration can take smaller steps first. Mr. Lawler, the housing economist, thinks the government could start to reduce the maximum amount that it will guarantee for Fannie and Freddie loans. In some areas, like parts of the Northeast and California, it is as high as $625,000. Before the financial crisis, it was essentially capped at $417,000.
The big question is whether the private sector - banks and investors that buy bonds backed with mortgages - will pick up the slack when the government eases out of the market. If they don't, the supply of mortgages could fall and house prices could weaken.
Banks say their appetite depends on how new rules for mortgages turn out. In setting such regulations, some tough choices have to be made.
The new rules will effectively map the riskiness of various types of mortgages. In determining that, regulators will look at the features of the loans and the borrowers' income. Banks say they are unlikely to hold loans deemed risky, and their lobbyists are pressing for legal protection on the safer ones, called qualified mortgages.
The temptation will be to make the definition of what constitutes a qualified mortgage as broad as possible, to ensure that the banks lend to a wide range of borrowers. But regulators concerned with the health of the banks won't want a system that incentivizes institutions to make potentially risky loans.
One set of qualified mortgage regulations, being written by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could be completed as early as January. Other regulators, like the Federal Reserve, are expected to take longer in finishing their mortgage rules.
Resolving the conflict between mortgage availability and bank strength may depend on the person who replaces Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary. Mr. Geithner is stepping down at the end of Mr. Obama's first term.
The Obama administration faces other daunting decisions.
One is how to deal with the considerable number of troubled mortgages still in the financial system. Banks might be reluctant to make new loans until they have a better idea of the losses on the old loans. "If you don't ever deal with these problems, you may never get to where you want to go," said Mr. Lawler, the housing economist.
To help tackle that issue, the new administration might decide to make its mortgage relief programs more aggressive. It might even aim for more loan modifications, writing down the value of the mortgages to make them easier to pay. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has effectively blocked such write-downs on the vast amount of loans those entities have guaranteed.
A new Obama administration may move to change the agency's stance on write-downs, perhaps by replacing its acting director, Edward DeMarco. If that happened, it would be a sign that the White House had a taste for more radical housing actions. The agency declined to comment.
Then there's what to do with the Federal Housing Administration, another government entity that has backstopped a huge amount of mortgages since the financial crisis. The housing administration was set up to focus on lower-income borrowers, and it backs loans that have very low down payments. Its share of the market has grown since the crisis. The F.H.A. accounted for 13 percent of the market in the third quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.
The new administration has to decide whether it wants the F.H.A. to continue doing as much business. The risk is that a big pullback by the F.H.A. could reduce the availability of mortgages to lower-income borrowers. Banks almost certainly won't want to write loans with minuscule down payments since they are considered riskier.
Ultimately, housing policy comes down to one question: Which borrowers should get the most subsidies?
Right now, the government largess encompasses a wide swath of borrowers. But most analysts believe government support should be focused on lower-income borrowers.
"We will know that the Obama administration is serious about housing finance reform when it comes up with a proposal for affordable housing," said Mr. Swagel, the University of Maryland professor.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Cleared for $3 Billion Stock Buyback

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The bank also disclosed in its quarterly filing that it had come to an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to wrap up two investigations into mortgage-backed securities. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Thursday that it had received the green light from regulators to buy back as much as $3 billion of its stock in the first quarter of next year, another sign that the nation's largest bank is moving beyond a multibillion-dollar trading loss it suffered on a soured derivatives bet. 
In May, after first disclosing the trading losses, JPMorgan ceased stock buybacks and gave a revamped plan for its capital to the Federal Reserve in August. The central bank approved the new capital plan on Monday, according to JPMorgan's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. 
The trading losses, which occurred out of the bank's chief investment office, were a rare misstep for Jamie Dimon, the bank's outspoken chief executive. After successfully steering the bank through the roughest straits of the financial crisis of 2008, Mr. Dimon had gained a reputation as a keen manager of risk. That reputation was undercut after the losses, which stand at $6.2 billion, were first announced in May. 
Since then, JPMorgan has undertaken some organization acrobatics, shuffling its top executives and moving to claw back millions of dollars in compensation from the traders at the center of the bungled bets. 
The stock buyback approval will enable the bank to get back on track toward an ambitious plan to improve shareholder value. Ahead of the trading losses, Mr. Dimon promoted his plans to buy back the company's stock. Last year, the bank repurchased $9 billion of its shares. 
In March, after handily passing the Fed's stress test, Mr. Dimon announced plans to increase its dividend payments and buy back at least $15 billion worth of stock through 2013. In a brash move, he barreled ahead of regulators and told investors two days before the Fed had planned to announce the results of the stress test. 
JPMorgan also signaled in its quarterly filing that its litigation costs could swell and raised its reserves for legal expenses to $6 billion from the $5.3 billion it had disclosed earlier. 
And the bank disclosed that it had come to "an agreement in principle" with the S.E.C. to wrap up two investigations into its mortgage-backed securities business. Still, other potential legal headaches remain. 
JPMorgan is contending with a lawsuit against Bear Stearns, the troubled unit it acquired in the 2008 financial crisis. In its first salvo against a large bank, the federal mortgage task force, co-headed by New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued Bear Stearns and its lending unit, accusing it of swindling investors who bought mortgage-backed securities during the heady days of the housing boom. 
And federal authorities are building criminal cases related to the trading loss, scrutinizing taped calls in which bank employees discussed how to value the botched bets.

HEADLINE: Setting the Table for Tax Negotiations

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: The government can address the so-called fiscal cliff through more progressive spending, not higher tax rates, the author writes. 

 BODY:
The looming "fiscal cliff" presents an opportunity for a new grand bargain: make taxes flatter, but make spending more progressive. 
In July 2011, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner came close to striking a deal. It did not work out. During the presidential election campaign, each party retreated to its starting position, with the president pushing for tax increases on those making more than $250,000, and Republicans advocating spending cuts. So what now?
With only a few weeks before we reach that so-called fiscal cliff - automatic spending cuts and tax increases - the most likely solution is a temporary fix that, at best, would make a down payment on future changes. 
 But the negotiations also provide an opportunity to prepare the electorate for a broader discussion of tax and fiscal policy that should take place over the next two years. 
There are reasons to be optimistic. A tax overhaul is more likely to happen in a president's second term, as he has more leeway to pressure his own party to compromise. Max Baucus, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Dave Camp, a Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have worked together to hold a series of joint hearings in anticipation of possible legislative action. 
To be sure, the opportunity set for change in the tax law is limited by each party's core principles. For Democrats, preserving a safety net for the most vulnerable is a priority. For Republicans, cutting spending and keeping tax rates low are seen as critical to economic growth.
Is there a way forward? One approach to consider is flatter taxes (a less progressive rate structure on a broader base) and more progressive spending. As Eric M. Zolt, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, explains in a draft paper, we need to stop thinking about taxing the rich "as the only, or perhaps even the primary, way to increase social spending programs." 
Instead, he suggests, we may need less progressive taxes, or even regressive taxes, to finance more progressive spending programs. Mr. Zolt notes that outside the United States, "this is hardly a new insight." 
The Nordic and Western European countries for the most part refrain from heavily taxing the rich. They instead support progressive spending programs with policies like consumption taxes that are more regressive than those in the United States.
It would be difficult for President Obama to reverse course completely and not increase the portion of the tax burden that falls on the rich. But we do not have to raise tax revenue by raising rates. Broadening the base is the wiser choice. 
Here is what one version might look like. The tax side of the equation focuses on the tax base. Keep ordinary income rates where they are now, and drop the corporate rate to 25 percent. Increase the capital gains rate to 20 percent, which Wall Street already expects, or 25 percent. Adjust or create limits on some of the tax breaks that provide benefits without regard to income, like the home mortgage interest deduction and the exclusion of employer-financed health care insurance premiums. 
The spending side of the equation could address inequality. Through spending, not taxes, focus on bringing the bottom up, not knocking the top down. Aim government spending toward the poor and most vulnerable. Focus on programs that improve economic mobility, like job training and support for technical education.
Right now, government spending is only mildly progressive. Social Security and Medicare are mostly intergenerational transfers, not redistributive across income groups. Government subsidies for housing, retirement saving, health care and student loans could be better designed to help the poor and lower middle class. Too much of our government spending amounts to a cross-subsidization program, as federal tax revenue is used to subsidize each state's favorite industry. 
Would this approach of flatter taxes and more progressive spending work politically? Maybe. Each side gets something. 
For liberals, concentrating spending cuts on the wealthy and preserving programs for the poor protects the most vulnerable, improves the overall progressivity of the tax-and-transfer system, and better reduces inequality compared to raising the top tax rate. Conservatives would applaud no increase in tax rates, only a small increase in tax revenue, and a somewhat smaller government. 
The key is for both sides to embrace economic mobility as a litmus test for spending programs. Take education, for example. Subsidizing school lunches for needy elementary school children makes sense; it is hard to learn when you are hungry. Subsidizing technical training in community colleges makes sense; we should make sure that our citizens can fill the jobs that exist here and now, and in the future. 
By contrast, providing federal student loans for law school tuition is puzzling. Outside of the top 20 or so law schools, going to law school is hardly a certain step up the economic ladder. 
New York City's continued success as a global financial capital depends in part on how we, as a country, deal with inequality. Our comfort level with inequality depends on whether financial success is earned by merit rather than political connections or the happenstance of birth. Economic mobility over generations is the best measure of how much inequality we should embrace, and by that measure we are behind all developed countries except Britain.
Wall Street philanthropists understand that merit and economic mobility are part of the social compact that makes their wealth deserved. Hedge fund managers dominate the boards of many charter schools, which they support as a method of improving economic mobility while sidestepping the institutional dysfunction of local politics. 
And they would certainly support flatter taxes.

HEADLINE: Orient-Express Rejects Takeover Bid and Names New Chief

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Orient-Express Hotels formally rejected an unsolicited takeover bid by an arm of the Tata Group of India, criticizing it as undervalued and ill timed. It also named a new chief executive, John M. Scott, who would replace the company's outgoing leader. 

 BODY:
Orient-Express Hotels formally rejected an unsolicited takeover bid by an arm of the Tata Group of India, criticizing it as undervalued and ill timed. 
It also named a new chief executive, John M. Scott, who would replace the company's outgoing leader.
The formal notice sets up a potential battle over control of Orient-Express, an operator of high-end hotels, cruises and restaurants like the 21 Club. The Tata unit pursuing the takeover offer, Indian Hotels, is seeking to buy the 93 percent of Orient-Express that it doesn't already own.
In a letter to Indian Hotels, Orient-Express said that the takeover bid of $12.63 a share was not in its shareholders' best interests.
"You continue to state publicly that you are offering a significant premium, but your opportunistic proposal was made at a time when the price of Orient-Express shares has been significantly depressed," J. Robert Lovejoy, Orient-Express' chairman, wrote in the letter.
Mr. Lovejoy argued that the company was on a path to lift its stock price by finishing renovations and banking on an economic recovery. Orient-Express has already seen an increase in advance bookings for next year, he added.
Moreover, the company views the Indian Hotels offer as too low relative to what other properties in the luxury hotel market have fetched. While the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan has reportedly drawn a takeover offer worth some $2.4 million per room, the company values the takeover bid at less than $700,000 per room, according to a person close to the hotelier.
"Our board has unanimously concluded that your proposal significantly undervalues Orient-Express, and that now would be a highly disadvantageous time to sell the company," Mr. Lovejoy wrote.
He also pointed to the hiring of Mr. Scott, formerly the chief executive of Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, the privately held owner of the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. 
Mr. Scott was previously a managing director of acquisitions and asset management at Maritz, Wolff & Company and an executive at the Walt Disney Company.
A representative for Indian Hotels was not immediately available for comment.
Shares of Orient Express slumped nearly 8 percent in midday trading, to $10.94.
Orient-Express is being advised by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

HEADLINE: Priceline to Buy Kayak Software in $1.8 Billion Cash-Stock Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Priceline, a travel company from an earlier Internet age, is buying Kayak, its younger rival, for $40 a share, Kayak announced on Thursday. 

 BODY:
Just months after going public, Kayak Software has been snapped up by a rival.
On Thursday, Priceline.com, a travel company from an earlier Internet age, agreed to buy Kayak, a younger competitor, for $1.8 billion in cash and stock.
The acquisition, the largest in Priceline's history, could provide a new source of revenue for the company.
Priceline, once a highflying company that survived the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, acts as an online travel agent. It collects fees and commissions on reservations. Kayak, which was started in 2004, allows users to search other sites to compare prices. It makes most of its money from referrals and advertising.
"I see Kayak serving as a global entree into the advertising market for Priceline," said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. He said the deal could help Priceline "with their search rankings and give them some additional expertise in the technology department."
The companies' global ambitions are also symbiotic. Priceline, which also owns the Asian travel site Agoda.com, has been pushing into new markets overseas. International reservations accounted for 78 percent of its total last year.
In the third quarter, Kayak's revenue from outside the United States amounted to $17.3 million, a 40 percent increase from the period a year earlier, the company said whenit reported earningson Thursday. Overall third-quarter revenue rose 29 percent, to $78.6 million.
"We believe we can be helpful with Kayak's plans to build a global online travel brand," Priceline's chief executive, Jeffery H. Boyd, said in a statement.
The deal is yet another corporate evolution for Kayak. In a matter of months, the travel search site has gone from a privately held start-up to a publicly traded company to a unit operating under the umbrella of Priceline.
Following a long path to the public markets that started in 2010, Kayak got a relatively warm reception from investors in its July debut. Just months after the troubled offering of Facebook, shares of Kayak surged on their first day of trading, closing at roughly $33. Since then, the stock has fluctuated.
Priceline will pay roughly $40 a share for Kayak. At that level, the acquisition represents a 29 percent premium over Kayak's closing price of $31.04 a share on Thursday. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.
"We're excited to join the world's premier online travel company," Steve Hafner, Kayak's chief executive, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Who Has a Mandate?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: To hear some Republicans tell it, Election Day was a nationwide outpouring of support for their refusal to consider tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction plan. 

 BODY:
As the White House and Congress settle back into their longstanding arguments about taxing and spending, the word "mandate" is in the air. The question, specifically, is whether the president has one or not. To hear some Republicans tell it, Election Day was a nationwide outpouring of support for their refusal to consider tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction plan.
On Morning Edition today, Steve Inskeep reminded Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma that the president "won re-election calling for higher taxes on the wealthy" and that "even many voters for Mitt Romney said they favored higher taxes on the wealthy." Mr. Cole responded that the "same electorate re-elected a very substantial Republican majority to the House of Representatives, which had a different position than the one you just outlined."

House Speaker John Boehner, who said on Wednesday that "the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising taxes," was so smugly confident that he stood in front of a giant portrait of George Washington to lecture the newly re-elected president on the virtues of non-partisan leadership.
"Mr. President, this is your moment," he said. "We're ready to be led - not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We want you to lead, not as a liberal or conservative but as president of the United States of America."
When people like Mr. Boehner start talking like that, it generally means they're about to jump into a deep partisan foxhole and refuse to come out. (Remember also that Mr. Boehner made a deal with Mr. Obama on the debt ceiling in 2011 and could not deliver his caucus, because it is dominated by Tea Partiers and other hard-right radicals who certainly have no trouble behaving like Republicans.)
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cole think they have the authority to hold the line on taxes because the G.O.P. held on to its majority in the House. But that's not valid. Voters across the nation weren't necessarily voicing their approval for the party's position on the fiscal cliff in particular or taxes in general.
Like virtually all Congressional elections, this one boiled down to the power of incumbency. And, despite that power the Republicans lost seats in the House (as well as in the Senate).
Moreover, it's hard to argue that individual Congressional races reflect national issues (the 1994 "contract for America" election and the 2010 Tea Party wave notwithstanding). The presidential race, on the other hand, was about national issues and Mr. Obama made it clear that the rich should pay a higher share of taxes than they currently do. He beat the Republican ticket, which included one of the architects of the G.O.P.'s current economic program.
Negotiations are about to begin over the Bush tax cuts, which expire on Dec. 31, and the budget sequester, which will kick in Jan. 1. A sensible agreement will only emerge if the talk of a no-new-taxes mandate is just for public consumption, and Republican leaders are prepared to really compromise.

HEADLINE: Voting Their (Thin) Wallets

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: Low income voters, who favored President Obama, constitute a huge bloc. 

 BODY:
According to exit polls, "low income groups" went big for President Obama: 63 percent of voters with family income under $30,000 voted for Mr. Obama, as did 57 percent of those with income between $30,000 and $49,999.
These low income voters are not just another vital minority, akin to and overlapping with the African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, young people and union members who supported Mr. Obama in large numbers.
Rather, low income voters constitute a huge bloc, even a majority by some measures. According to the Tax Policy Center, roughly 60 percent of families have incomes under $50,000, with some 40 percent making under $30,000 and 20 percent making between $30,000 and $50,000.

Census Bureau data show a smaller though still significant share of the population - 42 percent - in the under $50,000 category.
The discrepancy is due to measurement differences. For example, the Tax Policy Center gets most of its data from tax returns and counts the income of the tax filer (and spouse, if filing jointly); the Census bureau gets its data from surveys and counts the income of everyone in a household, including roommates and teenagers.
But by either measure, the under $50,000 crowd is enormous. Their numbers reflect the reality and challenge of modern economic life: With the distribution of income skewed to the top, the United States is no longer a country with an expanding middle class and broad prosperity. Instead, it is increasingly a place where families are poor or near poor or struggling to maintain a grip on the middle rungs - a state of affairs that has been tolerated and even condoned for too long.
When Mr. Obama built his campaign around restoring the middle class, he was speaking to the many.

HEADLINE: ESPN, as Usual, Spurs Quarterly Growth at Disney

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The cable television division, built around ESPN and Disney Channel, had a 9 percent climb in operating income, powered by ESPN and higher rates paid by cable affiliates. The video game and Web site unit, however, suffered its 16th consecutive losing quarter. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Disney's theme park and consumer products units each produced robust fourth-quarter growth, but it was ESPN - as usual - that delivered the biggest boost to the entertainment conglomerate, the company reported Thursday.
 For the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 29, Disney reported a profit of $1.24 billion, or 68 cents a share, a 14 percent increase from $1.09 billion, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Disney met analyst expectations (although it is customary for the company to beat them.) Revenue increased a modest 3 percent, to $10.78 billion. 
 Results were not uniformly positive, however. Disney's movie studio reported weak operating income of $80 million, a 32 percent decline from the year-earlier period - even though the studio released the DVD of its "Avengers" blockbuster in the quarter. Lower worldwide theatrical results and high marketing costs for "Frankenweenie," which flopped at the box office, were to blame.
 Still, Disney's cable television division, centered on ESPN and Disney Channel, saw operating income climb 9 percent, to $1.38 billion. The increase was powered by growth at ESPN that came from higher contractual rates from cable system affiliates, as well as decreased marketing costs. These increases were partly offset by higher ESPN programming costs tied to Major League Baseball and expanded Wimbledon rights.
 The company's Parks and Resorts unit -- closely watched as an informal barometer of discretionary spending in the broader economy - reported an 18 percent increase in operating income, to $497 million. Higher attendance at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland helped, but more capacity at Disney's cruise line appeared to be the largest contributor. Results for Disney's North American parks were flat.
 Strong sales of Spider-Man and Avengers merchandise helped deliver operating income of $267 million, a 29 percent increase from a year earlier, at Disney's consumer products unit, a signal that efforts to rewire the division are working.
 The troubled Disney Interactive, home to the company's video game business and Disney.com, reported a loss of $76 million, an improvement from a loss of $94 million a year ago. But the division has now suffered 16 consecutive quarters of losses - over $1 billion in total.
Disney hopes a barrage of recent changes at Disney.com and the Nov. 18 release of the video game "Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two'' will help to finally turn the tide.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths BERLISS, SUZANNE FRANKEL

 BODY:
BERLISS--Suzanne Frankel, died peacefully on October 31, 2012 at age 94. She is survived by her son, Henry; her grandsons, Jeremy and Jeffrey, and her brother, James. She grew up in Cleveland Heights, OH and, after graduation from Heights High, she attended Goucher College where she graduated in 1940. She married Arthur Berliss, Jr. on August 16, 1940. Sue and Arthur first met when she attended a Yale football game as the date of a mutual friend, Herb Buckman, who remained a lifelong friend of theirs. 
While Arthur served in the US Navy during World War II (much of it overseas), Sue volunteered as a nurse's aide and in other armed services support capacities in New Orleans and other United States cities where Arthur was stationed. Their daughter, Elizabeth, was born October 18, 1943 and their son, Henry, on May 14, 1945. She went back to school and earned a masters degree from Bank Street College in New York City, an institution she continued to actively support and raise substantial funds for. In 1957 Sue began working in the field of early childhood education. Her work assignments ranged from Dalton School to South Bronx day care centers such as Sunshine Day Care Center and Molly Perlbinder Day Care Center. In addition to her support of Bank Street College, Sue was an active board member and fundraiser for Student Advocacy in Elmsford, NY, which gave her great satisfaction. Throughout her life she worked effectively with children and adults of all economic and social backgrounds. She and Arthur traveled extensively, both on their own and with family. In 1975 Sue and all her family mourned the death of her daughter, Elizabeth. Her grandsons, Jeremy and Jeffrey, born in 1976 and 1980 respectively, were always a great source of joy for her and Arthur. Sue always had a great love of classical music, and she played the piano much better than she thought she did. Sue was buried on November 2, 2012 between Arthur and Elizabeth. A memorial service will be scheduled. In lieu of flowers, contributions are suggested to Student Advocacy or Bank Street College, or such other charity that people who knew and loved Sue choose.

HEADLINE: Food Banks Expand Beyond Hunger

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
FOR the recent East Coast hurricane, as in other emergencies, food banks were on the front lines with food, bottled water and cleaning supplies. They have long held sway in the public consciousness as providers of nonperishables.
But in fact, holding food drives and handing out cans of soup and tuna make up only a small part of what food banks do over the course of a year. Count the timely provision of fresh produce and nutrition education as among their newer core duties.
For millions of people, food banks have become more than a stopgap measure; rather, they are a chronic coping strategy, said Maura Daly, chief communication and development officer at Feeding America, the umbrella organization for the nation's 200-plus food banks. ''The majority of our clients are receiving food assistance for six months or longer,'' she said. 
Food banks provide assistance to more than 37 million Americans a year through more than 61,000 outlets, including food pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters, Feeding America said. The number of people served by food banks rose 46 percent from 2006 to 2010, mainly because of the recession, which Ms. Daly said increased demand among the unemployed and also among the working poor and the underemployed.
The storm's impact has strained the organization as it balances emergency relief with its role of serving clients' long-term needs, Ms. Daly said. An added challenge is the storm's timing: just before the holiday season, which is the busiest period of the year for food banks.
But when such emergencies are not absorbing their attention, food banks have increasingly moved beyond providing short-term supplies of food and water to confronting chronic hunger and poor nutrition, and the reality that the poor can suffer from hunger and obesity.
More efforts are in place to feed children during nonschool hours, to reach low-income seniors and to bring mobile pantries to neighborhoods that lack nearby food sources. Food banks are also encouraging more people to take advantage of the federal food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was greatly expanded since the recession.
Just as groceries and restaurants have turned their attention to fresh produce in recent years, so have food banks; this has meant a greater focus on nutrition education and new logistical challenges of delivery. ''Two-thirds of the food we distribute is fresh produce,'' said Paul Ash, executive director of the San Francisco and Marin Food Banks. Much of the food comes from packers and growers, he said, and if a truckload of carrots comes in, the food bank has no time to dither about what to do with it.
Since ''we have some clients who don't have a good grasp of the basics of nutrition,'' as Mr. Ash puts it, the San Francisco organization also offers cooking classes, while recognizing that many of its clients have limited kitchens. In a recent class, for example, students learned how to prepare ratatouille and scrambled eggs in a microwave.
The organization also sets up food pantries that resemble farmers markets. ''It's a really respectful experience,'' Mr. Ash said, and clients can choose among a variety of foods.
Some food banks are buying farmland as a way to bring more fresh produce to their clients. Several years ago, for example, the Vermont Foodbank bought a farm in Warren, Vt.; it is farmed by a couple who make their lease payments in food. Volunteers from local food organizations come to the farm to gather their share.
Refrigeration is also crucial to adding more produce to the diets of food bank clients. Hundreds of refrigerated trucks go to retail locations like Walmart, Kroger and Target and pick up food that is ''fully consumable but nearing its 'best if used by' date'' for use by food banks, Ms. Daly of Feeding America said.
A food bank in Tennessee in 2005 received enough charitable funding to invest in manufacturing technology that can cook and then freeze fresh food for use up to a year later. A culinary team comes up with meal ideas based on the donations that arrive. The ingredients are pressure-cooked and placed in bags, which are then flash-frozen to lock in taste and nutrition, said Tasha Kennard, vice president of marketing and communications for the Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee, which includes the Nashville area.
Meals like spaghetti, chicken and dumplings, burritos and chili can be fully cooked and frozen this way, to be reheated by clients later. Only a handful of food banks have this kind of equipment, so the Nashville plant also makes frozen meals for other food banks across the country.
With all of these innovations occurring at food banks, is there still a place for the humble food drive? ''Food drives are a wonderful way for people to engage with the issue of hunger,'' Ms. Daly said, but they account for only a tiny percentage of food banks' supplies. Food donations come mainly from corporations, the government and growers.
Andy Fisher, a co-founder of an antihunger organization, maintains that Feeding America's dependence on corporations for donations is preventing it from doing the type of advocacy work, in areas like the minimum wage and health care, that could help eliminate some of the root causes of hunger and poverty. Emergencies like hurricanes are exactly the kinds of things that food banks should mainly handle, he said. ''They do a great job of that; they're incredibly well prepared logistically.''
Ms. Daly said Feeding America wanted to remain a bipartisan organization, and took positions only on policies that directly affected its food banks and clients. Because of limited resources, she said, the group focuses solely on its core mission of feeding the hungry

HEADLINE: Getting Back More Than a Warm Feeling

BYLINE: By CAROLINE PRESTON

 BODY:
THE seven teenagers sit with their feet tucked under tan desks in a classroom in New York City's Rikers Island jail, taking turns answering ''icebreaker'' questions they've fished from an envelope.
''What's your favorite thing to do with your time?'' asks one young man, the rowdiest of the group. He answers himself: ''Reading.''
''Really?'' says Joyce Gendler, their peppy 22-year-old instructor, with just a hint of incredulity. ''Good.'' A few minutes later, she begins to engage them in the day's activity, making sympathy cards for people who are sick. 
The adolescents are part of a new program aimed at building personal responsibility and life skills, with the goal that fewer of them will re-offend. The program is financed by an innovative mechanism called a social impact bond, one of a handful of ways that philanthropy is trying to tap new pools of funding to produce measurable social results. If the program succeeds in significantly reducing recidivism, the ''investors'' paying its upfront costs -- in this case, Goldman Sachs, with backing from Bloomberg Philanthropies -- will be repaid by the city with a modest return. If the program falls short, the investors lose their money, sparing taxpayers the costs of the program.
The ''social impact bond,'' also known as a ''pay for success'' bond, is the latest -- and most discussed -- tool in a broader playbook philanthropists are using to blend business and charity to make a bigger difference. Sometimes known as impact investing, these approaches include providing low-interest loans to nonprofits, making equity investments in companies that tackle social problems and investing a portion of a foundation's endowment in enterprises that produce measurable benefits to society and a financial return.''There's a recognition that philanthropy and government can't solve all the social problems,'' says Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which has spent $40 million since 2009 to develop the field of impact investing. ''And then you have investors who maybe didn't want as bright a line between their charity and philanthropy on one side and their financial investments on another, and they began to look for blended opportunities.''
While many of these opportunities focus on microfinance, farming or other fields in which there is an obvious way to generate revenue, social impact bonds offer something new. They pay back investors through the savings a government could accrue if a preventive program succeeded in its goals of reducing recidivism or keeping children out of foster care, bringing an opportunity for financial returns to a new set of society's knottiest problems.
The bond concept has drawn interest from many government officials and some nonprofits eager for new financial support. But it has also stirred concerns among people who say the idea is impractical, ignores political realities and risks putting profits ahead of what is best for society.
The bonds were first tried in Britain two years ago, to finance a program for 3,000 prisoners at Her Majesty's Prison Peterborough. In Britain, 60 percent of prisoners who serve short sentences land back in jail within a year; by helping parolees find housing and other support, the program aims to reduce the recidivism rate by 7.5 percent.
Initial results won't be available for another two years, but Alisa Helbitz, director of research and communications at Social Finance, in Britain, says anecdotal feedback has been positive. Participation rates are high -- the program is optional for prisoners, though organizers are trying to reach as many people as they can -- and some local police say they are pleased with the project. The ''investors,'' in this case, included philanthropies like the Rockefeller Foundation.
Since then, the social impact bond idea has spread at a pace that has surprised some in the slow-moving world of philanthropy.
''There's been a gold-rush mentality,'' says Daniel Stid, a partner with the Bridgespan Group, which provides consulting services to nonprofits.
The federal government and the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, as well as Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Fresno, Calif., are introducing or exploring social impact bonds. Most of the programs focus on problems like helping parolees find jobs or housing the chronically homeless, where a preventive approach could produce obvious savings.
Nonprofits and foundations are investigating other ways to use the bond idea. Health impact bonds, for example, could finance the upfront costs of retrofitting homes to reduce asthma rates. Development impact bonds might provide a new way to pay for foreign aid programs.
''If we're successful,'' says Tracy Palandjian, co-founder of Social Finance, a sister organization of the group in Britain, ''social impact bonds will create a pathway for great nonprofits to access capital from capital markets.''
Still, she and others stress that the bonds are just a tool that will suit only certain programs, not a replacement for government or philanthropic dollars.
The bonds work by bringing together investors, nonprofits and government to agree on a social program and how long it will take to produce savings. In New York City's case, Goldman is lending $9.6 million to MDRC, a nonprofit group that oversees the work of two charities running the jail program. A fourth nonprofit evaluates the results of the four-year program.
If recidivism rates drop by 10 percent, Goldman gets its money back. The bank could make up to $2.1 million if the rates fall further. (Bloomberg Philanthropies is guaranteeing $7.4 million of the loan, leading some to say the New York City deal is not a true test of the bonds' appeal to commercial investors.)
All those additional layers drive up the costs of a program. Proponents say it is worth it because governments can rarely find the money to pay for preventive programs, and the rigorous evaluations demonstrate a program's effectiveness and encourage future spending on projects that work.
Government officials like Linda Gibbs, New York City's deputy mayor of health and human services, see social impact bonds as a way to strip away some of the ''inefficient and ineffective'' spending that is caught up in running governments. Governments could close jails and emergency shelters for homeless people if they could find others to pay for the preventive programs they say they can't afford.
''Government is often unwilling to try unproven approaches because taxpayers rightfully don't want money being wasted,'' says Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ''Social impact bonds are unique because they repay the investor only if a program's goals -- like New York City's aim to reduce recidivism -- are actually met.
''They're exciting because they have the potential to be a new financial tool that can empower governments to innovate in ways they wouldn't otherwise attempt.''
Nonprofits leaders' reactions to the bonds, meanwhile, have been mixed. Ideally, they say, governments would finance these programs directly. They also worry that donors will drift toward these profit-generating models and away from outright giving.
Elizabeth Gaynes, who has led the Osborne Association, one of two groups running the Rikers Island program, for 28 years, takes a realist's approach.
Ms. Gaynes said she doubted that without this experimental financing mechanism, her organization would have found the money to aid so many young people. The group has a mandate to serve all of the roughly 3,000 young people who pass through Rikers each a year.
''We're serving black and brown people who got arrested and went to Rikers Island,'' says Ms. Gaynes. ''There isn't a lot of clamoring to give them services.''
Whether investors will see the bonds as a viable way to make money remains a big question, however.
Andrew Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says he believes the bonds can generate interest from investors beyond philanthropy. ''I'm very bullish about the concept of social impact bonds,'' he says.
Others are more cautious.
Ron Cordes, a former wealth manager and now a philanthropist who describes himself as a ''pro bono evangelist of impact investing,'' says the concept is great. But, he added, ''Putting my investor hat on, what we need now is a number of pilots that demonstrate they work.''
While efforts to harness capital markets for social good aren't new, more donors say they are exploring such investment approaches as they struggle to have a bigger impact.
Jean Case started the Case Foundation with her husband, Steve, co-founder of AOL, in 1997. This year, the foundation hired Sonal Shah, former head of the White House Office of Social Innovation, to study how the foundation might help to expand the number of private investors who seek social as well as financial returns.
Ms. Case has invested personal money in technology businesses in the West Bank and in a company that helps charities raise money online, for example. She says she wants to do more.
''It's time to try something new because we're not seeing the impact in too many areas we've wanted to see, for too long,'' says Ms. Case.
One question that dogs these kinds of approaches, meanwhile, is whether they make a real dent in social problems.
Dave Peery, who manages his family's foundation, says he worries that investors may be kidding themselves that their contributions to social enterprises are getting at the roots of poverty.
''Generally, they are happy if they can get their money back, while helping a business with meager social returns,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''For example, a taxi business in Guatemala, a laundromat franchise in India. These create a few jobs, but they assume the simple creation of access to goods and services can be deemed as social impact. Just because people have access to modern laundry services doesn't mean their lives are demonstrably better.''
Mr. Cordes says the key is knowing when to make a pure charitable gift and when to seek a return. He invests part of his foundation's endowment in microfinance groups, he says, seeking a return. But in parts of rural Africa, where the institutions are newer and still developing, he provides money with no expectation of repayment .
Luther Ragin Jr., chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, says the obstacle to impact investing is not the difficulty of marrying financial and social returns, but of a lack of data on how to identify and assess quality nonprofits and socially minded businesses. His group and others are trying to develop that information; for example, they are creating a way to standardize information on organizations' social, environmental and financial impact.
For some people in the nonprofit world, social impact bonds stir fresh concerns.
Mark Rosenman, an emeritus professor at Union Institute and University in Cincinnati, urges caution when mixing profit and purpose.
''When we seek to introduce the profit motive, we begin to abandon who we are as a people and abandon our responsibility for the common good in pursuit of private profit,'' he says.
He cites the example of for-profit colleges, which have been criticized by some in Congress for focusing less on educating students than on marketing, recruitment and other strategies aimed at pleasing shareholders.
Mr. Rosenman says he is also perplexed as to why the Rikers Island bond deal, involving less than $10 million in financing, has generated so much ''hoopla.'' He says a proposed tax on financial transactions, known as the Robin Hood tax, could raise far more money and provide the resources for broader change. Tools like social impact bonds, he says, are ''tinkering at the margins.''
Peter York, chief research and learning officer of the TCC Group, says the idea that social impact bonds can prove a program's effectiveness, and help replicate it elsewhere, is more complicated than proponents admit.
A program that works in Oklahoma might not work in Oakland, Calif., he says. Or, what succeeds in helping a 65-year old parolee might not work with a 19-year-old. Assessing whether a program strengthens families or puts young people on a track to success, he says, is not like testing ''pills or clinical interventions.''
Mr. York also says he has concerns about government paying for programs after the fact. He worries that government leaders who favor fewer social service programs will push the metric of success for social impact bonds, the reduction in number of homeless people seeking emergency services, for example, to unrealistic points. The programs then might never get off the ground.
Christopher Stone, who leads George Soros's Open Society Foundations, agrees, calling social impact bonds ''a bubble.'' Newly elected politicians who face the prospect of paying off investors who've arranged bond deals with their predecessors in office will have every incentive to say a social program didn't work, he says.
Advocates, though, say many of these challenges will be overcome in the design of individual ''deals.''
Ms. Rodin says concerns around the role of profit in social programs are ''highly legitimate.'' But she says market-based approaches to financing social programs are not exploitative.
''Yes, someone is making money, but they are not making money off the backs of the poor,'' she says. ''They are making money by the poor or the person who is homeless or who has just been released from jail having a higher probability of getting a proven and effective program, of getting cared for in the most effective way rather than thrown back into society and ignored.''
Ms. Palandjian sees it as a ''philosophical divide.'' In her view, social impact bonds are a way to begin to rewrite the ''social contract'' with government, in which the for-profit world takes on a bigger role in easing social problems.
Traditional ways of raising money have their own drawbacks, said Ms. Gaynes of the Osborne Association.
''Frankly, the old model of charity throwing dimes at people on the street, the Lady Bountiful model, isn't any more respectful of the lives of the people we're serving,'' she says. ''Or what about philanthropists who are using their money to tell you what to do? This is a tough business.''
On Rikers Island, a new model for financing charity is in its early days.
As the afternoon session wraps up, one of the youths, his attention drifting, is tasked with collecting Crayola markers and pencils the teenagers have used to create sympathy cards. Ms. Gendler adds their cards to a pile from earlier classes.
Most of the cards bear messages like ''Get Well'' and ''Stay Healthy.'' One young man has written, in skinny blue-and-red letters, a message to other teenagers like him: ''Stay out of Jail.''
Goldman Sachs, Mayor Bloomberg's foundation and all of philanthropy will have to wait until 2016 -- when the program's results are revealed -- to learn how many of the young men decide to follow that advice.

HEADLINE: Komen Foundation Struggles to Regain Wide Support

BYLINE: By DAVID WALLIS

 BODY:
AS a phalanx of pink marched down Fifth Avenue in New York on a recent Sunday morning during Avon's Walk for Breast Cancer, a group of women who call themselves the Social Sisters stood on the sidewalk, tooting on noisemakers and waving pompoms. ''Way to go, ladies,'' screamed Sarah Robertson, who completed the 39.3-mile walk last year.
But when asked if she would support another prominent nonprofit battling breast cancer, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Ms. Robertson's cheery tone darkened. ''I personally wouldn't walk for Komen,'' she said, citing the organization's decision, disclosed in January, to eliminate $680,000 in grants to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings and education programs.
Seen by many as a statement against legal abortion -- Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider, though it also performs many other health services -- the decision created a firestorm. Criticism of Komen dominated news coverage, and boycotts of the organization and some of its corporate sponsors spread through social media. 
Komen quickly reversed course and restored the grants, but Ms. Robertson, who supports abortion rights, was not moved. ''You only have so much time, effort and money to give,'' she said.
On the other side of the abortion divide, the Atlanta archdiocese of the Catholic Church denounced a local Komen affiliate last month for its tenuous connection to Planned Parenthood. In an internal memo, the archdiocese said support for Komen Atlanta amounted to ''direct cooperation with evil.'' Komen Atlanta has not financed Planned Parenthood programs, but the archdiocese criticized it for having worked ''behind the scenes'' through Facebook to persuade Komen's national organization to reinstate the grants.
The people at Komen, it seems, are pilloried no matter what they do.
Komen, the nation's largest nonprofit devoted to preventing, treating and curing breast cancer, has moved to restore its battered brand. But several academics, crisis communications consultants and cause marketing experts said it needed to take more drastic action.
In a recent study by Harris Interactive, Komen's ''brand health'' score fell 21 percent from last year. In the 23 years Harris has done the study, only Fannie Mae in 2009 had a bigger drop.
The damage to Komen transcends image problems. A spokeswoman said the organization's signature Race for the Cure attracted 19 percent fewer participants through October than in the same period last year. Several Komen affiliates have reported that preliminary fund-raising figures from recent races were down from last year.
While the economy and more competition from similar events could depress fund-raising, many of these affiliates say they think the Planned Parenthood fallout contributed to the drop-off.
So far, corporate sponsors have stuck by the organization. General Mills significantly expanded its relationship with Komen this year, and World Wrestling Entertainment formed a new marketing alliance with the nonprofit.
But David Hessekiel, president of the Cause Marketing Forum and co-author of ''Good Works: Marketing and Corporate Initiatives that Build a Better World ... and the Bottom Line,'' said he expected some sponsors to eventually, and discreetly, distance themselves from Komen. ''A lot of people are spreading their bets by working with several breast cancer charities,'' Mr. Hessekiel said. Some, he noted, ''probably have multiyear contracts. It's not so easy on a dime to extricate yourself.''
Gene Grabowski, executive vice president of Levick Strategic Communications in Washington, criticized Komen for letting its mission become entangled with politics and offending ''both sides of the political spectrum.''
Mr. Grabowski, who specializes in crisis management, estimated that depoliticizing the brand could take as long as four years. ''If it had been a run-of-the-mill scandal, something that was not involving politics, where you can remove one executive or human fallibility is easily grasped, then you can get out of situations a little bit easier,'' he said.
Komen seizes every chance to remind critics of its good deeds. ''What we are focused on now is mission,'' said Andrea Rader, its managing director of communications. ''There are people who are still interested in talking about the controversy. They will do that. All we can do is demonstrate that what we do is important, it matters, it saves lives, it gets us closer to cure.''
Ms. Rader described a multipronged effort to refocus attention on Komen's accomplishments.
For National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, she said, Komen started a blog, 31 Days of Impact, with daily testimonials from breast cancer survivors, advocates and researchers.
The organization has also begun a print and television advertising campaign, ''I Am Susan G. Komen,'' to show how it helped four breast cancer survivors. In one TV spot, Alantheia Peña, a Bronx resident who received financial assistance from Komen, recounts tearfully of learning of her diagnosis when both of her daughters were pregnant. ''Everything I was looking forward to turned into everything I was going to miss: first words, first steps, being there for my grandchildren,'' she says.
Daniel Diermeier, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and author of ''Reputation Rules: Strategies for Building Your Company's Most Valuable Asset,'' praised Komen's ads. ''The organization or the brand is damaged, and then what you do is try to connect it with personal stories to reinvigorate,'' Mr. Diermeier said. ''Remind people that you are saving lives.''
Some executives associated with the Planned Parenthood imbroglio have left Komen. Karen C. Handel, who was the group's senior vice president for public policy and advocated cutting financing to Planned Parenthood, resigned in February. Before joining Komen, Ms. Handel had expressed her opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood in an unsuccessful run to become the Republican nominee for governor of Georgia.
Ms. Handel, author of ''Planned Bullyhood: The Truth About the Planned Parenthood Funding Battle With Susan G. Komen for the Cure,'' said Komen was paying a price for alienating anti-abortion supporters. ''I could not work for an organization that gave in to political pressure and put political pressure and the threats from Planned Parenthood and their allies over the mission of the organization,'' she said in a telephone interview.
Ms. Rader responded: ''These are Karen's personal views. In reversing the decision, we acted in the best interests of the women we serve and the organization's mission.''
A former executive and a current adviser said Komen's postcontroversy strategy involved lowering the profile of its chief executive, Nancy G. Brinker, who founded the organization in 1982 to honor her sister, who died of breast cancer. Ms. Brinker signed off last November on cutting Planned Parenthood's grants, and an interview she gave Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC to justify the decision was widely criticized.
''The strategy has been to keep Nancy under wraps a bit -- have her stop being a lightning rod,'' said a former Komen executive, who was not authorized to speak for the organization and requested anonymity.
Ms. Rader denied that Komen was silencing Ms. Brinker. ''Nancy has been active this year,'' she said. ''She has given speeches. She appeared at the U.N. General Assembly. Nobody is hiding Nancy.'' She said Ms. Brinker would not be made available for an interview.
In August, Ms. Brinker announced that she would step down as chief executive to become chairwoman of the Komen Board Executive Committee, focusing on fund-raising and on expanding Komen's international presence.
Denise Sevick Bortree, an assistant professor at Pennsylvania State University's College of Communications who studies nonprofits, said she doubted that Ms. Brinker's new job would mollify angry donors. ''She's gone, but she's not really gone,'' Ms. Sevick Bortree said. ''Getting rid of the people, the board who had been involved in the decision, would have been a way to acknowledge that this was a mistake.''
But cleaning house can be costly, Ms. Sevick Bortree said, because ''removing board members eliminates huge sources of funding for the organization.''
Mr. Grabowski, the crisis communications consultant, said Ms. Brinker should resign ''for the good of the cause.'' He cited the recent departure of Lance Armstrong, the former professional bicycle racer who is mired in a doping scandal, from Livestrong, the cancer charity Mr. Armstrong started. ''Lance leaves and Livestrong moves forward,'' Mr. Grabowski said.
Even if Ms. Brinker remains at Komen, Mr. Grabowski said, there are remedial measures the organization can take to regain its footing. For instance, he said, Komen could follow the example of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, which uses the actress Mary Tyler Moore as its main representative.
''You need a new face,'' Mr. Grabowski said. ''Under these circumstances, it would be helpful to have an icon, someone who can give them cover.''

HEADLINE: Not a Public Park, but a 'People-Powered' One

BYLINE: By GREG BEATO

 BODY:
THE waterfall that is the best-known feature of the Bohemia Ecological Preserve is currently nothing more than a picturesque spill of bone-dry rocks. The shaggy grasslands that carpet the preserve's rolling terrain are a parched golden brown.
But as Craig Anderson, 51, leads a group of hikers up gravel roads toward a hilltop campground, the fact that the landscape is at something less than peak splendor after several rain-free months does little to diminish his enthusiasm. And why should it? In California's economic climate -- also fairly parched -- Bohemia Ecological Preserve is that rarest of specimens: a recently opened park. In May, it celebrated its official grand opening.
Granted, caveats are in order. Bohemia, about 15 miles west of Santa Rosa, is not owned or operated by the California Department of Parks and Recreation or any other government agency. It is the property of LandPaths, a nonprofit that encourages people to experience the land of Sonoma County, and where Mr. Anderson serves as executive director. Also, while Bohemia is open to the public, access is provided only through guided hikes, volunteer stewardship opportunities and other scheduled events. 
And yet, at a time when public parks have been undergoing budget cuts and service reductions, Bohemia and the other properties LandPaths manages -- including Grove of the Old Trees, a 28-acre stand of old-growth redwood trees in Occidental, and Willow Creek State Park, a 3,300-acre preserve near the town of Duncan Mills that LandPaths operates for the state -- have been engineered from the ground up to survive in less forgiving economic environments.
''We call what we do 'people-powered parks,' '' Mr. Anderson tells the hikers at one point. ''As the government's been less able, the people are stepping up.''
Essentially, people-powered parks expand on the volunteerism that has always been a facet of public parks -- so much so that LandPaths can operate its holdings at a fraction of what it would cost the state.
Paradoxically, the LandPaths vision arose in part as a response to relatively well-financed parks and the way they can turn the outdoors into little more than a consumerized, turnkey experience for users. Instead of offering visitors a scenic parking lot to hook up their R.V.'s, Mr. Anderson wanted to create places that encouraged visitors to establish deeper connections with the land through active stewardship.
But persuading visitors to build trails and uproot invasive plant species on a regular basis is not just a good way to foster a love of the land -- the hands-on approach that LandPaths adopted in the late 1990s is also a way to keep open space accessible at a time when California voters have rejected even modest tax increases to provide the money that public parks need to maintain current services.
''I'm always looking for new models, new changes in the way people do business,'' says Ted Swindells, a venture investor based in San Francisco. ''And that's what I saw in LandPaths.''
Mr. Swindells learned about the nonprofit two years ago, when he was looking for something to do with a large piece of property he had bought a decade earlier, a parcel known as Bohemia Ranch. The land had been used for a cattle ranch, for logging and for mining, but for years before Mr. Swindells's purchase it had been held by real estate developers who had done little to maintain it. As a result, it was a popular party spot. On summer days, it rang with the whine of motorcycles and the crack of gunfire. A meadow known as the ''shooting gallery'' offered a scenic setting for target practice.
''There was garbage everywhere, especially old cars and shotgun shells, so I was advised to get an environmental impact report when I bought it,'' Mr. Swindells remembers. ''They basically said there was nothing to worry about, but they also didn't see one living thing -- no animals, no birds, not even any lizards. I think the people who'd been hanging out up there had been getting drunk and shooting anything that moved.''
Mr. Swindells, who hails from an Oregon logging family, bought the property in part to create a weekend retreat and in part to get some hands-on experience in conservation practices. But despite considerable investment, he and his family never ended up spending much time there. In 2009, he decided he wanted to sell, preferably to keep the property available for public use.
Years earlier, he had established a conservation easement that restricted the ways he or any future owners could develop the land. The nonprofit to which he had donated the easement, Sonoma Land Trust, tried to structure a deal with state and local agencies. But Mr. Swindells began to doubt that the state could effectively manage the property; it had its hands full trying to stave off closings and cutbacks in the hundreds of parks it was already operating.
LandPaths was a different story. ''That's what they do,'' says Liz Burko, the state's superintendent of the Russian River and Mendocino park districts. ''They know how to inspire people to want to take responsibility for the stewardship of public lands.''
When an acquaintance told Mr. Swindells about the organization, he quickly decided its participation was crucial to the deal. ''Craig had the right model for a changing environment,'' Mr. Swindells says. ''The parks are in trouble because they have so many properties they can't afford to manage any more. But you can't just let people run around in parks wherever they want. There are liability issues. Land management issues. All that stuff, you have to do it with volunteers now. That's where everything's headed, and Craig had already been doing it for years.''
In the end, Mr. Swindells sold an even more restrictive conservation easement to Sonoma Land Trust for $1.45 million. Then, he donated 554 acres of Bohemia Ranch to LandPaths.
At the same time, he sold roughly 300 acres to a conservation-minded couple, Will and Julie Parish. LandPaths and the Parishes share trail access and will co-manage features of the land that affect both properties. While the Parishes' property is not an official part of the Bohemia Ecological Preserve, the Parishes also joined the Swindells family in establishing a fund that LandPaths will use to manage Bohemia Ecological Preserve. Together, they contributed a total of $100,000.
Fund-raising, Mr. Anderson acknowledges, will be a challenge. To ensure visitor safety near the waterfall (when it is actually running), the organization needs to build a small bridge and a set of steps; initial estimates suggest that alone will cost $220,000. But Mr. Anderson has faith in the way people respond when they realize that places like Bohemia cannot exist without their passionate engagement.
After he has led the hikers to a picnic table shaded by a large oak tree, after they have eaten sandwiches and salads provided by a local restaurant, the Spinster Sisters, Mr. Anderson rises from the table, walks toward a vantage point overlooking a ravine and starts to yodel.
In part, he does this to demonstrate the acoustic properties of the terrain; in part, to see if he can catch the attention of a trio of horses grazing on a distant hillside. But mostly, one suspects, he does this simply because he's spent all morning exploring land that he loves.

HEADLINE: Imaginary Prizes Take Aim at Real Problems

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
IMAGINE putting up a prize of $20 million to inspire others to solve a particular problem. What would your challenge be?
Some of the world's leading companies, including Google, Qualcomm and Nokia, have sponsored big-money contests challenging competitors around the world to design a host of wonders, including robots that can explore the moon, superefficient electric vehicles and more accurate methods for sequencing the human genome. The online movie streaming company Netflix awarded $1 million to a winning team of outsiders that helped it develop better ways to predict which films its customers would like.
Challenge prizes, usually focused on the cutting edge of science and technology, have a long history. We learned how to measure longitude at sea thanks to a prize established by the British Parliament in 1714. Our modern system of canning food can be traced to an 1800 Food Preservation Prize created by the French government trying to feed Napoleon's army. And Charles Lindbergh made his famous flight from New York to Paris in 1927 to claim a $25,000 reward. 
These prizes have become more common since 1995 thanks in large part to the X Prize Foundation, which encourages breakthroughs in five areas -- the life sciences, exploration, energy and the environment, education and global development -- where the ''commonly held belief'' is that ''a solution is not possible.'' The foundation offers four prizes, one worth $30 million, that are largely supported by individuals, corporations and other foundations.
Of course, not all experts have a sack of gold to solve pressing problems. But they can dream. In a series of interviews, winners of the annual John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellowships were asked to propose their own $20 million challenge prizes.
Carol Padden, 2010 Fellow
CHALLENGE Use crowdsourcing to help the hearing-impaired
The paradox of America's economy is that while it is hard for many people to find one paying job, almost everybody has several they do free. We are bank tellers when we use the A.T.M., airline employees when we check ourselves in for flights and cashiers when we scan our items at the supermarket.
And we work on the cutting edge of technology, helping Google and Apple refine their voice recognition software each time we ask our phones to name the capital of Burkina Faso (it's Ouagadougou) and follow up by asking, ''How the heck do you pronounce that?''
Carol Padden, who is deaf and teaches communication at the University of California, San Diego, said she wanted to enlist volunteers to crowdsource a labor-intensive service: captioning video for the deaf and hard of hearing. Her $20 million prize would reward the person or team who devised an effective method to tap the power of the Internet to caption videos. She said this could involve ''breaking down a video segment into very short one-minute clips which are sent out in the universe to be captioned by anyone. The short clips would be recombined to produce a captioned version of the original segment.''
Like many efforts initially aimed at helping those with disabilities, Ms. Padden noted that the project would almost certainly have broader benefits. Parents pushing strollers, she noted, are grateful for the curb cuts created for people in wheelchairs, just as patrons watching ''Monday Night Football'' in noisy bars count on closed captions to see what the announcers are saying.
Dr. Edith Widder, 2006
CHALLENGE Remove deadly sediments from waterways
The oceanographer Edith Widder has collected images of nature that look like crime scene photos: the once-sleek skin of bottlenose dolphins covered with lesions and growths, as bumpy and mottled as a boxer's cauliflower ear; a 34,000-acre wonderland of lush sea grass transformed into a desert landscape; beds of oysters stained corroded-penny green.
The culprit is easy to identify: toxic sediments in aquatic ecosystems that ''are destroying life across the country and around the world,'' said Dr. Widder, co-founder of the Ocean Research and Conservation Association in Fort Pierce, Fla.
Yet the blight is hard to arrest. Pollutants like the copper that imperiled the oysters -- used for controlling aquatic vegetation and fighting citrus canker in limes, oranges and grapefruits -- often originate miles away and are carried by runoff to waterways, where they settle into the muck.
Dr. Widder's $20 million prize would develop better methods for making this sediment safe. She said current practices focused on dredging, which can make local conditions worse by stirring up the pollutants. The toxic sludge is taken to dry land, where the runoff cycle can ferry it back to the waterway. ''Ideally,'' she said, ''we could develop efficient methods for detoxifying the muck on site, maybe through micro-organisms that would eat the poisons.''
Ted Zoli, 2009
CHALLENGE Build better bridges
If there were no car mechanics or tailors, every time your engine died or you tore your shirt you would have to replace it. That's a central but largely ignored problem faced by designers of long-span cable-supported bridges, according to Ted Zoli, a bridge engineer.
Long-span bridge design, he explained, emphasizes efficiency, using the least amount of material to do the job. As a result, long-span bridges are like a no-win game of pick-up-sticks: no single rod can be removed without everything's collapsing.
''If any component of the bridge were to suffer damage or failure, we can't just replace it,'' he said. ''Instead, we have to replace the entire structure.''
Mr. Zoli's prize would offer $20 million to ''spur the development of a long-span bridge form where every component is replaceable while still maintaining function.''
Rebecca Onie, 2009
CHALLENGE Design a true health care system
The United States does not have a health care system, according to Rebecca Onie, chief executive of the Boston-based group Health Leads. Instead, she said, it has a ''sick care system,'' which devotes almost all of its resources -- expenditures reached nearly $2.6 trillion a year in 2010 -- to treating patients after they become ill.
There are many health-related initiatives being introduced at the national and state levels, including money for preventive care and efforts to reduce obesity and smoking. ''But almost all of these efforts,'' Ms. Onie said, ''exist on the margins of a vast system that waits until people are sick.''
Ms. Onie's $20 million prize would challenge contestants ''to transform our current sick care system into a health care system,'' maximizing investments in prevention and keeping as many patients as possible out of hospitals by putting human and other resources to their best use.
As a complement to increasing the number of primary care physicians, she said, contestants might propose hiring physician assistants, social workers and community service workers who can help people stay healthy. Some of them, she said, might be assigned to waiting rooms, where millions spend hours waiting instead of learning how to avoid a trip to the doctor in the first place.
Kevin M. Guskiewicz, 2011
CHALLENGE Predict sports-related brain injuries
Numerous press accounts and the suicides of several former N.F.L. players have placed a sharp focus on sports-related brain injuries. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 60 percent increase over the previous decade -- to nearly 250,000 per year -- in such injuries among children and adolescents.
The problem, says Kevin M. Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is that all concussions are slightly different, meaning individuals must be examined on a case-by-case basis. To make diagnosis more efficient, his $20 million challenge would reward the creator of an algorithm to help predict the neuronal vulnerability of groups of people.
Some of the key pieces of information would include genetic testing that suggests susceptibility to brain disorders; new ways to track the number and force of impacts athletes receive during competition; the number and severity of concussions experienced; and ways to measure athletes's aggressiveness.
The algorithm, he said, would weigh the importance of such factors over a spectrum of athletes to determine the risk for each individual.
Dr. Sarah Otto, 2011
CHALLENGE Create memes to protect the environment
Dr. Sarah Otto, director of the Biodiversity Research Center at the University of British Columbia, noted that advertisers were skilled at creating memes -- ideas that spread from one person to another in a culture. Why, she asked, can't environmentists take more of a cue from them? ''They spread memes about what is hip that encourage people to consume products,'' she said -- from Coca-Cola (''It's the real thing), to McDonald's burgers (''I'm lovin' it'') to Toyota cars (''Oh, what a feeling''). Even the Occupy Wall Street movement created an effective meme in framing an economic conflict between the ''99 percent'' and the ''1 percent.''
Dr. Otto said the environmental movement had enjoyed success with memes like ''sustainability'' and ''reduce, reuse, recycle'' that encourage behavior change. Her $20 million prize would bring together experts from various fields, including advertisers and psychologists, and reward the team that best creates memes ''to alter our cultural practices and values in a way that preserves the biodiversity that is so rapidly disappearing from our planet.''
''We could reverse these trends,'' she added, ''if only we figured out how to encourage each other to invest as much in protecting the environment as we spend on such things as our daily cup of coffee.''
Timothy Barrett, 2009
CHALLENGE Invent e-readers as good as books
E-readers have enjoyed strong sales during the last few years, and millions of Americans now enjoy their poetry and potboilers on Kindles, iPads and other devices. But Timothy Barrett, director of the Center for the Book at the University of Iowa, said he believed the technology had a long way to go before it could match the advantages of books.
As a result, he would offer a prize to encourage the invention of ''the first e-reader that will really equal the traditional paper-based codex.''
He said he would challenge contestants to develop a device that would be:
Small and very portable, designed to fit in a pocket or purse.
Equipped for reading, voice, text or video communications.
Able to withstand all the abuse a book can, including a drop on a hard floor, temporary immersion in water and dry room-temperature storage for centuries or millenniums.
Fully functional at any time with only a pair of eyeglasses and no external power source.
Mr. Barrett added that the winning e-reader might turn out to resemble the book, a device that has proved a success for more than 15 centuries. ''Its two covers,'' he noted, ''protect the information accessed within, and also provide a degree of reading privacy when positioned to block access to prying eyes.''
Dr. Shwetak Patel, 2011
CHALLENGE Create a better X Prize
Efficiently folding microscopic protein molecules just the right way is even harder than it sounds. Biochemists were offered some fresh approaches recently when the problem was turned into an online game that people around the world were invited to play.
This paradoxical trick -- using competition to collaboratively solve knotty problems -- is the great untapped power of the Internet and social media, according to Shwetak Patel, who teaches computer science and engineering at the University of Washington.
''Instead of having small teams of experts look at problems from their own perspectives,'' he said, ''we can start bringing together people with different areas of expertise and disciplinary approaches to find surprising and elusive answers. I'm really intrigued by the possibility of involving people in these X Prize-type challenges who wouldn't participate because it's not directly in their field.''
Dr. Patel's $20 million prize would reward those who create better mechanisms for achieving this. ''For instance, we have made very slow progress in increasing battery life, in part because batteries involve broad areas of expertise, including chemistry, engineering, materials science and so forth,'' he said. ''If we could get lots of people to work on various aspects of the same problem at the same time, we might make real headway.''

HEADLINE: From Cookie Sales to Lessons in Leadership

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
WHO hasn't heard that girls can have whatever job they want -- entrepreneur, chief executive, president of the United States?
But girls themselves are often not so confident, according to a recent survey, which found that some 60 percent of teenage girls believe that women rarely can reach a company's top position and a similar percentage think that it is easier to be a follower than a leader.
Those are perceptions the Girl Scouts of the USA, which is celebrating its centennial this year, hope to change with a broad new initiative, ToGetHerThere. Aimed at girls up to age 17, it is intended to encourage more projects, programs and services to create conditions that help girls learn what leadership is.
''It's more than just blowing out the candle on our birthday cake,'' said Anna Maria Chávez, chief executive of the Girl Scouts, which has 2.2 million members. 
''This is a cause. We want to give girls what they need to become leaders. Right now, the country is wasting so much of the talent that it needs.''
The Girl Scouts intend to remake leadership prospects for girls within one generation, said Ms. Chavez, by enlisting companies, organizations and as many of its 59 million alumnae as possible.
The Girl Scouts are restyling themselves as the country's premier girl-service organization, as the group emerges from an effort to overhaul and rekindle its venerable brand, best known for selling cookies. It began the task by reorienting its annual cookie sales away from a retail exercise to a course in money management, planning and other skills that girls as young as Brownie scouts could learn from selling Thin Mints and other cookies.
The new leadership effort aims at girls at an early age -- girls can register at age 5 to begin as Daisy scouts -- because studies repeatedly show that once women are in the work force, in college or even in high school, it is less effective to teach leadership.
Most leadership development efforts are now directed at students of middle-school age and younger, because ''girls tend to conceptualize leadership differently. Most don't like the top-down model, but something that is collaborative,'' said Rachel Simmons, founder of the independent Girl Leadership Institute, which conducts camps and workshops for girls.
''Leadership doesn't magically appear on the first day on the job,'' she said.
Girl Scouts were among some 1,200 middle-school boys and girls in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and other Northeast states who participated in a spring 2011 study of gender and career choices. Girls from 10 to 15 years old said they perceived less support from their families to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math, collectively known as the STEM fields.
Only 11 percent thought their parents supported such a career choice, compared to 23 percent of boys the same age, said one of the authors, Mary Shapiro, a management professor at the Simmons College School of Management in Boston.
The preteen and early-teenage girls wanted to attend college and to support themselves, but according to the study, ''Girls were far more open than boys in considering lesser-status jobs, and saw themselves as having fewer career options than boys.''
The study found ''organizations can make a big difference in showing girls that barriers can be overcome,'' said Ms. Shapiro.
''They need to hear women role models talking about how their success was not 'luck,' but instead due to perseverance and hard, but doable work,'' said Ms. Shapiro. The study was paid for, in part, by the management school's Center for Gender in Organizations.
That is where the Girl Scouts steps in, said Ms. Chávez, noting that the study builds on findings of its own Girl Scout Research Institute. Those findings show that girls can be hesitant and uncertain about stepping forward and taking charge. The institute's research, which underpins the ToGetHerThere initiative, also shows that girls can be intimidated by a fear of public speaking or of incurring peer criticism by appearing overly confident.
One strategy pursued by the Girl Scouts is trying to lift females out of what some call the pink ghetto, referring to the middle-management or staff jobs inside companies, where women workers tend to be clustered. The term was adapted from pink collar, which has been used for decades in the United States to refer to jobs like nursing, teaching and waitressing, which often pay less but offer more flexibility for women with children.
Last spring, a report called ''Women Matter 2012,'' by McKinsey & Company, the global consulting firm, found that relatively few women were in jobs that typically were pathways to top leadership positions at 130 European companies, a condition that is mirrored in the United States.
Women need more exposure to science, technology, engineering and math through, for example, science and math camps or robot-making workshops, where girls can become acquainted with less familiar subjects, and learn teamwork and decision-making.
Jobs in STEM fields pay well and are more plentiful, but attract relatively few women. AT&T gave $1 million to the Girl Scouts as part of scouting's companion Campaign for Girls, to encourage interest in STEM careers among low-income high school girls.
The Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas, one of 112 scout councils across the country, is devoting its portion of the money to acquaint girls with aspects of STEM fields and to learn critical thinking, teamwork and responsibility, said Colleen Walker, the council's director.
Scouts are using the 86-year-old Whispering Cedars camp, on the outskirts of Dallas, ''as a living laboratory, with hands-on activities like testing water samples, learning about the chemistry of composting or exploring ways to increase crop yield or harvest wind energy,'' she said.
To foster confidence and leadership through sports, Nestlé USA has committed $560,000 to expand a nationwide program called GirlSports. Girls who participate in sports or are earning sports badges can connect with others by posting their stories on a Web microsite that can be reached through the main togetherthere.org site, said Doreen Ida, a Nestlé spokeswoman, who said the company wanted to support programs that encouraged health, wellness and nutrition among girls.
To finance leadership initiatives, Ms. Chávez, the Girl Scout chief, said that the organization was embarking on its first conventional fund-raising effort. That departs from the traditional model, where council activities were largely supported by the proceeds from cookie sales and the headquarters was financed by sales of merchandise like uniforms.
''We may be a little late to the table,'' said Ms. Chávez, acknowledging that economic times had squeezed philanthropic giving. But she said the Girl Scouts were hoping to raise awareness of girl leadership across the national landscape and enlist a broad range of companies and foundations, and especially individuals, who had previously given little funding to the Girl Scouts.
Some companies are signing up for the ToGetHerThere initiative, and others are supporting the Campaign for Girls, which aims to raise $1 billion by 2017 for leadership programs for girls in scouting.
''This is final piece of the puzzle,'' said Ms. Chávez, of the broad leadership initiative, which, she says, will help create the supportive environment that is important for girls to flourish.

HEADLINE: Yale's Provost, Noted Psychology Scholar, Is Named President of the University

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Yale University said Thursday that Peter Salovey, a celebrated scholar of psychology who has been its provost for the past four years, would be its new president.
The appointment came less than three months after Richard C. Levin announced that he would be stepping down as president at the end of this academic year, after 20 years in the job.
A search committee considered more than 150 candidates before selecting Dr. Salovey, 54. He will begin the job on June 30. 
''Peter brings a profound understanding of Yale and great ambitions for advancing the university in the years ahead,'' Edward P. Bass, senior fellow of the Yale Corporation, the university's board, said in a statement.
A member of the Yale community for three decades -- as a graduate student, a professor, a department head, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, dean of Yale College and lastly a senior member of the university's administration -- Dr. Salovey (pronounced SAH-lo-vay) was regarded as having the inside track for the top job.
In marked contrast to his somewhat reserved predecessor, he is a colorful character. He plays double bass in the Professors of Bluegrass, a band that includes both faculty colleagues and students.
''I have always tried to break down barriers between faculty, staff and students and to get us interacting more,'' he said in an interview on Thursday.
He received two of Yale's most prestigious teaching awards, and students have praised him as a gregarious, approachable classroom presence.
As a scholar, he helped develop the concept of emotional intelligence, which refers to how people understand their own emotions, and what they do with them.
The concept crossed over from academic circles, where Dr. Salovey's research is widely cited, into the popular arena, where it can be seen on the best-seller list and can be heard on daytime chat shows.
Dr. Salovey inherits an institution on much firmer footing than the one his predecessor took on. Dr. Levin increased the endowment significantly, raised its academic standing, improved its facilities and softened the tone of administrative interactions with students, faculty and the city of New Haven. Announcing his intended departure in August, he identified two issues that would loom large for his successor: online education and building projects that were delayed during the recession.
Dr. Salovey noted those challenges, but said that instead of declaring his administration's agenda, he preferred to ''reach out to our community to develop a shared vision of what our priorities should be.''
''I think it's really important to do that -- not to presume that I know what they should be,'' he continued.
But one theme he anticipates is accessibility.
''That means figuring out ways for deserving students to wind up on this campus,'' he said, ''but it also means a digital strategy that makes more of Yale's treasure -- whether it's scholarship or pedagogy or collections -- available online. Moving from a collection of opportunities to a deliberate strategy for giving the riches of Yale, the wealth of Yale, away.''
That includes online education, a field which many universities are now struggling to navigate.
''I think the excitement about MOOCs'' -- massive online open courses -- ''is fine,'' Dr. Salovey said, ''but it's really only one part of what online tools can provide, and it may in the end not be the most important part.''
A potentially larger question, he said, is how to adapt the old teaching model for students who have grown up online.
By way of experimentation, in the seminar he teaches this semester, called Great Big Ideas, students watch the course's lectures online, leaving classroom time entirely free for interactive discussion.
''I love that,'' he said. ''It's freedom -- freedom to interact with students in a different way.''
Frank C. Keil, a professor of psychology at Yale and a friend of Dr. Salovey's, said he was ''tremendously interpersonally warm and engaging''; he also described Dr. Salovey as ''very outgoing, very affable, but also extremely modest and self-effacing.''
He is always game, Dr. Keil said, for unscholarly fun, like appearing in a student Halloween video in the guise of a Mario Brother (he had a thick mustache at the time) or conducting the school's marching band at a football game. ''He also knows more people than anyone else I've ever known,'' Dr. Keil added. ''He's an astonishingly human guy. He knew more about my barber's life than I did.''
Dr. Salovey is married to Marta Moret, who is president of Urban Policy Strategies, a research and consulting group that specializes in public health, education and social services. They met during their graduate studies at Yale. They have no children and share their home with a dog, a Havanese named Portia.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.
Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provençal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help but be overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org.

&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- are familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets.

&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed.

&#x2605; 'Egon Schiele's Women' (through Dec. 28) New York's most thorough look at Egon Schiele since a 2005 exhibition at the Neue Galerie finds the artist working through a long and impressively varied list of female models, including his mother; a rebellious sister who sometimes posed nude for him; anonymous pregnant women in a maternity hospital; a pair of young prostitutes known as the ''black-haired girls''; his redheaded lover Wally Neuzil; and his strait-laced bourgeois wife, Edith. In an accompanying book, the gallery owner, Jane Kallir, argues persuasively that Schiele, in contrast to contemporaries like Gustav Klimt, ''did not judge his women; he merely observed.''

'We the People' (through Nov. 17) Timed to coincide with the final weeks of the presidential election, this enervating exhibition of works by 68 artists extols American democracy. It includes patriotic posters by Norman Rockwell and LeRoy Neiman, but the overall drift is, unsurprisingly, to the left. There are paintings by Alice Neel, Nicole Eisenman and, most prominently, a billboard-size portrait of Mitt Romney by Richard Phillips. Sculptors include Duane Hanson, creator of a startling super-realistic portrait of a scruffy youth titled ''High School Student.'' Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Project Space, 455 West 19th Street, (212) 228-5283, rauschenbergfoundation.org. (Johnson)

Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chloë Sevigny. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Ken Johnson)
Guillermo Kuitca: 'Diarios,' José Antonio Suárez Londoño: 'The Yearbooks,' and 'In Deed: Certificates of Authenticity in Art' (through Dec. 9) Closed for a year for an upgrade, this venerable SoHo institution now has three galleries under one roof and an inaugural show in each of them, including the first New York museum-style exhibition of the Argentine painter Guillermo Kuitca, a small survey of illustrational drawings by José Antonio Suárez Londoño of Colombia, and a smart and amusing selection of artist-made professional contracts.

&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was. Broadway 1602, 1181 Broadway, Third Floor, (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com. (Cotter)
Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outré realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; and the Tracey/Barry Gallery at Fales Library in Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 998-2596, nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales.

Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; National Museum of African Art: 'African Cosmos: Stellar Arts' (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It's also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Conceptual Abstraction' (closes on Saturday) Abstract painting is making one of its perennial New York comebacks, and this ambitious survey gives a good sense of where it's coming back from. The 20 artists in this show all helped shape abstraction's previous revival in the 1980s. They all participated in an important 1991 exhibition, ''Conceptual Abstraction,'' at Sidney Janis Gallery, documenting that florescence. And they all continue to produce characterful work, as attested by the inclusion of both vintage and recent paintings. Hunter College/Times Square Gallery, 450 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212) 772-4991, hunter.cuny.edu/art/galleries. (Cotter)
'Light and Landscape' (closes on Sunday) Temporary exhibitions at this bucolic art park have not been notably cutting edge, but this show of Postmodernist sculptures relating to light organized by the center's new associate curator, Nora Lawrence, may signal a promising change in the program. It includes indoor works by Roni Horn, Alyson Shotz and Diana Thater and elaborate outdoor constructions by Spencer Finch and William Lamson. Most surprising is Peter Coffin's ''Untitled (Sunshine),'' which consists of four loud speakers attached to a tall pole on a grassy hill broadcasting sunny keyboard melodies composed and performed by the jazz musician Bob James. Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormkingartcenter.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Helen Miranda Wilson: 'New Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Painted with loving care on small panels, Ms. Wilson's works display compositions made mainly of thin stripes in lush, saturated colors. In most there are hypnotic optical effects. Concentric circles pulse and spin. Horizontal bands dip and bulge. Lines defining shapes like bowling pins suggest spectral human figures with radiating auras. Here is proof that beauty is not just in the beholder's eye. Lori Bookstein, 138 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com. (Johnson)

The earliest works in this show, her first New York solo, are six short films from that year. They're student works, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts, titled ''An Exorcism.'' (''Something Borrowed, Something Blue,'' above, is a 1977 photo-collage on display.)
