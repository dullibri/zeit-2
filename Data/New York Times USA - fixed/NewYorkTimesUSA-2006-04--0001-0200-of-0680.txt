HEADLINE: Housing Bubble? What Housing Bubble? 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
Gary and Margaret Hwang Smith spend a lot of time musing about real estate. 
 It is not just that the couple, economics professors at Pomona College, have put so much of their money in the game, having bought a home in Claremont, a college town in Southern California, a real estate market that has been described as overpriced by most and a bubble by some.
Rather, they said, applying economic tools to buy a five-bedroom 1922 Craftsman home sharpened their thinking and guided two years of research into whether there is a bubble. They concluded that not only was the Los Angeles region not in a bubble, but many markets that others were calling overpriced, like Chicago or Boston, were probably underpriced. 
 Their findings are at odds with other surveys that use the relationship of home prices to income to determine whether home buyers are overreaching. Homes in Orange County, Calif., were fairly priced, the Smiths found. Some cities like Dallas, Indianapolis and Atlanta were screaming bargains. Homes they surveyed in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, were, however, overpriced by about 54 percent. 
 In a paper the two presented at the Brookings Institution this week, ''Bubble, Bubble, Where's the Housing Bubble?'' they said that even though prices had risen rapidly and some buyers unrealistically expected the trend to continue, ''the bubble is not, in fact, a bubble in most of these areas.'' 
 They argued that the value of a home is determined by the rent it could fetch. Calculate the future rents, subtract mortgage payments, taxes and other costs, factor in a good annual rate of return of 6 percent or more, and one should be looking at the proper price of a house or condo.
 Their bottom line was: ''Buying a house at current market prices still appears to be an attractive long-term investment.'' 
 Speculating about bubbles -- their cause, their longevity, and indeed, their very existence -- occurs whenever there is a rapid rise in asset prices. When dot-com stocks pushed the stock market to record highs in the late 1990's, many people tried to explain -- or justify -- the high prices of the stocks by talking about how the Internet was creating a new economy, one that worked by different rules or needed valuations that did not depend on earnings but on eyeballs viewing Web sites or the ''stickiness'' of those eyeballs. Those justifications were proved false by the technology meltdown. 
 With real estate, there have been fewer attempts to justify the high prices and more of an effort to understand why it is happening and whether there is an asset bubble. 
 Robert J. Shiller, the Yale University professor who warned of the stock market bubble, has few doubts that a real estate bubble exists in many American cities. He said he did not buy the Smiths' point that certain markets were not overpriced.
 The way the Pomona professors reached their conclusion, however, has generated a lot of interest among fellow economists. ''I think the paper is a sign of the times,'' Mr. Shiller said, because it emphasizes the link between home prices and rent as the proper way to understand the value of real estate. 
 Richard Peach, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York who studies home prices and their relation to income, echoed that view, saying, ''This is an important paper.'' 
 The value of the Smiths' research may be its practicality. It concentrates on the how, more than the why, in laying out a method to determine the underlying value of a home. They offer a way for real estate agents, financial planners and prospective homeowners to understand how much is too much to pay for a house.
 Karl E. Case, a Wellesley College economics professor who has been studying real estate prices for more than 25 years, calls the paper's method ''absolutely the correct way to think about it.''
 The Smiths say a prospective homeowner needs to ask, Should I buy or should I rent? That the value of a house is tied to the rent it can command is not a new idea. Other economists have advanced the idea and some have advanced the notion that a bubble can be measured with price-to-rent ratios that correspond to price-to-earnings ratios for stock. 
 But a price-to-rent ratio does not go far enough, according to the Smiths. Investors like Warren E. Buffett value a stock by looking at its intrinsic value -- that is, how much return one would get on the stock over time. For stocks, that is the cash the company generates and, in some cases, gives back to shareholders in the form of dividends.
 The intrinsic value of a house is the rent that it can generate. ''It's not that houses are like stock,'' Mr. Smith said, ''but if you think about them as you do stocks, you start thinking about it correctly.'' 
 The problem is that there has not been a good way to compare rents with homes. Indexes that try often end up comparing apartment rent with prices of a single-family home. A result, the Smiths said, is inflated price-to-rent ratios that are displayed as evidence of a bubble when one may not exist. 
 The Smiths solution was to look for ''matched pairs'' of similar houses, one rented, one owned, but both in the same neighborhood. They did this in 10 cities in which they could find enough real estate data and matched pairs. Once they had established what rent was for a certain house, they used software they created to compute the flow of rents over time, factoring in the outflow of mortgage payments, maintenance costs and taxes. Then they had to determine what those future payments would be worth today, which economists call the net present value. If the net present value is a positive number, the house is worth the price. If the result is a negative number, the buyer would be better off renting it. (For more, see Your Money, Page B4.)
 Of course, few people do that math when they buy a house. They look at what other houses in the neighborhood are selling for and base their bid on some expectation of what the house may be worth in the future. 
 Those expectations are far too optimistic, numerous studies have shown, most notably a 2003 study by Mr. Case and Mr. Shiller that found, for instance, that homeowners in San Francisco expected annual price increases of 15.7 percent. ''It's clear a lot of people are nuts,'' Mr. Case said. 
 The Smith formulas provide a way to determine if a buyer is overpaying. Making the calculations takes a fair amount of math skill, so Gary and Margaret Smith, who is also a certified financial planner, say they want to commercialize their program so that the average person can determine a house's value. She has helped several clients decide whether to buy or rent. ''We may have some intellectual property that is valuable,'' Mr. Smith said. 
 Indeed, the Smiths used an early version of the formula before they moved from a tract home in Claremont to a home closer to the college. The two met and married while teaching at Pomona, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. They have three children (a fourth is on the way), so they needed more room.
 They found a four-bedroom house a short walk from the college that also had a separate guest house they could use as an office. But the owner was selling it without an agent and did not have an idea of what to sell it for. ''He told us to figure out a price,'' Ms. Smith said. They determined what rents were for comparable homes and ran their cash-flow software to find a price. ''We knew where we could go up to,'' Ms. Smith said. Their first offer was rejected, but he eventually accepted $950,000. 
 That was about 30 percent more than the price ofthe house they had been living in, but the net present value calculation told them that they would be generating an 8 percent after-tax return. ''It seemed like a no-brainer,'' she said. 
 ''Then it occurred to me that it was an appropriate method for looking at the question of the bubble,'' she said. 
 The Smith analysis does not escape criticism. Several economists, like Mr. Case and Mr. Shiller, quibble about the assumptions the Smiths make in doing their calculations -- for example, homeowners spending only about 2 percent of the house price a year on maintenance or that everyone can obtain a mortgage interest deduction. One-third of taxpayers do not itemize their deductions and many more are getting hit with the alternative minimum tax that removes some of the advantages of home ownership, said Christopher Mayer, a professor of real estate at the Columbia Business School. Still, he agrees with the Smiths that there is not a housing bubble and he was impressed by the effort they made in finding matched pairs of houses.
 But he also said that they lacked an understanding of what drives the economies of cities. For instance, he says, Indianapolis looks undervalued because, unlike the Northeast and West Coast cities, land there is inexpensive. The supply side of the supply-demand relationship that determines prices seems to be overlooked. In some cities, zoning and other restrictions limit the building of homes. Elsewhere it is relatively easy to build houses when demand rises because most of the cost of a home is in construction. That is one reason there is a greater expectation of price appreciation in California than in a place like Indianapolis, he said.
 The questions many people want to know about housing prices are not answered by the Smith research: when will they fall and by how much? ''Some people think we are trying to predict prices and we are not,'' Mr. Smith said. ''That's a point a lot of people get hung up on.'' 
 Sure, he said, if prices drop you would have been better off if you had waited. ''But you can't time the market,'' he said. ''If you are a house flipper, we aren't talking to you.''

HEADLINE: China and U.S. Are World's Growth Engines and Its Market Laggards

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE stock market in the United States has performed very well since the fall of 2002, when the sell-off started by the bursting of the Internet bubble and accelerated by Sept. 11 and the 2001 recession finally came to an end. 
 Since then, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up nearly 60 percent, a strong gain that the Bush administration has pointed to as reflecting an economic recovery brought on by tax cuts.
But looked at internationally, the American bull market appears less impressive. Searching stock markets around the world, there appear to be only four that have performed worse -- when measured in dollars -- than the American market over that period. They are the markets in Botswana, Malaysia, Slovenia and China, with the latter being the only market to show a decline.
 At first glance, it seems odd that the two countries that have been the engines of global growth in the period, China and the United States, should be laggards. But there are explanations. The Chinese market has gained an unfortunate reputation for a lack of effective investor protection, and the best-quality companies in China are more likely to list their shares in Hong Kong, New York or London.
 As for the United States, much of its economic vigor has helped companies in other countries as the American trade deficit has soared. Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, argues that a repricing of American assets is needed to continue drawing in foreign capital. He notes that the difference between American interest rates and those in Europe and Asia has been growing for more than a year.
 If that continues, it will mean that American companies have to pay more for capital -- either equity or debt -- than overseas competitors. That will make it more difficult for them to compete. Mr. Prince argues the trend will continue until American growth slows enough -- or the dollar falls enough -- to begin to cut the trade deficit and thus reduce the American need for investment from overseas.
 The accompanying charts show the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for the United States -- an index similar to the S.& P. 500 -- against the M.S.C.I. index for the entire world outside the United States. The rest of the world has done better than the United States in 10 of the last 14 quarters. The measures use the most prominent national index for each country.
 Perhaps the most impressive fact is how widespread stock market profits have been throughout the world, despite all the talk of slow growth in Europe and Japan. 
 Stock markets in 24 of the 25 members of the European Union have outperformed the American market, with Slovenia, the only exception, almost matching the United States. And Britain, which has shown much stronger growth than most of Western Europe, ranks 23rd in the union, leading only Cyprus and Slovenia.
 Stock markets sometimes do a good job of forecasting economies. What the virtually worldwide strength of stocks may have been saying is that even lagging areas of the world are going to start growing. Some economists now say that later this year there will be good growth in Europe, Japan and the United States at the same time, the first time that has happened in many years.

HEADLINE: After Quick Start in January, Spending Cooled in February

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
After starting the year with some vigorous purchasing, American consumers took a breather in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
 Personal spending increased by 0.1 percent in February after showing markedly higher gains in the prior three months: 0.8 percent in January, 0.7 percent in December and 0.5 percent in November. Incomes rose 0.3 percent, after rising 0.7 percent in January.
The data, when combined with other reports released yesterday that showed low inflation, increasing manufacturing activity and rising consumer confidence, indicated that the economy was settling down after unseasonably warm weather in January revved up growth. 
 ''We have an economy that is strong, but we don't have an economy that is totally out of control,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group. Wall Street analysts had expected spending to be flat in February.
 Prices for consumer purchases excluding food and energy rose by 1.8 percent in the 12 months ended February, unchanged from the month before and slower than the 2 percent that Federal Reserve policy makers consider ideal. Including food and energy, prices rose 2.9 percent in the last 12 months, down from 3.1 percent in January.
 Many analysts expect economic growth to slow as the short-term interest rate increases by the Fed make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend money. Mortgage applications, for instance, have already fallen by about 16 percent in the last 12 months, and the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.32 percent, up from 5.93 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.
 Thomas M. Hoenig, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, echoed those sentiments in a speech yesterday and said the Fed was getting close to ending its nearly two-year campaign of raising its benchmark interest rate, which it increased to 4.75 percent on Tuesday. Most economists expect one more increase, to 5 percent in May, but there is less unanimity on whether the Fed will go further.
 Consumers, though they are gaining faith in the economy and their own job prospects, appear to have reservations. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index rose to 88.9 in March, up slightly from February but below the 91.2 reading in January.
 Increased hiring and rising wages in recent months are improving family finances and increasing confidence in the economy, analysts say, but as home sales slow and rising interest rates make home equity loans less enticing, that may change.
 ''The real question is at what point will the moderation in the housing market have an impact on the consumer,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. For now, ''households still feel as though their wealth is going up.''
 Some analysts say an early indication of slowing consumer spending is already evident.
 Spending on durable goods, which are big-ticket items like cars, appliances and furniture that are expected to last more than three years, fell 1.9 percent in February, a sign that consumers may be starting to cut back on discretionary purchases, according to Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm based in Princeton Junction, N.J.
 ''Whenever households experience financial stress, durable goods are usually the first to be sacrificed,'' Mr. Baumohl wrote in a research note to clients.
 But businesses appear to be more optimistic. A monthly index that measures the sentiments of purchasing managers in the Midwest jumped to a reading of 60.4 this month from 54.9 last month. A reading above 50 is considered positive.
 Another report yesterday from the Commerce Department showed that orders for manufactured goods rose 0.2 percent in February after falling by 3.9 percent in January. The gain, however, was smaller than the 1.3 percent gain Wall Street economists had expected.

HEADLINE: Shares End a Positive First Quarter With a Modest Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks ended a solid first quarter with a modest decline yesterday, despite lower oil prices and a round of temperate economic data that mitigated concerns about inflation and higher interest rates. 
 The major indexes finished mixed for the week, but were higher for the month and the quarter.
The market opened higher on a Commerce Department report that growth in personal spending and income tapered substantially last month, with a small rise in factory orders also signaling a slowing economy and helping to soothe worries that greater demand would drive up prices. 
 But stocks tailed off shortly after midday as Wall Street continued to assess the Federal Reserve's opinion of the economy. The last two months of data, including an upward revision to fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, have shown that inflation measures have been mostly in line with or above targets, said Ed Keon, Prudential Equity's chief investment strategist.
 ''I think inflationary pressures are growing a little bit,'' Mr. Keon said. ''In the long run, the Fed will be able to deal with those pressures. We may see a little longer period of uncertainty as we deal with that.''
 Crude oil futures pulled back as investors took profits after several days of sharp gains on concerns about political instability overseas. A barrel of light crude oil fell 52 cents, to settle at $66.63, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 41.38 points, or 0.37 percent, to 11,109.32. The Dow lost 170 points this week.
 Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,294.83; the Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.03 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,339.79, after reaching a five-year high the day before.
 Bonds were basically flat after two days of declines, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at 4.85 percent, down from 4.86 percent late Thursday, and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, up 2/32, at 97 9/32. 
 The dollar was lower against other major currencies, and gold prices declined.
 Last month's personal spending growth slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.8 percent in January, but topped economists' forecast for no change, as monthly income grew at a rate of 0.3 percent from a prior level of 0.7 percent and missed estimates of 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
 The department also said factory orders rose 0.2 percent in February after a 3.9 percent decline in January. Economists, however, expected a 1.3 percent increase; the slower growth in orders may have also eased inflation fears.
 Investors weighed upbeat consumer data against the drop in spending after the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index for March rose 2.2 points, to 88.9, topping predictions of an 86.9 reading.
 Despite sharp losses this week, the major indexes ended with modest gains for the month of March, giving them their best first-quarter performances in several years. For the week, the Dow lost 1.51 percent and the S.&P. 500 dropped 0.62 percent, while the Nasdaq rose 1.17 percent.
 But in March, the Dow rose 1.05 percent, the S.&P. 500 added 1.11 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.56 percent. For the quarter, the Dow gained 3.66 percent, the S.&P. 500 rose 3.73 percent and the Nasdaq was 6.1 percent higher.
 Although investors showed a mild response to yesterday's numbers, next week's data on vehicle sales and employment should give the market reason to move in some direction, said Rick Pendergraft, an equity trader at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
 Still, he said, ''I wouldn't be surprised if we meander until the jobs number'' for March, which is to be released next Friday.
 Delphi said it would ask a bankruptcy judge to void its union contracts, sending jitters through the auto industry about the prospect of a strike at the parts maker. A walkout would be devastating for Delphi's former parent, General Motors, which relies heavily on Delphi parts. G.M. nonetheless rose 21 cents, to $21.27.
 The mortgage lender Freddie Mac said its 2005 results were strong and that it expected to file its annual report in late May. The firm is recovering from an accounting scandal in 2003, when it revealed about $5 billion in underreported earnings. Freddie Mac lost $1.45, to $61.
 The toy maker Mattel said a federal judge dismissed a patent lawsuit filed by LeapFrog Enterprises over the company's Fisher-Price PowerTouch toy. Mattel added 23 cents, to $18.13, and LeapFrog fell 14 cents, to $10.62.

Price Set on New Google Shares
By Reuters

 Google said yesterday that the price of its public offering of 5.3 million shares was set at $389.75 each, to raise about $2.07 billion.
 Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., said it would sell as many as 5.3 million shares to offset the impact of its inclusion in the widely held Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The sale represents about 2.7 percent of Google's float, the number of shares that are available for public trade. 
 Goldman Sachs is the sole underwriter of the offering, and shares will be offered primarily to index funds whose portfolios are primarily based on stocks included in the S.& P. index, Google said in a filing Wednesday with securities regulators. Google, which has expanded into Web-based services like e-mail, blogging and chat, said it would use the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes.

HEADLINE: Calculating What to Pay for a Home 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
How do you know what to pay for a house?
 You look at the ''comps,'' of course. A real estate agent will tell you what comparable houses in the neighborhood sold for. Web sites like Zillow.com or HomeValues.com value homes the same way.
Is that not a little like thinking Yahoo stock is a bargain at $32 a share because Google is selling at $390 a share? With stocks, you would want to know how the price relates to the company's future earnings. Gary and Margaret Hwang Smith, Pomona College economics professors, argue that with housing you similarly want to know how the price relates to the future stream of rent from a home, whether you intend to rent or not. 
 It is not an unheard notion among investment professionals. Redbrick Partners, an investment fund that buys and rents single-family homes, evaluates a property's cash flow, as well as the economic prospects of the neighborhood and larger region, before buying it. ''Just because you pay 5 percent less than somebody else doesn't mean it is a good price,'' said Thomas Skinner, a managing partner.
 You will need some math skills and some software or a financial calculator to do this. The Smiths said they might offer a program on their Web site, www.smithfinancialplace.com, to automate the process, but until then, you'll have to read the formulas in their new research paper found there and work out the numbers using a spreadsheet. 
 To see how this would be useful to a buyer, take a look at a house on Silver Cloud Drive in Diamond Bar, Calif. It is an 1,812-square-foot four-bedroom two-bath split-level ranch built in 1964.
 It sold last July for $560,000. First, you need to know how much the house could rent for. As it happens, just across the street is a nearly identical house that was renting at the that time for $2,295 a month. 
 Determining how much rent a house can fetch may turn out to be one of the more difficult tasks in this entire process, especially if you live in a single-family home in a neighborhood where few homes are rented. If you own a condominium or an apartment, it's easy because there are always comparable units renting. 
 Now you need to calculate the annual cash inflow, that is, the rent, and subtract it from the outflow, things like mortgage payments, taxes and maintenance. You'll have to make some assumptions of how much any of those factors will change over time. The cash flow may be negative in the first few years of ownership, but as rents increase and the mortgage payments don't, the returns flip positive. 
 Plug these numbers into a spreadsheet set up to calculate net present value -- what the future payments are worth right now. You can find advice at http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/assistance/HP052091991033.aspx. In our example provided by the Smiths, assuming (economists love to assume) the buyer makes a 20 percent down payment, secures a 30-year fixed mortgage at 5.7 percent, and spends about 2 percent of the price of the house each year on maintenance as rents rise 3 percent a year, you discover that with a 6 percent after-tax annual rate of return, the house price would be $696,000. That's about 24 percent more than the actual selling price and 18 percent above Zillow's estimate of $588,502. 
 The calculation doesn't mean that as a seller you'd necessarily get that much. Supply and demand -- and the Greater Fool Theory -- will still determine the price. It means as a buyer you could go that high and still be happy with the decision in years to come.
 Given the price it did sell for, for someone in a 28 percent federal income tax bracket, the long-run after-tax annual rate of return will be 7.4 percent. (Use an internal rate of return, or I.R.R., function in a spreadsheet.) Given that a 30-year bond was yielding about 4.83 last week and some banks will give you 4.5 percent interest, 7.4 percent isn't a bad return.
 What if the price drops? That's the risk in owning over renting. Certainly, if you had waited you would pay less and probably get an even better return. But that's the reason you analyze the fundamentals. If you computed a healthy return and are holding it for the long term, you minimize the danger of losing your investment. 
 At the risk of sounding like a real estate agent, Mr. Smith said there are two risks to consider when buying a house. One is that you buy and the price goes down. The other is that you don't buy and the price goes up. ''The second is more scary,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Music Industry's Sales Post Their Sixth Year of Decline 

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

 BODY:
Global sales of music CD's and DVD's dipped for the sixth consecutive year last year and surging digital music sales failed to offset the decline, an industry trade group said yesterday. 
 Global music sales, including ''physical'' and digital formats, fell to about $21 billion in wholesale revenue, a decline of 3 percent. Measured in units, CD's fell 3.4 percent and music DVD's were flat, according to an annual report released by the trade group, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
Sales of digital music, included in the annual report for the first time, are rising sharply but did not compensate for the decline of CD's, which have been the industry mainstay for two decades. The number of single songs downloaded online or to mobile phones rose more than 190 percent, to 470 million units, the report said. Revenue from digital sales nearly tripled, to $1.1 billion from $400 million. 
 In a break from past practice, the organization based its report on wholesale figures instead of retail. A spokesman said the organization made the switch because of the difficulty of accounting for retail discounts and other variables. But on a retail basis, it said the industry generated about $33 billion in sales last year, a decline of 2.4 percent.
 John Kennedy, the federation's chief executive, said the worldwide music market ''is fast becoming a mixed economy'' as fans purchase music from an array of outlets. Mr. Kennedy said that in Japan, digital sales already made up for the loss of physical sales and ''other markets should go this way.'' 
 In the United States, overall shipments of music products, including CD's and digital albums and singles combined, fell 3.9 percent last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, which also released its annual report yesterday. It said wholesale revenue was about $7 billion, but did not give a comparable figure for the previous year. 
 Sales of CD's and DVD's combined generated about $6.4 billion, a decline of 9 percent, the report said.
 The association did not release wholesale figures for digital sales, but said they were growing rapidly. According to the data, retail sales from various digital sources, including mobile phone ring tones and sales of songs sold online, rose to almost $1.1 billion, or about 8.8 percent of the industry's total retail sales. The overall retail sales were essentially flat, at $12.27 billion.
 The association's chairman and chief executive, Mitch Bainwol, said that illegal file-sharing on many popular online networks had been ''held in check'' amid an industrywide crackdown on piracy. But he said different forms of piracy, including the distribution of music through internal networks on college campuses, remained ''major factors'' in the industry's declining sales.

HEADLINE: Some Chartists Connect Dots And See a Bear 

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
ECONOMICS is called the dismal science, but you would be forgiven for thinking that adherents of technical stock market analysis are even less fun to be around. As investors celebrate five-year highs in major indexes, some chartists are forecasting a sharp, imminent reversal.
 Ralph Acampora, a prominent analyst with four decades on Wall Street, attracted attention late in March when he reiterated his prediction of a decline of as much as 20 percent in stocks this year. 
He is not alone. Some technicians -- analysts who study chart patterns rather than economic and corporate information -- are just as bearish, if not more so.
 Peter Kendall, co-editor of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, predicts a return to the lows of 2002 and 2003, which would mean declines greater than 40 percent for major indexes. ''The Dow may make a new high within the next couple of weeks, but after that, or in lieu of it, the stock markets in the U.S. and around the world will resume the downhill trip,'' he said.
 Louise Yamada, another well-regarded technician and head of Louise Yamada Technical Research Advisors, is more optimistic-- about certain market segments. ''What's happening here is the market is giving a lot of mixed signals,'' she said. ''Clearly there are areas that are doing well and going up.''
 These include small and medium-size companies and sectors like transportation, metals and energy. She encourages investors to stick with these winners until they break below significant recent lows.
 Ms. Yamada is less sanguine about the broad market. Still, she said that ''there's nothing I'm looking at that's saying we're about to have a 20 percent decline.'' She added, ''We could have a sharp retreat, but I don't have any indication of it at the moment.''
 Other analysts are bullish without Ms. Yamada's qualifications and caveats. In fact, The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter that tracks other investment letters, has detected a pronounced brightening in the mood of many other technicians.
 Mark Hulbert, who writes a column for Sunday Business and is the editor of the newsletter, has found a sudden and substantial increase in the recommended exposure to stocks among short-term market timers, most of them technical analysts.
 That may not be a good omen for stocks, however, and it may even foretell a decline. Mr. Hulbert cautioned that the increase in bullishness may itself be a technical indicator signaling a decline.
 ''Basically when you get excessive bullishness, it's bearish, and vice versa,'' he said. ''My read of it is there's modestly too much bullishness right now, although it does change from day to day.'' Why do the timers have such an uncanny knack for incorrect timing? Because when analysts or investors tell you what they think will happen, they are telling you what they have already done with their money. Once so many have sold so much, the market heads higher because their selling has depressed prices and there are few others left who are inclined to sell. The same happens in reverse at tops.
 WHETHER bulls or bears, technicians make up a shrinking minority on Wall Street, where big investment houses have been reducing or eliminating their technical research for years. If mainstream investment firms see little need for technical analysts, why should you?
 For one thing, they provide a reality check to the conventional thinking of fundamental analysts, who view the same economic reports and earnings statements and tend to draw similar conclusions. Those conclusions are often wrong because of the well-known tendency of stock market movements to precede the economic developments that conventional wisdom holds to be their causes. Buying and selling based on economic and corporate data alone can leave investors positioned the wrong way and perplexed by the market.
 Technical analysis can serve as an early warning system by focusing on what the market is saying without trying to explain why it is saying it. And technicians contend that some measures of momentum and sentiment can anticipate market changes.
 Mr. Hulbert's survey of short-term timers' opinions is one such measure. Mr. Kendall said the dearth of technical analysts at conventional investment firms was another.
 ''People should pay attention to technical analysts because the discipline has fallen from favor,'' he said. ''Technical analysis is popular in bear markets when the financial crowd loses its heart for buy-and-hold and gets keen on picking peaks and valleys. Now that the Wall Street firms have swept out the technicians, it's time for a reversal to sweep them back in.''

HEADLINE: A Team's Troubles Shock Few At Duke

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN and JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., March 31 

 BODY:
It was supposed to be Duke's year. The men's lacrosse team lost to Johns Hopkins by a goal in the national championship game last year. The Blue Devils returned most of their starters, including every member of their high-scoring attack unit. Mike Pressler, the coach for the past 15 seasons, was also back. Duke was a preseason favorite to win the national title.
 Instead, the Blue Devils' season has been suspended indefinitely after a black woman from a nearby college who was hired by team members to dance at an off-campus party on March 13 said she was derided with racial epithets and sexually assaulted by three white players. Team members have admitted to underage drinking at the party and to hiring the dancers, but they denied the woman's allegations of sexual assault.
The police collected DNA samples from 46 of the team's 47 members; no charges have been filed. Tests on the DNA samples are expected to be completed early next week. 
 It is not clear what happened in the house on North Buchanan Boulevard on the first night of spring break, and the police are continuing their investigation. But students, professors and members of the Duke community said they were not surprised to hear that trouble had found the lacrosse team, a clubby, hard-partying outfit with roots in the elite prep schools of the Northeast.
 Their defenders said that because of their backgrounds and high profile on campus, lacrosse players at Duke were targets, and are now being made to answer for a host of complex social issues that have little to do with the team.
 But others say lacrosse players have operated with a sense of entitlement that stood out at the $43,000-a-year university, and surely brought the trouble on themselves.
 ''A lot of people are saying, 'That's awful, but not a complete shock,' '' said Mike Van Pelt, the sports editor of The Chronicle, Duke's student newspaper. ''They go out a lot, drink a lot. Rowdy party behavior is not uncharacteristic.''
 Since the incident in the early hours of March 14, some of that rowdy behavior has come to light. The News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C., citing documents from Durham County Court records, reported this week that 15 of the lacrosse team's 47 members had been cited in the past for misdemeanors like underage drinking and open-container violations.
 No one disputes that underage drinking took place at the players' party, or that exotic dancers were hired to perform, conduct the team captains apologized for on a Duke sports Web site.
 But at Shooters Saloon, a bar where young women dance in a cage above the dance floor, Kenny Morrison, a junior from Kentucky, said the lacrosse players were being treated unfairly.
 ''The media has been used as a weapon against these guys,'' said Morrison, who said he was friends with several of the team members. ''I understand it because there are so many dynamics involved, like race, sex, affluence and athletics. It's like every problem we've ever had is put on top of those guys.''
 At Duke, a university in the South with many students from the North, lacrosse is as much a social pursuit as an athletic one. Though basketball is the most popular sport, students tailgate at lacrosse matches and players are generally recognized on campus, Van Pelt said, and even revered for their athleticism.
 Peter H. Wood, a history professor who played lacrosse at Harvard and was captain of the team at Oxford, said that lacrosse players on campus stood out for their aggression, which he said was in some ways endemic to the game they played. Lacrosse was invented by Native Americans, who called it the little brother of war and played it violently, town against town, with hundreds on the field at a time. It was popularized in 20th century in the prep schools of the Northeast.
 ''The football players here are often rural white boys with baseball caps or hard-working black students who are proud to be at Duke,'' Wood said.
 ''Basketball players are held at a higher level and are more tightly controlled. Too often, there seems to be a surliness about some lacrosse players' individual demeanor. They seem hostile, and there is this group mentality.''
 The team members and Pressler, the coach, have not spoken publicly about the incident or anything that has happened since. 
 Fraternities once attracted many lacrosse players at Duke, and they connected through their sport and their similar socio-economic backgrounds. In recent years, though, the team has banded together outside the fraternity system. Students at Duke are required to live on campus for their first three years; only seniors may live off campus. Several students said that the house where the party was held had served as a de facto fraternity house for the team.
 The players are also regulars at Charlie's Pub & Grille, a sports bar near campus, where patrons seemed sympathetic to the players and expressed dismay with how they had been portrayed in the news media.
 ''It's like they've already been convicted,'' said Matt Myers, a contractor. ''If they're guilty, full extent of the law. But if they're not, don't ruin their lives.''
 Last Saturday, as protests were being held around campus, including a candlelight vigil at the captains' house, Jill Hopman said she saw about 20 team members at Charlie's. Hopman, who graduated from Duke last year and is a law student at the University of North Carolina, said the players were drinking and breaking into chants of ''Duke lacrosse.'' She said she was nauseated by the display and wrote an opinion piece for The Chronicle.
 ''It was just sitting there knowing that a candlelight vigil was held at their house, while they are slamming down the shots on the bar,'' Hopman said Friday.
 ''I don't know if they are guilty or not. I'm all for due process. But I love Duke, and they were under a microscope and were representing us. Forget all the issues about race and affluence and our relationship with the town. The one thing we all have in common is Duke.''
 Employees at Charlie's would not comment on whether the players were at the bar last Saturday.
 Wood, who teaches Native American history, said that over the years he had taught many lacrosse players who were interested in learning about the culture behind their sport. He said that in his experience, the players had become haughtier in recent years, though he could not say why. He said it frustrated him because he remained passionate about the sport.
 ''It's gotten noticeably worse in the last four or five years,'' he said of the players' attitudes. ''They've gotten more aggressive.''
 Wood said the athletic department was partly to blame. Two years ago, before the Blue Devils were to play the perennial power Virginia, several players told him that they were going to miss a Friday morning class. They had played poorly the game before, and Pressler had scheduled an extra practice. 
 Wood said he told the players that he could not excuse their absence and contacted the athletic department to object. Still, they skipped the class.
 ''To me, that is beyond the pale,'' said Wood, who has taught at Duke for more than 30 years. ''You don't do that at Duke.''

HEADLINE: CAR PARTS MAKER MOVES TO BREAK ITS UNION DEALS 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Flint, Mich., for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 31 

 BODY:
Delphi, the nation's biggest auto parts maker, on Friday asked a federal judge for permission to throw out some of its labor agreements, a move that could cost 20,000 union workers their jobs and leave thousands of others with less than half their current wages. 
 Delphi, which is operating in bankruptcy, wants the judge's permission to impose sharply lower wages and benefits on six unions, setting up a confrontation that its largest union, the United Automobile Workers, said could lead to a lengthy strike.
A strike could also cripple General Motors, which spun off Delphi in 1999 and remains its biggest customer. And any harm to G.M. could eviscerate the U.A.W.'s own influence as one of the nation's most socially progressive and powerful unions, while accelerating the slide of the American auto industry.
 Delphi said it would close or sell all but 8 of its 29 plants in the United States and cut 28,500 positions around the world. Beyond the 20,000 of its 33,100 hourly jobs in the United States that Delphi plans to cut, another 8,500 salaried jobs worldwide are to be eliminated. 
 ''I took this job thinking this was my future,'' said Tracey Huffman, 37, staring blankly down at a table at Jamins, a pool hall next to the U.A.W. Local 651 hall on the east side of Flint, Mich. ''Now I don't know. It's like starting all over again.''
 Ms. Huffman, who is scheduled to be laid off temporarily at the end of April, now fears that her layoff could become permanent. Any decision by the judge, however, is expected to be weeks or even months away.
 The confrontation promises to become even more fierce in coming months, as G.M. tries to extricate itself from its worst financial crisis in over a decade, and the U.A.W. fights Delphi over the deep wage cuts that it wants to impose.
 All sides could be losers. A strike by the U.A.W. could send G.M. into bankruptcy alongside its former parts unit, a fate that would be an even bigger debacle for the union and the industry than Delphi's bankruptcy has proved to be. 
 And unless a judge rejects Delphi's effort to abrogate its contract, the U.A.W. faces the prospect that it can no longer give its workers the security it has fought for years to provide, leaving the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, distressed.
 Already, some workers at the Delphi East plant in Flint left their plant in tears Friday, after learning that it was among 21 that would close. In 1998, a seven-week strike at that plant and another in Flint, nearly crippled G.M.
 ''I have to put my faith in the union,'' said Judy Steyer, 36, who dabbed her eyes as she walked on her lunch break. 
 Wearing a black sweatshirt embroidered with the U.A.W. crest, Mrs. Steyer continued: ''I've been through one strike. It was tough then, and it'll be tough if we go on strike now.''
 David L. Gregory, professor of labor law at St. John's University in New York, said, ''This is really for all practical purposes a frontal challenge to the reason for existence of the U.A.W.'' 
 The tangle comes as the American industry already faces stiff competition from Asian and European companies, which have wrested market share in automobiles and auto parts from their American rivals.
 G.M., which lost $10.8 billion last year, is struggling to reverse a slide that has deepened under its chief executive, Rick Wagoner, while Delphi is one of half a dozen major American parts suppliers that have been forced to seek Chapter 11 protection.
 G.M. has already stepped up several times to help Delphi, most recently last week, when it agreed to pay for bailouts covering 13,000 Delphi workers, in addition to 113,000 of its own, and to take 5,000 Delphi workers back to G.M. On Friday, Delphi said it hoped that many of the workers who will lose their jobs will have a ''soft landing'' because of the G.M. program.
 This is going on, Professor Gregory said, while companies like Toyota, which is expected to earn $16 billion for the year ended Friday, are prospering and even building plants across the Midwest and South that are employing tens of thousands of Americans.
 ''The 20th century was the century of General Motors and America,'' Professor Gregory said. ''The 21st century is going to be the century of Toyota and Asia.''
 While similar actions have occurred in the steel and airline industries, Delphi's move was the first time that a major player in the automobile industry had sought to void its labor contracts, setting the stage for a precedent-setting court ruling later this year.
 Delphi plans to eliminate 21 factories in Michigan, New Jersey, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and elsewhere.
 ''Emergence from the Chapter 11 process in the U.S. requires that we make difficult, yet necessary, decisions,'' Delphi's chief executive, Robert S. Miller, said in a statement Friday. ''These actions will result in a stronger company with future global growth opportunities.''
 Once Delphi is finished with its restructuring, it will have a much more streamlined product line than the current wide array of components -- from air-conditioning systems to steering gear to cruise controls -- that it inherited from G.M. 
 Under Delphi's contract, which is essentially the same as the one covering workers at G.M., members of the U.A.W. are paid nearly $28 an hour in wages. Their total compensation, including pensions, health care and other benefits, is an average $78.63 an hour, Delphi said in court documents, a figure it said was three and a half times that at competing parts suppliers.
 That number, however, struck analysts and union officials as too high; they generally estimate total costs to be about $67.
 In its court filing, Delphi said it wanted to impose its last offer, which it made a week ago. That was for a $5-an-hour wage cut this year, to $22, followed by another cut next year to $16.50 an hour. To ease the pain, workers would be given $50,000 each, presumably provided by G.M.
 If workers do not accept that deal -- or if G.M. does not come up with the money -- Delphi said it would impose a unilateral cut in wages to $12.50 an hour. 
 Though less than half what they make now, that is still more than Delphi's original offer to the U.A.W., made shortly after its bankruptcy filing, for wages as low as $9.50, a proposal that ignited outrage among union members.
 The U.A.W. earlier this week rejected essentially the same proposal Delphi now wants a judge to approve, saying its members would surely vote it down. If those terms are imposed on the union, ''it appears that it will be impossible to avoid a long strike,'' U.A.W. officials said.
 Robert Betts, president of U.A.W. Local 2151 in Coopersville, Mich., home to one of the plants that Delphi intends to close, said the issue went beyond the parts maker.
 ''This is turning from a restructuring of a business into a basic struggle for workers' rights,'' he said. ''Essentially what they want you to be is a very poorly paid indentured servant.'' 
 He added: ''If we accept too low of a wage, it will affect workers everywhere.''
 Knowing the ramifications, bankruptcy court judges encourage labor unions and companies to reach agreements, rather than have lower rates imposed upon them. A hearing in the Delphi case is set for May 9, and the situation may not be resolved for weeks after that, allowing plenty of time to reach a deal -- if the parties talk.
 A number of unions in the airline industry have reached agreements with bankrupt companies in the last few years.
 The U.A.W., however, has never been in this position with such a large company. And labor experts said it would be politically impossible for Mr. Gettelfinger to agree to all of Delphi's demands, because that would set a precedent for even more critical talks next year with G.M. and Ford.
 Delphi has been included in the union's practice of ''pattern bargaining,'' which essentially calls for the same terms at each company. Cuts granted at Delphi would open the door for the automakers to demand lower wages and benefits as well.
 Although it has agreed to some modifications, particularly changes in health care coverage negotiated at G.M. and Ford last year, the U.A.W. has not granted pay cuts at a major auto company since it agreed to concessions with Chrysler in 1979 as part of its bid for a Congressional bailout. Those cuts were later restored.
 Given that a strike is its only -- and most lethal -- weapon, Mr. Gettelfinger has to appear as if he is ready to wield it, experts said. 
 ''There's always a lot of posturing,'' Ms. Steyer, the Flint auto worker, said. ''It's like two big dogs. You growl, and I'll growl back.''
 But people in the union and in the auto industry who are acquainted with his thinking said Mr. Gettelfinger was loath to call a broad strike at Delphi, knowing it could lead to a bankruptcy at G.M. and an even bigger morass for the union. 
 That would not prevent him from strategic strikes, at a plant or two, if he felt it was necessary to send a message to Delphi, these people said.
 Mr. Gettelfinger's reluctance to inflame the situation is a reason the U.A.W. has not conducted strike votes at any local unions, a formality that occurs before any walkout. 
 Quentin Garland, a 32-year veteran at the Flint plant who assembles cruise control mechanisms, said he understood the union's quandary. ''A strike at this point doesn't help anyone,'' Mr. Garland, 51, said. 
 But Sue Gosner, 50, said she did not plan to wait around to see if that happened. She recently reached the 30-year mark that will allow her to retire with a $35,000 check from G.M. 
 ''It's just been such an emotional roller coaster for so long now,'' Ms. Gosner said. ''People just go in there and do the best they can do. That's all we can do.''

HEADLINE: Top General in Iraq Aims to Shoot Less, Rebuild More

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: CAMP RIPPER, Iraq, March 30 

 BODY:
Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, who took command of American ground forces in January, tells his troops that the only way they will defeat the insurgency is to do less shooting and more rebuilding.
 It's a tough sell at this desert base in Anbar Province, where marines recently spent an hour explaining to him that insurgent attacks and intimidation have brought reconstruction work in their area almost to a standstill. A few days earlier, a suicide car bombing just outside their front gate killed two Iraqi policemen, they told him.
''If you're saying you've got to get an area secure before you do any reconstruction, you'll never get any reconstruction done,'' General Chiarelli finally told the half-dozen officers around a conference table at the regiment's command post.
 General Chiarelli is trying to carry out a far-reaching philosophical shift in military strategy in Iraq that seeks to reduce the use of force by Americans and finish long-planned reconstruction projects. 
 Though still in its early stages, the effort shows signs of taking hold in some parts of the country and even in Baghdad, where American troops are noticeably less visible. But in the most violent areas, including Anbar, he is finding that shifting to the new strategy will take time, if it can be done at all.
 Still, the approach has been endorsed by the Bush administration in several recent strategy documents. General Chiarelli himself was selected to take over as ground commander last year largely because, after commanding the 1st Cavalry Division in Iraq during 2004 and 2005, he became a champion of the notion that American tactics often alienated Iraqis and strengthened support for the insurgency.
 ''Every time we shoot at an Iraqi in this culture -- a culture of revenge, a culture of honor -- we stand the chance of taking someone who is sitting on the fence'' and pushing him toward ''the terrorists and foreign fighters,'' he said. 
 General Chiarelli is urging commanders to put local people to work and to revive services in towns that still have no local government, three years after the American invasion.
 He has ordered American troops to leave checkpoints and patrols as much as possible to Iraqi soldiers and their American advisers. At a daily staff briefing, he also tracks the ''escalation of force,'' the number of times each day that American soldiers fire their weapons. 
 Though the rules governing when troops may use force have not changed, he says units are being urged to make greater use of flares and other nonviolent methods of avoiding Iraqi casualties.
 The number of shootings by Americans has fallen 20 percent since January, he says. In addition, large combat operations involving mostly American troops are likely to be rare in the future, unless security disintegrates, American commanders say. 
 The aim is to take some of the ardor out of the insurgency by pushing American forces into a supporting role. General Chiarelli (pronounced ka-RELL-ee) said he had learned that he could kill or arrest thousands of insurgents -- and spawn more enemies in the process.
 Some troops on their second tours in Iraq applaud the shift.
 In a Marine unit south of Baghdad last year, Lt. Col. Jeff Kenney said, ''we did direct-action hits and big sweeps. Instead of kicking in doors, what we should have done was put in a water purification system on the Tigris River.''
 Previous American commanders have stressed the need to get reconstruction projects finished, but none has been as public as General Chiarelli in questioning the emphasis over the last three years on killing and capturing suspected insurgents. 
 ''We have picked so many folks who plant I.E.D.'s,'' he said, referring to improvised explosive devices. ''But for all practical purposes we're getting the same number of I.E.D.'s as we had before, in some instances even more. So you've got to ask yourself: 'How is that happening? How do you break that cycle?' ''
 General Chiarelli, a butcher's son from Seattle with advanced degrees in economics and international relations, seems prepared to consider almost anything to achieve his goal.
 On weekly trips around the country from the moated palace near the Baghdad airport that serves as his headquarters, he hands out copies of Malcolm Gladwell's book ''Blink,'' a treatise on split-second decision-making, to get soldiers and marines to think about how to avoid opening fire unless they are in real danger.
 Flying by helicopter over Anbar Province as the smell of manure wafts up from farms below, he tells an Iraqi general next to him that he is arranging for aerial spraying of the country's date palm groves.
 Left unsprayed for the last three years, the once-lucrative crop is suffering from infestation. That means fewer jobs at harvest, potentially fueling the insurgency, he says. ''We're going to do it,'' he said of the spraying. ''I'm following it every day.''
 But fixing problems in the reconstruction effort, much of which is handled by the State Department and Iraqi ministries, strains even a three-star general's powers. 
 He mentions a tractor factory near Baghdad that once employed 6,000 workers. The factory has not been looted and is still owned by two Iraqi government ministries. But it sits largely idle, for reasons the general cannot fully explain but vows to fix. 
 At Asad air base in the desert, Col. Majid Khathim Shaban, the deputy commander of the Iraqi Army brigade that deployed to western Anbar Province last October, thanked General Chiarelli for the training and equipment his soldiers have received from American advisers. He then reeled off complaints about food, pay and the threat of suicide attacks. His unit has lost nearly 600 men to desertions and failures to return from leave, Colonel Kenney said.
 Iraqi Army units are still spread thinly across much of Anbar and police forces are just beginning to form again in many towns, after collapsing in 2004. For that reason, American officers say, it could be a long time before most Iraqi units are able to operate independently.
 Meeting with Marine commanders at the base, General Chiarelli heard Col. W. Blake Crowe say that because local contractors are afraid to work for the Americans, he could not find companies willing to help him clear a large ammunition dump, among other projects.
 The only contractors willing to do the work come from Baghdad, but using them generates resentment among Anbar locals. General Chiarelli told him to approach sheiks and explain how they could benefit if they helped find local companies willing to do the work.
 Colonel Crowe later described how his marines had recently tracked a suspected insurgent leader to an isolated house. A year ago, he said, they probably would have called in an airstrike to kill him. Mindful of the new emphasis on limiting combat, though, the marines raided the house and took the man alive.
 ''You probably got more intelligence and avoided killing civilians,'' said General Chiarelli, beaming. ''That's what I'm trying to make everyone understand.''

HEADLINE: Preparing for Nature's Attack

BYLINE: By Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger. 
Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger are the authors of the forthcoming ''The End of Environmentalism and the Birth of a New American Politics.''

DATELINE: El Cerrito, Calif. 

 BODY:
ENVIRONMENTALISTS and their opponents have spent far too much time debating whether global warming is caused by humans, and whether the transition to cleaner energy sources will be good or bad for the economy. Whatever the causes, warming is a genuine risk. 
 If the earth's temperatures continue to rise, we can expect to face melting glaciers and rising sea levels, warmer ocean temperatures and more intense hurricanes, more frequent droughts and other extreme weather. Is the government ready?
No. Which is why we need a Global Warming Preparedness Act. 
 Those of us who live in California have long prepared ourselves for ''the big one.'' Many of us buy earthquake insurance, bolt our houses to their foundations and set aside emergency food and water. Local governments create evacuation plans with first responders and make sure emergency generators are in place. Schools have created plans to house families whose homes are damaged.
 But nothing like this exists nationally. Under a preparedness act, it would. The law would give the Federal Emergency Management Agency the task of coordinating a national global warming preparedness plan with other government agencies. For instance, coastal and Gulf states would be required to demonstrate effective evacuation procedures to deal with rising sea levels and more severe hurricanes, as well as to assess the risks of new construction in low-lying areas. And Southwestern and agricultural states would be required to determine their capacity to cope with future droughts. 
 After its Hurricane Katrina failures, this would be a great opportunity for the management agency to rehabilitate itself. And to make sure that the agency does the job right, Congress should see to it that all of the agency's plans are made open to public debate and scrutiny. In addition to a preparedness law, we also need a Global Warming Disclosure Act. Here again, California is a good role model. 
 In 1992, the legislature ordered California's Department of Conservation to map earthquake hazards and gave cities and counties the power to regulate development within high-risk areas. In 1998, Gov. Pete Wilson signed the Natural Hazard Disclosure Law, which requires property sellers to disclose any details that could affect the safety, development potential or value of the property. These details include potential exposure to earthquakes, floods and wildfires.
 A federal disclosure act would build on this model, requiring property owners and businesses to assess and disclose the potential effect of global warming to buyers and investors. To some extent, investors are already considering global warming risks when making investment decisions, especially when it comes to the insurance premiums they can expect to pay. But shareholders and property buyers need national standards so that risks are disclosed uniformly. 
 Insurance companies should be the first to advocate for greater clarity and transparency. As Hurricane Katrina showed, insurers (and the federal government) are going to increasingly be in the position of paying for global warming disasters. 
 But the law should find other supporters, too. Federal and state legislation on global warming preparedness and disclosure will help firefighters, paramedics and police officers get the information they need to prepare for natural disasters. 
 We can agree to disagree on the causes of climate change. What we all must agree on, though, is that it poses a risk -- one for which we are woefully unprepared.

HEADLINE: Why the French Take to the Streets

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 These demonstrations, along with recent polling data, indicate a level of rigidity that does not bode well for the future of France.
Let's compare this unhappy situation with the United States, John Tierney's model for global success. 
 Rather than demonstrating in the streets, Americans have accepted, almost without a whimper let alone a demonstration, the elimination of job security, the destruction of pension systems, and the erosion of incomes as the top 1 percent captures the fruits of economic growth.
 Perhaps Mr. Tierney can explain why Americans are not rioting in the streets. That would seem to be a far more interesting question.

HEADLINE: Why the French Take to the Streets

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Corinne Maier (''French Twist,'' Op-Ed, March 31) says that while Parisian protesters in 1968 wanted to change society, protesters in 2006 ''want simply to be part of it.'' So why do they protest in favor of the status quo? With more than one in five unable to find a job, do these twentysomething middle-class French citizens fancy that they are now well integrated into society? 
The key to enabling each young man and woman to become part of society is liberating each person to work on terms mutually agreeable to that person and to his or her employer.

HEADLINE: The Trash Isn't Pretty, but Oh, the Cans!

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Seasons change and so, in the fullness of time, must garbage cans. 
 Yesterday, on the 12th day of spring and, therefore, spring-cleaning season, city officials and community leaders celebrated a new waste receptacle at Canal and Baxter Streets in Chinatown. 
The garbage can will be used in Chinatown because of the area's reputation as being one of New York's scruffier neighborhoods. 
 The garbage cans are sturdier, spiffier and bigger than current receptacles and cost $1,500. Each.
 Even in New York, some apartments can be rented for less. 
 The first group of 48 garbage cans, paid for by Chinatown businesses, community groups and city agencies, will cost a total of $72,000 -- about the price of a nicely loaded Jaguar XJ. 
 Made of ''shot-blasted'' steel, the garbage cans are heavier than most of the city's other 25,000 receptacles. 
 At nearly three and a half feet tall, they are 45 percent taller than most current cans; and at 36 gallons, 25 percent bigger.
 Looking somewhat like a Doric column chipped off a Greek temple, they are also more attractive. Moreover, workers from Chinatown groups will empty them, in addition to service provided by sanitation workers.
 What could require, in the words of the official news release, such ''state-of-the-art, high-volume refuse containers'' that are triple the cost of the older, dumpier $500 garbage cans?
 In a word, Chinatown.
 True, things have improved recently. A City Department of Sanitation study found nearly 84 percent of Chinatown streets ''acceptably clean'' last year, up from nearly 71 percent the year before.
 Still, the garbage cans will go on nearly every Chinatown street corner, said Wellington Chen, 53, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that led the drive for new garbage cans.
 ''It's a necessity,'' he said.
 Like the rest of Lower Manhattan, Chinatown has suffered a lingering economic recession. 
 The terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, scattered businesses, kept tourists away and prompted security measures, like the building of concrete barriers in front of police stations, that tangled already problematic traffic.
 Yet, according to a 2002 survey of 1,800 Chinatown residents, litter, broken sidewalks and other sanitation issues were the top concerns.
 In a different survey of people outside the area, respondents cited sanitation was cited as a reason for avoiding Chinatown, Mr. Chen said.
 Summertime can be especially grim, said Mr. Chen, who as a teenager once packed and shipped women's wigs in a sweaty Canal Street warehouse. Streams of water from fish markets, spilled food, graffiti and dilapidated storefronts are vivid, and largely unwanted, impressions of Chinatown for visitors, Mr. Chen said.
 New garbage cans are only the beginning, he said.
 At any rate, the cans were greeted enthusiastically at yesterday's ribbon-cutting.
 While Stefan Pryor, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, was speaking to reporters and television cameras, a blithe passer-by dropped some refuse into the beribboned receptacle.
 ''That was the inaugural piece!'' shouted Mr. Pryor, to laughter. ''Did someone get a photo?''
 Two hours later -- at 1:30 p.m. and without a red ribbon -- the garbage can was already half full.

HEADLINE: The Slow Fight to Save Chinese Artifacts

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH; Randy Kennedy contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, March 31 

 BODY:
In China's headlong rush to modernize, few things have been so neglected as its past.
 Compared with, say, neighbors like Japan and South Korea, this much larger country has rarely done a good job preserving ancient architecture. And despite the incomparable riches of Chinese civilization, world-class museums here are few and far between.
For decades, collectors seeking a precious piece of China's past have found overseas markets to be the best bet -- like the auctions and antiques fairs of Asia Week, an annual event that has attracted droves of collectors to New York in recent days. For indignant Chinese officials and archaeologists, such sales are a testament to smugglers' skill in funneling antiquities out of the country and into markets where they will fetch top dollar. 
 According to some estimates, some 300,000 to 400,000 tombs have been raided in China in the last quarter-century of accelerating capitalist-style development. Although the numbers of looted items are much fuzzier, experts say, the most valuable ones have made their way to the West, with the bulk going to the United States. 
 For years, China has asked the United States to join its campaign against antiquities smuggling, most recently pressing Washington to adopt a ban on imports of any art or artifact predating 1911, the end of the Qing dynasty. Progress on the issue has been slow, however, partly because of fierce objections from art dealers and collectors.
 Nicole Deaner, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, said yesterday that China's request was still under consideration and that there was no timetable for when a decision would be made.
 Recently there has been a bit of movement on other fronts. In January, China and Italy signed a treaty providing for a new task force of Chinese special agents who will travel to Italy to receive training from the Italian military police in identifying and tracking cultural artifacts. The two countries also plan a rapid exchange of information about suspected smuggled goods. Chinese experts differ widely on the long-term prospects for controlling the trade in contraband antiques. Yet they agree that the looting of important archaeological sites has slowed somewhat over the last decade.
 ''It's impossible to absolutely stop this sort of thing, but the mid-1990's was the crazy peak for this market,'' said He Shuzhong, an official of the State Cultural Heritage Administration, which has been involved in the talks with the United States on tightening import restrictions. ''If you look now at the tomb-raiding problem, and you look at the new pieces on the overseas market, things are better than they were 10 years ago. Tomb raiding, although it still exists, and exists seriously in some areas, has decreased by at least half.''
 Mr. He cited steps taken recently by China to rein in the trade, like new requirements that auction houses and antiques dealers reapply annually for the extension of their licenses. Motion-sensing and satellite-based technology are now used to monitor the best-known sites, and volunteers have been recruited to police them, particularly in the hinterlands. 
 Still, he said, the most effective remedy would be an American import ban on antiques, adding that he was ''annoyed and unsatisfied by America's reaction.''
 People who do not work for the government agree that the market for illicit antiquities has dried up somewhat. ''Smuggling was at its peak between the 1980's and mid-1990's, but now it's relatively subdued,'' said Ma Weidu, owner and founder of Guanfu, China's first private museum of classic and antique art, in Beijing. ''If you went to Hollywood Road in Hong Kong back then, you could see lots of antiquities displayed right there on the street, and they were genuine. Go there today, and you find lots of copies.''
 As recently as a few years ago, he said, ''no one really cared'' when excavation work for a big construction project uncovered antiquities, ''given the heavy emphasis on economic development.'' 
 ''Today, when a construction crew hits an ancient site,'' Mr. Ma said, ''the project will be paused, or forced to take a detour.'' 
 Still, Mr. Ma estimated that 20 percent of the items he viewed in overseas auctions of Chinese rarities left the country under illegal circumstances.
 Lu Jianrong, a professor in the department of heritage, culture and museum science at Fudan University, in Shanghai, said there was little ground for optimism, although he supports the treaty with Italy, which he sees as largely symbolic.
 ''There is obviously a deep socioeconomic background to this, because our country is in a transition period, and from the perspective of city, county or provincial leaders, the focus should be on people's living standards,'' he said.
 ''Antiquities are just not part of the focus,'' he added, ''especially in central and western China, where the living standards are just too low, and where for some, the easiest way to make a living is still to dig stuff up.''

HEADLINE: Gearing Up For Slowdown In Housing

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Bruce Karatz subscribes to the ''jump in with feet first'' philosophy of life, an approach that has proved tremendously successful.
 When he was assigned to run KB Home's French operations in 1976, Mr. Karatz, now KB's chairman and chief executive, asked that his secretary speak only French, even though he had taken just three days of language lessons before leaving.
''It absolutely forced me to muddle my way through,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his office in Los Angeles, where KB is based. ''And really in about six months you speak the language.'' 
 While in France, Mr. Karatz, 60, started successful operations in Lyons and Marseille and created a stir by building a model home atop a department store in Paris, which with 500,000 visitors in five months attracted more people than all other KB Home properties did all year.
 Raised in Minnesota, where his family owned a movie theater, Mr. Karatz's try-anything style and marketing finesse have paid off handsomely for KB Home -- the company's stock has more than tripled in the last four years -- and for him, with his stock and pay package frequently making him the highest paid executive in California.
 That record, however, will face its greatest test this year as the housing market slows. Following are excerpts from the interview:

Q. Tell me about the thinking behind the homes you are building with Martha Stewart.

A: Of everything I've been involved in, the Martha venture is by far the best. And the reason it's the best is that it's not a promotion. It's not just a marketing idea. There is real substance to it. She is a talent when it comes to knowing how people want to live, like to live.

Q. You have announced that you are building up to 20,000 homes outside New Orleans and plan to do more. Is this a good-will gesture or will it be a profitable business?

A. The initial motivation was let's go in on a humanitarian basis and build quickly and well-quality homes, and get it moving. The problem with that is our heart was in the right place but we couldn't find lots to actually build. So as we stepped back, we said, O.K., this is going to be a longer-term process. We're going to have to go through planning and go through all of those administrative steps. Let's go in and set up a division and do it on a for-profit basis. We know how to do that.

Q. What is the biggest challenge to making money there?

A. The challenge is trying to determine what the demand is. In any market you go into, you can extrapolate from the past building cycle and job growth to anticipate what the future will bring. There is no way to know in New Orleans. There has been such a major displacement of population that you can be, on the one hand, quite optimistic that there are hundreds of thousands who want to move back to New Orleans. But there's another side, which is maybe these people aren't coming back.

Q. Recently, KB Home said that orders fell 12 percent in the first quarter from a year ago. Is that indicative of the rest of the year, will it get better or worse?

A. My personal view is that the market is adjusting downward from a market that was very heated, generally along both coasts. The speculators, investors who were in the market, that varied from, let's say, 10 to 15 percent of sales in any given -- of the so-called hot markets -- are gone.
 I believe when that all settles, we're going to have very strong demand on any historical basis; not as good as it was a year ago, but still very strong. And big home builders are going to be able to operate very well. I don't think there's going to be any significant price depreciation.

Q. So if prices are not falling how do you attract buyers, are you using incentives?

A. We don't believe in incentives. We're selling buyers choice, and we sell buyers quality. And this is the single most serious purchase, economic decision made by a family. So we do not believe telling people that they can get $50,000 off on a particular home is going to move them to whether they buy it or not. There are more serious criteria than that.

Q. But doesn't, at some point, the price give?

A. Sure. If in a submarket you were to have a serious correction in value driven by all your competition, there would be, theoretically, a point where you would have to adjust your prices. It's one thing, to be the best design, best quality, best service, but value has to be there.

HEADLINE: An Open Mind on Open Borders

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL. 
E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
GIVE me a pint,'' gets lost in translation -- in Britain of all places -- thanks to the large numbers of immigrant bartenders and waiters, writes Andrew Leonard in the ''How the World Works'' blog for Salon. 
 On a family trip last summer, ''Polish, Czech, Hungarian and Slovakian waitresses and bartenders abounded,'' he writes. ''But nary a pub featured authentic English-speakers.'' 
Critics of the European Union, particularly in Britain, often point to the huge influx of Eastern European immigrants as an example of the downside of the union's open labor markets. 
 But Mr. Leonard argues that the general success of the union's liberalization of labor offers evidence that eventually the United States can open its border with Mexico to the benefit of both countries.
 ''Free worker movement is a cornerstone of the European Union,'' he writes. ''It's a testament to progress that something that was utterly unthinkable 10 years ago -- free migration of workers from Eastern Europe to the West -- is now seen as inevitable. Can we ever envision a similar thing happening with the United States and Mexico?''
 Sure, he concludes, but it will be a while. First, both Mexico's economy and social conditions must improve greatly to avoid a mass northward migration. 
 But given the aging United States population and the labor shortages that will result, opening the border may become more than desirable -- it may become necessary.
 ''Both Mexico and the United States have a lot of work to do before any borders near the Rio Grande start vanishing,'' Mr. Leonard writes. ''But cast a wistful eye at the European Union. They're figuring out how to pull it off. Why can't we?''

APPLE RETREAD -- Cnet News.com offers a puzzling package this week ''celebrating'' Apple Computer on its 30th anniversary.
 Part hagiography, part Apple highlight reel, the package does not say anything new, and it does not offer any fresh context to Apple's place in American business, or that of Steve Jobs, the founder and chief executive. 
 ''Some say there are no second acts in business,'' writes Ina Fried, ''but Jobs & Co. are making mincemeat of that old chestnut.'' 
 How that odd bit of alchemy was achieved is a story that has been told many, many times. The better histories review the corporate intrigue that led to trouble for Apple and Mr. Jobs in the 1990's. And they at least make mention of his mercurial personality and often-antisocial behavior. Not so in this short, prosaic account. 
 A discussion section asks readers, ''Which company is more successful, Apple or Microsoft?''
 It goes on to ask, ''Do you value more the one that kick-started the revolution in 1976 with the original Apple computer and continues to innovate with products such as the iPod, or the one that eventually sold hundreds of millions of copies of its operating system, arguably bringing computing to the masses?''
 Arguably? Microsoft's 90 percent share of the desktop market is not mentioned, perhaps because of worries it would skew readers' opinions.

WORST. HATE BLOG. EVER. -- Matthew Neal Sharp, a programmer and blogger, has concluded that he does not think much of the peripatetic technology journalist and blogger Xeni Jardin (NPR, Wired News, Boingboing). So Mr. Sharp decided to create a blog dedicated to continually dipping her virtual pigtails into the digital inkwell. The site is replete with nasty, sarcastic invective delivered in spot-on Comic Book Guy tone.
 Ms. Jardin tried to be a good sport, posting on Boingboing that Mr. Sharp's blog is ''a total hoot.'' But that only enraged Mr. Sharp further.
 You can see the love -- er, that is, the hate -- at xenisucks.com. An interesting side note: Mr. Sharp plays in a band, Mathgeeks, with Ms. Jardin's colleague, Rick Karr, who reports technology and culture for NPR. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Why the French Take to the Streets

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Who Moved My Fromage?'' (column, March 28):
As an American living in Paris, I am disappointed in John Tierney's view of the protests. 
 I share his incomprehension at the apparent desire of French youth to hold a single, well-protected job until retirement, but though these ''lifetime'' employment contracts do exist, they are increasingly rare.
 People here are uniformly against the new legislation but not only because they are clamoring for job safety. They call the legislation a ''slippery slope,'' propelling France closer to the kind of ''Anglo-Saxon'' economy that cares less about the interests of its workers and citizens than about the interests of wealthy corporations. 
 Given the many debates raging in the United States on this subject, perhaps the protesters are on to something?

HEADLINE: Jitters Over Rate Increases and the Auto Business

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
QUESTION: Is a fast-growing economy good news or bad? Answer: Normally good, of course, but not always -- at least not if robust growth encourages the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.
 That, at least, was the collective conclusion of the stock market last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 96 points in the minutes after the Fed released its latest rate decision. Investors' moods were not helped by the prospect of a potentially damaging labor-management showdown in the auto industry.

HIGHER AND HIGHER -- As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent. As feared, it suggested that even more increases were coming.
The Fed has raised rates at each of the last 15 meetings of its policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, stretching back to June 2004, when the rate was bottomed out at 1 percent. Some investors had hoped that the Fed would now pause, particularly since the economy grew at an anemic annual rate of only 1.7 percent in the last three months of 2005. 
 But in its statement describing the decision -- the first under its new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- the central bank repeated its now familiar warning that ''some further policy firming may be needed'' to keep inflation from accelerating. 
 When the initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter is released on April 28, economists expect it to show expansion accelerating to an annual rate of 4 percent or more. At that rate, economic growth could push prices higher.

NERVOUS TIME -- An anxious standoff loomed over the automobile industry as the Delphi Corporation filed papers in federal bankruptcy court yesterday seeking to unilaterally impose wage and benefit cuts on its 34,000 hourly workers. The move came after the company, the world's second-largest auto parts maker, could not get its employees to agree to cuts before its self-imposed deadline of Thursday.
 Seeking the unilateral cuts sets up a confrontation with Delphi's two big unions. One, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communications Workers of America, has already authorized a strike if the court approves the cuts. A bigger union, the United Automobile Workers, could also seek its members' authority to strike.
 A walkout would affect most major carmakers in the United States, including factories in the country owned by foreign companies, including Nissan. But the biggest effect would be felt at General Motors, which spun off Delphi as a separate company in 1999 and still relies on it for many of its parts. G.M., which had joined the negotiations, said it lost $10.6 billion last year, in part because lower sales did not support its high labor costs.
 A federal bankruptcy court judge is scheduled to consider Delphi's request on May 8. Workers will continue to receive full pay and benefits -- and their unions are urging them to remain on the job -- at least until then.

THE ENRON TRIAL -- Prosecutors in the trial of two former Enron chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, rested their case after eight weeks of testimony by 22 witnesses before a federal court jury in Houston.
 As soon as the government finished presenting evidence, Judge Simeon T. Lake of federal district court dropped 3 of the 31 counts against Mr. Skilling and one of the seven counts against Mr. Lay. The prosecutors, seeking to simplify their case, chose not to present evidence to support those accusations.
 Defense lawyers are scheduled to open their case on Monday, and they have said they plan to have both Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling testify.

MANY HAPPY RETURNS -- While millions of people were preparing to file their tax returns, a former partner at the KPMG accounting firm pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud by admitting he had helped rich people escape paying millions of dollars in taxes using phony tax shelters.
 As part of his plea, the former partner, David Rivkin, who had worked for KPMG in San Diego, agreed to cooperate with the government as it pursued similar charges against 16 other former employees of the firm as well as an outside lawyer and an independent investment adviser.
 Prosecutors have focused their investigation on four tax shelters that they contend were bogus and that they say created $11 billion in phony losses that allowed wealthy individuals to avoid paying about $2.5 billion in taxes.
 Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of federal district court, who accepted the guilty plea, said that Mr. Rivkin's sentence would depend on how well he cooperated with prosecutors. He could be sentenced to as much as five years in prison for each count he admitted.

SUE YOU BLUES -- It was Apple v. Apple in Britain's High Court -- again. The Apple Corps music publishing company of the Beatles sued Apple Computer for the third time since 1980, accusing the computer maker of infringing on its trademark.
 Specifically, Apple Corps said Apple Computer violated a 1991 agreement between the companies when it started its iTunes online music service. The Apples had settled earlier disputes over the rights to their names by agreeing that Apple Computer would stay out of the music business.
 Lawyers for the computer maker argued in court that their client had not violated that agreement because it did not publish music, it only sold it for use on its popular iPod music players.
 Justice Edward Mann is not expected to rule on the matter for some time.

HEADLINE: A Tangle In Caracas For Exxon

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 31 

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is locking horns with Venezuela's government, which ratcheted up the pressure Friday on other American oil companies by taking steps to put more than two dozen coveted petroleum ventures under government control. 
 The latest move in the growing confrontation between big oil and the leftist government of President Hugo Chavez follows months of changes -- from raising taxes to shifting control of projects to Venezuela's national oil company and welcoming state-controlled companies from Iran, China and India as exploration partners. 
Few moves can rattle the executive suites of companies here in Houston. But one that did came late this week: a comment from Venezuela's energy minister, Rafael Ramirez, who essentially told Exxon that it was no longer welcome in Venezuela. 
 ''We don't want them to be here, then,'' Mr. Ramirez said Thursday in a television interview in relation to Exxon's earlier decision to sell its stake in an oil field to Repsol of Spain rather than submit to a venture controlled by Petroleos de Venezuela. Venezuela's Congress approved measures this week that give the government control of 32 privately run oil fields. 
 If Venezuela needs Exxon, Mr. Ramirez said, ''we'll call them.'' 
 Still, nothing is simple in the relationship between Venezuela and Exxon, which played a contentious role in the building of the country's oil industry. For all the rising tensions, the relationship between Exxon and Venezuela is more nuanced and intertwined than the harsh statements from Mr. Ramirez might suggest.
 Exxon's chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, said this month that he, at least for the moment, would avoid making any major investments in the country. Western oil companies fear a creeping nationalization of petroleum assets in Venezuela under Mr. Chavez's government, which is using its growing wealth from high oil prices to spread its influence around the rest of Latin America. 
 Those rising revenues from oil exports have also emboldened Mr. Chavez's government in its dealings with foreign energy companies. 
 Yet for all its difficulties in Venezuela, the placement of Exxon in the government's cross hairs may have more to do with symbolism than substance because of the way the company is perceived as a symbol of American influence in a country where anti-American sentiment is flourishing.
 Exxon also stands out because of its signature method of dealing with governments in countries where it operates. Exxon, for example, has publicly criticized Venezuela's moves to increase royalties on projects in the country's Orinoco region, threatening last year to take the issue to international courts.
 Venezuela has repeatedly been a challenging operating arena for Exxon, with the company taken off a $3 billion petrochemical project in February and a $5 billion project to export natural gas in 2002. 
 While Exxon and Venezuela continue to dance around each other, most other foreign oil companies operating there, including some of the largest energy concerns from the United States, Britain and France, have acquiesced to government requests for higher taxes, royalties and even fines.
 Jose Vielma, the superintendent of Venezuela's tax authority, announced Friday that Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, after Exxon, had agreed to pay $50.2 million in back taxes, interest and fines. And BP of Britain will pay about $14 million, Mr. Vielma said.
 Total of France made a similar outstanding tax payment of about $19 million this week after its administrative offices in Caracas were shut down by authorities for two days this month. 
 Lured by Venezuela's 77.2 billion barrels of conventional oil reserves, the largest outside the Middle East, these companies and others gained a foothold in Venezuela during a loosening toward foreign investment in the 1990's. And they have good reasons to try to hang on to it.
 One often overlooked reason most companies have declined to fight the different measures squeezing their operations is that Venezuela remains a relatively friendly place to do business. And while Venezuela's politics might be risky, its geology is not, with its oil easy to find. 
 Moreover, Venezuela still exports the bulk of its oil to the United States, since no other country's refining system can better handle its high-sulfur crude.
 In Washington, the Energy Department issued a report this month concluding that Venezuela still offered a more favorable investment climate for American companies than Saudi Arabia, the most pivotal member of OPEC, and Mexico, where longstanding nationalism and constitutional law prevent foreign companies from exploring for oil. 
 Some analysts say that foreign oil companies account for as much as half of Venezuela's estimated 2.5 million barrels of daily oil production, explaining in part why these companies are hesitant to leave Venezuela and why Caracas, so far at least, is hesitant to see them go. 
 International companies have shown particularly keen interest in Venezuela's heavy oil reserves, after witnessing the boom in Canada, which is getting billions of dollars in revenue from these once uneconomical resources. 
 ''The relationship with foreign oil companies and Venezuela is actually relatively warm, even with some of the improvised and emotional declarations that have been made,'' said Mazhar al-Shereidah, a professor of petroleum economics at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. ''I don't interpret some negative comments about Exxon as policy of the state.'' 
 So why has Exxon opted to publicly complain about its treatment in Venezuela, risking a government scolding? Perhaps because it can do so without much harm to its overall operations, unlike some of its competitors.
 ConocoPhillips, for example, relies on Venezuela for about 7 percent of its oil production, while Venezuela accounts for just 1 to 2 percent of Exxon's output. 
 ''Exxon is bigger than an Argentina or any medium-sized Latin American country,'' said Roger Tissot, director of markets and countries at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''They're not going to be bullied by Venezuela, but neither is Venezuela going to be bullied by Exxon.'' 
 Exxon has been through upheaval before in Venezuela, helping to cement the nation's position as a major oil exporter in the 1920's through its Creole Petroleum subsidiary and deriving nearly half its dividend income from Venezuela by the 1950's.
 That was before a previous populist government nationalized foreign oil assets in the 1970's. Exxon still has a 42 percent stake in the Cerro Negro oil field in Venezuela, which produces 120,000 barrels of oil a day. 
 Mark Boudreaux, an Exxon spokesman, said the company had ''a long-term perspective of its activities in Venezuela and maintains a respectful relationship with the Ministry of Mines and Energy.''

HEADLINE: China Output Not a Threat, Official Says

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 31 

 BODY:
The United States has nothing to fear from the rise of China as a low-cost manufacturing power and should concentrate on further growth in high-value industries, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said Friday.
 At a time of mounting friction over a $202 billion trade deficit with China, Mr. Gutierrez said United States unemployment was declining and wealth increasing even as imports from China rise.
 ''Our economy is growing, and the average take-home pay per American is increasing,'' he told a business forum in Tokyo. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Gutierrez issued a blunt warning during his visit to Beijing that rising protectionism in Washington could hurt China if the country failed to open its markets further to American products.
 The two messages highlighted the fact that Washington is more concerned with what it perceives as Beijing's unfair trade practices than with the growing might of China's manufacturing industry.
 The Bush administration and American manufacturers have long complained that China keeps its currency, the yuan, undervalued to give its exporters a competitive advantage. They also argue that a broad range of regulatory barriers, subsidies and rampant theft of intellectual property restrict United States exports to China, contributing to the ballooning deficit.
 The European Union joined Washington on Thursday in confronting China at the World Trade Organization over tariffs that Beijing places on auto part imports. 
 This trade gap is now one of the major irritations in what senior United States officials describe as the most important global economic relationship of the 21st century. It seems certain to be a source of contention when President Hu Jintao of China visits Washington in April. 
 Some trade specialists maintain that United States and European Union manufacturers have little choice but to surrender low-cost manufacturing to China.
 ''For the time being, the strategy for developed countries is to go further into new-generation technology and value-added products,'' said Yan Lan, a Beijing-based specialist on international trade with the French law firm of Gide Loyrette Nouel.
 Senior United States trade officials acknowledge that trade between China and the United States is complex with benefits to each side.
 ''The United States draws significant benefits from our commerce with China,'' Mr. Gutierrez said Wednesday in a speech in Beijing after he held talks with senior Chinese leaders. ''Our consumers gain additional choices and many American companies are operating profitably in China.''
 Senior Chinese officials argue that some critics of the United States trade deficit fail to recognize that a significant proportion of Chinese exports of manufactured goods are shipped by subsidiaries of American companies or subcontractors.
 And they note that the value to China of these exports was often limited to inexpensive labor, materials and packaging -- while the high-value returns from design, marketing and retail sales were earned in the United States.
 Despite continued American frustration over the deficit, there are signs that some of this tension could ease.
 Two of Beijing's most strident critics in the Senate, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, this week delayed plans for a bill that would have required heavy tariffs on Chinese imports if Beijing failed to let its currency rise in value against the dollar.
 After a weeklong visit to China last month, both lawmakers said Chinese officials had expressed willingness to allow the yuan to appreciate and tackle other barriers to United States exports.
 The yuan did rise this week, albeit incrementally, and it finished the week at its highest level since July, when it was partly released from a peg to the dollar. The dollar eased to 8.0175 yuan on Friday from 8.027 yuan on Thursday, adding to a gain for the yuan of about 0.5 percent since early February.
 Some trade specialists suggest that trade tensions can also be expected to ease if both sides recognize that they have a lot to gain from cooperation rather than conflict.
 Mr. Gutierrez said Friday in Tokyo that China and the United States were at different stages of development and not competing head-on.
 ''China has built its economy on the basis of manufacturing of commodity-type products,'' he said. ''What we have seen in the U.S. is that our new jobs that are being created are in the area of higher-value manufacturing, differentiation of products, higher technology and in many cases new services.''
 To remain competitive, he said the United States would need to improve education and encourage research and development.
 He suggested that China would eventually need to follow the same path.

HEADLINE: King Canute At The Border

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY; Maureen Dowd is on a book leave.

 BODY:
George Bush is the King Canute of the immigration debate, and I mean that in a nice way.
 Canute has an image problem today because so many people think of him as that batty old English king who thought he could command the tide to recede. But that's the wrong spin on his legend.
In the original tale, he was a sensible ruler who was tired of hearing flattery from his courtiers about his great powers. When they told him that even the tides would obey his command, he went down to the sea to teach them a lesson in limits. 
 Today's courtiers are the Republicans in Congress and the others demanding that America ''secure the border.'' They're furious at Bush for suggesting that a crackdown at the border will not stop the tide of illegal immigrants.
 ''When you make something illegal that people want, there's a way around it,'' he said, pointing out an inconvenient reality that would remain even if a 2,000-mile fence were built on the southern border. People would keep going under it, through it or around it to other borders.
 The Border Patrol has tried building fences and adding thousands of agents, and in some places it has made smuggling harder. Yet the overall flow of immigrants hasn't slowed. No matter how hard they work, the agents can't outlaw basic economics.
 In San Diego, for instance, agents took pride that their concentrated efforts had caused local smugglers to raise their fee to $1,500. But that's still a small price next to what immigrants stand to gain. Chinese immigrants are already paying $20,000 apiece to be smuggled into America. 
 It's the same kind of economic quandary that has stymied the war on drugs. For more than a quarter-century, federal and local authorities have tried to solve America's drug problem by making smuggling and dealing prohibitively expensive.
 They've stepped up enforcement at the borders, promising that more agents and new technology would make a difference. They've taken the fight to countries supplying drugs. They filled prisons with dealers and addicts. But even though they raised the cost of smuggling and dealing, the increase was never enough to make a difference.
 ''Seizing drugs has not had any perceptible impact on the availability of drugs,'' says Peter Reuter, an economist at the University of Maryland who's an expert on drugs and other black markets. ''Even though enforcement has gotten tougher by any measure, the prices of drugs have been falling steadily.''
 I'm not suggesting that stopping drugs is the same as stopping the flow of illegal immigrants. In many ways the drug war is easier because it enjoys more popular support. Most people would like to see less drug use. No one wants a drug market on the corner, and people will urge the police to round up dealers and addicts there.
 They're not about to turn in the illegal immigrants working in their stores, their neighborhoods and their homes. They know how hard immigrants work and how much they contribute. They may tell pollsters there's too much immigration, but they like the immigrants they know.
 Americans are understandably angry to see immigrants' breaking the law, but they're not going to be assuaged when a crackdown simply creates more illegality. The only practical way to reduce lawbreaking is to change the law so more immigrants can enter legally and the ones here can stop hiding, the approach favored by Bush and Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy.
 Some skeptics doubt that illegal immigrants want to come forward and start paying taxes. But most immigrants claim to be willing, at least according to a new survey of more than 200 undocumented workers in Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami conducted for the Manhattan Institute and the National Immigration Forum.
 About 4 in 10 of them said they're already getting taxes deducted from their paychecks, and 70 percent said they'd be willing to pay back taxes to get legal status. More than 90 percent said they'd comply with other requirements, like paying a fine of $1,000, getting fingerprinted and submitting to a criminal background check.
 Railing at them for breaking the law is not going to make them go home or stop others from following them here. Immigrants will cross the border one way or another. The more of them we let in legally, the better off everyone will be. Whether you welcome more immigrants, as I do, or whether you'd rather see fewer, there's no point in commanding the tide to ebb.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Reaches New Agreement With Jets and Giants for Stadium 

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 31 

 BODY:
After threatening to abandon plans for a new Meadowlands stadium because of its cost, Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced Friday that the state had reached a compromise with the Jets and the Giants that would save New Jersey millions of dollars.
 In exchange for revisions in the agreement, however, state officials said they would give the teams additional naming rights at the stadium complex, which could earn the teams millions of dollars more. 
 New Jersey officials said that two key provisions would help ease the state's financial burden on the project.
 The first, officials said, included an agreement that the teams would now pay roughly $35 million in costs associated with upgrading the stadium complex's roadways, sewers and other needs. Those improvements had been the state's responsibility under the earlier deal.
 The second provision requires the teams to make larger payments in lieu of taxes to the town of East Rutherford, where the stadium will be situated. The payments must still be negotiated. Under the earlier agreement, the payments were to have been capped at about $1 million dollars a year. 
 While the old agreement allowed the teams to sell the naming rights to the stadium -- which was expected to bring the teams more than $10 million a year -- the new deal also allows them to sell naming rights to the racetrack and the planned retail complex adjacent to the stadium. But those naming rights do not extend to the Continental Airlines Arena or Xanadu, the $1.2 billion retail and entertainment complex now under construction in the Meadowlands. 
 In a statement, Mr. Corzine said that the revised agreement ''confirms the partnership that has been fostered between New Jersey and the teams.''
 The stadium, which officials estimate will cost about $1 billion and will seat 81,000 people, is scheduled to be completed in 2009 and open for the 2010 football season. Besides building the stadium, the teams are also expected to build more than a half million square feet of retail space in the surrounding area.
 The owners of the teams, Steve Tisch and John K. Mara of the Giants and Woody Johnson of the Jets, said in statements that they were looking forward to the start of construction and acknowledged the roles of both Mr. Corzine and his predecessor, Richard J. Codey, in drafting the new agreement.
 ''I think all parties agree that it is time to put shovels in the ground,'' said Mr. Codey, who had negotiated the original agreement with the teams last fall.
 The state and the teams began to renegotiate the agreement early last month after Mr. Corzine questioned the cost of the project to taxpayers and suggested that he would like to see the stadium fitted with a retractable roof. Adding a roof would allow the stadium to hold lucrative events year round, including the Super Bowl, and bring in more tax dollars to the state.
 But the owners of the teams -- who are privately financing the project -- have made public remarks in recent weeks suggesting that they would forsake the new stadium completely rather than add a costly roof, which could have increased the price by as much as a half-billion dollars.
 Although the revised agreement does not include a provision for a roof -- or an increase in the teams' annual $5 million rent -- one analyst said that changes to the new agreement, however modest, were beneficial to New Jersey taxpayers.
 ''In a fairer world, the deal would have been sweeter for New Jersey,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist who teaches at Smith College. ''But you've got to give Corzine credit for the way he stuck his neck out and said, 'Hey, wait a minute, I know a deal has been negotiated, but we need to look at this.'''
 Mr. Zimbalist added, ''One can imagine a more equitable agreement, but I think this is a pretty O.K. outcome.''
 East Rutherford's mayor, James L. Cassella, of said he was waiting for a legal review of the agreement.

HEADLINE: Mayor Seeks New Ways To Tighten Immigration

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday offered some of his most explicit views so far on the national immigration debate, calling for much tighter border controls, more generous visa policies for foreign scientists and the granting of permanent residency -- though not necessarily citizenship -- to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in this country.
 The mayor, who has seized on ideas from both the right and the left on immigration matters, spoke favorably for the first time about erecting a ''physical wall'' along the borders with Mexico and Canada or using technologies like sensors to detect the movements of migrants across borders. 
''I have said from Day 1, get control of the borders,'' the mayor said in a radio call-in program on WABC. ''People say, 'All right, I want control of the borders, but I don't want a wall.' Well, that's O.K. Just tell me what else works. And nobody's come up with an idea.'' 
 Later, speaking about illegal immigrants, he said: ''Legalize them, close the border and be serious about closing the border. And people say, 'Oh, you know, the wall -- you can always climb over it.' Well, if 3,000 come through one little point on the border every day and you build a wall so only 10 climb the wall, I would argue that if you get it down to a hundred, if you get it down to a thousand, you'd be successful by that standard.'' 
 Just as Mr. Bloomberg's call for legalizing illegal immigrants has placed him at odds with conservative Republicans, so his call for tighter border controls could alienate liberal Democrats, who make up much of the city's electorate. 
 Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a nonprofit group that provides social services in Manhattan and the Bronx, applauded Mr. Bloomberg's condemnation of criminalizing illegal immigrants and his recognition of their economic contributions, but said the idea of a wall was absurd. ''Why not build a wall around the entire country?'' he asked. 
 Deborah J. Notkin, a Manhattan lawyer who is president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports gradual legalization of illegal immigrants, said that a fence along the border would not work and would cost far more to monitor than the entire current budget for Customs and border enforcement. 
 ''The drug traffickers can dig tunnels, the smugglers can get boats and we cannot have a Berlin Wall-type structure become our symbol, and substitute itself for the Statue of Liberty,'' she said.
 On the radio show, Mr. Bloomberg called for raising the number of H-1B visas, which allow skilled professionals sponsored by their employers to work temporarily in the United States. 
 ''We are killing ourselves, hurting universities and hospitals and research in this country,'' he said. ''We're losing the battle. Our science is going overseas.''
 The mayor also ridiculed rules that bar employers from inquiring about immigration status and said it was difficult for many employers to verify applicants' identification documents. 
 ''Let's say they don't speak a word of English, O.K.?'' he asked. ''So that's a good tip, maybe, that the guy wasn't born here. Maybe you should check. Unh-unh. Can't check any more for that person than you check for the person who speaks the king's English.''
 Meanwhile, he said, forgers ''set up tables in the streets. You can buy a green card and a Social Security card, a combination for $50.''

HEADLINE: Clinton, Impresario of Philanthropy, Gets a Progress Update

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
''Ajay, please come up here!'' said Bill Clinton, summoning a Citigroup executive, Ajay Banga, to the stage. There, before a full house of corporate chieftains, millionaire investors, nonprofit leaders and assorted more ordinary people, the former president slipped comfortably yesterday into his new role as an impresario of philanthropy.
 It was Mr. Banga's turn to bask in the glow of Mr. Clinton's approval. Under the auspices of Mr. Clinton's ''global initiative,'' Citigroup has committed $5.5 million to support financial education for poor people and awards that recognize individuals who create innovative programs to finance very small businesses. 
 ''Mr. President, keep going!'' Mr. Banga told Mr. Clinton, and assured him of Citigroup's support. ''Three hundred thousand employees are behind you.''
 The gathering at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Columbus Circle in Manhattan represented six months since Mr. Clinton invented one of the most high-profile ventures of his post-presidency, the Clinton Global Initiative. It brings together people with money, influence and ideas to talk about global poverty, climate change and religious and ethnic conflict.
 What sets it apart from other such high-minded conferences is Mr. Clinton's insistence that participants not just discuss these daunting problems but also do something concrete about them -- or not be invited back. A staff of four works full-time on ''commitments management.'' 
 Since the program began with a conference in September, almost 300 corporations, individuals and nonprofit groups have committed more than $2.5 billion to an array of good works, his staff says. Some projects would have happened anyway, but Mr. Clinton estimates that more than half are genuinely new.
 ''More and more people were saying to me all the time: 'What can I do? What can I do? Tell me something to do,' '' Mr. Clinton said in an interview. ''I just heard it all the time. So here we are in New York. The United Nations meets here. We can bring together all kinds of people from all over the world. So I just decided to organize a 'What can I do?' conference. And then try to do it every year for a decade.''
 A parade of people gave testimonials from microphones in the audience about what they had done since they made their commitments in September. 
 Dr. Bruce Charish, a Manhattan cardiologist, founded a new nonprofit group, Doc to Dock, to send medical tools and supplies to hospitals and clinics in Africa. ''Just the prestige of being a C.G.I. commitment has opened many corporate doors,'' he said.
 Maria Otero, who heads Accion, described how her nonprofit group and another, Unitus, have taken steps to fulfill their promise to provide small loans and other financial service to millions of poor people in India by 2015. ''I want to thank you for galvanizing us to do this work,'' she told Mr. Clinton.
 Nancy Kete, the director of Embarq, founded with a grant from the Shell Foundation, is working with Porto Alegre, Brazil, to develop mass transit powered by low-polluting buses. ''If you care about climate change, you have to care about transportation,'' she said.
 A row of black Mercedeses and Lincolns lined up on West 60th Street as guests arrived yesterday for a breakfast with Mr. Clinton at Dizzy's Club that felt more like a cocktail party, albeit one where only orange juice and coffee were served. A duo played jazz on saxophone and piano, and Mr. Clinton embraced his daughter, Chelsea.
 With sweeping views of Central Park, 100 or so people milled about. They were a reflection of Mr. Clinton's vast network. There was Mike Rienzi, an Italian food importer from Astoria, who said Mr. Clinton came to a recent fund-raiser he held for research into deafness, and stayed all evening. Yesterday was his first time at a Clinton Global Initiative event, and he said he had not made any commitment yet. But he added, ''Whatever the Clintons do, I support them.''
 Across the room Bernard Schwartz, chairman of Loral Space and Communications, and Lewis Cullman, 87, a philanthropist, chatted. Both had come to the September meeting and neither had yet picked a project to finance. ''I'm ready to do so,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''I'm sure having said so, I'll get a lot of knocks on my door, and they'll be welcome.''
 Soon the breakfast guests merged with the 500 people who had come for the main event, an updating on the program's progress. Ami Nahshon, who heads the Abraham Fund Initiatives, a nonprofit group that promotes coexistence between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens, hopes to find patrons to encourage business development in Arab communities. He seemed very pleased to be at the event. ''It feels a bit like philanthropic speed dating,'' he said.
 Mr. Clinton himself chose a retailing metaphor. 
 ''Maybe the model is eBay,'' he said. ''It brings buyers and sellers together. Maybe we can create a massive, floating and flexible partnership where people who want to give some money and people who want to provide services or programs and people who need economic and social support will be together in an ongoing dialogue.''
 ''That would be my dream,'' he said, ''that we could turn the concern of people who are well educated and have good incomes or represent foundations or businesses into action.''

HEADLINE: For Low Fares, the Waiting Game May Not Pay

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A ROUND-TRIP air fare from Los Angeles to Dublin this June cost Stu Watson $630 when he booked it in January -- and he is relieved that he did.
 A few days later, Mr. Watson, a retired bank vice president who lives in Redondo Beach, Calif., rechecked the price online. ''The same flight now was $800,'' he said. ''By mid-March it was up to $940.''
When it comes to buying airline tickets for a summer vacation, late winter and early spring is a time of uncertainty. Do you book now, and lock in what may be a higher fare? Or do you wait until the summer fare sales that normally take place just before Memorial Day, and hope there are still seats left? 
 This year the decision is particularly agonizing for Europe-bound travelers because prices are higher than they were at this time last year. The average one-way economy fare from the United States to Europe -- booked in February for summer travel -- was $455, compared with $428 for the same period in 2005, according to Harrell Associates, an air-fare analysis firm. In some cities, rates are dramatically higher. The one-way fare from Newark to Rome was 21 percent higher, at $455, while the $670 fare from San Francisco to Frankfurt was 49 percent higher than last February's $450 ticket. 
 If the cost is already beyond your budget, you aren't out of options. Inexpensive flights may still be available online, through creative routing or by buying special packages that include an airline ticket. Regardless of how you buy a ticket, experts say, it is still a gamble.
 ''It's almost like the dilemma of refinancing a mortgage,'' said Bob Harrell, a principal with Harrell Associates. ''Do you want to lock in a higher rate than last year now? Then again, the fares haven't gone on sale yet. But when they do later in the spring, will seats still be available?''
 Take Mr. Watson's search. ''I knew the timing was critical,'' he said. ''I expected fares to go up, but I wasn't sure by how much.''
 American Airlines, the carrier on which he had bought his tickets, acknowledged through a spokesman that its fares have been rising but said Mr. Watson's strategy is one of the most effective ways to get a low summer fare. ''If you start looking early, and if you keep an eye out for fare sales, you can still find a deal,'' said the spokesman for American, Tim Wagner. He said Mr. Watson also made another shrewd move: he selected a city other than London as a destination. ''Being flexible is important -- not only on times and dates but also on destinations,'' said Mr. Wagner. ''If you need to go to Great Britain, you might consider flying into airports outside of London, like Manchester.''
 Experts predict that fares to Europe will be pricier this year than in the recent past.
 ''If you're looking for a fare this summer, I would buy now,'' said Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with Calyon Securities. ''I doubt if there will be many last-minute bargains.''
 Why not? European routes are more profitable because there is generally less competition and because airlines can charge more for flights, according to experts. 
 So that is where airlines are adding capacity. American Airlines, for instance, says 25 percent of its flights were international in 2001; this year, it estimates that the proportion will rise to 35 percent. American launched new service from Boston to Shannon, Ireland, and between Chicago and Dublin within the last year. 
 But the airlines have carefully calculated their moves so that they don't add too much capacity, which could cause prices to drop. That has kept load factors -- the airline equivalent of hotel occupancy rates -- high.
 American's load factor on European routes was 81 percent in 2004 and 82 percent in 2005. ''When load factors are above 80 percent, then that's where we want to be,'' said Mr. Wagner. 
 If fares to your favorite destination are already sky-high -- and odds are, if you have not booked a ticket yet, they will be -- all is not lost, according to fare-watchers. Airlines often negotiate with tour operators and travel agents to sell discounted tickets at bulk rates, and it may still be possible to find a low price through other channels.
 ''There is more aggressive pricing on package deals, which actually may be better for U.S. travelers because of high hotel costs,'' said Michael Miller, an airline analyst with the Velocity Group. ''In the past, shopping for air fare was the most important aspect of a trip. But with the higher euro and higher hotel prices, the hotel can cost more than the air fare.''
 MR. Miller recommends the big three online travel agencies -- Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz -- which allow travelers to take advantage of discounted flights and to create highly customized itineraries that include inexpensive hotels. For example, recently a round-trip economy-class ticket between New York and Frankfurt in early July cost $1,014 through the United Airlines Web site. On Expedia, the same flight was roughly $100 cheaper -- $909. Add six nights at the Best Western Hotel Domicil, in Frankfurt's banking district, to the flight, and the room rate was about $75 a night (not including taxes and fees), a savings of $133 from what Expedia normally charges. There is another way of sidestepping higher fares this summer. Alex Cruz, a transportation expert with Accenture in London, says competition within Europe is growing. ''The European market is currently under great pressure from multiple low-cost airline competitors, and low fares are fairly easy to find between major hub cities and regional cities,'' he said.
 For example, you could fly round-trip economy class from New York to Vienna on British Airways this summer for $1,036, including taxes and fees. Or you could just fly to London on British Airways for $796, and then fly to Austria for an additional $:82 (about $147, at $1.79 to $:1) on the discount carrier Ryanair. But the $96 saving comes at a price: instead of flying out of Heathrow Airport near London, Ryanair departs from Stansted, which is about twice as far from the city center. And you arrive in Graz, about 120 miles southwest of Vienna. 
 Of course, one of the best options may be to pay nothing. Vada Crosby began fare shopping for a late summer flight between New York and Rome last September, almost a year before his scheduled departure. But prices remained stubbornly high.
 ''Sure, it's the height of the summer travel season,'' he said. ''But paying more than $1,000 for a round-trip ticket from Hartford to Rome is outrageous.''
 Mr. Crosby, a page designer for a newspaper in Hartford, cashed in 100,000 Delta Air Lines frequent flier miles for the ticket instead of waiting for an inexpensive fare.

HEADLINE: A Gritty Area With Awesome Views

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: PATERSON 

 BODY:
THIS is a city with a reputation for being old, gritty and tired, but it has a natural wonder that is mostly a secret to outsiders: magnificent waterfalls. 
 Now, Paterson's energetic mayor and a fired-up developer envision a vibrant neighborhood near these falls. It would create hundreds of condos in restored factory buildings and new low-rise structures, new retail space, a public access cable television studio, a hotel, an amphitheater and a waterfront trail along the Passaic River.
The mayor, Jose Torres, is pushing hard to have the Great Falls of Paterson -- the second largest by volume east of the Mississippi, after Niagara, according to the city -- declared a national park. And he has set in motion a plan to secure a National Park Service grant to finance the cleanup and stabilization of the historic district around the falls, which was declared a state park in 2004. 
 Currently, the area immediately around the falls is desolate. It is occupied by the city dog pound, two warehouses, a run-down arena and several burnt-out husks of buildings that once served as textile mills.
 But the developer, Dornoch Holdings of Morristown, has seized on the mayor's view of the place as a natural gem in need of polishing and has produced plans for a large-scale redevelopment to be built in phases over the next five to seven years. 
 The Great Falls Historic District project would create a total of about 350 market-rate condominium units in restored and newly built structures and an 83,000-square-foot hotel-conference center where there are now faded industrial structures running along McBride Avenue that have spectacular waterfall views.
 The plan for the project is designed to showcase the views -- of the falls, the river and the Manhattan skyline 12 miles to the west -- for both residents and tourists, said Glen Fishman, who founded Dornoch two years ago with Frank Macios.
 ''We were amazed when we first saw what is here,'' Mr. Fishman said. Now, he likes to lead visitors up a ladder to the roof of one of the warehouse buildings to show off the panorama. And he is prone to outright cheerleading for a beleaguered city he perceives as having big-league potential.
 ''Anywhere else in the country, a place like this is valuable real estate, and it's valuable real estate here too,'' he asserted fervently in a recent statement from the warehouse rooftop. ''We are committed to help in revitalizing Paterson and its economy, because this is a sweet place with a rich history, and we think that's very exciting as a business opportunity, and as a worthwhile thing to do.''
 So far, Dornoch has acquired eight acres of property, including the warehouse sites and the site of the long-vacant Columbia textile mill, bordered by Ryle Avenue and Geering Lane overlooking the river.
 Mr. Fishman said various Columbia mill buildings would be restored to maintain their ''historical character,'' and turned into a dozen 900-square-foot one-bedroom homes; one three-bedroom home of 1,800 square feet; and 30 condos, each about 1,200 square feet. Some of the units would be intended as artist's live-work space.
 The warehouses, which occupy the bluff above the falls on Jasper Street, would be razed, according to the plan, which will be formally submitted to local planning authorities next month, Mr. Fishman said.
 In their place, Dornoch will build the Palisade Condominium complex: five buildings with 12 one-story apartments each, and six buildings with four single-level apartments and six town homes. 
 Town planners are insisting on low-rise buildings, no higher than three floors, Mr. Fishman said. The buildings would be red brick, with tall windows and classic colonial-era detail in deference to the mill motif, he said.
 Mayor Torres, who was born in Paterson and who is in his first term as mayor, promotes the city as a ''unique treasure of national history.''
 In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, the country's first secretary of the treasury and one of Paterson's founders, helped to initiate the Industrial Revolution by investing in a hydropower system that diverted water from the Great Falls to the mills strung along the Passaic. Hamilton met with George Washington at the site, an event commemorated in a painting that hangs in the mayor's office.
 The water power system generated some major breakthroughs in early manufacturing. Samuel Colt, who invented the first revolver, and John Holland, who invented the first useful submarine, started up factories fueled by its power. The Colt Gun Mill site is a part of the redevelopment area.
 By the early 20th century, Paterson had become known as a world center for the production of cotton, silk and locomotives. ''Important labor history was also made here,'' said Mr. Torres, who made mention of the Silk Strike of 1913, during which skilled workers first demanded an eight-hour day.
 In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford designated 118 acres of the industrial area near the falls as a national landmark, and that set off a process that could lead to National Park designation.
 Since then, a number of the old mills in town have been restored and converted to new use. Several others still actually operate as mills.
 But the heart of the historic mill district pretty much languished until the mayor began beating the drums, and Dornoch heard the call.
 Even now, there is the possibility their plans will never precede. The mayor is up for re-election next month in a tight battle. 
 The developers emphasize that no financing is required from the city of Paterson for the project. 
 ''But the truth is we have worked closely and well with the mayor on creating this plan,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''We want to move forward despite any future issues or obstacles, but politics could certainly change the scenario.''

HEADLINE: A House That's Shy About Revealing Its Age 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:

Q. Could you tell me anything about the interesting wooden building at 203 East 29th Street? Susan Marro, Montclair, N.J.

A. This tall post-and-beam structure is recorded on its site no later than 1840, and dating buildings in this period is usually a combination of inference and luck -- especially luck.
 In 1747, John Watts bought 131 acres between what are now East 21st and East 30th Streets, and named his place Rose Hill Farm, apparently after the family's property near Edinburgh. Mr. Watts was outspokenly loyal to the British crown, and before the Revolutionary War was banished from New York, forcing him to forfeit his land. 
 The main house at Rose Hill burned in 1779, but a deed from the 1780's mentions ''houses, buildings, orchards, gardens'' on the land. 
 In 1786, Nicholas Cruger paid ''144 pounds'' for most of what is now the block bounded by 29th and 30th Streets and Second and Third Avenues. Later notations indicated that the parcel had been divided into building lots in 1811, the very year the Commissioners' Plan establishing Manhattan's present street grid was adopted.
 Thus, the odd lot on which 203 East 29th Street now stands was created at that time. It runs for 50 feet along 29th Street but is only 24 feet deep. 
 The creation of the lot suggests a particular purpose -- perhaps to receive an outbuilding relocated from the Rose Hill estate because it lay in the path of new roadways? 
 The Department of Buildings first started issuing building permits in the 1860's, and before that time researchers must rely on yearly tax assessments to date buildings. The tax assessment for 1830 for this location says that Joseph Haskett, a saddler, had two lots and one building -- but doesn't indicate whether the lot at what is now 203 East 29th was the one with the building on it. 
 It is not until 1840 that the tax assessment clearly indicates that there was a house on the lot at 203 East 29th, although it gives no indication of height or size. Tax records for 1860 indicate that the house was three stories high. Most people would describe the present house as being four stories high: a masonry-walled ground floor and three upper floors covered with clapboard.
 If the three-story description is accurate, that could mean the house was later jacked up and the present ground floor built beneath it. Or perhaps the 1860 tax inventory did not count the top level because of its low ceiling. The 1880 tax inventory definitely records the wooden building as being four stories.
 The 1905 census lists the occupants of this and an adjoining brick building as Harry Jarvis, a truck driver; Mary Decker, a bookbinder; and Charles Barshfeld, a coach driver, along with their children and spouses.
 The 1910 census lists six households in place, with occupations like elevated railroad guard, janitor and upholsterer. A 1912 photograph at the New York Public Library shows large ''Junk Shop'' signs on the ground floor, with furniture and other items out on the sidewalk. 
 The building's distinctive look drew the attention of the late Alan Burnham, who was the executive director of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in the 1960's and 70's. Some of his notes in commission files, apparently dating from the 1960's, convey the sense of elation a historian feels when an exciting discovery presents itself.
 Observing the complex pitch of the roof, he wrote that ''this particular type of high-shouldered gambrel may be quite early'' and that he could see the heavy timber construction typical of early buildings. ''I suspect we have something here of considerable antiquity even though so far uptown,'' he wrote. 
 But by 1972 elation gave way to deflation. In a letter to an inquirer, Mr. Burnham wrote: ''I don't wonder that you are intrigued by it. I was too when I first saw it -- hoped it might even be Dutch.'' 
 By then Mr. Burnham had come to the conclusion that the house was of ''no particular antiquity'' and dated from around 1845, although he said the commission still found it ''very interesting.'' It has never been designated a landmark. 
 A photograph from 1980, a year after Patrick and Linda Lyons bought the house for $80,000, shows it with its windows boarded up. They finally moved in three years later, and an article in The New York Times in 1984 reported that only the frame of the house was saved, with most of the roof, siding and windows removed and reproduced. 
 John Sanguiliano, the Lyonses' preservation consultant, said at the time that saw marks on the framing indicated a date no later than 1820 and probably 1790. He said last month that the other finishes removed at the time were consistent with that date. 
 Now the house is owned by Harriet Lembeck, a wine writer and educator, and her husband, William, an engineer. She conducts wine appreciation classes on the ground floor, but rents out the upper floors as a single residence. She and her husband live in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, and would like to take over the upper floors in a few years. 
 The residential portion is all drywall and new flooring -- it might as well be three one-bedrooms in a white-brick apartment house stacked on top of each other, except for the low ceilings on the third floor. 
 If more of the original finishes were in place, it might be possible to conduct modern testing that would date them more closely. If the timber frame were exposed, dendrochronology -- the comparative study of growth rings in tree trunks -- could date the timbers, which might cast light on the age of the building itself. That, of course, would take an extraordinarily curious owner and another gut renovation.
 Diane Jackier, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that it had decided to formally review 203 East 29th Street, and perhaps further research by its staff can resolve some of the mysteries of this curious building.

ALBERTS, WILLIAM W.

 BODY:
 ALBERTS--William W. Age 81, died at his home in Lake Forest Park, Washington, the afternoon of March 28th after a long illness. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from public high school. He was an infantryman in the U.S. Army during World War II and a combat veteran of the Battle of the Ruhr and other action in the European Theater of Operations. 
Dr Alberts took his Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Milton Friedman, Abba Lerner and Frank Knight. He taught Business Economics and Finance at the University of Washington Graduate School of Business from 1967 to 1995. He was known for his rigorous academic standards and his excellence in teaching. In 1978, Dr. Alberts co-founded Marakon Associates, the international management consulting firm described by ''The Economist'' as ''a consultancy that has advised some of the world's most consistently successful companies.'' Marakon now has offices in New York, London, Singapore, Chicago and San Francisco. Dr. Alberts was a driving force in developing the firm's strategy and organizational practice and training the consulting staff. He worked parttime for Marakon while he was on the University of Washington faculty, and fulltime after he retired from teaching, remaining active in the firm until his death.

HEADLINE: Two Years and a Marriage Later

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN. 
E-mail: thehunt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR Josh Lamstein, the hunt for his Fort Greene, Brooklyn, brownstone apartment seemed effortless. His neighbors found the place for him. All he did was say yes.
 Mr. Lamstein, 36, who is from Newton, Mass., lived briefly in downtown Manhattan after finishing business school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He settled in San Francisco to work in venture capital.
In August 2003, just after the big blackout in New York City, Mr. Lamstein and his wife, Sandy, moved from San Francisco to Manhattan so she could attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. With the help of a broker friend, they rented a $3,200-a-month one-bedroom in a small Chelsea brownstone and found themselves fast friends with everyone in the building. 
 Their upstairs neighbors, who had an infant son, were thinking of moving to a bigger place with a yard. They found a lovely brownstone in Fort Greene that was being converted into a two-family condominium, and asked the Lamsteins if they wanted to buy the top unit. They did. 
 ''Essentially, just in looking at the place and understanding how much it would cost on a monthly basis, I jumped on it,'' Mr. Lamstein said. Each unit cost about $1 million. (Mr. Lamstein's unit has three floors and a roof deck; the lower unit has two floors and a garden.)
 The building had been open to the elements, so the owner, Antonio Calvo, a local developer, gutted the interior, said Patrick Brennan, an agent with Aguayo & Huebener. When Mr. Lamstein first saw it, nearly two years ago, it seemed about 95 percent finished. ''The market was so busy that if they waited until it was finished and the owner had an open house, it was likely they would be in a bidding war,'' Mr. Brennan said. 
 So Mr. Lamstein signed the contract and paid a 10 percent deposit. He let the Chelsea lease expire so he would not have to break it later, even though his neighbor -- whose lease had nearly a year left -- warned him the deal would probably take longer than anticipated. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Lamstein's wife was having second thoughts about leaving Manhattan. ''It was a fait accompli at that point, so her telling me wasn't all that positive,'' he said. They put everything in storage but one suitcase each. 
 Mr. Lamstein's previous buying experience had gone smoothly. In the summer of 2001 he was renting in San Francisco's Mission District. Walking to the coin laundry, he saw an open-house sign on a Victorian row house. He checked it out between the wash and dry cycles and bought it for $777,000. ''It seems that I impulse-buy homes,'' he said. 
 Soon afterward he met his wife-to-be at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada. When they moved to New York, he sold the house to a friend for $800,000.
 After they left their Chelsea apartment, the couple stayed first with a friend in SoHo who was temporarily away. The news about the Fort Greene brownstone was always the same, if the developer returned their messages: soon, soon. 
 Mr. Lamstein considered voiding the contract, ''but the calculation in my mind was that the market continued to go up,'' he said. What's more, ''even though this was an incredible hassle, I didn't find a place that appealed to me like this place.''
 They then stayed with a friend in Chelsea who was traveling. When the friend returned, the hunt began in earnest. Mr. Lamstein scoured the Craigslist Web site for furnished short-term places suitable for two people and a toy poodle.
 Timing was important. ''If you started looking around the 15th of the month, the odds were in your favor,'' he said. ''If you started the week before you needed to move, there was a lot available, but there was also a lot of demand.'' (They paid rents of $1,400 to $1,800.)
 They landed a place in the Clinton Hill co-ops, a few blocks from the Fort Greene brownstone. Every night, Mr. Lamstein would walk the dog, Seti, past the house. Just walking by served ''to sort of buck up my spirits, like, ultimately, I am going to end up here,'' he said.
 It was in Clinton Hill that the marriage dissolved. ''The turmoil we went through during the period of homelessness was pretty traumatic,'' he said. His wife returned to California with the dog; the two are now divorced.
 The delays continued. The brownstone's location in the Fort Greene Historic District made for some finicky requirements. The front fence and gate, for example, were not approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Nobody seemed to have meaningful answers for the delays.
 Mr. Calvo, the developer, acknowledged the delays, but said, ''I never promised them any day to move in.'' 
 For Mr. Lamstein, it was back to Craigslist. ''It was like interviewing for a job,'' he said. ''These are people whose homes you are going to be inhabiting.'' 
 Then, last summer, all he could find was a two-week rental in the East 40's. ''I questioned my sanity at times,'' he said. ''It was this complete sense of futility and powerlessness.'' 
 Finally, he had to resort to roommates -- three guys in TriBeCa. ''We were all in the same apartment for economic reasons,'' he said. ''This was when I realized I had sunk to the lowest of the low. Man, I am 36 years old and living with three guys.'' 
 Mr. Brennan, the real estate agent, finally went to the Department of Buildings to sort out what remained to be done. The developer ''was very convincing but at a certain point we crossed this bridge where we knew we couldn't trust him anymore,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''I was the guy in the middle who looked really stupid.'' 
 At last, after well over a year, Mr. Lamstein closed on his new home. He got a dog, a wheaten terrier named Bella. The friendship with the neighbors from Chelsea, who now share the Fort Greene house, survived.
 ''It made me so happy to finally move in that when anything goes wrong'' -- the roof had a leak, which led to a buckled floor -- he is annoyed. ''It's like I went through Odysseus's journey and everything is supposed to be perfect now.''
 Still, he said, ''I have way too much house for a single guy and a dog, so I have been debating whether to sell the place. But I decided I want to make a commitment to it.'' Actually, he couldn't sell if he wanted to. The building has received only a temporary certificate of occupancy. It is still awaiting approval of the front fence from the Landmarks Commission, though the agency says the developer has not yet filed the paperwork.

BYLINE: By Charles Isherwood

 BODY:

This week, New York stages are affording writers, producers and directors opportunities to try on different hats and stretch new muscles. Three new Off Broadway productions find a stage actor writing a play, a major director presenting one and a prominent screenwriter and film director writing for the stage. 


Opening Sunday night on Playwrights Horizons' second stage is a new play by DAVID MARSHALL GRANT. Mr. Grant, a Tony nominee as an actor for ''Angels in America,'' has pursued a small sideline in playwriting. His third play, ''PEN,'' is about a wheelchair-bound mother who can't let go of her college-bound son. Starring as the needy mama is the wonderfully versatile Off Broadway veteran J. SMITH-CAMERON. 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; $45.

Beginning Tuesday, MIKE NICHOLS's name appears on another New York theater marquee, or rather it would if the tiny Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village had a marquee. Mr. Nichols, the director of Broadway's Python-athon ''Spamalot,'' is presenting ''ON THE LINE,'' a new play by JOE ROLAND. Mr. Roland, who is also an actor, studied with Mr. Nichols and others at the New Actors Workshop. ''On the Line'' is a comic drama about the evolving relationship among three friends. 38 Commerce Street, (212) 239-6200; $36.

PAUL WEITZ makes his second appearance as a writer for the stage in two seasons with ''SHOW PEOPLE,'' a comedy about a couple of chronically unemployed Broadway actors who enter the employ of a prominent banker. Mr. Weitz is best known as a film writer and director. ''American Dreamz,'' the follow-up to his underappreciated movie ''In Good Company,'' hits screens this spring. DEBRA MONK, LAWRENCE PRESSMAN, TY BURRELL and JUDY GREER make up the cast of ''Show People.'' Opens Thursday at the Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422; $52 and $65.

HEADLINE: Buenos Aires

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- Four years after its currency crash and one year after a nightclub fire claimed 194 lives, Argentina's capital has recovered a lot of its swagger and fun. The populist President Nestor Kirchner's early payoff of Argentina's International Monetary Fund debt, and less-than-friendly treatment of President Bush at the Summit of the Americas in November, played well in a country tired of international advice, and in last October's midterm elections Mr. Kirchner's mascara-caked wife, Cristina, won a senate seat amid a wave of Evita nostalgia. The economy is booming, too: After hitting bottom in 2002, it bounced back in 2004 and 2005, a turnaround that is visible in the sheer number of new apartment towers and clothing stores popping up in the trendy Palermo area. And yet it is still shockingly inexpensive, with first-rate meals rarely costing more than 78 pesos a person, or $25 at 3.14 Argentine pesos to $1. 
 During this recovery, international skepticism about the local economy has meant that the exchange rate has actually improved for American travelers, with the peso recently falling to a three-year low against the dollar. The downside is that there has been a surge in the cost of living in a land as famous for its explosive inflation as for its huge steaks. With the economic boom predicted to continue for 2006, travelers might be advised to visit before inflation makes Argentina no longer the eye-popping bargain it has been since 2002. 

WHERE TO STAY -- The luxurious Recoleta neighborhood, with its famous mausoleum-stacked cemetery and obsession with doorman-polished brass, has long been anchored by the Louis XIV-style Alvear Palace Hotel; Avenida Alvear 1891; (54-11) 4808-2100; www.alvearpalace.com. (The country and city code for Buenos Aires is 54-11.) But the glitzy 74-year-old institution -- with 210 rooms, tea from 4 to 7 p.m., Hermes toiletries and doubles starting at $385 plus 21 percent tax -- will get stiff competition in late June when the 165-room Palacio Duhau-Park Hyatt Buenos Aires (Avenida Alvear 1661; 5171-1234; www.buenosaires.park.hyatt.com) opens two blocks away. There, a garden links the renovated Duhau family mansion, built in 1934 and inspired by Chateau Le Marais in France, with a contemporary addition. Prices for deluxe rooms are tentatively set at $410, plus tax.
 Trendier Palermo's anywhere-but-here barrios, Palermo SoHo, Hollywood and, yes, Queens, are home to new design-conscious, Wi-Fi-outfitted boutique hotels. Across the tracks in Palermo Hollywood sits the Hotel Home (Honduras 5860; 4778-1008; www.homebuenosaires.com). Opened in December by the English music producer Tom Rixton and his wife, Patricia O'Shea, the 17-room Home has Scandinavian-style furniture and vintage wallpapers, a spa and garden pool. Rooms start at $115, plus tax. 

WHERE TO EAT -- Recently, a wave of starkly designed restaurants has carved a nouvelle Argentine cuisine from the traditional steak-and-pasta diet. Leading the pack is the always-full Sucre (Sucre 676; 4782-9082; www.sucrerestaurant.com.ar; lunch and dinner daily), with the local uber-chef Fernando Trocca at the helm. Dishes like leg of lamb with rosemary and mint (27 pesos) are consistently excellent, but the cavernous concrete space can leave some cold despite the huge fireplace. The recently opened Mott (El Salvador 4685; 4833-4306, breakfast, lunch and dinner daily) sweetly updates the trend in a heaven-white box with many of Sucre's design elements. There, Maria Lancio's kitchen turns out interesting dishes like sweet-and-pungent fruit and mushroom risotto (24 pesos) and a tender lamb ragout with pumpkin tart (29 pesos).
 Buenos Aires, of course, is beef-crazed, and Cabana Las Lilas (Avenida Alicia Moreau de Justo 516; 4313-1336; www.laslilas.com), based in the tourist-packed Puerto Madero port, is arguably its most famous, and expensive, purveyor, where a T-bone steak costs 49 pesos. Across the street from the soccer coliseum known as La Bombonera sits the classic Don Carlos (Brandsen 699; 4362-2433; closed Sunday and during soccer games), where the waiters bring a seemingly endless variety of dishes, from spinach fritters to steak, and the only ordering you do is answering Don Carlos's one question: ''Meats or pastas?'' Lunch comes to about 35 pesos a person; no credit cards. 
 For an update on parrillas, barbecue restaurants where more than a quarter of the patrons might actually speak Spanish, try La Dorita (Humboldt 1905 & 1892; 4773-0070; www.parrillaladorita.com.ar), lunch and dinner daily, where a photographic take on the Last Supper as an Argentine BBQ overlooks diners drinking wine served in traditional penguin-shaped carafes and eating veal sweetbreads (12 pesos) and lomo, or tenderloin (20 pesos for two people).

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- With relatively few must-see sites besides the Casa Rosada, the Obelisk, Recoleta Cemetery and Teatro Colon (closing in late October for renovation), a visit to Buenos Aires tends to be less about ogling architecture than absorbing culture. You can join those who pass the day in a park with ice cream or mate, the local herbal tea -- start with a cone of frutilla granizada at Persicco, Salguero and Cabello (www.persicco.com), one of the best of the city's innumerable Italian-named ice cream shops. From there, stake out Las Heras Park, Avenida Las Heras and Avenida Coronel Diaz, where an array of dog walkers and bikini-clad (male and female) sunbathers attest to Argentines' twin loves, sometimes simultaneous, of canines and bronzing.
 Then stroll the embassy and jacaranda-lined Avenida del Libertador to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Avenida del Libertador 1473; 4803-0802; www.mnba.org.ar; closed Mondays; free). The Buenos Aires art world got an upgrade in November, when works by Cezanne, Gauguin and Renoir, stolen from Bellas Artes on Christmas in 1980 and found in Paris in 2002, were returned and joined works ranging from Manet to Rothko.
 ''El estress'' is a constant topic among Portenos (Buenos Aires residents), and many nearby estancias (ranches) offer half-day escapes from the city for those needing to unwind. A ''Dia de Campo'' at the 1880 Italianate estancia built for General Pablo Ricchieri (Estancia El Ombu; Ruta 31, cuartel VI, Villa Lia; San Antonio de Areco; 4710-2795; www.estanciaelombu.com) includes gut-busting amounts of wine and gaucho-cooked meat, swimming in two pools and horseback rides on its 740 acres. A day costs $45 a person; $110, double occupancy, for a day and night (meals included). 

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- As Buenos Aires night life starts vampirically late, a predinner cocktail or snack is advisable. Barring one of the regular openings at Malba (Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires), where free wine brings out a large portion of the city's art students, there's El Diamante (Malabia 1688, second floor; 4831-5735; closed Sundays). Co-created by Sucre's Fernando Trocca just over a year ago, the plant-filled roof deck on the Paraguayan-themed bar fills on Fridays and Saturdays with the young and well-dressed drinking concoctions like the capizen (vodka, ginger and hesperidina); 12 pesos.
 After dinner, Las Canitas's young and affluent crowd the popular new Kandi (Baez 340; 4772-2453), which has a loungy vibe and retro Brady Bunch decorations. For tango, the city's many choreographed shows can be entertaining, albeit overpriced. Travelers who want to participate should head to the 10:30 p.m. Friday or Saturday beginners classes (9:30 on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday) at La Viruta (6 pesos), curiously located in the basement of the city's Armenian cultural center (Armenia 1366; 4774-6357; www.lavirutatango.com). After lessons, the dancing continues until 6 a.m. 
 Decorated with bright red walls, minichandeliers and white leather lounge chairs, the year-old Bulnes Class (Bulnes 1250; 4861-7492; www.bulnesclass.com.ar; Thursday to Saturday from 11 p.m. on) fills with a young gay male crowd looking for something more relaxed than the nightclubs. 

WHERE TO SHOP -- For shoes, Marina Palmer, the author of the 2005 memoir ''Kiss and Tango: Looking for Love in Buenos Aires,'' recommends the tango dancer Alicia Muniz's intimate Comme Il Faut (Arenales 1239; 4815-5690). The tiny leopard-skin-decorated store, upstairs on a small Recoleta alley, specializes in sexy tango shoes with stiletto heels of at least 2 3/4 inches (about 260 pesos).
 Named the first Unesco City of Design last August, Buenos Aires takes its presentation seriously. The Colegiales neighborhood's Dorrego market, at Dorrego and Zapiola (check Centro Metropolitano de Diseno, www.cmd.gov.ar, for details), a converted garage, regularly houses shows of local housewares and clothing designers. Nearby Palermo SoHo is packed with shops selling clothes by young Argentine designers. Felix (Gurruchaga 1670; 4832-2994; www.felixba.com.ar) hits a Williamsburg-goes-B.A. vibe, with stylish sneakers (219 to 239 pesos) and retro T-shirts (65 pesos). 

YOUR FIRST TIME OR THE 10TH -- See a soccer game. Argentina's soul bleeds for the sport, and the most fearsome rivalry is that between Boca Juniors and River Plate. If you can, go to one of the biannual Superclasicos between the two teams. The near-riot experience is really about watching passionate fandom, learning the songs and taunts, and discovering why visiting-team fans get a 30-minute head start after a game (their safety). Tickets to a Superclasico, usually scalped via a hotel concierge or ticket broker, run around 300 pesos. La Bombonera, home of the Boca Juniors, is a place of soccer legend (Brandsen 805; 4309-4700).

HOW TO GET THERE -- There are nonstop flights between Buenos Aires and major cities like New York, Miami, Houston and Washington. Depending on the season, a nonstop American Airlines coach seat to Ezeiza International Airport (Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini de Ezeiza) from Kennedy Airport in New York is about $750 to $1,000 (specials often available) and takes about 10 hours and 30 minutes. The taxi from the airport runs about 60 pesos.

HOW TO GET AROUND -- The easiest way to get around is via the huge fleet of yellow and black taxis; a trip across town will rarely cost more than 15 pesos. More independent visitors can take the subte (subway) or one of the careening city buses. For a transit and street map, buy a pocket-size ''Guia T'' (about 3 pesos) at a newspaper kiosk.

HEADLINE: Who Is a South African? At Last, Someone Who Dances

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
''I WILL kill you all!'' shouted a man clutching a small Bible in the midst of the audience on the final night of the Dance Umbrella festival here late last month. He was ignored at first, assumed to be part of Sello Pesa's ''Thapo,'' which began with the audience invited onstage to witness an image of death, as one man rolled another into a carpet. But as audience members returned to their seats, the shouter continued to rant. A few minutes later, he was escorted from the theater.
 The audience's assumption was not much of a stretch. Despite South Africa's peaceful transformation from the apartheid regime to democracy in 1994, the country is still dealing with the difficulties of racial integration, wildly disparate lifestyles of poverty and luxury, and a population ravaged by AIDS, domestic violence, high unemployment and an elevated rate of violent crime. The man's declamations might have referred to any or all of those issues, since several of them were persistent themes at Dance Umbrella, the most important platform for contemporary dance on the African continent. 
In the 18 years since its inception, the festival has produced a number of choreographers who have established themselves on the international circuit, including Robin Orlin, Boyzie Cekwana and Vincent Sekwati Koko Mantsoe. It has also created an artistic community of contemporary dancers and dance-makers, serving as a means for South African artists to express hopes and fears about their society in ways that were often not condoned elsewhere.
 ''The evolution has been enormous,'' Adrienne Sichel, the dance and theater critic for the Johannesburg newspaper The Star, who was instrumental in founding the festival, said in an interview. ''It first happened in a very different society in a different country. The first years were created in isolation. We were not even part of Africa then, let alone the wider world.''
 The tale was told at Dance Umbrella's 18th-anniversary gala, held midway through the three-week event. The festival came about when Phillip Stein, whose company, Vita Promotions, ran an arts awards program financed by an insurance company, discovered that he had a little extra money in his budget. He asked Ms. Sichel and another journalist, Marilyn Jenkins, if they had any ideas. ''Let's have a festival like Jacob's Pillow,'' Ms. Jenkins is supposed to have said. 
 The first Dance Umbrella, held in February 1989 on a minuscule budget of less than $500, wasn't much like Jacob's Pillow. Unlike that festival in Massachusetts (and most others), it was not curated. It simply offered a platform for any company that wished to perform, using the stage at the University of the Witwatersrand theater here and covering modest production costs. 
 ''The decision was taken during a traumatic era in our history,'' Ms. Sichel and Ms. Jenkins wrote in a Dance Umbrella souvenir program in 1998, ''during states of emergency when it was not unusual for artists to be seen to be consorting with the enemy or the state, to be assaulted or even have their homes burnt down.''
 The festival nonetheless attracted 14 entries, many from participants who had never set foot on a stage, and enthusiastic audiences. In 1990, 69 choreographers applied. By 1993, there were 91 pieces on the program, and Mr. Stein had enlisted First National Bank, one of the country's major financial institutions, as the primary benefactor. This was no mean feat. Sports receive a lot of sponsorship from private enterprise in South Africa, but financing for the arts rarely comes from big business. 
 Although Mr. Stein retired in 2003, his work has had long-lasting effects. First National Bank is still the primary source of financial support for the festival, which today has a budget of around $320,000 and is officially named the FNB Dance Umbrella. (Other principal sources of financing are the national lottery fund, the regional department of Arts and Culture and the cultural departments of a number of European embassies.) ''No one has ever acknowledged what Phillip has done for dance in this country,'' said Georgina Thomson, the artistic director of Dance Umbrella. ''In the case of Dance Umbrella, he enabled a whole artistic field to exist.''
 Contemporary dance did exist in South Africa before Dance Umbrella, but it consisted of a few companies sporadically producing work in the late 1970's and early 80's. That they existed at all now seems a minor miracle: these companies were multiracial and often politically provocative at a time of extensive repression of any form of protest; lavish state financing for dance went almost exclusively to four national ballet companies; and South Africa was effectively cut off from the influences of the international artistic community through sanctions.
 Two decades later, the country had passed through the looking glass. By the time Ms. Thomson took over from Dance Umbrella's first director, Nicola Danby, in 1997, the festival was showing 200 works over two weeks, some of them by choreographers from other countries, African as well as European. It was both exhilarating and chaotic, with everything from community groups to professionals, classical Indian dance to avant-garde performance art, on its marathon grab-bag programs. Traditional African dances were presented back to back with ballet or integrated into contemporary dance forms, raising questions in the giddy years after Nelson Mandela was elected president: who is African, and what does it mean to be African? 
 In artistic and social terms, it is still a relevant question. Most of the choreographers and dancers at Dance Umbrella are black; most of the audience is, too. In demographic terms, that is as it should be: blacks represent nearly 80 percent of the country's population.
 But it is also surprising, and heartening, given South Africa's recent history. Few black South Africans had access to theater, opera, classical music or dance during the apartheid years, and the performance arts are still another world for millions who live in poverty. Even those who were introduced to dance, like Mr. Cekwana, the choreographer, were often regarded with suspicion in their own communities. ''There were those who regarded my involvement in 'Eurocentric' styles such as ballet as being counterrevolutionary,'' Mr. Cekwana said in a 2004 interview with Drum magazine.
 Despite these obstacles, a generation of South African choreographers have come of age over the last decade, bolstered by Dance Umbrella commissions, residencies and workshops. And to judge from this year's festival, they are melding traditional dances, modern dance techniques, ballet and township forms like mapantsula and kwaito often to fascinating effect.
 In Mr. Mantsoe's ''Men-Jaro,'' traditional African dance motifs, like Zulu indlamu stamps, are transformed into more abstract movement in a sophisticated meditation on the relationship between ritual and art, beautifully echoed by Anthony Caplan's modern score for traditional African instruments. In Mxolisi George Khumalo's ''Living on a Construction Site,'' an uncompromising female duo suggested mental isolation and contemporary anomie through obsessively repetitive, inventively disjointed vocabulary. These pieces were among the 12 commissioned by the festival in a departure from the open policy that has reduced the number of works to around 100 each year, shown over three weeks.
 ''It seemed clear that the festival needed more artistic direction,'' said Ms. Thomson, who changed the open program policy in 1998. ''We now commission up to 12 works each year and try toprogram other established choreographers on programs with the commissions. For the youth and community groups, we have the Stepping Stones programs, which show about 60 works over two days.''
 The issue of African, or South African, identity in contemporary dance is a complex one, said Ms. Thomson, a tall, phlegmatic redhead who runs Dance Umbrella (and another dance festival, in August). ''I don't think you can decide what is African dance -- there are so many ways that people work here -- and I don't think that there is overt pressure to show African identity in the work,'' she said. ''At the same time, there is still a resistance to ballet training in some quarters, and there is a subtle pressure in terms of state funding, which tends to go to the traditional dance ensembles..''
 The lack of official recognition of the relevance and popularity of contemporary dance is just one of its problems. 
 ''Apart from Dance Umbrella, there is very little infrastructure in South Africa,'' said David April, the artistic director of Moving Into Dance, one of the country's most established companies. ''We have very little chance to perform around the country, because theaters are so expensive to hire; there are no residencies at universities; and we lose a lot of wonderful dancers to overseas or commercial shows because it's so hard to make a living.''
 Ms. Thomson is guardedly optimistic about the future, and she is also working hard to raise funds for a physical space that choreographers could use to create and collaborate with companies, dancers and teachers from abroad. Meanwhile, Dance Umbrella offers an intensely hopeful vision of an integrated, evolving South African society, asking itself intelligent questions and coming up with complex answers.

HEADLINE: Case Study: Fix a Baseball Team

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: St. Petersburg, Fla. 

 BODY:
IT has been a rough first inning for Andrew E. Friedman, the cherubic-faced 29-year-old general manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Opening day looms, and one of his best young pitchers has been lit up for four runs while his third baseman has booted one ball and overthrown another. Business as usual, it would seem, for the bumbling Devil Rays, long a doormat for the powerful big-budget teams in the American League East. 
 Just over two years ago, Mr. Friedman was a junior banker toiling for an obscure private equity firm in New Jersey. Now, perched on the edge of his seat behind home plate at a spring training game here in St. Petersburg, his poker face intact, he is scanning his BlackBerry for trade offers and checking pitch counts.
Then Carl Crawford, the Devil Rays' star left fielder, whom Mr. Friedman signed to a long-term contract last year, lines a pitch into the gap in right field. As Crawford tears around the bases, pushing for a rare inside-the-park-home run, Mr. Friedman's cheeks begin to flush. The small crowd roars, and for a moment he is a fan again. ''Go four,'' Mr. Friedman shouts, and that is just what the speedy Crawford does, beating the throw home with a deft slide past the catcher. 
 In the past, Mr. Friedman, who began his career as an investment banker at Bear Stearns in New York, gave vent to his baseball passions by playing fantasy baseball, poring over the box scores of his hometown team, the Houston Astros, and taking in the occasional Mets game. Today, fantasy has turned into reality for Mr. Friedman, whose official title with the Devil Rays is executive vice president for baseball operations.
 Mr. Friedman is part of a new management group that assumed control of the team last fall. Led by Stuart L. Sternberg, the principal owner, who is a former Goldman Sachs executive, it is aiming to road-test its collective Wall Street wisdom in the foggy realm of Major League Baseball economics. Rounding out the front office is Matthew P. Silverman, 29, the team's president, who had been a junior investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
 While the Devil Rays would lose this spring training game, Carl Crawford's audacious tour of the bases offered a tantalizing taste of how sweet life could be if the team's crop of cheap young talent ever did jell.
 AT $35 million, the Devil Rays' payroll is less than one-fifth that of the New York Yankees. And it is $4 million less than the four-year contract that the Yankees awarded to Carl Pavano, a free-agent pitcher who won but four games for them last year. But as the gap between baseball's haves and have-nots continues to widen, more attention is being paid to the quantitative, statistics-based methods of talent assessment popularized by a new breed of baseball executives with Ivy League degrees instead of years of experience in the major leagues. 
 With its reliance on financial models and data mining, this new approach has been compared to the financial markets, but few of today's practitioners had any real-world Wall Street experience until the new Tampa Bay crew came along. 
 In 2004, Mr. Sternberg and five other former senior partners from Spear Leeds & Kellogg bought a majority stake in the Devil Rays; they paid $50 million to $60 million in cash, in addition to assuming debt. Four years earlier, Spear, then the largest specialist trader on the New York Stock Exchange, was sold to Goldman Sachs for $6.5 billion. The six partners collectively owned a minority stake in Spear. It was a trade that has entered Wall Street annals: not only did they sell high, before a spate of scandals rocked the stock exchange, but they sold well, having been paid with Goldman Sachs stock that is trading near its all-time high.
 Mr. Sternberg's love for baseball is deep-rooted if not obsessive, and it dates back to his childhood in Brooklyn, when he followed the Mets. He named his first-born son after his idol, Sandy Koufax, and his e-mail address is BaseballDad32 (in honor of Koufax's jersey number). When Mr. Sternberg was shown the precarious finances of the Devil Rays, he was immediately intrigued -- notwithstanding the fact that he knew less about the Devil Rays than he did about any other major league team.
 ''We said, 'This is horrible,' and when I hear 'horrible,' I go 'ooooooh,' '' he said, letting out a slow hoot of delight as he sat with Mr. Friedman and Mr. Silverman in an office overlooking the Devil Rays outfield at Tropicana Park. ''I'm a buy-low guy, and if you pay the right price for something, I don't care what it is, you can't go very wrong.''
 No one disputes that Mr. Sternberg and his group bought low; some might even say that he has caught himself a falling knife. In operation since 1998, the Devil Rays have finished last in their division every year except one, and in 2005 the team was ranked last in terms of value among major league ball clubs, at $176 million, according to Forbes magazine. The Devil Rays, who play in a dreary concrete dome and carry the name of an ungainly bottom-dwelling sea creature, became a symbol for fan torpor and overall poor management under the leadership of their former managing partner, Vincent J. Naimoli. 
 None of this has deterred Mr. Sternberg, 46, an inveterate positive thinker. He bounces around the premises with a sputtering vibe of boyish glee that outshines even that of his two teenage sons, who trail his every step. Noticing that his sons are taking batting practice on the empty field below, he jumps up from an interview and yells from an open window: ''Come on, hit the thing will ya?''
 Indeed, there is a distinct boys-club feel to the slap-happy camaraderie that binds Mr. Sternberg to his two young executives. It mixes the testosterone of the Wall Street trading floor with the geekiness of those who spend an inordinate amount of time breaking down earned-run averages. Mr. Friedman's dogged pursuit of a little-known pitcher on an opposing team, for example, has become a standing joke among the three. ''He doesn't even pitch,'' Mr. Sternberg snorts. Mr. Silverman chimes in: ''It's a mancrush.'' On occasion, even Mr. Sternberg's sons weigh in on personnel matters, and they twit Mr. Friedman for being less than enthusiastic about their own favorite players.
 When asked about his young executives' slight baseball resumes, Mr. Sternberg makes no apologies and draws a comparison to his days as a trader. ''On Wall Street, you want younger, hungry people out there,'' he said, going so far as to claim that Mr. Friedman's inexperience may even be an advantage. ''If people feel there is a trade to be made, they will find your number in a hurry -- and they would probably rather call Andrew as opposed to John Schuerholz,'' he said, invoking the name of the veteran general manager of the Atlanta Braves, ''so it may create opportunity.''
 The origins of this unusual threesome go back to Mr. Sternberg's first days at Goldman, after it bought Spear. Mr. Silverman, who joined the Goldman training program in 1998 just after getting his degree in economics from Harvard, was assigned to work on various mergers with Mr. Sternberg. 
 WHILE the two did not chalk up any market-moving deals, they did spend countless hours talking baseball. In 2002, Mr. Sternberg left Goldman with the still-nascent idea of someday owning a team. Mr. Silverman, who by then had come to see Mr. Sternberg as a mentor, left soon after to work on a novel loosely based on his relationship with his father.
 Like Mr. Friedman and Mr. Sternberg, Mr. Silverman is a certifiable baseball geek; he grew up in Dallas cheering for the Texas Rangers and the Chicago Cubs. In 2003, some 60,000 words into his novel, he got a call from Mr. Sternberg, who said that he had an opportunity to buy a controlling stake in the Devil Rays. Mr. Silverman put his novel on hold, pulled out of his fantasy baseball league and began plugging Devil Rays data into his old Goldman Sachs spreadsheet. The numbers were ugly, but the upside, in the view of the two men, was immeasurable. To say nothing of the fun they would have.
 With his slacks and blue blazer, Mr. Silverman may dress like a middle-aged man, but his fresh face and jokey manner suggest someone who has to produce a driver's license when he goes out for a beer. Indeed, an elder business colleague from Texas once told him that he had cowboy boots older than Mr. Silverman.
 As president, Mr. Silverman is responsible for the business side of Mr. Sternberg's venture, and he has the unenviable task of squeezing revenue out of the Devil Rays' enervated business model. But he has moved quickly, commissioning a $10 million refurbishment of Tropicana Park, including the installation of flat-screen TV's in the corridors and the overhaul of the public restrooms. 
 ''It's not about flash,'' he said. ''It's about building a business on the baseball side that matches our growth on the business side. It's that convergence that will hopefully make us a successful organization.''
 A bolder move may be in the works. He and Mr. Sternberg are considering doing away with the team's nickname, colors and logo, in order to break from its less than glorious past. 
 Despite its deep pockets, Mr. Sternberg's group has made it clear that there will be no big free-agent signings and that the investment focus will be on cultivating the team's roster of promising young players that include Crawford, the smooth center fielder Rocco Baldelli and the power-hitting second baseman Jorge Cantu. 
 Mr. Friedman, who attended Tulane on a baseball scholarship, spices his language with Wall Street jargon like ''mark-to-market accounting'' and ''positive arbitrage'' in describing how he expects to get the most out of his roster. While the Devil Rays' payroll of $35 million puts the team at the bottom of the league, for example, Mr. Friedman uses the mark-to-market method -- which allows a Wall Street trader to value a security in his portfolio at the current market price, not the price he paid for it -- to gauge his team's real worth. 
 Applying that notion to baseball allows Mr. Friedman to attach a market value of perhaps $7 million to Scott Kazmir, the team's star pitcher, who is actually on his payroll for $370,000 a year. Luckily for them, most of the players on the team are contract-bound to salaries lower than what they might command on the open market. The bottom line is this: Mr. Friedman reckons that the real value of the Devil Rays' payroll is closer to $50 million.
 Such valuation discrepancies also inform Mr. Friedman's approach to trading players. ''I am purely market driven,'' he said. ''I love players I think that I can get for less than they are worth. It's positive arbitrage, the valuation asymmetry in the game.'' As an example, he cites the young pitcher he desperately covets. He likes the pitcher not so much for his stats and scouting reports, which do have their allure, but because the other team does not appreciate his true worth.
 High-minded thinking, to be sure. But while such a quantitative approach has been made famous by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's, it also cannot be a substitute for old-fashioned scouting and talent assessment, an area that the Devil Rays also want to strengthen.
 A few months ago, the three men put their philosophy to work and made their first big trade, exchanging their all-star closer, Danys Baez, for two untested starting pitchers from the Los Angeles Dodgers, Edwin Jackson and Chuck Tiffany. 
 Baez was a desirable asset. He was coming off a great year and was in line to command a large contract this year, a player who arguably had approached his true market value; the two starting pitchers were top prospects in the Dodgers organization, although Jackson's star had dimmed in recent years.
 The Devil Rays, however, are betting that the two prospects will flower into top-rated starting pitchers -- perhaps the most elusive and highly valued commodity in baseball today. All the same, it was a risky gambit, and while Mr. Friedman said that his nerves were fine, Mr. Sternberg acknowledged some uneasiness in his belly.
 ''On Wall Street you can find out very quickly if you are right or wrong,'' Mr. Sternberg said as the team prepared for its season opener tomorrow, at Baltimore. ''I own I.B.M. at 100 and now it's 97. That does not exist here. In the deal with Baez, there is no question that on April 3 we are worse off. But it also makes the organization better in the future.''
 FOR all this talk of mark-to-market and positive arbitrage, there are some people in the Devil Rays organization who believe that there are simpler ways to assess baseball talent. Sitting in the dugout on a cool spring evening, Don Zimmer, 75, a senior coach for the team who is starting his 57th consecutive year in baseball as a player, coach or manager, is one such man. 
 With his watery blue eyes and bulging red cheeks, he is the very picture of old-school baseball thinking, and he has little use for computers, economic models or other modern appurtenances. ''When I watch a pitcher, I know if he is slow to the plate or not,'' Zimmer said. ''I don't need no stopwatch.''
 He describes a ''heated argument'' with Mr. Friedman the day before, as different factions of the team's baseball staff debated which players to keep and which to send down to the minor leagues. ''I've had a lot of people say to me, 'What do these kids know? They look like they are 20 years old,' '' Zimmer said. ''How much baseball will they grasp?'' 
 Looking out on his young players taking infield practice, he pauses, then adds: ''Stu Sternberg is no dummy and he must think they will grasp a lot. I say, give them a chance.''

HEADLINE: Hand in Hand, Over the Precipice

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR years, thoughtful people yearned for labor and management in the United States to work in concert rather than at loggerheads. If only workers and auto companies could row in unison, the thinking went, Detroit might at last be able to compete against the Japanese.
 As it turns out, workers and managers in the American auto industry have been rowing in unison, albeit directly toward the cataract. Giving new meaning to the term ''labor-management cooperation,'' union leaders and General Motors executives joined forces years ago. However unwittingly, they have been working hand in glove ever since to wreck the place. Bringing G.M. to its knees is a big job, after all, and neither side could have done it alone. Only by working together not to rock the boat has it been possible to steer such a dominant player aground, deprive future generations of jobs and profits and send entire cities into extended decline. It's enough to make you wonder if we might have been better off with more old-fashioned labor strife. 
Consider Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker. It went through years of ugly conflict with the United Automobile Workers union during the 1990's, only to emerge a stronger company for employees and shareholders alike. It now has a market capitalization of $51 billion -- versus just $12 billion for G.M. 
 Of course, it's hard at G.M. to distinguish cooperation from folie a deux. G.M. signed labor agreements over the years that left the company paying a remarkable $74 an hour, including benefits and retiree costs, for its domestic factory workers. The company even set up a ''job bank,'' a mechanism to pay laid-off workers not to work. These agreements weren't only expensive; I suspect that they helped to foster a risk-averse culture that made it harder for G.M. to cope with change.
 For students of management, an interesting question is why the company agreed to such things in the first place. The answer is, because it was easy: G.M.'s well-paid managers had every incentive to buy short-term labor peace at the expense of long-term viability (for the company as well as for G.M. cities like Flint, Mich.). The company was flush, and if things went bad, well, the managers who signed these contracts would have long since retired to Arizona. 
 An equally intriguing question is whether the U.A.W. has any sense of its own part in this mad tango. What if you could go back in time and show union workers and leaders that since 1985, the number of hourly factory workers at G.M.'s American plants would fall to just 113,000 from 457,000? You can't blame a union for getting whatever it can for its workers, but imagine if, a generation ago, the U.A.W. had sought and accepted an actual ownership stake in G.M. instead of untenably high wages and costly benefits. As owners, the workers would have enjoyed a share in the profits. And they might have been more careful to avoid killing the goose that laid the golden egg. They might have even prodded management to run the company more effectively in the face of competition from Japan. 
 Instead, G.M. workers have enjoyed full partnership in an astonishing decline, one that has been duplicated across the unionized industrial landscape. Fifty years ago, unions represented nearly 35 percent of the private-sector work force. Today the proportion is under 8 percent. Labor leaders have surely also noticed that many of the most heavily unionized sectors of the economy -- automobiles, airlines, newspapers and public schools, to name just a few -- are those having perhaps the most difficulty adapting to life in the 21st century. 
 Can this be a coincidence, or is there something about the cumulative effect of union agreements that, over time, promotes a creeping -- and potentially deadly -- ossification? It's not noticeable at first: when unions organize entire industries, no one company is at a competitive disadvantage. But that is before outsiders like Toyota come along.
 As it turns out, G.M. workers got what amounts to an unofficial ownership stake anyway, via their enormous claims on the company's future earnings. But that stake isn't worth much, given G.M.'s prospects, which may yet include bankruptcy. 
 Now, in addition to paying workers not to work, the company says it will offer them good money to quit. Expect the most capable to leave, as they always do when companies offer voluntary buyouts. But, hey, that's O.K. As long as labor and management keep working together, everything will be just fine.

HEADLINE: Death by Smiley Face: When Rivals Disdain Profit

BYLINE: By Richard Siklos

 BODY:
THE tectonic changes facing media companies are by now the topic of an often-recited sermon. Put briefly, digital technology is placing control over much information squarely in the hands of consumers and creating all kinds of opportunities for new entrants who can push the revolution forward. 
 Understandably, attention in this race is focused on the companies that are, as the management consultants like to say, transferring value from conventional outlets to new disruptors that deliver personalized media more efficiently and hence with greater profitability. In other words, to the victor go the spoils.
The obvious standouts are Google and Yahoo with their aggregation software, prominent brands and ability to layer advertisements all over the Internet and perhaps beyond; or Apple Computer with its iTunes and iPod and their utter dominance over portable music. 
 Consider Monster Worldwide, the online employment advertising company, where the numbers tell the story: Monster, the owner of the www.monster.com site, has a stock market value of $6.2 billion, some 40 percent greater than the amount for which Knight Ridder, the newspaper chain owner, is being sold. But Monster has only one-third of Knight Ridder's $3 billion in annual revenue. 
 There is another breed of rival lurking online for traditional media, and it is perhaps the most vexing yet: call it purpose-driven media, with a shout-out to Rick Warren, the author of ''A Purpose-Driven Life,'' for borrowing his catchphrase.
 These are new-media ventures that leave the competition scratching their heads because they don't really aim to compete in the first place; their creators are merely taking advantage of the economics of the online medium to do something that they feel good about. They would certainly like to cover their costs and maybe make a buck or two, but really, they're not in it for the money. By purely commercial measures, they are illogical. If your name were, say, Rupert or Sumner, they would represent the kind of terror that might keep you up at night: death by smiley face. 
 Probably the best-known practitioner is Craigslist.org, the online listing site. Although it is routinely described as a competitor with -- and the bane of -- newspaper classified ads, the site is mostly a free listings service that acts as a community resource. When the company contemplates imposing fees for using its site in a particular city, as it has recently in New York, it does so cautiously and thoughtfully, as a means to weed out real estate brokers who are abusing the site by posting their ads over and over. 
 The twist about Craigslist and its ilk is that their egalitarianism could make them very valuable someday -- although Craigslist's founder, Craig Newmark, has proclaimed no interest in cashing in. EBay, no doubt sensing the commercial potential, bought a 25 percent stake from a former employee last year. Other examples are the ''for sale by owner'' Web sites that have cropped up across the country, in which people can sell their homes at a cost that is a small fraction of the usual broker's fee. 
 And let's not forget that Google began life as one of these ventures: it was only a handful of years ago that one of Google's founders quaintly decried the evils of advertising before figuring out a do-gooder way (as they saw it) to sell boatloads of it. 
 Now Google, with its market valuation of more than $100 billion, has drawn the ire of the newspaper and book publishing industries, among others, which argue that its supposedly benevolent search robots have been usurping their intellectual property.
 Purpose-driven media, by the way, are even more common in the software world. The shining example is the Firefox browser that is available free for download and has emerged as a credible rival to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. And, for icing on the cake, Firefox makes money for its not-for-profit owners because Google pays to be its search engine. 
 Another example of genius ideas from people who don't seek Internet riches is Chowhound.com. This nine-year-old site features community-generated restaurant review boards in various cities and steadfastly refuses to accept restaurant advertising. Rather than continue to grovel for donations and make a few dollars selling Chowhound books, the founders sold the company last month to CNET Networks, a Web business known for its reviews of technology products, for an undisclosed amount. Unlike Chowhound, whose independence and spirit it has vowed to maintain while helping to spiff up the site, CNET.com is chockablock with ads.
 A fascinating new entrant in the field is LaLa.com, a music-swapping site introduced last month. Depending on where you are sitting, the LaLa concept is either brilliant (if you are a music fan with a lot of CD's you don't listen to, or if you are an artist) or terrifying (if you are a retailer of new or used music, or perhaps even a music label). 
 Here again, the founders are not in it just for profit. Rather, their idea is that despite all the cool new digital music services, well over 90 percent of the music industry sales are still in the CD format; most people still have CD's and artists don't gain any benefit from the sale of used discs. Many music lovers, the founders contend, feel disenfranchised by the way music is sold. 
 So LaLa is essentially a CD-swapping site that matches people who want one another's old CD's. It charges them a mere $1 a disc and provides the postage-paid envelopes to send them in for 49 cents apiece. Out of each dollar, the company voluntarily pays 20 cents to the performer on the recording; there is no more a legal obligation to do so than there is to pay General Motors a cut every time a used Chevy changes hands. 
 Bill Nguyen, the man behind several Silicon Valley start-ups, who is one of LaLa's founders, said that the service might work just as well at a cost of $4 a CD -- still a quite a bit cheaper than a typical used CD on eBay or in an East Village record shop -- but that making money wasn't the point. 
 Like those of other purpose-driven ventures, the company's costs are relatively low: it has only 17 employees at its offices in Palo Alto, Calif. So far, the site has been operating by e-mail invitation only because Mr. Nguyen and his partners want to build a strong base of music lovers, and not just people looking for cheap CD's. Mr. Nguyen maintains that the site already has 1.8 million album titles available for swapping. By comparison, Amazon has more than one million different CD's available for purchase, according to a spokeswoman for the company.
 MR. NGUYEN expects to open the site to the broader public by the summer. And no matter how successful the site becomes, he vows that it will not carry ads for the music industry or for anyone else -- except some links to charities. Nor will the company sell singles, although it will sell physical and download versions of entire new albums. 
 He also asks that LaLa members ''do the right thing,'' as he sees it, and erase from their hard drives and iPods any copies of songs from CD's they have traded. ''We did a lot of weird things that didn't make sense,'' Mr. Nguyen said proudly. 
 Or, maybe they do. After all, the company did manage to attract $9 million in financing from the venture capital firms Bain Capital and Ignition Partners. Obviously, these investors believe that there is money to be made in communal efficiency, just as CNET must believe in its purchase of Chowhound or eBay in its investment in Craigslist. 
 Maybe the lesson for media companies is to keep your friends close but to keep these friendly menaces even closer. As far as Mr. Nguyen is concerned, pursuing his labor of love is enough reward in and of itself. ''We just dig music,'' he said. ''Karma plays a role, man.''

HEADLINE: Less Can Be More When It Comes to Overseas Stocks

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR the last year, investors have been pumping more new money into foreign stock funds than into domestic portfolios. And they've been rewarded handsomely for doing so. 
 Consider that the average European stock fund has soared more than 14 percent a year, annualized, over the last five years. During this same stretch, funds that invest in domestic blue-chip growth stocks have returned less than 2 percent a year.
 Some strategists say that if more than half of the world's total stock market capitalization resides in companies based outside the United States, about half of your equity portfolio should be held in foreign shares. That argument has certainly gained traction in light of the recent successes overseas. 
 Yet there is something fundamentally wrong with this line of thinking.
 ''If you were to follow this logic, it would be the same thing as saying that investors should have owned technology companies in proportion to their market cap at the peak of the tech boom,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.
 Back then, the technology sector accounted for 34 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Yet most investors who had that much of their holdings in tech in March 2000 came to regret that decision.
 ''We've seen this movie before,'' Mr. Schweitzer said, noting that two decades ago, many investors believed -- incorrectly -- that the Japanese stock market was the place to be if they wanted to make real money. Of course, soon after conventional wisdom said that they had to have a substantial stake in Japan, the Nikkei 225 index of Japanese stocks fell into a steep bear market from which it still has not fully recovered.
 So how much foreign exposure should a buy-and-hold investor have? How much is too much?
 New research by S.& P. would seem to indicate that keeping around 25 percent of your equity exposure in foreign securities would be optimal.
 Having some foreign exposure clearly helps diversify a portfolio. From 1970 to 2005, a portfolio invested entirely in domestic stocks had a standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8 percent, according to S.& P. By comparison, a portfolio that was 75 percent invested in domestic stocks and 25 percent in foreign shares had a standard deviation of 16.4 percent, implying a slightly less bumpy ride.
 But beyond a 25 percent international allocation, the more foreign stock you own, the more volatile your portfolio becomes -- without generating much in additional returns. 
 Over the last 35 years, for example, a stock portfolio with 25 percent foreign exposure gained 11.4 percent a year, annualized, according to S.& P. That is based on the performance of the S.& P. 500 index of blue-chip stocks and the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index of foreign shares.
 During the same period, a 50 percent foreign portfolio returned only a hair more -- 11.5 percent a year. And a 100 percent foreign stock strategy returned slightly less -- 11.2 percent. ''I was amazed at how tightly packed the returns were,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. 
 Of course, an all-foreign stock portfolio had a standard deviation of 21.8 percent, making it by far the most volatile mix.
 Jeff Mortimer, head of equity portfolio management at Charles Schwab Investment Management, said researchers at Schwab had done their own analysis and had come to a similar conclusion. Conservative investors with 40 percent in stocks and 60 percent in bonds should probably have around 10 percent of their total portfolio in foreign equities, Mr. Mortimer said. More aggressive investors, with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds, should keep around 20 percent of their money in overseas shares. 
 Of course, investors may sometimes choose to slightly overweight or underweight foreign stocks, as opportunities arise. John Thompson Jr., portfolio manager at Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, says he thinks that an aggressive investor should feel comfortable putting as much as 30 percent of total equity exposure overseas. 
 But it's also important, Mr. Thompson said, not to deviate too much from your long-term asset allocation strategy. 
 That is especially true if you plan to hold emerging-market shares. Investors should probably keep their emerging-market exposure from growing beyond 5 percent of their total portfolio, he said. After all, the whole point of having a long-term asset allocation strategy is to reduce your portfolio's risk. 
 Moreover, given the recent outperformance by foreign stock markets, there is always the risk of being whipsawed if they begin to lose ground to domestic equities.
 To be sure, not all investors are going overboard. Many Americans, in fact, still have a home-country bias. Only around 10 percent of the equity allocation of a typical 401(k) investor is invested in foreign holdings, according to Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm. But that's more than double the exposure that 401(k) investors had to foreign shares in January 1999. 
 And this could shoot even higher if the same euphoria that swept up technology investors in the 1990's keeps driving domestic investors to foreign equities.
 So far this year, about 70 cents of every new dollar invested in equity funds has been directed to internationally oriented portfolios, according to the mutual fund tracker AMG Data Services. And emerging-market stock funds -- by far the hottest foreign category -- have pulled in more new money in the first three months of 2006 than they did in all of 2003, 2004 and 2005 combined. 
 Kevin M. Cronin, head of investments at Putnam Investments in Boston, says the foreign markets continue to look attractive. But he noted that opportunities abroad -- especially in the emerging markets -- come with clear-cut risks.
 ''The history of the emerging markets,'' he said, ''is littered with sociopolitical and economic problems.'' 
 The average emerging-market fund is up 22.7 percent a year, on average, for the past five years. Yet it is important to remember that these funds also managed to lose money in two of those five years -- just as they lost money in seven of the past 12 years. 
 This history suggests that while you may want to own some foreign shares, you may be advised to keep your holdings in moderation.

HEADLINE: Follow The Bouncing Jobs Data

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
JOB growth probably slowed last month, and that is just as well for the economy's future, said John K. Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments. If the government employment report on Friday shows that fewer than 200,000 jobs were created in March, he said, the end of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases could be near. 
 Mr. Lynch expects the economy to have added about 175,000 jobs last month. That is somewhat below the 190,000 net new jobs that are forecast in a Bloomberg News poll of economists. But either total would please him and, he thinks, Wall Street.
''A figure of 175,000 to 200,000 would be consistent with an economy that's growing, and it would be consistent with wage growth that's not threatening,'' he said. ''I think equities will respond positively'' to a number in that ballpark, he added.
 Wage inflation is especially important to the stock market and the Fed, Mr. Lynch said, because wages account for about two-thirds of business costs. Energy, a source of anxiety over the last year, represents just 10 percent of business costs, he pointed out.
 ''Wages are a number we need to watch,'' he said.
 Mr. Lynch will be watching a couple of other reports this week: the Institute of Supply Management's snapshots of the health of the nation's manufacturing and service industries in March.
 ''Both should be supportive of the economy expanding, with services a little stronger,'' he said. The I.S.M. manufacturing survey tends to get more attention, he said, and the service sector, which represents 75 percent of economic output, ''doesn't get the credit it's due.''
 The Bloomberg poll predicts a reading of 57.5 in the manufacturing survey, to be released on Monday, up from 56.7 in February. The service report, two days later, is forecast to show a decline to 59.0 from 60.1.
 That is unlikely to be the last indication of a slowing economy that investors will encounter in the weeks ahead, Mr. Lynch warned.
 ''Through the year we'll see the impact of the Fed'' rate increases, he said. He estimated that the economy grew by close to 5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. But as the Fed's tightening policy takes hold, he said, ''it will go quickly to a growth rate of half that pace.''

DATA WATCH -- Whatever is in store for the rest of the year, a couple of other modestly positive numbers are anticipated on Monday. Construction spending is forecast to have risen 0.5 percent in February, after climbing 0.2 percent in January. Vehicle sales at an annual rate of 16.8 million units are expected for March, compared with 16.6 million the previous month.

HEADLINE: A High-Octane Roth Plan Beckons to High Incomes

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
SAVING for retirement is often easier in theory than in practice. Not only is it hard to put away money and invest it intelligently, but new savings plans keep cropping up that promise attractive benefits, yet need to be examined carefully for hidden pitfalls.
 Consider a new type of savings account that became available through some employers on Jan. 1: the Roth 401(k). It combines the attractive features of a traditional 401(k) and a Roth I.R.A., making it a potentially powerful option. For the first time, high-income employees can accumulate savings tax-free. And that's a big bonus.
Unlike a traditional 401(k), in which taxes are deferred until retirement, in a Roth 401(k), investors pay taxes up front. So what you see in your Roth 401(k) savings account is what you'll actually get after you retire.
 The Roth 401(k) was part of President Bush's 2001 tax package, so there has been plenty of time for employers to learn about it. From the outset, its introduction was scheduled for the start of this year. So far, though, only a handful of major companies, like Vanguard, A. G. Edwards, and General Motors, have introduced the new plans, and then generally after their employees requested them. 
 ''It's tended to be financial services firms or companies with employees who are investment-savvy,'' said Lori Lucas, director of retirement research at Hewitt Associates, the human resources consulting firm. ''And they've been mainly responding to employee demand.'' 
 So what do the employees of Vanguard, A. G. Edwards and G.M. know that the rest of us may not?
 The biggest beneficiaries of a Roth 401(k) are high-income earners. Because of the impact of taxes, they can save more earned income for retirement in the new Roth account than in a regular 401(k). To see why, consider a person under 50 who makes the maximum contribution allowed for a Roth 401(k), $15,000 a year. For an employee in the 35 percent tax bracket, that is equivalent to saving $23,000 before taxes instead of $15,000 in a traditional 401(k). 
 Then there is the tax benefit in retirement. A $15,000 contribution to a Roth 401(k) will be $15,000 in retirement, but a $15,000 contribution to a regular 401(k) will be $15,000 minus, say, 35 percent in taxes. Of course, no one knows what marginal tax rates they will pay years from now. 
 ''People have a false sense of security when they look at their 401(k) and see the total,'' said Richard A. Friedman, a chartered financial consultant in Lancaster, Pa. ''The truth is you don't ever really know what the value of your 401 (k) is going to be, because you can't predict taxes.''
 If you put money into a Roth 401(k), you're betting that your individual income taxes will be the same or higher in retirement. But there's also a broader context to consider. Many economists expect tax rates to rise substantially in the future in order to close the huge federal budget deficit and bring the national debt under control. 
 Until now, there wasn't a straightforward way for high-income earners to protect their retirement savings from future tax increases. The main tax-free savings vehicle -- the Roth I.R.A. -- is not available to high-income earners: the income limit for investing the maximum contribution kicks in at $95,000 for a single person, with gradually reduced contributions allowed until income reaches $110,000.
 By contrast, the Roth 401(k) has no income limits. And it allows for maximum contributions of $15,000 a year ($20,000 for those who are 50 or older), compared with only $4,000 a year for the Roth I.R.A. ($5,000 for those 50 or older). That means that the people who can most afford the Roth 401(k) can also save more money tax-free with it. 
 High-income earners aren't the only people who can benefit substantially from a Roth 401(k), but they are the main constituency. People who expect to earn high incomes in the future may also benefit; for instance, young workers with good earnings prospects could put away money today and pay taxes on it at a lower rate than they presumably would have to later. 
 For everyone else, though, it is questionable whether there are real benefits to a Roth 401(k). It's pretty clear that there are none for low-income earners, who, if they can afford to save at all, already have the Roth I.R.A. available to them. For those in the middle, the benefits depend on how much they can afford to contribute and whether they will move into a higher tax bracket in retirement. 
 Fidelity Investments ran the numbers on an employee in the 35 percent tax bracket who had $9,000 to save before taxes. She can contribute about $5,800 after taxes ($9,000, less 35 percent in taxes) to a Roth 401(k) -- or $9,000, pretax, to a regular 401(k). Fidelity found that if her tax rate remained the same in retirement, investing in a Roth versus a regular 401(k) wouldn't make a difference. If, however, her tax rate rose at retirement to 40 percent, she would have additional savings of $3,400 at the end of 30 years by investing in a Roth 401(k). On the other hand, if her tax rate went down to 30 percent, she would have $3,500 less.
 There are other restrictions to consider. For instance, the funds must be in the Roth 401(k) account for at least five years in order to qualify for tax-free status, and they cannot be withdrawn before the age of 591/2. In addition, once a contribution goes into the new Roth vehicle, it cannot be switched over to a regular 401(k). So if an account holder changes jobs, and the new employer does not offer a Roth 401(k), the employee must roll it over into a Roth I.R.A., which may result in extra administrative costs.
 Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption of the Roth 401(k) is that it may not be here to stay: it is scheduled to disappear in 2010, if Congress doesn't take action to make it permanent. If it disappears, anyone with an account would be allowed to roll over the balance into a Roth I.R.A. 
 That prospect has given many companies second thoughts about offering the new plan. Given the high administrative costs associated with introducing it -- for education and communication, for instance -- many companies are waiting to see if their employees actually want it. 
 And that's why Vanguard, A. G. Edwards and G.M. offer a lesson for high-income earners. Don't wait for your employer to offer the Roth 401(k) -- if you don't ask, you won't get it. For most everyone else though, it may not be worth the bother.


CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A table last Sunday with an article about employer-sponsored Roth 401(k) plans reversed the columns showing income limits for two other retirement savings vehicles: traditional and Roth I.R.A.'s. People of all incomes may make contributions to traditional I.R.A.'s. No contributions may be made to Roth I.R.A.'s by individual taxpayers whose income exceeds $110,000 a year or by married taxpayers filing jointly whose income exceeds $160,000.

HEADLINE: Invest Globally, Stagnate Locally

 BODY:
IN the United States and Europe, there has been a curious disconnect in recent years between the performance of the corporate sector and the performance of the overall economy. 
 For example, median incomes for American workers have barely budged since 2000, while corporate profits have nearly doubled. In Germany, wages have fallen in real terms in the last two years, while earnings for the companies in the DAX 30 index have more than doubled. And in Germany and much of the rest of Europe, the overall pace of economic growth has remained sluggish.
''All in all, the widespread prosperity of companies does not lead to prosperity for domestic economies or wage earners in Germany, France or Japan,'' wrote Patrick Artus, chief economist of IXIS, the Paris bank, in a recent report. 
 In theory, corporate profits and wages shouldn't be a zero-sum game. Rising corporate profits are supposed to stimulate investment, which leads to job creation and rising consumer demand, which in turns tends to push up wages. But that process has broken down, at least within national borders, thanks to two related trends that stem largely from globalization.
 It's a truism in the large developed economies that capital is strong and labor is weak. From 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2005, corporate profits as a percentage of United States G.D.P. rose significantly, to 11.6 percent from about 7 percent. Companies have been able to keep a larger share of the cash they generate, rather than pay it out in wages, in part ''because the labor market recovery has been weak,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor DeLong notes that while unemployment is low, other measures of labor-market health, from hours worked to the employment-to-population ratio, show it to be less than robust.
 In Europe, where unions remain strong, the growing ability and desire of French and German companies to invest beyond borders gives management new leverage over labor. ''Capital has mobility in Europe,'' said Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC in London. ''German companies are able to tell workers that they can either accept reduced pay, or see the company close factories and reopen new ones in Poland or India.''
 The heightened mobility of capital allows companies to invest their profits around the globe with considerable freedom. ''American companies really haven't been sinking much of their gains back into domestic investment,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. In the United States, nonresidential fixed investment as a percentage of G.D.P. fell to 11.56 percent in 2005 from 12.55 percent in 2000. 
 Thanks to globalization and the opening of new markets, Mr. King said, ''it's increasingly difficult to argue that companies themselves are attached to a country.'' He notes, for example, that Vodafone, the giant British telecommunications company, has more than 80 percent of its sales and employment outside of Britain. And as of 2002, Mr. King found, the 50 largest multinational companies had 55 percent of their employees and 59 percent of their sales outside of their home countries.
 The trend of corporate cosmopolitanism is most pronounced in Europe. In a report published last November, Mr. Artus of IXIS found that for the members of the German index, the DAX 30, about 53 percent of employment and 34 percent of sales were in Germany; for the companies in the CAC 40, the French index, 43 percent of employees and 35.5 percent of sales were in France. 
 The trend is less pronounced in the United States. Standard & Poor's estimates that the companies in the S.& P. 500 derive about 60 percent of their sales at home, according to Alec Young, equity market strategist at S.& P. But for some of the largest companies, like McDonald's, the domestic market counts for only one-third of revenue. 
 More important, Mr. Young said, a disproportionate share of the revenue growth is coming from overseas, which means that domestic companies may be less likely to hire and invest in the United States as sales and profits grow. 
 In Dell Computer's most recent quarter, foreign sales were 43 percent of total revenue, up from 40 percent in the previous quarter. Dell is hiring in the United States: last fall, it opened a plant in North Carolina that will employ 1,500 people within five years. In late March, Dell announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees over the next three years -- in India. 
 Given these trends, the combination of rapidly rising corporate profits and stagnant or falling real wages seems less paradoxical. But some economists are wondering how much longer these trends can continue. 
 ''When you have labor shares shrinking relative to capital shares, you tend to get a rise in economic nationalism, which is a democratic response to some of the effects of globalization,'' Mr. King said.
 In other words, the arguments over Chinese imports, cross-border mergers and investments by companies from the Middle East in America's infrastructure could just be the beginning.

HEADLINE: A Nation of Pack Rats Needs Room to Stow

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
THE self-storage business started only about three decades ago in the Southwest, largely in response to an influx of retirees who were downsizing and looking to stow away excess belongings. 
 Today, it is a $145 billion industry, with 45,365 facilities nationwide and counting -- or, as its trade association breaks it down, a business large enough to provide nearly seven square feet of rentable space for every person in the United States.
But it is also an industry in transition, evolving from a sector that is highly fragmented -- dominated by thousands of mom-and-pop operators -- to one that is maturing and consolidating. And it has been capturing the attention of Wall Street. 
 Investors, seeing further growth ahead in a nation of pack rats, have been snapping up real estate investment trusts that hold large portfolios of self-storage properties. REIT's, which disburse most of their profits as dividends, now own an estimated 10 percent of self-storage facilities across the country. 
 There are five publicly traded REIT's in the self-storage sector, though that number will soon drop to four: Public Storage and Shurgard Storage Centers, which agreed recently to merge their operations, as well as Sovran Self-Storage, U-Store-It Trust and Extra Space Storage. Together, they outperformed most other kinds of REIT's during the first quarter this year. 
 This year through Thursday, the self-storage sector returned 17.67 percent. That was on top of a return of 26.55 percent last year, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. 
 By contrast, the average return for all equity REIT's was 14.48 percent this year through Thursday, and 12.16 percent in 2005, the trade group said. 
 Self-storage ''has really had a great run,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a financial analyst at Harris Nesbitt, the investment firm. Mr. Adornato recalled how a few years ago the sector suffered from growing pains as overbuilding caused rents and occupancy rates to fall off. Occupancy rates have ranged from 80 percent to nearly 90 percent and are now hovering around 85 percent, according to industry estimates.
 But while market watchers have been pleased with the turnaround, some remain cautious about what lies ahead.
 ''I think the sector will continue to have decent results, but I don't think this year will be as robust as 2005,'' said Michael Knott, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. Like some other analysts, he said he believes that share prices of self-storage REIT's are becoming too rich. Indeed, most are now trading close to their 52-week highs. 
 Part of the reason for the run-up has been consolidation. Investors have been bidding up shares in anticipation that further mergers or acquisitions may occur.
 The largest in the sector was announced just last month, when Public Storage agreed to buy Shurgard in a deal valued around $5 billion. The combination of these REIT's, the biggest in the category, would create the largest self-storage company in the world, with more than 2,100 facilities in 38 states and in Europe.
 Last May, a unit of General Electric agreed to sell its Storage USA unit for $2.3 billion in cash to a joint venture of Extra Space Storage and Prudential Real Estate Investors. And throughout last year, U-Store-It Trust bought a total of 146 facilities around the country for $547.9 million. 
 Analysts have called the Public Storage-Shurgard merger, which is expected to close in the second quarter, a good fit -- even though some have said that Public Storage overpaid for Shurgard's assets. Because of overlapping markets, there should be substantial saving in management and advertising costs after the merger, analysts said. At the same time, they said they expected that Public Storage, which has no overseas operations, would benefit from Shurgard's strong presence in seven European countries. 
 Michael R. Grupe, a senior vice president for research and investment affairs at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, acknowledged that many recent acquisitions ''have been done for some pretty substantial premiums.'' But, he said, this shows that ''the value of the underlying assets is perceived to be higher than what is reflected in the share price.''
 Louis Taylor, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, for one, says he thinks that Public Storage's share price, now around $80, still has room to grow, and he recently upgraded his ratings on the REIT. 
 Paul Puryear, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, was also bullish. ''The stock prices are rich,'' he said of Public Storage and other self-storage REIT's, ''though I would point out that the earnings growth looks strong.''
 But Mr. Adornato suggests that investors may want to consider taking profits now. He said that self-storage REIT's -- and Public Storage in particular -- could be susceptible to future economic downturns and overbuilding. (The growth rate for new facilities, in fact, has been about 9.5 percent a year for the last two decades, according to the Self Storage Association, which says that nearly 4,000 were added in 2004 alone.)
 Mr. Adornato said he was also concerned about ''a noticeable uptick in the level of discounts being offered to new customers.'' According to a recent Harris Nesbitt survey, 43 percent of self-storage providers were offering one month of free rent in the fourth quarter of 2005, up from 22 percent in the quarter a year earlier. (The average rental lasts six to nine months.) 
 ''That could be a good leading indicator of where the industry is heading,'' he said.
 Still, many real estate experts say that as long as the economy continues to grow, so will demand for self-storage. For one thing, economic expansion often leads to increased hiring, which will cause some people to relocate for new jobs; such transitions often require the renting of storage space. In addition, more people may be able to afford big-ticket items that take up much of that space. 
 Of course, demand for self-storage is also created by life's passages: marriage, divorce, retirement, even enlistment in the military.
 John Kriz, managing director of real estate finance at Moody's Investors Service, says he sees growing demand, too, for self-storage by small businesses, particularly those that operate online. ''Those tenants are relatively stable; they rent for longer than just a season,'' he said. (About a third of all units are now rented to small businesses, according to the Self Storage Association.)
 MR. KRIZ has another reason for his favorable view of self-storage as an investment: storage sites are relatively inexpensive to maintain. 
 ''When you have an apartment or office building, you have to put in new rugs or paint,'' he said. ''But with self-storage, there's not as much to do -- you sweep it out and maybe paint the floors and put in a new light bulb.'' 
 That apparent ease of operation, though, concerns Mr. Puryear. ''You can build these facilities for $2 million to $3 million -- there are not a lot of moving parts -- and that attracts a lot of small investors,'' he said. ''But that's a problem from a supply side.''

I. A Day in Court for the Criminals of Darfur?
 A thick afternoon fog enveloped the trees and streetlights of The Hague, a placid city built along canals, a city of art galleries, clothing boutiques, Vermeers and Eschers. It is not for these old European boulevards, however, that The Hague figures in the minds of men and women in places as far apart as Uganda, Sarajevo and now Sudan. Rather, it symbolizes the possibility of some justice in the world, when the state has collapsed or turned into an instrument of terror. The Hague has long been home to the International Court of Justice (or World Court), a legal arm of the United Nations, which adjudicates disputes between states. During the Balkan wars, a tribunal was set up here for Yugoslavia; it has since brought cases against 161 individuals. It was trying Slobodan Milosevic -- the first genocide case brought against a former head of state -- until his unexpected death last month. And now the International Criminal Court has begun its investigations into the mass murders and crimes against humanity that have been committed, and are still taking place, in the Darfur region of Sudan. 
The Hague has become a symbol of both the promise of international law and its stunning shortcomings. We have reached a point in world affairs at which we learn about genocide even as it unfolds, and yet it is practically a given that the international community will not use military intervention to stop it. Militias called janjaweed, recruited from Arab tribes in Darfur and Chad and supported by the Sudanese government, continue to attack, rape and kill villagers from African tribes -- more than 200,000 people have been killed in Darfur, and two million have fled their homes. For more than two years, politicians and activists have been shouting to the world that a genocide is unfolding in Darfur, calling it a slow-motion Rwanda in the hope that the shock of remembering the nearly one million people slaughtered in that African country in 1994 would prompt action. Coalitions of students, religious leaders and human rights groups have lobbied in Washington, have set up SaveDarfur.org and have made green rubber bracelets, now worn all over the United States, that quote George Bush recalling Rwanda and promising, ''Not on my watch.'' Yet the killing rolls on, and no one intervenes to bring it to an end, as if the genocide in Darfur were already history. 
 Last year the United Nations Security Council referred the Darfur file to the International Criminal Court. And now the horrors of Darfur have become the preoccupation of an extraordinary international team of investigators in a plain and quiet Dutch town. They have no army, but they want to ensure that out of this history -- this slow-motion genocide -- they can wrest some justice.
 Luis Moreno-Ocampo is the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. A veteran Argentine lawyer in his 50's, he has a short, graying beard and Groucho Marx eyebrows that are almost always in motion -- excited, alarmed, disappointed. Moreno-Ocampo knows how difficult his position is. ''I'm a stateless prosecutor -- I have 100 states under my jurisdiction and zero policemen,'' he said when I visited him in The Hague in January. But he does not see his court as a token body. ''No. No! Wrong!'' he said, swinging his arms one Saturday afternoon as we strolled by The Hague's medieval prison. He recounted how he had explained the court to his 13-year-old son: ''My son is studying the Spanish conquerors in Latin America. Yesterday he says to me, 'They killed 90 percent of the Indians, so today you'd put them in jail?' I said: 'Yes. Exactly. What happened to the native populations in the U.S. and Latin America could not happen today with the I.C.C. Absolutely. Absolutely. We are evolving. Humanity is not just sitting. There is a new concept. The history of human beings is war and violence; now we're saying this institution is here to prevent crimes against humanity.'''
 The International Criminal Court was created by the Rome Statute in 1998 and began work in 2003 with two goals -- to prevent crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes; and to prosecute them. Of the two, prevention is what fires Moreno-Ocampo's ambition; it is what excites his imagination and intellect and fuels his 18-hour workdays, far away from his family, his horses and his farm in Argentina. It's not that he thinks the court can protect the villagers now being killed and maimed and raped in Darfur; his investigation into war crimes there will take years. What he is convinced of is that the prospect of prosecuting war criminals in Darfur and elsewhere will deter others from committing horrific crimes. Genocides ''are planned,'' he told me. ''They are not passion crimes. These people think in cost.'' The I.C.C. is intended to raise the cost. Moreno-Ocampo holds up Carlos Castano, one of Colombia's top paramilitary commanders, as an example of the court's potential reach. After Colombia ratified the I.C.C. treaty, Castano laid down his weapons because, according to his brother, he realized that he might become vulnerable to I.C.C. prosecution. 
 Colombia, however, is not Sudan, and Castano was not carrying out a genocide. Does Moreno-Ocampo have a chance of bringing the perpetrators of the crimes in Darfur to justice? 

II. The Dreams of Gustave Moynier and Luis Moreno-Ocampo
 In 1989, as Soviet rule crumbled, a tiny window of historical possibility opened. For a moment, many people imagined a new world, with relations between nations rooted in human rights and international norms. It was something of a utopian vision, and the 90's -- with massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia, Chechnya, Liberia, Congo and Sierra Leone -- quickly swept the world back into bloodshed and genocide. Despite all the killing, an international movement was pushing the principle that government officials must be held accountable before the law. An early triumph of the movement was the successful prosecution in the mid-80's of Argentine generals responsible for the ''dirty war'' that led to as many as 30,000 Argentines being ''disappeared.'' This was the first such trial -- against top generals and leaders -- since Nuremberg. Luis Moreno-Ocampo was the assistant prosecutor and became a household name across Argentina. The Argentine trials set a precedent for later tribunals like those for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. 
 The dream of an I.C.C. can be dated as far back as 1872 to a Swiss man named Gustave Moynier, who helped found the Red Cross. He saw many atrocities committed during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and realized that the 1864 Geneva Convention, on the treatment of wounded soldiers, was just paper without a court that could try violators. Nearly 130 years later, 120 countries voted to endorse the Rome Statute and began what could prove to be a small revolution in the history of nations. World leaders dared expose themselves to international law. No more immunity: they agreed to be held accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Investigators and prosecutors would detail crimes and prosecute the criminals. Prisons would hold those convicted. Here was an idealistic vision designed by liberal pragmatists. 
 In the end, the delegations of seven states involved in the negotiations voted against the resulting treaty. Those states included Iraq, Israel, Libya, China -- and the United States. But in 2000, just hours before the deadline, President Bill Clinton signed the treaty, a necessary step before sending it on to the Senate for ratification. A few weeks later, advisers to his successor, President Bush, let it be known that his administration would not respect that signature -- that it regarded most international treaties as tools for the weak. In May 2002, Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton sent a letter to Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, announcing that the United States didn't consider itself bound by the Rome Statute. In one public debate, Bolton, who later became the American ambassador to the U.N., had argued: ''The United States should pursue a policy of 'three nos': the United States should provide no financial support for the court, directly or indirectly; the administration should not collaborate further in efforts to make the court operational; and the United States should not negotiate further with governments to 'improve' the I.C.C. This policy will maximize the chances that the court will not come into existence.'' Since the court was a fait accompli, President Bush signed into law the American Service-Members' Protection Act, which requires American forces to liberate any American in I.C.C. custody. It is popularly known as The Hague Invasion Act.
 Given that the reputation of the United States on human rights is today at one of its lowest points -- Abu Ghraib, Bagram, Guantanamo -- Moreno-Ocampo gamely regards Bush as an inadvertent boon to the court. Bush builds Moreno-Ocampo's legitimacy by being against the court. For Moreno-Ocampo's work is political as well as legal, and his approach is intensely pragmatic. As idealistic as he may be in his global post, his career is rooted in the muck of reality. He was just 32 when he prosecuted the Argentine generals. He went on to prosecute Argentina's military regime responsible for the Falklands war and other officers for murder, torture and kidnapping. He endured assassination threats while taking on corrupt officials, cabinet members and judges; preventing and fighting corruption became his unusual specialty when he went into private practice in 1992.
 The challenge in Darfur is, however, greater by far than anything in Moreno-Ocampo's career. It was in March of last year that the Security Council referred the case of crimes against humanity in Darfur to the I.C.C. Soon, television footage was shown around the world of a truck delivering boxes of documents, compiled by United Nations investigators, about the crimes committed in Darfur. In New York, Kofi Annan handed Moreno-Ocampo an envelope containing the names of 51 Sudanese people recommended for indictment by the commission. News of the list's existence unnerved officials in Khartoum, Sudan's capital. Moreno-Ocampo took the envelope, flew back to The Hague and opened it among a few associates. He then locked the names away, later saying that he would compile his own list.
 Moreno-Ocampo's Darfur file is a first in international justice. His investigators must work against the will of the Sudanese government. They cannot gather any forensic evidence from schools where collective rapes occurred. They cannot gather samples from wells that were poisoned. They cannot even gather shrapnel from bombs dropped on civilians by the government. The collecting of written material, however, did not stop with the U.N. commission. Sudanese dissidents and activists have been feeding the I.C.C. investigators letters and documents. A U.N. team recently returned from investigating key Sudanese officials (and singled out 17 for international sanctions). And Moreno-Ocampo is interviewing victims by every means possible, putting together the narratives of selected crimes and connecting them to command decisions in government. Slowly, too slowly for some, out of the murderous morass a case is being built.

III. What the I.C.C., and Sudan, Can Do
 The government of Sudan, led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, contends that the I.C.C. investigation is unnecessary. After all, Sudanese courts are conducting their own investigations and prosecutions for whatever crimes may have occurred in Darfur. Immediately after Moreno-Ocampo declared in June 2005 that the people he was likely to investigate would not face justice in Sudanese courts, Bashir's ministry of justice announced the creation of the Darfur Special Criminal Court, a three-judge traveling court.
 There are several ways in which a case may be brought before the I.C.C. One is by invitation of a state; this is the case in Uganda, for example, where the government asked the I.C.C. to investigate crimes committed by the Lord's Resistance Army, a murderous cult group composed of a few leaders and thousands of kidnapped children that has been terrorizing northern Uganda for nearly 20 years. A second option is for an I.C.C. prosecutor to initiate an investigation. This is the method that has made John Bolton and others apoplectic about the court and led President Bush in the 2004 presidential campaign to refer to an ''unaccountable prosecutor.'' (In fact, the prosecutor is accountable to an international panel of judges.) The third possibility is referral by the Security Council. In every instance, a case will be inadmissible to the I.C.C. if a state is carrying out its own investigation or prosecution -- unless the I.C.C. determines that the state's prosecution is seriously inadequate.
 That determination is made by the I.C.C. prosecutor and the court's judges, who are nominated by the 100 states that are full parties to the Rome Statute. In short, the court is empowered to assert jurisdiction in states like Sudan that are not themselves parties to the treaty. This is the point at which the aspirations of international law meet the resistance of sovereignty and political power. For now, Sudan has set up courts with an eye toward demonstrating that the Darfur cases are inadmissible to the International Criminal Court because they're being handled perfectly well in Sudan.
 The airport in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, welcomes you with carefully tended flowers and a soft breeze that is a pleasant change from the relentless heat of Khartoum. A bustling market town on the edge of the desert, Nyala has an air of normalcy about it. Children in blue-and-white uniforms walk the dusty roads to school in the morning. Lawyers wait outside the courts to bring their cases. Women in technicolor wraps make fresh tea and coffee on little stools in the market. Arab nomads park their camels in the livestock market at the edge of a neighborhood locally known as Falluja because of the violence there. 
 The governor has declared it a crime to call the neighborhood Falluja, one of the many strange rules that remind you that you are in a police state. My translator during my trip to Darfur this past winter was a Fur, the Fur being one of the main African tribes of Darfur, and to protect himself he often had to lie about his tribe when we went to neighborhoods like Falluja. On the edge of town, African Union troops -- they have been in Darfur since July 2004 to monitor a cease-fire and now number a mere 7,000 -- camp in tents provided by American companies. Just outside town, the notorious Kalma camp spreads across a stark plain alongside a dry riverbed. Some 90,000 people have come to live at the camp after fleeing their villages. The camp is nearly two years old and has sprawled almost five miles as families pack themselves in under thatch roofs and flapping walls made of canvas USAid food sacks.
 In a quiet corner of Nyala, in a modest stone house, is the Amal Center, one of a handful of local institutions that offer some hope to Darfurians. The Amal Center is financed mainly by international organizations. Volunteer doctors treat victims of attacks, and a team of local Arab and African lawyers donate their time to file cases of murder, looting and rape stemming from the crisis. The center was founded in Khartoum in 2000 to help victims of torture in Sudanese prisons and later expanded to Darfur. 
 Among the lawyers at Amal is Muhammad Ali, a local Arab whose clients are mostly black African victims of janjaweed violence, and Thuriya Haroon Daldon, who is teasingly nicknamed Mrs. I.C.C. by local judges and, unusually for a woman here, drives herself around in a van. Thuriya Haroon's first case with Amal was in 2001, representing a group of men who said they had been tortured by national-security officers. ''I submitted the names of the torturers to the attorney general, but until now there's no permission even to pursue the case, and no answer,'' she said, and laughed. A frank woman with a friendly but firm aspect, Thuriya Haroon uses laughter to fend off the realities of death and cruelty that now fill her workday. ''Instead, we face harassment,'' she said. ''They follow us, watch us. And until now the victims say to me: 'What do you do? We give our stories, and those who tortured us are on the streets.' Sometimes I'm ashamed. I've done nothing.'' She has handled hundreds of rape cases, for example, and until now: ''No one has been convicted of rape in all of Darfur. We've had only two cases of immoral behavior. They were sentenced to six months.'' 
 Since President Bashir and the National Islamic Front (now known as the National Congress Party) took power in a coup in 1989, there have been dozens of rebellions all over Sudan. The deadliest predated the regime: a civil war between the north, where the Islamist regime was based, and the mostly Christian or animist south. Unlike in the south, however, in Darfur the African and Arab tribes are all Muslim. In Darfur, as elsewhere in Sudan, the rebels are fighting their people's economic and political marginalization.
 The current Darfur conflict began raging after rebels ambushed the Sudanese Air Force at one of its bases in North Darfur early in 2003. It was a humiliating defeat for Bashir and his government's security apparatus. The government responded -- as it had previously in the Nuba Mountains and the southern oil fields -- by recruiting local militias to wage a counterinsurgency campaign, thus pitting tribes against one another. The name janjaweed means bandits or ruffians; it combines ''devil'' (jinn) with ''horse'' (jawad) and conjures a dark terror for Darfurians. The janjaweed were plucked from the mostly nomadic camel- or cattle-breeding Arab tribes of Darfur and neighboring Chad. Uneducated, destitute and landless, they are motivated mainly by promises made by Sudanese government officials of land and loot. Today the government uses them as a means of deniability: the militias are uncontrollable, the government says, and are merely carrying on an ancient tribal conflict or a centuries-old fight over resources between seminomadic Arabs and African farmers. Yet when the government wants to control them, it does, and many of the janjaweed have simply been incorporated into what are known as the popular defense forces. 
 Since August 2004, the Amal Center has compiled information on more than 72,000 cases. The documents are stored in boxes and a simple gray metal cabinet. Most are in folders sorted by the name of the targeted village. Consider the case of the town of Marla. In April of last year, after the Darfur file was referred by the Security Council to the I.C.C., the governor of South Darfur, Atta al-Mannan, announced that anyone from Marla who had a complaint could open a court case. The people of Marla took the governor at his word. ''I brought all the cases of torture to the governor,'' the omda, or community leader, of Marla, Abdul Karim, told me one hot, windy afternoon at the Kalma refugee camp. ''The one tied by plastic rope who was paralyzed, the ones who were hung and have wounds on their necks, the ones who were burned with melting plastic. Sixteen cases. I told them to stand in front of the governor to tell their story and to show their wounds. One man couldn't even hold a cup of water anymore. The governor said, 'I didn't know such things happened.''' The governor said he would form a committee to investigate who committed the crimes. A prosecutor from Khartoum came and did the investigation, submitted his report and returned to Khartoum. The governor proudly showed me the bound report, along with several other investigative reports that he had ordered and that sat in a glass display case behind his desk. 
 Abdul Karim said that when investigators found that all the Marla cases were against government or janjaweed or popular defense forces, they dropped the investigation. Several men from Marla had filed cases against specific young men who belonged to the popular defense forces. The men from Marla had a court hearing and brought witnesses. But on the way out through the courtyard that day, the plaintiffs were arrested by national security and then disappeared for months. The men accused of the initial crimes were released. The tribal leader who the Marla men and United Nations officials say assisted in commanding the attack lives in a comfortable house in Nyala and hangs out at police headquarters and the prosecutor's office.
 Justice in Nyala begins and ends with the prosecutor of South Darfur, Mauwia Abdullah Ahmed, who is from one of Darfur's Arab tribes. He decides which, if any, cases will go to the Darfur Special Criminal Court. I met him one morning in his office in a long one-story building just across a fence from Nyala's courthouse. He wore a blazer and tie and seemed bored when I asked why he hadn't transferred any of the serious cases -- like those brought by the survivors from Marla -- to the special court. He said it was too difficult to arrest the accused. He complained that the victims never identified their attackers, that witnesses never showed up. 
 I then asked him about the case of Hamada, a village attacked by janjaweed in January 2005. Muhammad Ali and others from the Amal Center filed the case on behalf of the villagers of Hamada -- 93 people had been slaughtered, livestock and possessions were looted and as the mayhem went on at least 19 women were raped.
 The Arab tribal leader Nazir al-Tijani, who commands most of the janjaweed in that area and is said to be under the control of the governor, has admitted that the attacks occurred and that he directed them. He said it was in retaliation for cattle raids. ''He gave a big speech about his innocence, but he has not read the Geneva Conventions very well,'' one international official told me, quoting Tijani as having said, ''Just because I ordered and planned the attacks doesn't mean that I was present during the attacks!'' 
 The prosecutor told me that no individuals had been named in relation to Hamada. I asked him about Tijani. ''That's a political case,'' he said. ''People talk to the media, but no one came and gave us these details.'' I reminded the prosecutor that the village leader of Hamada filed the case through the Amal Center, and the prosecutor changed tactics. ''We made an order of arrest, but up to now they're not arrested,'' he said. ''The police don't know these people.'' But everyone knew Tijani. He came into town several times a week, or you could, as I once did, drive the two hours to his farm. ''Murder cases are so common here,'' the prosecutor said, leaning back in his chair and scratching himself. ''Hamada is no different. It's not a war crime. It's a murder case.''

IV. A Visit to Sudan's Own Court
 The Sudanese government's leading initiative to pre-empt the I.C.C. is its Darfur Special Criminal Court. By late last fall the special court had heard just six cases. One was a rape case that was dropped. (Thuriya Haroon, of the Amal Center, tried to obtain a closed-session hearing for the under-age girl, but the judges refused, and the girl clammed up.) Another case involved the looting of a truck and the shooting of a USAid employee; the charge was reduced to weapons possession. One of the harsher sentences went to a man convicted of stealing 80 sheep. It's not that no one has been connected by Sudanese courts to the genocide. They have convicted several men who did not want to take part in it: Darfurian Air Force pilots who refused to fly bombing missions over their homeland. They are serving 10 to 20 years in Kober prison in Khartoum. 
 One morning I visited the special court in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur. I asked the president of the court, Mahmoud Abkam, why, with all the heinous crimes committed in Darfur over the past two years, so few cases of any seriousness had come before his court. He was an elderly man and had been retired when this job came up. He said, ''We've found nothing of importance except those cases we heard.'' Why? ''Because no information went to the prosecutor.'' What about Marla, Hamada, Deleig and all the other cases? He reiterated that no cases had come to the court's attention and suggested that this was because the victims preferred to talk to foreigners like me.
 ''You can serve their case better than the authorities,'' he said. ''Here you can do nothing.'' He invited frustrated complainants to come to his court and tell him that the attorney general's office is ignoring their cases, but, he added, ''They won't do it.'' 
 I said that many of the people who had told me their stories had no idea of his court's existence. He said, with a distinct suddenness: ''To be frank, when we came here we thought there would be cases ready for trial. And we heard of mass rape, mass murder. We had the authority to see everything in the attorney general's office. But nothing on paper was shown to us.'' How did he explain that? ''Perhaps the attorney general could not proceed due to circumstances beyond his control,'' he said. ''Let us be optimistic and say that.''
 What if we were to be pessimistic?
 ''Higher authorities are not interested in these cases to be presented to the court,'' he said, ''or for them to even come to the knowledge of the court.'' Another judge told me that, given the shortcomings of the court, the government of Sudan, far from preventing the I.C.C. from taking over justice in Darfur, is all but ensuring that the I.C.C. prosecutor will come to Sudan. 

V. An I.C.C. Kind of Crime
 A few days before I arrived in Nyala, the janjaweed and Arabs in military uniform attacked the Fur village of Tama. In the courtyard of a small house in Nyala, I met two women who had fled Tama and were wrapped in white shrouds, legs stretched out on the earth, eyes fixed down. One of them, Zahara Muhammad Abdullah, drew an orange cloth over the face of a young girl who was hiding in her lap. The child was petrified. A few days earlier, the two women told me, they rose before the sun for prayers in the mosque with their husband, the imam, when out of the quiet came the sounds of hoofbeats and gunfire and shouts, and janjaweed, some in uniform, burst through the mosque doors asking for the imam by name. The women watched as their husband said, ''Yes, this is me,'' and the armed men said, ''You, imam, are the one asking God to give victory to the Tora Bora'' -- a nickname for antigovernment rebels -- ''so today is the last day for you.'' The imam prayed and recited a sura from the Koran, Zahara said, ''and then suddenly they shot him.'' Then the men fired their guns randomly around the mosque. The bullets hit the imam's brother, his brother's wife, his brother's two sons and his daughter's son. They all died. Another armed man appeared and asked the other gunmen, ''Did you kill Fakir Tahir'' -- the imam. ''We did,'' they said. He wanted to make sure and pulled off the cloth covering the dead imam's face.
 The imam's two wives and Howa, the 5-year-old girl, were kept inside the mosque and beaten periodically throughout the day while some 300 janjaweed continued to kill and loot. Meanwhile, the janjaweed women known as Hakama, a kind of Greek chorus who sing and encourage their warrior men during raids on villages, broke into song when they saw the dead in the mosque: The blood of the blacks runs like water, we take their goods and we chase them from our area and our cattle will be in their land. The power of al-Bashir belongs to the Arabs, and we will kill you until the end, you blacks, we have killed your God. It's a nonsensical ending: one thing that distinguishes the war in Darfur is that all the tribes are Muslim, and their God is the same.
 The janjaweed killed 42 people that day, most of them running out of their homes or through fields of sorghum, hoping to escape. They told the imam's wives, ''Go now to your father.''
 ''We asked them, 'Who is our father?' and they said, 'The foreigners in Kalma camp.''' 

VI. The Perpetrators' Point of View
 A few days later, I drove to Tama with African Union officers and troops. Their mandate is a cruel one in that they are nearly powerless; they must monitor the cease-fire, and that's it, no peacekeeping. Which means that many of these men -- Rwandans, Gambians, South Africans, Kenyans, Nigerians -- have spent the last year picking up and burying hundreds of dead bodies, and even watching as janjaweed burn and shoot. And they can do nothing. 
 In Tama the fires hadn't yet gone out. Flames shot out of the freshly harvested sorghum and sesame. Ceramic storage vats of food were smoldering. Homes were ransacked. Empty toothpaste boxes, notebooks, onions and okra spilled across the floors. A dog lay dead outside the smashed basins of the midwife's house. Inside the brick mosque the floor was clean but for a bloodied turban, a bloodied djellaba, a few bullet casings and two aluminum boxes holding Korans. ''This is the Islam of Sudan,'' said a young Fur man, a Muslim. A sheik from the village showed us the graves outside the mosque where they buried 10 men and a woman. A week had passed since the janjaweed first attacked, and still they were burning the place to ensure that the villagers wouldn't come back. The governor of South Darfur, Atta al-Mannan, explained Tama to me this way: ''I warned the A.U. that this is the seasonal trip south of the nomads and there may be an accident.'' But according to a military-intelligence officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared he would be killed, the Sudanese military knew the janjaweed were going to attack Tama. The janjaweed, he said, are considered legal and are mostly part of Border Intelligence Guard units. ''They picked up boxes of ammunition at 2 p.m. the day before,'' he said. ''So we knew some attack was coming. That is the usual routine.'' 
 Sudan's rulers seem to contemplate the murderous violence that sustains their power with complete serenity. One evening in Khartoum I visited the former governor of South Darfur, Lieut. Gen. Adam Hamid Musa. We sat in his garden during Ramadan, accompanied by a professor friend of his. Hamid Musa lived in a residential area cordoned off for favored military officers. He was removed as governor in 2004 and now heads the Darfur Peace and Development Forum, which is financed by Sudan's ruling party. He suggested that talk of rapes and racial cleansing in Darfur was simple propaganda. ''Do you think a governor will go to kill his own people?'' he asked. 
 Even before he was made governor in 2003, Musa was part of a group of Arab ideologues who were in Darfur recruiting Arab nomads into the militia now known as the janjaweed. In the garden that night, he noted that the allegations of rape and slaughter all came from the tribes of victims. 
 ''And they all lied?'' I asked. 
 ''Yes,'' he said. ''A single case of raping hasn't been proved. The women there don't even know what the word means.'' He chuckled happily and popped a toffee into his mouth, as did his professor friend.

VII. Moreno-Ocampo Fights on Many Fronts
 For Moreno-Ocampo, work- ing on the Darfur file is a never-ending tale of bureaucracy and doublespeak. Interviews, access and permits are given to I.C.C. investigators, then revoked, then rethought. Slow comes with the job, and in some ways this is a throwback to Moreno-Ocampo's early days against a similar regime. In prosecuting the perpetrators of the dirty war, 20 years ago, Moreno-Ocampo and his team could not rely on evidence from intelligence or police. They had no graves or remains -- the desaparecidos were mostly thrown into the sea. What they had were 30,000 reported cases of desaparecidos collected by a truth commission. They decided to focus on 700 cases. They based their evidence on the testimony of survivors, many of whom were tortured alongside those who disappeared. The prosecution proved that the generals had command responsibility for the detention centers and the military pilots who had dumped the bodies into the sea. This is exactly the strategy Moreno-Ocampo plans to use in Darfur. 
 The Argentine trials gave Moreno-Ocampo a deeper understanding of the meaning of the law for society. Argentina's new president at the time, Raul Alfonsin, won the 1983 elections with a promise to prosecute the guerrillas and the junta. ''There was a social demand for law, but we the prosecutors were just the strawberry -- the politicians were the cake,'' Moreno-Ocampo told me. ''Trials are an expression of society. The victims finally received respect, for the first time in my country. Before the trials, if you were a victim you were under suspicion.'' Even his mother came around. She attended the same church as Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla, the president and leader of the junta, and was furious with her son for prosecuting him and betraying the family -- after all, her father was a general. ''She changed her thinking through the media, watching the trials. She said, 'I still love Videla, but he has to be in jail.''' 
 The trials were the most potent symbols of the fundamental changes sweeping through Argentina. One disappointment with the Yugoslav tribunals, according to Moreno-Ocampo, is that people were hoping ''the trials were the cake.'' But the trials didn't change the country. ''The prosecutor cannot change job opportunities or create consensus in society,'' he said. ''You need social movements.'' 
 But Sudan is not Argentina or even Yugoslavia. The regime is still in control, and its officials are masters at manipulating the international community. As one Sudanese foreign-ministry ambassador told me, ''We just have to get one step ahead of the game so we can outmaneuver the I.C.C. when they finally request to send investigators.'' Referring to the Darfur Special Criminal Court, he said, ''We make national trials, show no impunity'' -- that is, that the guilty are being punished -- ''and ruin the I.C.C.'' You have to look long and hard to find any political figure of significance in Sudan who is actively supporting the I.C.C. -- while there are plenty who will draw a crowd by fulminating against the court as one more instance of foreign meddling. 
 Given the lack of domestic support for prosecutions in Sudan, foreign support is crucial. The European Union has been the I.C.C.'s most loyal backer but has shown some wariness in the Sudan case, not least because of justifiable worries about appearing colonialist. (There were huge anti-U.N. demonstrations in Khartoum last month, and Sudanese politicians played the colonialism card very heavily.) China and France, which are permanent members of the Security Council, have interests in Sudanese oil, and though they referred the Darfur file to the I.C.C., it is reasonable to question how deep their commitment goes. Russia, another permanent member of the Security Council, has always been uneasy about the I.C.C., given the continuing disaster in Chechnya. Neighboring countries, through the African Union, have in general supported peace efforts and in some instances have helped the I.C.C. But of course such support must be handled with care, as the Bashir regime has active disputes with several of its neighbors -- notably Chad, with whom it is virtually at war. 
 The American position is a confused one. On one level, the Bush administration is determined to hobble the I.C.C. For a few years, the United States has pressed I.C.C. member states to sign a bilateral agreement swearing not to surrender U.S. citizens, or foreign nationals working for the U.S., to the I.C.C. But the administration's anti-I.C.C. policy has backfired. Gen. Bantz J. Craddock, head of the Pentagon's Southern Command, testified before Congress this year that the insistence on special bilateral agreements is undermining American military influence. Eleven Latin American countries have not only lost military aid; they no longer receive American training -- which means no bonds are established with their American counterparts. Other countries, especially China, are taking advantage of the American withdrawal to advance their own foreign goals. On a trip to Latin America last month, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that this I.C.C.-immunity policy was damaging America's interests.
 The American willingness to allow, without voting for it, the Security Council's referral of Darfur to the I.C.C. may have indicated a change in attitude, though it seems to have come more from a belief that the court's investigation couldn't hurt and might help. The State Department was working hard on Darfur even before Secretary of State Colin Powell declared in 2004 that Sudan's actions in the region constituted genocide. The peace agreement between North and South Sudan last year, which ended decades of war, was a rare (and fragile) success for Bush administration diplomacy in Africa. The United States has tried to push similar negotiations on the warring parties in Darfur, so far with little result. At the United Nations, John Bolton led the administration's push in February to have the African Union force in Darfur reorganized under U.N. auspices and expanded, which will probably take place by the end of the year.
 At the same time, the Bush administration has stopped calling the crimes in Darfur a genocide. The administration does not want to lose the North-South agreement and the peace it has secured, and this may make it wishy-washy on Darfur. It has also found Sudan to be a useful ally in the war on terror. At least some Sudanese leaders being investigated by the I.C.C. are, according to American officials who asked not to be named, highly valuable, if unreliable, allies in hunting down Islamic terrorists. ''In 2004, when the Sudanese decided to conclude the North-South peace, they got an A- on cooperation,'' a senior American official said. ''They rendered people and gave us information on people we didn't even know were there. Since then they've done stuff that saved American lives.'' The C.I.A. flew Sudan's national-security director, Salah Abdallah Ghosh, to Washington for a debriefing last year. He shared information that his office had on Islamist militants training in Sudan before 9/11. Yet he is one of a handful of top security men orchestrating Khartoum's crimes in Darfur and deploying intelligence units that have carried out targeted killings since 2003. In December, a United Nations panel recommended that Ghosh and 16 other Sudanese officials face international sanctions. ''The U.S. has pressed the U.N. not to include Ghosh on the list of people who should be subject to sanctions,'' John Prendergast, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, told me. ''Trying to constructively engage with mass murderers in order to gather information is the wrong policy. It reinforces the regime's willingness to perpetrate atrocities.'' 
 The Bush administration is reluctantly coming to terms with the usefulness, if not the necessity, of the I.C.C. According to Roger Winter, the State Department's special representative for the Sudan conflict, who has been involved in America's Sudan policy for 25 years, ''If you want toliquidate an Islamo-fascist regime that committed genocide, the way to do it that is accepted by the international community is through the C.P.A.'' -- the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended the North-South war -- ''and prosecutions by the I.C.C.''
 Despite the ambivalences, mixed messages and conflicting interests in the international community, the biggest challenges for Moreno-Ocampo and his team are in Sudan. The Khartoum government is learning how to play the game. It is pushing tribal leaders from the Fur, Zaghawa and Massalit to accept reconciliation and compensation; it has its roving Special Criminal Court. And as the new minister of justice in Khartoum told me: ''We are sending 15 prosecutors to Darfur. We will try the armed forces, and convict rape offenders, just to prove to the I.C.C. prosecutor that we are willing and able to try the offenders in Darfur.'' He did add that under Sudan's Constitution, the president and his cabinet members, members of the assembly and certain members of the armed forces and police may be immune from prosecution. 
 Leaving aside the question of sincerity, Sudan's efforts do point to deeper issues: should peace be allowed to trump justice? (The I.C.C. statute itself advises that the prosecutor suspend indictments if they are not in the interests of the victims.) Are reconciliation and compensation better justice than prosecution and punishment? In northern Uganda, many tribal groups were against the intervention of the I.C.C. at first. But some of Moreno-Ocampo's initial enemies, like the northern mayors he was meeting with when I went to visit him in The Hague, subsequently brainstormed with him on how to arrest Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army.
 Sudanese intellectuals close to the government are very good at painting pictures of Armageddon to foreigners, insisting that if the international community demands justice it will only hasten war. As Ghazi Salah al-Addin, a moderate Islamist and presidential adviser, told me in Khartoum: ''Those who feel threatened by the I.C.C., at a certain point, it will be a matter of life and death to them. They could block the C.P.A. The situation is so fragile. We shouldn't be complacent. Sudan is a very dangerous place. Your Somalia would be a picnic if Sudan degenerates into chaos. It would draw in the elements you fear most. It would require an influx of U.S. troops just like Afghanistan.''
 But that is why the I.C.C.'s work is so crucial, including to the United States: it has the potential to increase the pressure for peace as well as to deliver some justice. Darfurians and activists across Sudan see it as the only way of getting rid of one of the most murderous governments in the world. As the omda of Marla, Abdul Karim, told me, ''After the intervention of the commission of inquiry and the U.N. and all of them confessed that there are crimes of war and crimes against humanity in this state, the best chance for the citizens of Darfur is that the perpetrators of these crimes should be taken to account at fair trials. Our hope is with the I.C.C.'' 
 So, quietly and doggedly, Moreno-Ocampo is stitching together his file against the top leaders of the genocide in Darfur, collecting evidence from victims, activists and international officials, and perhaps this might, in a very partial way, help keep Sudan from falling apart. In June he will present to the Security Council a report on the crimes committed, a road map of how he will proceed and probably a list of suspects to be indicted. Given that the Security Council is backing Moreno-Ocampo, if he issues arrest warrants against President Bashir and Vice President Ali Osman Taha, which is a real possibility, their political careers will effectively end.
 I met Moreno-Ocampo recently at a cafe on the Upper East Side of New York to talk about his presentation at the Security Council. Sitting next to us was Hector Timerman, the Argentine consul, and his family. Timerman told me that when Moreno-Ocampo was first offered the job, Timerman was pushing him to accept. ''Argentina is known in the world for the word desaparecidos -- it is heavy for a country like us,'' Timerman said. ''I told him, 'It's time to show the world a new Argentina committed to human rights.''' A few jokes were made between the Timermans and Moreno-Ocampo about his arrogant confidence as a lawyer and prosecutor. And then Timerman's wife said there was, after all, a reason for it: ''Luis never loses.

HEADLINE: A Piece of the Puzzle 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Virginia Postrel's review of William Easterly's ''White Man's Burden'' (March 19) has much in common with the book itself. Both are thoughtful and courageous attempts to explain why recent calls to ''make poverty history'' by quadrupling aid will disrupt more than assist citizens in the fragile, neocolonial political economies of Africa. Both, though, struggle for solutions because they treat poverty as a technical, rather than a deeply political, problem. 
 The primary purpose of foreign aid, as it has been since its conception after World War II by European nations hoping to bind their colonies to them in fact if not name, is to maintain the military and economic power of the rich nations by buying cooperation and forestalling state failure and radical challenges. For the United States and France in particular, with their far-flung military forces and investments and their policy of not trusting to markets for their strategic minerals, efforts to ''end poverty'' are just a small piece that must fit itself into the foreign-aid puzzle.
 Development within the framework of domination is as unlikely today as it was in 19th-century British-ruled India, 20th-century French-ruled West Africa or apartheid South Africa, all of which had legions of development experts and substantial antipoverty programs. Widespread poverty will remain part of the world economy until the United States and other rich nations stop propping up cooperative regimes that spur civil wars and stop blocking countries' transitions from producing raw materials to refining and retailing. Even then, as shown by the persistence of poverty in the booming economies of countries like China, India and South Africa, ''making poverty history'' will depend on governments' choices about sharing opportunity with the poor during the painful shift from a traditional to a modern economy. 
 To talk of reducing poverty is fine, but to talk of ending it before there are changes in power relations between and within countries is silly. A quick look at the pledge by the World Bank president, Paul Wolfowitz, to change Africa ''from a continent of despair to a continent of hope'' shows why. African commentators were bemused by this pledge, since most Africans live in modest but functional fashion, and much of what despair does exist can be traced to Wolfowitz's current and previous employers. The World Bank, controlled by its United States and European majority, helps trap Africa in its low-growth role as exporter of raw materials, and the worst poverty is found in refugee camps created by civil wars against thugs who were armed and aided in return for cooperating with American military, covert and mineral operations: Savimbi in Angola, Mobutu in the Congo, Doe in Liberia, Barre in Somalia and Nimeiry in the Sudan. Today's American aid to regimes that cooperate with the ''war on terrorism'' plants the seeds for the civil wars, and the poverty, of the future.

 BODY:
FAIR TRADE FOR ALL
 How Trade Can Promote Development.
 By Joseph E. Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton.
 315 pp. Oxford University Press. $30.
It is not exactly a new debate. On my bookshelf sits ''Which? Protection or Free Trade,'' edited by H. W. Furber and published in Boston in 1888. That was some 70 years after the British economist David Ricardo first suggested that the gains from trade exceed the losses regardless of whether trading partners are more or less economically advanced, as each nation shifts to where it has a comparative advantage. Most economists and policy makers now accept Ricardo's argument, although the popular debate over the merits of free trade continues. 
 The new and more interesting debate is about how the benefits of trade should be shared. During the 1990's, the so-called Washington consensus of officials from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and United States Treasury Department thought the best way to spur growth in developing nations was for them to quickly lower their trade barriers and deregulate their markets. But that prescription hasn't worked especially well, even though it still shapes American trade policy. Apart from China and India, the gap between rich and poor nations has continued to widen. More than two billion people worldwide live on the equivalent of less than a dollar a day. Trade talks initiated in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, were intended to redress the balance but have gone nowhere. The last major international meeting, in 2003 in Cancun, Mexico, ended in failure and recrimination, and there's been little progress since. The world's poorer nations think the richer ones are still offering a lousy deal.
 In their provocative book, ''Fair Trade for All,'' Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia, and Andrew Charlton, a research officer at the London School of Economics, argue that the poorer nations are right. A better deal would be for them to move toward free trade gradually, each according to its own particular circumstances. The authors urge richer nations to help poorer ones prepare themselves for trade, while dismantling their own trade barriers, which prevent developing nations from selling them many goods and services. 
 Stiglitz is worth listening to. A winner of the Nobel in economic science in 2001 for his pioneering work in the economics of information, he was a member and then chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1997 (during which time, in the interest of full disclosure, we frequently attended the same White House meetings), thereafter becoming chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank. In other words, Stiglitz was in Washington when the Washington consensus was formed. He was a dissenter, however, and in recent years has been an outspoken critic of Washington's trade and global investment policies.
 Stiglitz and Charlton show that standard economic assumptions are wrong when it comes to many developing economies. When markets in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere are opened, people often can't move easily to new industries where the nation has a comparative advantage. Transportation systems that might get them there are often primitive, housing is inadequate and job training is scarce. They're vulnerable in the meantime because safety nets are weak or nonexistent. Most people lack access to credit or insurance because financial institutions are frail, so they're unable to start their own businesses or otherwise take advantage of new opportunities that trade might bring. Many poor countries are already plagued by high unemployment, and job losses in the newly traded sector might just add to it. 
 Hence, the authors argue, the pace at which poorer nations open their markets to trade should coincide with the development of new institutions -- roads, schools, banks and the like -- that make such transitions easier and generate real opportunities. Since many poor nations can't afford the investments required to build these institutions, rich nations have a responsibility to help.
 Without these other institutions in place, the authors say, trade by itself can do more harm than good. They point out that inequality increased after trade was liberalized in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay. Ten years after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, Mexico's real wages are lower than they were before, and both inequality and poverty have grown. Many of the manufacturing jobs that came to Mexico in the wake of Nafta have since been lost to China, partly because China invested heavily in education and infrastructure while Mexico, lacking tariff revenues, couldn't afford to do so. According to Stiglitz and Charlton, every developing country that has succeeded in achieving rapid growth has protected its market to some extent until it was ready to dismantle trade barriers. China's growth, for example, escalated in the 1970's, before it lowered its barriers.
 Moreover, they warn, one size does not fit all. Richer nations should not force all poorer nations to abide by the same market-opening rules and timetables. Poorer nations have different needs. They are at different stages of economic development (subsistence agriculture in much of Africa and parts of Asia, export-oriented agriculture in Latin America and other parts of Asia, early-stage industrialization elsewhere). They have different political and institutional capacities.
 Richer nations should also help developing nations get a fair share of the benefits of trade, Stiglitz and Charlton write, by reforming themselves. They should no longer protect their own textile producers, subsidize their farmers (the American farm bill of 2002 increased farm payments by some $83 billion over previous bills), shield their maritime and construction industries, or impose fines on poor nations for allegedly ''dumping'' exports at below-market rates. More broadly, the authors suggest, all nations that have joined the World Trade Organization should make a commitment to giving complete free-market access to all developing countries poorer and smaller than themselves. Finally, richer nations should allow unskilled workers from poorer nations to migrate temporarily, thereby earning money they can send home.
 Surprisingly, though Stiglitz has spent some years in Washington, he doesn't answer the obvious next question: How can this commendable agenda be sold to richer nations? Their political leaders are in a bind since so many of their own citizens are also losing jobs and experiencing declining incomes and, rightly or wrongly, blaming globalization for their plight. This is one of the major reasons the antiglobalization movement is as strong in the developed world as in the developing. It was, after all, Americans who marched and demonstrated against the World Trade Organization in Seattle in December 1999, at what was to have been the start of the new round of trade liberalization. And just months ago, with a Republican in the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress and with the solid support of American business leaders, the modest Central American Free Trade Agreement squeaked through the House of Representatives by only two votes.
 While Stiglitz and Charlton nobly assert that trade agreements should be viewed as presumptively unfair if they bestow disproportionate benefits on richer nations, they fail to acknowledge that within richer nations free trade is already disproportionately benefiting the best educated and best connected. Thewealthy are growing much wealthier while the middle class is being squeezed. In fact, the adjustment mechanisms the authors find lacking in most developing economies -- good public schools, modern infrastructure and adequate social safety nets -- are coming to be less and less available even in America. Free trade surely generates the gains Ricardo claimed for it. But until those gains are more widely shared -- within richer countries as well as between richer and poorer -- we can kiss any further round of trade liberalization goodbye.

HEADLINE: Filling in the Tax Gap

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt.

 BODY:
Mr. Szilagyi's Billion-Dollar Idea
 This is the time of year when American citizens inevitably think about the Internal Revenue Service and, also inevitably, about how deeply they hate it. But most people who hate the I.R.S. probably do so for the wrong reasons. They think it is a tough and cruel agency, but in fact it is not nearly as tough and cruel as it should be.
The first thing to remember is that the I.R.S. doesn't write the tax code. The agency is quick to point its finger at the true villain: ''In the United States, the Congress passes tax laws and requires taxpayers to comply,'' its mission statement says. ''The I.R.S. role is to help the large majority of compliant taxpayers with the tax law, while ensuring that the minority who are unwilling to comply pay their fair share.'' 
 So the I.R.S. is like a street cop or, more precisely, the biggest fleet of street cops in the world, who are asked to enforce laws written by a few hundred people on behalf of a few hundred million people, a great many of whom find these laws too complex, too expensive and unfair. 
 And yet most Americans say they are proud to pay their taxes. In an independent poll conducted last year for the I.R.S. Oversight Board, 96 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement ''It is every American's civic duty to pay their fair share of taxes,'' while 93 percent agreed that everyone ''who cheats on their taxes should be held accountable.'' On the other hand, when asked what influences their decision to report and pay taxes honestly, 62 percent answered ''fear of an audit,'' while 68 percent said it was the fact that their income was already being reported to the I.R.S. by third parties. For all the civic duty floating around, it would seem that most compliance is determined by good old-fashioned incentives.
 So which of these incentives work and which do not? To find out, the I.R.S. conducted the National Research Program, a three-year study during which 46,000 randomly selected 2001 tax returns were intensively reviewed. (The I.R.S. doesn't specify what these 46,000 people were subjected to, but it may well have been the kind of inquisition that has earned the agency its horrid reputation.) Using this sample, the study found a tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid -- of $345 billion, or nearly one-fifth of all taxes collected by the I.R.S. This sum happens to be just a few billion dollars less than the projected federal budget deficit for 2007; it also amounts to more than $1,000 worth of cheating by every man, woman and child in the U.S. 
 But most people aren't cheating. And when you take a look at who does cheat and who doesn't, it becomes pretty clear just why people pay their taxes at all. The key statistic in the I.R.S.'s study is called the Net Misreporting Percentage. It measures the amount that was misreported on every major line item on those 46,000 returns. In the ''wages, salaries, tips'' category, for instance, Americans are underreporting only 1 percent of their actual income. Meanwhile, in the ''nonfarm proprietor income'' category -- think of self-employed workers like a restaurateur or the boss of a small construction crew -- 57 percent of the income goes unreported. That's $68 billion in unpaid taxes right there. 
 Why such a huge difference between the wage earner and a restaurateur? Simple: The only person reporting the restaurateur's income to the I.R.S. is the restaurateur himself; for the wage earner, his employer is generating a W2 to let the I.R.S. know exactly how much he has been paid. And the wage earner's taxes are automatically withheld from his every check, while the restaurateur has all year to decide if, and how much, he will pay. 
 Does this mean that the average self-employed worker is less honest than the average wage earner? Not necessarily. It's just that he has much more incentive to cheat. He knows that the only chance the I.R.S. has of learning his true income and expenditures is to audit him. And all he has to do is look at the I.R.S.'s infinitesimal audit rate -- last year, the agency conducted face-to-face audits on just 0.19 percent of all individual taxpayers -- to feel pretty confident to go ahead and cheat. 
 So why do people really pay their taxes: because it is the right thing to do, or because they fear getting caught if they don't? It sure seems to be the latter. A combination of good technology (employer reporting and withholding) and poor logic (most people who don't cheat radically overestimate their chances of being audited) makes the system work. And while it sounds bad to hear that Americans underpay their taxes by nearly one-fifth, the tax economist Joel Slemrod estimates that the U.S. is easily within the upper tier of worldwide compliance rates. 
 Still, unless you are personally cheating by one-fifth or more, you should be mad at the I.R.S. -- not because it's too vigilant, but because it's not nearly vigilant enough. Why should you pay your fair share when the agency lets a few hundred billion dollars of other people's money go uncollected every year? 
 The I.R.S. itself would love to change this dynamic. In the past few years, it has increased significantly its enforcement revenue and its audit rate, despite a budget that is only fractionally larger. A main task of any I.R.S. commissioner (the current one is Mark Everson) is to beg Congress and the White House for resources. For all the obvious appeal of having the I.R.S. collect every dollar owed to the government, it is just as obviously unappealing for most politicians to advocate a more vigorous I.R.S. Michael Dukakis tried this during his 1988 presidential campaign, and -- well, it didn't work. 
 Left to enforce a tax code no one likes upon a public that knows it can practically cheat at will, the I.R.S. does its best to fiddle around the edges. Once in a while, it hits pay dirt. 
 In the early 1980's, an I.R.S. research officer in Washington named John Szilagyi had seen enough random audits to know that some taxpayers were incorrectly claiming dependents for the sake of an exemption. Sometimes it was a genuine mistake (a divorced wife and husband making duplicate claims on their children), and sometimes the claims were comically fraudulent (Szilagyi recalls at least one dependent's name listed as Fluffy, who was quite obviously a pet rather than a child).
 Szilagyi decided that the most efficient way to clean up this mess was to simply require taxpayers to list their children's Social Security numbers. ''Initially, there was a lot of resistance to the idea,'' says Szilagyi, now 66 and retired to Florida. ''The answer I got was that it was too much like '1984.''' The idea never made its way out of the agency.
 A few years later, however, with Congress clamoring for more tax revenue, Szilagyi's idea was dug up, rushed forward and put into law for tax year 1986. When the returns started coming in the following April, Szilagyi recalls, he and his bosses were shocked: seven million dependents had suddenly vanished from the tax rolls, some incalculable combination of real pets and phantom children. Szilagyi's clever twist generated nearly $3 billion in revenues in a single year.
 Szilagyi's immediate bosses felt he should get some kind of reward for his idea, but their superiors weren't convinced. So Szilagyi called his congressman, whogot the reward process back on track. Finally, five years after his brainstorm became the law, Szilagyi, who earned about $80,000 annually at the time, was given a check for $25,000. By this point, his idea had generated roughly $14 billion. 
 Which suggests at least one legitimate reason to dislike the I.R.S.: if the agency hadn't been so stingy with Szilagyi's reward back then, it probably would have attracted a lot more of the anti-cheating wizards it really needs today.

HEADLINE: The Time Trap

BYLINE: By Ann Hulbert. 
Ann Hulbert is a contributing writer.

 BODY:
Since my daughter joined her high school's crew team, I've gained several hours a week of uncluttered time. That's what I tell myself on her predawn practice mornings as I climb out of my warm bed at 4:45 a.m. and then try to savor the dark stillness, a couple of girls nestled quietly in the car with me. That's also what I would report if I was asked to participate in the kind of time-use diary surveys that are the bedrock of two noteworthy recent studies, one on leisure trends and the other on family caregiving trends. The drive to and from the boathouse takes barely 40 minutes, I would say in the hour-by-hour account that surveyors collect, so I'm soon home to enjoy the newspaper in the kitchen, listening to music, with nobody else awake bustling or bothering me. What I wouldn't take the time to explain is that although this sounds like a lovely balance of special solicitude and unexpected solitude (a mother's dream), I seem more susceptible to feeling parental stress than newfound leisure. 
In an era when parents with strollers sit at Starbucks and commiserate about the perfect madness of child rearing, particularly the middle- and upper-class variety, the time seems ripe for hard figures by which to assess our predicament. Just how pressured are we, really, and where do kids fit into the fast-paced flow of productivity and play? It's welcome news that while parents have been boasting and complaining about their juggling feats, experts have been tracking our time in ever more finely tuned daily inventories.
 The bracing surprise is that the sighing over the espressos is overblown. The latest data support neither the notion that Americans are hopelessly overworked nor the concern that kids have been shortchanged as women have flocked to the work force. Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst, economists and authors of the working paper on leisure published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, report that working-age Americans have gained, rather than lost, free time since 1965 -- between four and eight hours a week, with men benefiting most from a decline in work time and women from a plunge in housework hours. Meanwhile, the sociologist Suzanne M. Bianchi and her associates at the University of Maryland have noted that the average employed mother in 2000 recorded the same amount of primary child-care time (roughly 10* hours a week) as the average at-home mom did in 1975.
 But it would be premature simply to herald a slower or cuddlier America. In drawing on the latest, biggest time-diary sweep -- the 2003 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- both studies confront elusive data about just how preoccupied parents are. Eager to capture peripheral as well as primary child-care time, the ATUS posed a supplemental question about how often kids were ''in your care'' that day. The trouble is, soliciting such estimates invites exaggeration. The results indeed don't exactly add up: the ATUS recorded very high amounts of ''in your care'' time -- double the time, for families with children under 13, that adults spent with kids according to their hour-by-hour accounts of their days.
 As the experts tackle the methodological problem, they mirror widespread confusion about a child-rearing mission that can no longer be neatly slotted into the housework category. Now that raising kids is both a high-status avocation (thanks, in part, to fathers' pitching in) and a high-stress obligation (because most mothers also do paid work), how we conceive of child-care time is a puzzle with implications for how we experience it -- not least, whether we end up feeling unusually privileged or besieged.
 On one side is what you could call, at the risk of a sexist caricature, the laid-back-dad view of child-rearing as the realm of fulfilling activities, not chores. It can be discerned in the way Aguiar and Hurst, who chart an overall rise in leisure time, do their data-crunching. Examining the signs of superconscientious nurturing in the ATUS figures, they suspect measurement bias at work: the survey's interest in caretaking may result in hours being categorized as child-focused that in the past would have been coded differently -- as leisure pastimes, for example. So the economists lump all child care -- from the basics to kids' sports and homework help -- in their ''preferred definition of leisure.'' It's the sort of tack, easy for those who luck into more of the fun stuff and less of the drudgery, that drives mothers nuts when dads adopt it. What this vision overlooks, of course, is that child-rearing isn't just enjoyable, or purely volitional.
 On the other side is the more momlike emphasis on the unremitting responsibility of parenthood. Bianchi and her colleagues detect a decades-long trend of carving out time for ever more caretaking, featuring bigger doses of ''interactive'' attention (like reading together). Perhaps that's why estimates of ''in your care'' time soar: when developmentally correct duties call, it's easy to succumb to an all-pervasive sense of duress. What's worth remembering, though, is that such time is also an enviable choice, one that delivers (among other things) the selfish parental pleasures of feeling irreplaceable and, at least intermittently, adored.
 Even, perhaps, at 5 a.m., on my way to the car. Recently, a mother I met years ago in the Little League bleachers -- where she'd rushed from her job at the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- suggested that what Americans may now enjoy more of shouldn't be called leisure, with its connotations of ease. Instead it's discretionary time. For parents, the rub is that it rarely comes at a perfect moment, or feels exactly relaxed. Yet as I get used to that in the quiet kitchen, the time, it's true, seems to expand.

 Hours spent on child care per week.

THE DISPOSABLE AMERICAN
 Layoffs and Their Consequences.
 By Louis Uchitelle.
 283 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.
LOUIS UCHITELLE has long been one of The New York Times's best economics reporters. He has always been eager to put the day's numbers and the month's trends into context, and to pursue sources who have interesting things to say.
 Now he has written his first book, ''The Disposable American,'' about large-scale layoffs and the harm he sees them doing to the country. Uchitelle believes Americans have acquiesced in permanent mass layoffs because of three myths: (1) that they are a necessary step to make companies better, stronger, more efficient and more productive; (2) that it is the laid-off workers' own fault if they fail to find near-equivalent new jobs in the modern economy; and (3) that layoffs are primarily an economic affair that ought to be decided upon by managers looking at their corporation's dollars-and-cents bottom line. 
 To Uchitelle's attack on these three myths I want to say yes, yes and yes. There are numerous costs associated with layoffs that are not measured by their effects on the corporation's bottom line: it's not only workers who get a great deal of the cash flow from a highly efficient productive operation; so do national, state and local governments, as well as businesses in the region that live off the purchases of the workers who are about to be laid off.
 Moreover, older workers have a particularly hard time starting over, turning the skills and experience that made them a good fit at their old jobs into something valuable to a new employer. Subaru doesn't want workers laid off from the Ford assembly line. White-collar middle managers in their early 50's have next to no chance of finding remotely equivalent jobs. Layoffs destroy what is -- or at least what until recently was -- a valuable meshing of worker skills and experience with company operating procedures. A huge amount of human capital disappears when businesses close down.
 And Uchitelle is right when he says mass layoffs do not make the companies that undertake them better. Mass layoffs make them different.
 Consider one of his major examples: the Stanley Works, which found itself under increasing pressure from countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China. ''Customers for Stanley's hand tools were defecting in alarming numbers. The lure was Asian tools . . . socket wrenches, screwdrivers, claw hammers, saws, levels, chisels, pliers and measuring tapes . . . indistinguishable in quality from Stanley's offerings, and at 60 percent of the price.'' The bosses at the company responded by opening some factories in Asia to make low-end tools and by trying to automate production in the United States. But American economic policy mistakes like the big budget deficits of the Reagan and Bush II eras led to waves of dollar overvaluation that left Stanley with almost no chance at all to beat foreign competition.
 So Stanley's directors found a new chief executive, John Trani, to change the Stanley Works from a tool-making manufacturing company into a service-providing money-making machine. Uchitelle interviewed Trani, who told him: ''I call it favored markets.''As Uchitelle explains: ''Selling hand tools was not a favored market. The tools were sold to a wholesaler or a retailer and that was the end of it. Automatic entrance doors . . . were a different matter. . . . What set the doors apart was the need to service the various electronic components.'' Uchitelle writes that ''by 2002, Trani had organized a new Security Solutions division within Stanley.'' The shareholders and directors applauded the turnaround artist, for Stanley now had a chance to survive as it gradually shifted into a high-margin service-sector market niche where foreigners could not compete, but where its corporate tool-making assets still gave it an edge. Meanwhile, Stanley's longtime workers were left high and dry.
 In fact Trani saw no reason for Stanley to be in America at all: he tried, but failed, to reincorporate the company in Bermuda. The name ''Stanley Works'' and the stock market ticker symbol ''SWK'' survive, but Stanley's workers are increasingly electronics maintenance and repair technicians, not blue-collar assembly-line tool makers.
 For Uchitelle, this transformation of Stanley -- this use of corporate assets to find new market niches where the old workers do not fit -- is a bad thing. In his eyes, Stanley's bosses were morally obligated, and in a better world would be legally obligated, to invest the company's resources in directions that promised a chance of preserving the jobs of longtime workers -- even if such investments were, in the judgment of Wall Street, unlikely to succeed, and so would depress the stock price.
 Uchitelle's diagnosis that mass layoffs are a serious national problem is convincing. But for this card-carrying economist, his desired prescription is not. I see no examples anywhere in the world of economies that have taken steps in the direction he desires without severe side-effects. In Western Europe, unions bargained fiercely for job security, and governments enacted ''no firing without cause'' laws, giving workers individually and collectively quasi property rights in their jobs. Yet this did not lead to a happy labor market. Instead, high overall unemployment, extra-high long-term unemployment and extra-extra-high youth unemployment appear to be the consequences of attempts to ensure that managers and workers are in the same boat. Companies that know they cannot lay off groups of workers if demand goes sour are very likely to be companies that hesitate to hire workers when demand is strong.
 Indeed, Uchitelle does not want to forbid all mass layoffs. ''Some,'' he writes, ''are inevitable as American companies adjust to the growing competition from abroad.'' His real wish is for managers to treat their workers as partners and fellow human beings, rather than as potentially obsolete and disposable parts in the corporate money-making machine. But when demand and industrial structure are shifting rapidly, there is a great deal of money to be made by treating workers as disposable parts rather than as partners. 
 Uchitelle wants the government to help. But the government's powers and competence are limited: it can do much more at cleaning up the mess afterward -- in the form of unemployment compensation, education support and job search assistance -- than it can at getting managers, directors and shareholders to ''play nice'' when the financial stakes are high.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Staying Out of Jail

BYLINE: By Kirsten D. Levingston. 
Kirsten D. Levingston is the director of the criminal justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

 BODY:
WHEN he released his budget in January, Gov. George Pataki boasted that New York was the safest large state in the nation. He also proposed programs to help people leaving prison ''become productive, law-abiding citizens.'' Indeed, the governor rightly links a convict's reintegration into society with public safety. 
 But nestled in Governor Pataki's budget is a proposal that would make it far harder for people on probation -- those sentenced to a period of correctional supervision in their communities instead of in prison -- to rejoin those communities and enter the economic mainstream. The governor's plan authorizes every county and the City of New York to pile thousands of dollars in fees and fines on probationers. 
These new fees would pay for the cost of things like electronic monitoring, drug testing and DNA databank submissions, adding more than $3,500 to an already daunting array of financial punishments that include the costs of, among other things, a crime-victim assistance fee and a cash bail fee that people convicted of crimes may face. Moreover, probationers must pay off these monetary obligations before they can emerge from probation supervision. 
 Today, these fees and fines serve varied purposes. Some are intended to punish or make a victim whole. Others are assessed to offset administrative costs, like probation supervision expenses. Still others raise funds that go into government coffers for general use, like the DNA databank fee. 
 Governor Pataki's proposal has nothing to do with compensating victims. It simply allows local governments to offset the cost of supervising people on probation, essentially creating a probationer's tax. Twenty years ago, in weighing the pros and cons of probation fees, the National Institute of Corrections, an agency within the United States Department of Justice, said that fees like these ''represent double taxation: the assessment of a user fee is, in reality, payment for services already supported by general taxes paid by probationers.''
 Strangely enough, many of these fees and fines may be far harsher than the original punishment. Most probationers are not convicted of felonies, but are guilty of misdemeanors, petty offenses not punished by long jail time. Yet failure to pay fees and fines can land them in jail even if their actual offenses did not. While this sounds like something out of a Dickens novel, examples of this are multiplying as fees and fines are increased across the country.
 To be sure, financial punishment sounds like a relatively painless way of being tough on crime. After all, if given the choice between a financial penalty or time in prison, most of us would gladly reach into our pockets. And the state avoids the cost of actually locking someone up when fees and fines replace cell time. But this solution is merely the latest example of a policy that erects barriers to successful reintegration into society for those convicted of crimes. 
 Like the rest of us, many people on probation face multiple financial obligations. They are supporting families, paying rent or mortgages and making sure the lights stay on. Unlike the general population, however, some 80 percent of defendants in the justice system are indigent, according to the Center for Community Alternatives, a nonprofit organization that closely monitors these fees in New York. 
 If a $3,500 debt matters to you, imagine what it would mean to a poor person with a criminal conviction who is struggling to get a decent job and either return to the mainstream economy or enter it for the first time. The mere appearance of a justice system-imposed obligation on someone's credit history can flag a criminal history even if a court has sealed or erased a person's criminal record, or if the conviction information is years old, making it even more difficult to land a job.
 According to the National Institute of Corrections, ''The added stress caused by inability to pay may cause probationers to miss appointments, thus negating any positive effect of supervision and sometimes resulting in revocation for failure to comply with the conditions of probation.'' 
 Acknowledging that fees and fines can be a ball and chain that hold people back, the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit good governance group, has urged states to strike an ''especially careful balance between achieving reparative justice (for the victim or community), meeting the needs of the released person's family and creating a manageable, if difficult, obligation for the individual.'' 
 Governor Pataki's proposal does not strike that balance. It would be folly to proclaim our devotion to re-entry of prisoners into society with the one hand, while imposing financial burdens with the other that will make it harder for them to get jobs and stay out of jail.

HEADLINE: A Paint Job? Yes, and a Painting Job, Too

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BRIGHTEN school walls and brighten students' prospects.
 It's all part of the same palette, according to a group that runs a program in which students in New York City's middle and high schools volunteer to paint the halls, cafeterias and other common areas of older schools in vibrant tones of yellow, green, blue, red and orange.
The nonprofit group, Publicolor, says that besides creating a more energizing learning environment than the institutional grays and tans that the brighter colors usually replace, the project gets many indifferent or misbehaving students engaged with their schools. And it says the project also introduces participants to the habits and discipline they will need in the world of work. 
 For those who advance in the program, the painting tasks are combined with academic tutoring and after-school workshops on career possibilities and, for those interested, on choosing and applying to colleges. Some have received scholarships from Publicolor.
 There can also be a financial reward, which is important because most of the boys and girls in the program are from poor or working-class families. While those on the program's beginner level, who can be as young as 11, are not paid for their work, those on the advanced level, who must be at least 13, can qualify for stipends of $20 to $30 a week. A small number of high school students are deemed semiprofessionals, because of their skills, and earn $20 to $50 for each day's work.
 Participating schools are chosen from among those whose principals request inclusion, and from recommendations from others. A principal's agreement is required for work in a school, said Kelcey Kintner, a member of Publicolor's staff. ''We look to choose schools that are failing academically, have big dropout rates and are depressing visually,'' she said.
 A recent late-afternoon visit to Intermediate School 291 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, one of three schools currently being painted, provided a snapshot of Publicolor's operation.
 Recently, state education officials added the school to a list of those at risk of being shut down because of low academic performance.
 Ten students from the school, including Diontre Cornish, 11, had stayed after classes to paint doors on the second floor a rich blue. Three older students, including Jeremiah Butler, 18, had come from other schools to paint and help guide younger participants.
 ''Painting is a way to interact with other children,'' said Diontre, a sixth grader.
 Jeremiah, a senior at Paul Robeson High School in Brooklyn, said he had found Publicolor's business workshops valuable. ''I want to be an entrepreneur,'' he said, speaking of owning a clothing or record store one day.
 Publicolor was founded in 1996 by Ruth Lande Shuman, an industrial designer who has studied the psychological effects of color. ''I wanted to try to use my talent to help engage disaffected students in their education, so they would not drop out of school,'' she said recently. 
 More than 5,000 students have taken part in the 10-year-old program, most at their own schools, Ms. Kintner said, adding that each project takes several months to a year. About 450 students have moved to the advanced level, which involves painting schools other than their own and homeless shelters, police stations and other city buildings. The program has steadily expanded, with up to nine schools being painted annually in the last few years, and 74 altogether, Ms. Kintner said. 
 Ms. Shuman said she did not know whether dropout rates had declined at schools after they had been painted, but a study of the question is planned. Nor does she know if any former participants had taken up painting as a livelihood.
 The work is done after school and on Saturdays, and business and professional people who support the program often join the students on that day. Publicolor, whose budget this year is $2.1 million, operates largely on donations from businesses, foundations and private contributors.
 Carmen Farina, the city's deputy chancellor for teaching and learning, said she was a ''big fan'' of the program. ''Any organization that encourages kids to stay in school till 6, 7 at night and brings them in on weekends,'' she said, ''is instilling the values we desire.''

HEADLINE: That Sound You Hear? The Market Coming Down to Earth

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO; Reporting for this article was contributed by Ford Fessenden, as well as by Kathleen McGrory in Westchester, Faiza Akhtar and Sophia Chang on Long Island, John Koblin and Nate Schweber in New Jersey and Alejandro Lazo and Avi Salzman in Connecticut.

 BODY:
AS clusters of open-house balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area, from the New Englandy enclaves of Fairfield County, Conn., to the salt-sprayed boroughs of the Jersey Shore, the question remains: whither the housing market?
 Everyone, it seems, has an answer, and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time. If inventory is your gauge, the market is slackening. If prices are your prism, it's still going strong.
But in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents, buyers, sellers and economists, the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth. Prices are still in the clouds, but inventory is expanding and bidding wars, once commonplace, are increasingly rare.
 If the boom is over, there is no bust in sight. ''It's turning,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''It's neither a buyer's nor a seller's market.'' 
 Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill. (There are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers.) Brokers, meanwhile, are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices, and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes.
 ''A few years ago, sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink, and buyers were still coming and buying,'' said Cindy DeRose, a sales agent for Hudson Shores Realtors in Irvington, N.Y. ''It is still a healthy market. But it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work, frankly.''
 Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs. But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer.
 Though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state, there are differences from one community to the next, with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn, at least for now. 
 Frank Anthony, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker in Mendham, called the current market ''town sensitive.'' He compared a Cape Cod in East Hanover that was first listed for $539,000 and sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in Millburn that was listed for $775,000 and sold in two days. 
 Mr. Anthony says he believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met: ''nice house, nice location and nice price.'' 
 For all the talk of a bubble, prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south, with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated. Brokers say the $1 million mark seems to be a dividing line: houses priced for less sell quickly, while houses listed for more are sitting longer and, in some cases, going for less than their list prices.
 The most recent statewide real estate data for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year, but at a less breathless clip than the year before. 
 According to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states, the third quarter of 2004. New York State saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for single-family houses, over the same quarter in 2003; Connecticut, 15 percent; and New Jersey, 18.5 percent.
 By comparison, in the last quarter of 2005, housing prices in New York rose 12.6 percent over the year before, 11.9 percent in Connecticut and 14.6 percent in New Jersey. Westchester County's fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent. And some brokers say that housing prices may be leveling off. 
 ''It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour,'' Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices. ''We're just decelerating. It looks like the market is moving away from its peak.''
 Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit. Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.
 ''There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market,'' said Claudia DeNatale, who recently toured a lackluster three-bedroom condominium in Huntington Station listed for $425,000. ''There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic. When you talk about a drop, it should be significant.''
 What many buyers do report is greater choice. Indeed, inventory -- tight as a noose since 2000 -- is up across the region, sometimes markedly.
 On Long Island, the number of unsold houses in January stood at 23,470, a 67 percent jump from the year before. Inventory in Connecticut also rose. In Fairfield County, the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004. Inventories in some communities (Norwalk, Easton, New Canaan and Darien) were up more than 50 percent.
 New Jersey's inventory swelled, too, up 46 percent in January over the previous year. Westchester had the least growth in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. If you add in co-ops and condominiums, the rise in inventory was 21 percent.
 The chief executive of Westchester County's real estate board, P. Gilbert Mercurio, said the total number of residential properties now on the market is still less than half that of the mid-1990's. ''The real estate boom ate into the inventory in Westchester County, and it is only now starting to rebuild,'' he said.
 Whatever the exact inventory increases, the effect is a more relaxed home-buying environment. Kelly Sabloff has sampled both markets. In 2001, she and her husband, Matthew, relocating from Montreal, bought an expanded Cape for $515,000 in Stamford, Conn. In February, after selling it for $680,000, they moved a short distance to a center hall colonial, for which they paid $747,000. ''The big difference I noticed was the choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff said. ''Granted I was in a different price range four and a half years later. But there was a sheer volume of choice. You didn't have the pressure of, 'If you don't put an offer down, you're going to lose it.' ''
 Bill Hanley, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors and manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, agreed. ''Before, we had one home for 10 buyers,'' he said. ''Now the one buyer can look at 10 homes.''
 For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration. Gary Harman watched in recent years as his neighbors sold Cape Cod-style homes for more than a half-million dollars. At the end of December, he put his house, in East Hanover on the market for $539,000. None of the more than 25 people who went to see it made an offer. He then dropped the price three times, to $499,000, and late last month finally received an offer, which he accepted. 
 He had thought his house would stand out because of the abundant custom wood molding that he installed. ''The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don't even take that into consideration,'' he said. ''You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter.'' 
 Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house. Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say. 
 Lori and Greg Margolis have just put their 1960's ranch in Harrison, N.Y., on the market for nearly $2.2 million. It is sizable: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres. They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a ''complete 1980's abomination,'' by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors. 
 Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation. ''The market's not vibrant now,'' she said. ''It's a nice house, but it's a certain look. The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic. It's very conservative. This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house. People here like English country.''
 Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential. The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate. The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.
 Brokers say buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commutes. More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.
 Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some. ''When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value,'' she said. ''We are very impacted by taxes. I just lost a couple of $3 million customers to Connecticut.''
 Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt. There is Rye, N.Y., on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the ''Mc'').
 Last month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.
 Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew. And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, ''needs everything, everything.''
 But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the office of Country Living Associates in Westport, Conn.
 Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, Conn., on the market for $535,000. ''We sold it instantly,'' she said. But the buyer got cold feet, she said, and failed to move forward with an inspection. Three other buyers expressed interest but faded away, Mrs. Decker said. It was not until late March that a firm offer was made and accepted.
 ''Three years ago,'' she said, ''I think it would have sold -- and stuck -- right away.''

HEADLINE: A Suburban Switch: The Condo's the Thing

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
IN mid-November, Jin Kim and May Yee Yeoung, single professional women who have been roommates for two years, pooled their money and bought their first home, a luxurious two-bedroom condo just off Interstate 95 in Fairfield, Conn., 60 miles north of the rental apartment in TriBeCa where they used to live.
 Two months later, Walter and Lois F. Killough, who have been married 26 years and have two grown children, bought a two-bedroom condo in West New York, just across the Hudson River from Midtown Manhattan. They are slowly moving out of their home in suburban Mahwah so that Mr. Killough can have a shorter commute to work in New York City and Mrs. Killough can be closer to the theaters she loves to attend.
''This feels almost like a vacation home,'' Mrs. Killough, a seventh-grade English teacher, said of her new home at the Hudson Club in Port Imperial, a 200-acre waterfront development that spans five New Jersey cities and towns. 
 ''There's a pool that's right on the edge of the river,'' said Mr. Killough, chief operating officer of Delia's, a retailer of clothing for teenagers. ''There's a whole health club. I can be back home from work in 15 minutes.''
 Although Fairfield and the Hudson waterfront of New Jersey present two distinctly different streetscapes, both sets of homeowners are part of a trend that has the potential to draw a new wave of suburban pioneers to some cities and other densely populated communities. 
 For decades, ornate homes with lush yards and multicar garages have been staples of suburban life and the objects of desire of countless families yearning for better schools, safer streets and greener environs far from the city. But as the scarcity of vacant land drove prices to stratospheric highs and many outlying communities began to impose restrictions to curb sprawl, builders trained their eyes on urban neighborhoods. 
 There they can still buy old or abandoned property at market value, tear it down and replace it with condos, which can be as fancy as a McMansion and as spacious as a single-family home. Though the properties at the high end are not cheap, they typically cost less than a house of comparable luxury and are easier to maintain.
 ''People that used to be able to afford a 1,200- or 1,500-square-foot home in the suburbs are still moving to the suburbs, but buying a 1,200- or 1,500-square-foot condo instead,'' said Tim Cashel, a division manager at Baker Residential, a developer in Pleasantville, N.Y., that is building two condominium communities in Bayonne, a long-neglected city on the Hudson River waterfront.
 ''Condos have become the new starter home for a lot of these folks,'' Mr. Cashel said. ''But because some of these condos are so posh and so close to the city, they have also become a retirement home for many other people who were already living in the suburbs, but were looking to trade their mansions for a smaller place.''
 Developers, spotting an opportunity, have been investing in condo construction at a feverish pace. According to the Crittenden Builders Report, a trade publication, the number of new multifamily condo and town house projects increased by about 50 percent nationwide between 2004 and last year. 
 Much of the new construction has sprouted in urban communities that developers bypassed when they blazed new frontiers deep in the suburbs. Local officials enticed them with tactics like tax incentives, selling public property for a fraction of the price and easing the approval of construction permits. In return, the developers promised to fatten municipal coffers with property tax revenues. 
 ''These days, urban areas are more friendly than the smaller suburban communities because their leaders -- the mayors, the city councilors, the city managers -- they want to see those areas revitalized, they want to see their cities active 24 hours, and the best way to do that is to encourage new construction,'' said Jeffrey Dunne, a vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis in Stamford, Conn., a commercial real estate company that sells buildings for condominium conversion throughout the New York metropolitan area. 
 Suburban cities ''are following the smart growth principles,'' said Richard V. Guarino, dean of the Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University in Hempstead. ''They're creating density where infrastructure already exists, and they're creating this density with mixed-use development in downtown areas, building offices as well as housing so that you can attract young people to live and work there. 
 ''That's critical to the future of these areas because if they're not able to attract young people, they won't be able to sustain their business and economic gains,'' Mr. Guarino said. 
 In the last five years, new condo and rental apartment towers have fueled a renaissance in the working-class enclaves of Union City and Weehawken, which have at least 30 condo projects recently completed, under construction or in the planning stages; and in once-depressed downtown areas of White Plains and New Rochelle in Westchester County, where three condo towers carry Donald Trump's name.
 In Connecticut, condos have brought residents to Stamford's downtown and to an old industrial swath of Fairfield, where a large office and retail complex, Metro Center, will rise along I-95 and across the street from Stone Ridge, the luxury condominium community where Ms. Kim and Ms. Yeoung live.
 Like many of the new condos on the market, theirs is a high-end unit, with stainless-steel appliances and granite counters, 10-foot ceilings and hardwood floors. Ownership comes with free health club membership. Such new luxury condos are not cheap, with prices typically starting around $450,000 for a one-bedroom, and bigger units can cost as much as $1.5 million. Developers are trying to convince whoever will listen that it is not just a home they are selling, but a style of living.
 ''The bottom line is that these people want an easier way to live,'' said Ramin Rezai, project manager at Sterling Plaza Condominium in Great Neck, N.Y., where there is hardly any room for new development. ''They don't want to shovel the driveways. They don't want to deal with the annoyances of a broken boiler.
 ''What they want is comfort and convenience, but they don't want to pay New York City prices for that.''
 That is exactly what lured Ms. Kim and Ms. Yeoung to Fairfield, after a year of renting in Manhattan. The women work long hours at a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., and said they did not want to worry about who was going to drop off their suits at the dry cleaners. 
 ''We have a concierge who can do that,'' Ms. Yeoung said. ''And we don't even have to cook breakfast on the weekends because they serve it at the health club.''
 She added: ''We can live here for two, three years, and we can build a lot of equity. Buying this condo was a great investment. And our home, it looks beautiful.''

HEADLINE: They Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
A PERMANENTLY unfolded futon bed, piles of clothing and the smell of stale smoke make Sean Sciubba's cottage in Sea Cliff, N.Y., seem a lot like a college dorm room.
 ''They call it 'The Studio,' '' Mr. Sciubba, 23, said of the friends who visit, weary of the childhood bedrooms they have returned to in their own parents' homes.
Mr. Sciubba's loftlike converted garage behind his mother's lavender Victorian affords him more privacy.
 ''The only time I see my mother is when I'm in the office,'' Mr. Sciubba said. Both work at Sherlock Holmes Realty in Sea Cliff on Long Island; he is the rental manager and she is a real estate agent. 
 It is hardly news that 20- and 30-somethings are living with their parents, camped in a back cottage or a childhood bedroom. The arrangement passes for entertainment, from the Fox sitcom ''Free Ride,'' about a college graduate who moves back in with his parents, to the comedy ''Failure to Launch,'' starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, about a 35-year-old man who never left home.
 But the cost of real estate is making plenty of strange housefellows, with siblings, elderly parents and children, work mates and friends doubling up to save on the mortgage or rent.
 Some local governments are cracking down on cohabitants who are not related. In extreme cases, where day laborers and other immigrants are crowded into houses meant for single families, they are evicting.
 Even the classic ''mother-daughter'' arrangement -- a single-family home with an apartment added for a parent -- is increasingly likely to be illegal, as the cost of building such an apartment to conform to building and zoning codes can run up to $100,000.
 And yet people all over the suburbs are making shared housing work, with some finding happiness and comfort in living with those they know and maybe even love.
 ''It doesn't feel that crowded since they're all family,'' said Ismama Joseph, 52, who lives in a four-bedroom duplex in Norwalk, Conn., with her husband, two adult daughters, their husbands and the five grandchildren she cares for while the others are at work. ''But it would be impossible with strangers.'' 
 In Fairfield County, Conn., many older people -- ''people who have lived their entire lives in Norwalk'' -- are selling and moving in with their children, according to Carol Ann Falasca, a broker at Coldwell Banker Real Estate in Norwalk. ''Their children went to the schools here and all of a sudden they're retired and they cannot afford to stay because of the taxes,'' she said. 
 In New Jersey, Gordon Crawford, a real estate agent with Re/Max Properties Unlimited in Morristown, said about 10 percent of his buyers have been groups of family members buying together. 
 One such group included Suzanne Rosengold, a single mother, who was living last year with her daughter, Hanna, in a one-bedroom rental apartment in Parsippany in the same complex as her parents.
 When Ms. Rosengold's grandfather died last year, the family inherited a Florida condominium that they sold, planning to use the proceeds for a down payment on a house.
 After looking at dozens of houses, the Rosengolds found a four-bedroom ranch in Lake Hiawatha, a suburb of Parsippany. All three generations moved in last July -- the first time any of them had owned a home.
 The mortgage payment is the same as the combined rents the Rosengolds were paying before. ''It has really changed our whole lives,'' Ms. Rosengold said. ''My daughter has her own room now. Before, she had a converted dining room.''
 Her father, Edward Rosengold, 63, said: ''I do things now that I've never done before. I have my own workshop. I build things, I repair things.'' 
 In another three-generation household, in Fairfield, Conn., Christina and Raul Diaz live in a three-bedroom 1,750-square-foot ranch with Mr. Diaz's 59-year-old mother, Leonor Martinez. Ms. Martinez takes care of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, while they work in nearby Stamford.
 But the household will be growing, Ms. Diaz said. Her mother, Beth Bodnar, 70, who recently retired, is moving in soon, and the couple hope to have another baby next year. 
 Ms. Diaz has been looking for about four months for a bigger house that the family can afford in Fairfield. They need about 2,500 square feet and, ideally, a ground-floor master bedroom, she said. 
 But pickings are slim.
 ''We're probably going to have to put it off another year to save more,'' Ms. Diaz said. 
 The couple are assuming that the real estate market is not going to change at all, she added. ''My big concern is how much equity we can get out of our existing house, because I feel like it's a buyer's market, not a seller's market,'' she said.
 Baby boomers reaching retirement age who want to move to a warmer climate are also increasingly helping their adult children expand their homes or buy a larger house. 
 They don't want to lose total contact with their lives here after moving to Florida or Arizona, said Elayne Jassey, a real estate agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford. 
 Expanding one's living space to accommodate a relative may be a good investment, in spite of the cost of complying with zoning codes and the possibility of higher property taxes. 
 While ''real estate prices have exploded,'' said Robert Campbell, professor of real estate finance at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., construction costs have risen more slowly with inflation. Under those conditions, he said, ''building onto your own house is one of the best things that you can possibly do.'' 
 But where young people are concerned, multigenerational living is often seen as temporary. Matt Wolff, 31, has been living at his parents' home in White Plains, N.Y., for two years since friends with whom he shared an apartment in Bronxville, N.Y., went their separate ways.
 Mr. Wolff is saving for a down payment on a co-op, ''the last bastion of affordability'' in the area, according to his father, Nick Wolff, who owns Century 21 Wolff, a six-office real estate agency based in White Plains.
 ''It's not a problem for us,'' the senior Mr. Wolff said of his son's situation, ''but from his standpoint, he's a grown man and wants to be on his own and have privacy.''
 On Long Island, Sean Sciubba also says he won't stay in his mother's cottage forever. ''I work in real estate,'' he said. ''I've done the research. Hopefully, I'll be able to get out of there soon.''

HEADLINE: Here to Stay. For Now.

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
AFTER living for 14 years on four acres in Bedford, N.Y., Greg Smith and Deborah Dodds were ready for a change. With 9-year-old twins, they wanted a home in a neighborhood, the kind of place where there are lots of kids and a spare cup of sugar is as close as the kitchen next door.
 They found just the place, a four-year-old colonial on a cul-de-sac in the same Westchester town, and they put in an offer, but reconsidered when they could not get what they wanted for their five-bedroom, three-bath home, which they priced near $1.3 million. Rather than move, they have decided to invest in improvements to the home, a 1960's colonial, even though they still intend to move in the next couple of years.
''We don't want to build the Taj Mahal,'' Ms. Dodds said. ''We'll live here maybe two years afterward. We want it to be comfortable and economical.'' 
 It is a delicate balancing act. According to suburban homeowners, designers and builders, remodeling projects are increasingly being influenced by the uncertainty of the real estate market. When do you reach for the stars and when do you stick with the basics? For each homeowner, the answer is different. 
 Ms. Dodds said she and her husband examined their own needs while considering the comments of potential buyers who toured the house. The couple had already redone the kitchen, but, according to the real estate broker's feedback, buyers said they would have liked the house better if the master bathroom had been updated and if the house had a larger family room.
 ''We learned some things by putting it on the market,'' said Ms. Dodds, who runs two businesses from her home, one selling high-end women's clothing and the other teaching scrapbooking. ''It's very hard to compete against new construction.''
 Working with the interior designer Susan Marocco of Bedford, the couple decided to upgrade the bathroom for about $8,000. ''I don't have time to do a gut,'' Ms. Dodds said.
 That is not to say Mr. Smith and Ms. Dodds are not going to make some major improvements. They are planning to expand into the garage to create a large family room off the kitchen and build a separate two-car garage with a second story that could be used as an office or in-law apartment. The cost of that project has not been determined but could be in the neighborhood of $100,000, Ms. Dodds said.
 ''It will help with resale and make us comfortable the next couple of years,'' she said. 
 Like Mr. Smith and Ms. Dodds, Steven P. Grossman is remodeling his home, a 1970's high ranch in Bellmore, N.Y., with an eye to selling it as well as for his own comfort. 
 Mr. Grossman, who listed the Long Island house about 18 months ago, could not sell it, even after he dropped the price $200,000 to $895,000; following the advice of his real estate agent, he had made no improvements before putting the house on the market. This time, he is taking a different approach.
 Based on buyers' negative comments, he created a plan to solve problems while making himself happy. He is replacing windows, altering the facade and putting on new decks. He has plans to upgrade the kitchen, gut the bathrooms and make cosmetic changes throughout.
 To treat himself, he replaced old sliding glass doors with a wall of windows that accentuate the water views.
 ''Every day I walk upstairs in my house and say that's the best money I spent,'' he said.
 Mr. Grossman estimates the cost of the improvements between $100,000 and $150,000 and says he has carefully assessed costs based on the impact the improvements may have on resale.
 For example, while he will be putting new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, he did not go for the top of the line. Rather than removing old cabinetry, he is having it painted and new hardware put on.
 ''I'm hedging whether I'm staying or going,'' he said. ''I didn't want to go full bore because one never knows if this is a bubble and when the bubble might burst.''
 Besides the real estate market and their personal comfort, Catherine and Stephen Candland of Greenwich, Conn., had one more consideration as they have restored and updated their turn of the century Arts and Crafts home for nearly 10 years: maintaining the architectural integrity of the house.
 Their major projects included turning an addition that once housed a doctor's office into a kitchen, family room, spare guest rooms and office. The third-floor attic was turned into bedrooms for two daughters, a family room, bathroom and laundry room. A master bedroom was created, a pool and patio added and numerous small steps taken to restore architectural features to the home.
 Now, with three daughters ages 13, 17 and 20, the Candlands think they are short-timers in the house. As they move forward on what will probably be their final major project, working with Stephanie Ladoff-Koch, the owner of Ladd Design of New Canaan, Conn., they are also factoring in how far they want to go in an uncertain market.
 ''We could have spent twice or even three times what we were going to spend on this project,'' Ms. Candland said. ''We decided we would balance it with our original three goals. 
 ''Historically Greenwich has held its value, but I think a number of things are happening in Connecticut and it's naive to assume that things won't slow down.''
 While they knew they wanted to take down a wall to open up the entryway, a decision on whether to add a stone gas fireplace had to be carefully weighed against what it would cost to open a hidden flue. 
 The Candlands decided to go with a fireplace, but chose electric, an alternative that would not require opening up the flue. 
 For some homeowners, especially those who expect to be staying put for a while, comfort outweighs the investment factor in home improvement. Darlene Branch and her husband, Leonard, of Orange, had hoped to move to a community with a better school system but found themselves priced out of the market in nearby places like Montclair and Glen Ridge and are considering private school for their children.
 For now, they are altering their six-bedroom Victorian home to better suit their needs as well as those of their 4-year-old twins. Ms. Branch said they went ahead with a $16,000 basement remodeling so the children would have a place to play, even though she was told the improvement would not contribute much to the home's resale value. 
 The Branches put off a major kitchen remodeling, choosing instead to invest in new windows and convert the oil furnace to gas for future energy savings. This summer she will make improvements to the outside of the house, replacing gutters and painting.
 Ms. Branch is also working with an interior designer, Nicole Bouknight, of Bloomfield to redecorate the children's rooms and the living areas on the first floor.
 ''Even if you did all the renovations in the world, I don't think the market is going to hold,'' Ms. Branch said. ''So we decided let's do what makes us happy.''

HEADLINE: The Other Pension Crisis

BYLINE: By Christian E. Weller. 
Christian E. Weller is a senior economist at the Center for American Progress.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
RECENT concerns about pensions in New Jersey have focused on the budget question: where will New Jersey find the approximately $2 billion it needs to keep its pension promises to state employees this year? 
 That is a substantial problem, but over the long term, it is not the state's biggest. Looming even larger are low levels of pension coverage and retirement security for New Jerseyans employed in the private sector. Over time, as New Jersey workers retire with increasingly inadequate savings, the state's Medicaid and public assistance programs will face a growing burden.
To be sure, the state government's problem must be dealt with. The pension crisis today is a result of two factors. The first is a market change -- the sharp decline in both the stock market and interest rates, a combination unseen since the Great Depression. These bear markets cut the money available to pay current and future benefits. In 2004, New Jersey had 87 percent of what it needed, compared with 111 percent in 2000. The second cause of the public pensions crisis is state lawmakers, who acted just like private employers by taking advantage of technical rules to reduce pension contributions. As a result, pension plans were less prepared for the end of Wall Street's golden years. 
 Faced with a budget deficit of $4.3 billion, Gov. Jon S. Corzine has proposed to contribute $1.5 billion to state pensions this year -- a respectable 70 percent of the current pension obligation. But small changes in how New Jersey finances its pensions can insure the health of these plans for the long run. Among the most important changes is the requirement that the state make regular contributions -- a change that would end efforts to avoid pension contributions when times are good and a change that might have saved us from the current budgetary crunch. 
 Another fix to the system is to end what's called ''padding and boosting,'' a practice intended to increase pension benefits through end-of-career spikes in earnings. This can happen when people take on multiple jobs at the end of their career with the goal of increasing their pension. While ending these practices would save the state only $7.2 million a year according to the Benefits Review Task Force, the great benefit would be the likely boost in public confidence and support for the system. 
 As pensions in the public sector are both sustainable and likely to remain in place, our major concern should be with the frightening lack of pension coverage in the private sector. With only 45 percent of private workers in New Jersey covered by a pension, New Jersey ranks 26th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
 Strategic reforms could go a long way to improving pension coverage in the private sector. Although the federal government will have to take on most of the burden, the state has an opportunity here to encourage and assist employers who might want to provide pensions but are perhaps wary of the costs of administration. 
 For example, the state could establish a separate 401(k)-style fund that would be open to all employers who want to participate. Such a plan could significantly lower the costs of saving for retirement, letting people keep more of their own money. The plan would presumably be large and administered by the state. Investments would be spread out among a variety of stock and bond funds, ensuring lower financial risks than in private-sector 401(k) plans, some of which invest in a single company's stock. Similar proposals have been made for Washington State, under the Washington Voluntary Accounts proposal, and, most recently, for Michigan by Gov. Jennifer Granholm. 
 Any calculation of the exact government savings from better pension coverage is extremely speculative. But better coverage might keep one-quarter to and one-half of low-income elderly residents off public assistance. That, in turn, could reduce state and federal spending on such programs by 5 percent to 10 percent. If such programs were already in place, they could lower government spending in New Jersey in 2007 by $400 million to $800 million.
 While increased pension coverage is the primary goal, New Jersey will probably never reach 100 percent coverage and therefore will need also to encourage saving for those without any formal pension. States can and should play an active role in making it easier for people to save. Some of the strongest proposals to make employees save more are those that make saving more automatic. 
 One such proposal is the ''automatic'' individual retirement account developed by Mark Iwry of the Brookings Institution and David John of the Heritage Foundation. With an ''automatic I.R.A.,'' every company above a certain size, in this case 10 employees, would have to offer automatic payroll deduction into an I.R.A. for their employees. The process would be similar to the direct deposits of paychecks. Employees would have the option to decline, but studies show that when you make someone opt out as opposed to asking them to opt in, most will stay in. Establishing an easy way for people to save would greatly increase retirement security for many workers in New Jersey.
 So by all means, let's tackle the budgetary crisis created by public sector pensions. But as we do, let's not forget the potentially even greater shortfall in the private sector.

HEADLINE: Labor Talks: Don't Worry, There Must Be Something to Fight Over

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
IN most years that are the last of a labor agreement, labor would be the issue that would command the top spot on the list of potentially thorny problems facing Major League Baseball. This year, though, labor will take a distant second place to the thorn in Commissioner Bud Selig's side that is named Barry Bonds.
 Last month, Selig said he'd rather have a root canal than have to answer questions about Bonds. If that didn't put his feelings in perspective, try this: He'd rather argue with Don Fehr about revenue sharing and luxury taxes than have to deal with the problems Bonds has created. Selig will get his chance. 
 The collective-bargaining agreement expires Dec. 19, and the two sides have had background talks. They may begin their negotiations as early as this month. 
 It's much too early, though, to determine where the talks will head and how they'll wind up. The last negotiation, in 2002, was concluded amicably, but every negotiation before that, beginning in 1972, resulted in a strike or a lockout.
 Fehr said last week that he was out of the prediction business, but in response to a question after a speech in San Francisco in early February, he said, ''I'd like to believe the atmosphere of lower levels of public dispute is going to be maintained.''
 Right, until either side proposes something for which the other side has no use. When that happens -- and it will -- the issue will be economic. It probably won't be a salary cap, which the owners, envious of the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., have tried for years to attain. Fehr said in his speech: ''I would be very surprised if we were talking about salary caps. I think that issue is behind us, and that's positive.''
 Baseball has flourished economically in recent years, and the owners would be hard pressed to make proposals based on economic hardship. Industry revenue didn't reach $2 billion until 1997, and last year it soared to $4.7 billion. In the same period, the average salary rose to just shy of $2.5 million, from $1.3 million.
 Obviously, revenues have risen at a faster rate than salaries, and players are making a smaller percentage of the total revenue than they did a decade ago. 
 The problem in baseball isn't industry revenue; it's the disparity of revenue among the 30 clubs. The Yankees generate far greater revenue than the Kansas City Royals and spend far more on players, too.
 That was the point Selig made in a television appearance earlier this year, saying he would seek to increase the revenue going to low-revenue clubs from high-revenue clubs. If there is going to be a labor fight, that effort is where it will probably start. 
 Clubs already share national revenue equally, but unlike the situation in the N.F.L., baseball revenue is mostly local. Under the current agreement, clubs share 34 percent of their local revenue.
 What business is it of the union how much revenue the clubs share? The union cares because the amount a paying club gives up can affect its decisions on how much it will pay its players. The luxury tax figures in that process, too.
 Last year, the Yankees paid more in luxury tax ($34 million) and revenue sharing ($75 million) combined than 28 of the other 29 teams paid their players. The previous winter, the Yankees could have signed Carlos Beltran for a discounted $100 million, but they opted not to because the contract would have cost an extra $40 million in luxury tax.
 That's the sort of thing that bothers the union. Whether it's the Yankees or any other club, if any payment inhibits spending on player salaries, that payment is not attractive to the union.
 Before entertaining any club proposals on revenue sharing, the union will scrutinize how clubs have spent the money they have received. The current agreement states that a club will use what it receives from revenue sharing ''in an effort to improve its performance on the field.''
 Some members of the union are not convinced that all of the clubs who have received revenue-sharing money have followed that provision.
 Fehr has completed team-by-team spring-training meetings and has received the players' views on issues that are important to them. 
 One issue that was discussed was how Selig used his Congressional hammer to force the union into agreeing to a tougher steroid-testing plan in what amounted to an unprecedented second reopening of an existing collective-bargaining agreement (the first reopening was unprecedented as well).
 Selig's stance will probably harden the attitudes of many players and create a more militant attitude than may have otherwise existed. 
 No matter what happens in negotiations, neither side can take any action threatening the season. 
 The agreement reached peacefully in 2002 was unexpected and stunning. When no strike or lockout developed, one person who had experienced nothing but strikes and lockouts felt empty and lost, as he did in 1994 when there was no World Series to culminate the season. 
 A club president had once accused me of favoring the forces of instability, and at that moment there was no instability to favor.

HEADLINE: What's Next? A Zipper Board?

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
THE billboard is 48 feet wide and 14 feet high, but what really sets it apart from the others on Interstate 95 in Bridgeport are the tens of thousands of colored digital lights and images that change every few seconds. It is a bit of Times Square in Connecticut and the second such sign in the state, with more to come. 
 Lamar Advertising, a company in Baton Rouge, La., that owns more than 1,000 billboards in Connecticut, recently put up the first of two full-sized L.E.D. models it has planned for I-95 in Bridgeport. It has had a similar billboard on I-84 in Hartford for about two years. The Legislature passed a law allowing the signs, which are very noticeable, two years ago.
''We certainly don't want a distraction to take away anyone's attention from a moving vehicle on a highway in the state,'' said Sgt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the State Police. ''These boards are very bright and visible, especially at night, and do have a tendency to draw a driver's attention. It's a concern for us, but we have no control over them.''
 Sergeant Vance said that there have been no accidents tied to drivers being distracted by the signs.
 Chris Cooper, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, said that according to the law, each message must be on the board for at least six seconds and the new messages must be displayed within three seconds to prevent drivers from getting distracted, he said.
 Mr. Cooper said the State Department of Public Safety, at a hearing before the law was passed, testified that the boards could be a distraction.
 He also said too many of the boards could become a problem. He said that the law doesn't address this issue, but that the D.O.T. would be watching to see how many would be put up.
 ''We do monitor that kind of signage,'' he said, noting that companies must obtain permits from the agency for the signs. ''Although it's unclear what we would be able to do without legislative change.''
 William J. Ripp, the director of digital advertising for Lamar, said the company had put up about 75 L.E.D. billboards across the country at a cost of about $500,000 each. The signs can display rotating messages, so Lamar can sell the time on each board to more than one advertiser.
 He said the boards were designed to not be distracting. He also said he did not believe there would be a great proliferation of them on the highways.
 ''The cost of these is quite high, so I just don't see the economics panning out in that kind of fashion,'' he said.
 Stephen Freitas, the chief marketing officer for the Outdoor Advertising Association of America in Washington, said there are about 100 L.E.D. billboards in the United States. He said he expected that number to double this year.
 Mr. Freitas said Delaware, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Wyoming are the only states that do not have legislation allowing the boards.
 ''Because this is a new technology, they don't have provisions on the books yet,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Suburban Switch: The Condo's the Thing

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
IN mid-November, Jin Kim and May Yee Yeoung, single professional women who have been roommates for two years, pooled their money and bought their first home, a luxurious two-bedroom condo just off Interstate 95 in Fairfield, Conn., 60 miles north of the rental apartment in TriBeCa where they used to live.
 Two months later, Walter and Lois F. Killough, who have been married 26 years and have two grown children, bought a two-bedroom condo in West New York, N.J., just across the Hudson River from Midtown Manhattan. They are slowly moving out of their home in suburban Mahwah, N.J., so that Mr. Killough can have a shorter commute to work in New York City and Mrs. Killough can be closer to the theaters she loves to attend.
''This feels almost like a vacation home,'' Mrs. Killough, a seventh-grade English teacher, said of her new home at the Hudson Club in Port Imperial, a 200-acre waterfront development that spans five New Jersey cities and towns. 
 ''There's a pool that's right on the edge of the river,'' said Mr. Killough, chief operating officer of Delia's, a retailer of clothing for teenagers. ''There's a whole health club. I can be back home from work in 15 minutes.''
 Although Fairfield and the Hudson waterfront of New Jersey present two distinctly different streetscapes, both sets of homeowners are part of a trend that has the potential to draw a new wave of suburban pioneers to some cities and other densely populated communities. 
 For decades, ornate homes with lush yards and multicar garages have been staples of suburban life and the objects of desire of countless families yearning for better schools, safer streets and greener environs far from the city. But as the scarcity of vacant land drove prices to stratospheric highs and many outlying communities began to impose restrictions to curb sprawl, builders trained their eyes on urban neighborhoods. 
 There they can still buy old or abandoned property at market value, tear it down and replace it with condos, which can be as fancy as a McMansion and as spacious as a single-family home. Though the properties at the high end are not cheap, they typically cost less than a house of comparable luxury and are easier to maintain.
 ''People that used to be able to afford a 1,200- or 1,500-square-foot home in the suburbs are still moving to the suburbs, but buying a 1,200- or 1,500-square-foot condo instead,'' said Tim Cashel, a division manager at Baker Residential, a developer in Pleasantville, N.Y., that is building two condominium communities in Bayonne, N.J., a long-neglected city on the Hudson River waterfront.
 ''Condos have become the new starter home for a lot of these folks,'' Mr. Cashel said. ''But because some of these condos are so posh and so close to the city, they have also become a retirement home for many other people who were already living in the suburbs, but were looking to trade their mansions for a smaller place.''
 Developers, spotting an opportunity, have been investing in condo construction at a feverish pace. According to the Crittenden Builders Report, a trade publication, the number of new multifamily condo and town house projects increased by about 50 percent nationwide between 2004 and last year. 
 Much of the new construction has sprouted in urban communities that developers bypassed when they blazed new frontiers deep in the suburbs. Local officials enticed them with tactics like tax incentives, selling public property for a fraction of the price and easing the approval of construction permits. In return, the developers promised to fatten municipal coffers with property tax revenues. 
 ''These days, urban areas are more friendly than the smaller suburban communities because their leaders -- the mayors, the city councilors, the city managers -- they want to see those areas revitalized, they want to see their cities active 24 hours, and the best way to do that is to encourage new construction,'' said Jeffrey Dunne, a vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis in Stamford, Conn., a commercial real estate company that sells buildings for condominium conversion throughout the New York metropolitan area. 
 Suburban cities ''are following the smart growth principles,'' said Richard V. Guarino, dean of the Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University in Hempstead. ''They're creating density where infrastructure already exists, and they're creating this density with mixed-use development in downtown areas, building offices as well as housing so that you can attract young people to live and work there. 
 ''That's critical to the future of these areas because if they're not able to attract young people, they won't be able to sustain their business and economic gains,'' Mr. Guarino said. 
 In the last five years, new condo and rental apartment towers have fueled a renaissance in the working-class enclaves of Union City, N.J., and Weehawken, N.J., which have at least 30 condo projects recently completed, under construction or in the planning stages; and in once-depressed downtown areas of White Plains and New Rochelle in Westchester County, where three condo towers carry Donald Trump's name.
 In Connecticut, condos have brought residents to Stamford's downtown and to an old industrial swath of Fairfield, where a large office and retail complex, Metro Center, will rise along I-95 and across the street from Stone Ridge, the luxury condominium community where Ms. Kim and Ms. Yeoung live.
 Like many of the new condos on the market, theirs is a high-end unit, with stainless-steel appliances and granite counters, 10-foot ceilings and hardwood floors. Ownership comes with free health club membership. Such new luxury condos are not cheap, with prices typically starting around $450,000 for a one-bedroom, and bigger units can cost as much as $1.5 million. Developers are trying to convince whoever will listen that it is not just a home they are selling, but also a style of living.
 ''The bottom line is that these people want an easier way to live,'' said Ramin Rezai, project manager at Sterling Plaza Condominium in Great Neck, where there is hardly any room for new development. ''They don't want to shovel the driveways. They don't want to deal with the annoyances of a broken boiler.
 ''What they want is comfort and convenience, but they don't want to pay New York City prices for that.''
 That is exactly what lured Ms. Kim and Ms. Yeoung to Fairfield, after a year of renting in Manhattan. The women work long hours at a hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., and said they did not want to worry about who was going to drop off their suits at the dry cleaners. 
 ''We have a concierge who can do that,'' Ms. Yeoung said. ''And we don't even have to cook breakfast on the weekends because they serve it at the health club.''
 She added: ''We can live here for two, three years, and we can build a lot of equity. Buying this condo was a great investment. And our home, it looks beautiful.''

HEADLINE: They Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
A PERMANENTLY unfolded futon bed, piles of clothing and the smell of stale smoke make Sean Sciubba's cottage in Sea Cliff seem a lot like a college dorm room.
 ''They call it 'The Studio,' '' Mr. Sciubba, 23, said of the friends who visit, weary of the childhood bedrooms they have returned to in their own parents' homes.
Mr. Sciubba's loftlike converted garage behind his mother's lavender Victorian affords him more privacy.
 ''The only time I see my mother is when I'm in the office,'' Mr. Sciubba said. Both work at Sherlock Holmes Realty in Sea Cliff; he is the rental manager and she is a real estate agent. 
 It is hardly news that 20- and 30-somethings are living with their parents, camped in a back cottage or a childhood bedroom. The arrangement passes for entertainment, from the Fox sitcom ''Free Ride,'' about a college graduate who moves back in with his parents, to the comedy ''Failure to Launch,'' starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, about a 35-year-old man who never left home.
 But the cost of real estate is making plenty of strange housefellows, with siblings, elderly parents and children, work mates and friends doubling up to save on the mortgage or rent.
 Some local governments are cracking down on cohabitants who are not related. In extreme cases, where day laborers and other immigrants are crowded into houses meant for single families, they are evicting.
 Even the classic ''mother-daughter'' arrangement -- a single-family home with an apartment added for a parent -- is increasingly likely to be illegal, as the cost of building such an apartment to conform to building and zoning codes can run up to $100,000.
 And yet people all over the suburbs are making shared housing work, with some finding happiness and comfort in living with those they know and maybe even love.
 ''It doesn't feel that crowded since they're all family,'' said Ismama Joseph, 52, who lives in a four-bedroom duplex in Norwalk, Conn., with her husband, two adult daughters, their husbands and the five grandchildren she cares for while the others are at work. ''But it would be impossible with strangers.'' 
 In Fairfield County, Conn., many older people -- ''people who have lived their entire lives in Norwalk'' -- are selling and moving in with their children, according to Carol Ann Falasca, a broker at Coldwell Banker Real Estate in Norwalk. ''Their children went to the schools here and all of a sudden they're retired and they cannot afford to stay because of the taxes,'' she said. 
 In New Jersey, Gordon Crawford, a real estate agent with Re/Max Properties Unlimited in Morristown, said about 10 percent of his buyers have been groups of family members buying together. 
 One such group included Suzanne Rosengold, a single mother, who was living last year with her daughter, Hanna, in a one-bedroom rental apartment in Parsippany, N.J., in the same complex as her parents.
 When Ms. Rosengold's grandfather died last year, the family inherited a Florida condominium that they sold, planning to use the proceeds for a down payment on a house.
 After looking at dozens of houses, the Rosengolds found a four-bedroom ranch in Lake Hiawatha, a suburb of Parsippany. All three generations moved in last July -- the first time any of them had owned a home.
 The mortgage payment is the same as the combined rents the Rosengolds were paying before. ''It has really changed our whole lives,'' Ms. Rosengold said. ''My daughter has her own room now. Before, she had a converted dining room.''
 Her father, Edward Rosengold, 63, said: ''I do things now that I've never done before. I have my own workshop. I build things, I repair things.'' 
 In another three-generation household, in Fairfield, Conn., Christina and Raul Diaz live in a three-bedroom 1,750-square-foot ranch with Mr. Diaz's 59-year-old mother, Leonor Martinez. Ms. Martinez takes care of the couple's 2-year-old daughter, while they work in nearby Stamford.
 But the household will be growing, Ms. Diaz said. Her mother, Beth Bodnar, 70, who recently retired, is moving in soon, and the couple hope to have another baby next year. 
 Ms. Diaz has been looking for about four months for a bigger house that the family can afford in Fairfield. They need about 2,500 square feet and, ideally, a ground-floor master bedroom, she said. 
 But pickings are slim.
 ''We're probably going to have to put it off another year to save more,'' Ms. Diaz said. 
 The couple are assuming that the real estate market is not going to change at all, she added. ''My big concern is how much equity we can get out of our existing house, because I feel like it's a buyer's market, not a seller's market,'' she said.
 Baby boomers reaching retirement age who want to move to a warmer climate are also increasingly helping their adult children expand their homes or buy a larger house. 
 They don't want to lose total contact with their lives here after moving to Florida or Arizona, said Elayne Jassey, a real estate agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford. 
 Expanding one's living space to accommodate a relative may be a good investment, in spite of the cost of complying with zoning codes and the possibility of higher property taxes. 
 While ''real estate prices have exploded,'' said Robert Campbell, professor of real estate finance at Hofstra University in Hempstead, construction costs have risen more slowly with inflation. Under those conditions, he said, ''building onto your own house is one of the best things that you can possibly do.'' 
 But where young people are concerned, multigenerational living is often seen as temporary. Matt Wolff, 31, has been living at his parents' home in White Plains for two years since friends with whom he shared an apartment in Bronxville went their separate ways.
 Mr. Wolff is saving for a down payment on a co-op, ''the last bastion of affordability'' in the area, according to his father, Nick Wolff, who owns Century 21 Wolff, a six-office real estate agency based in White Plains.
 ''It's not a problem for us,'' the senior Mr. Wolff said of his son's situation, ''but from his standpoint, he's a grown man and wants to be on his own and have privacy.''
 On Long Island, Sean Sciubba also says he won't stay in his mother's cottage forever. ''I work in real estate,'' he said. ''I've done the research. Hopefully, I'll be able to get out of there soon.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Staying Out of Jail

BYLINE: By Kirsten D. Levingston. 
Kirsten D. Levingston is the director of the criminal justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

 BODY:
WHEN he released his budget in January, Gov. George Pataki boasted that New York was the safest large state in the nation. He also proposed programs to help people leaving prison ''become productive, law-abiding citizens.'' Indeed, the governor rightly links a convict's reintegration into society with public safety. 
 But nestled in Governor Pataki's budget is a proposal that would make it far harder for people on probation -- those sentenced to a period of correctional supervision in their communities instead of in prison -- to rejoin those communities and enter the economic mainstream. The governor's plan authorizes every county and the City of New York to pile thousands of dollars in fees and fines on probationers. 
These new fees would pay for the cost of things like electronic monitoring, drug testing and DNA databank submissions, adding more than $3,500 to an already daunting array of financial punishments that include the costs of, among other things, a crime-victim assistance fee and a cash bail fee that people convicted of crimes may face. Moreover, probationers must pay off these monetary obligations before they can emerge from probation supervision. 
 Today, these fees and fines serve varied purposes. Some are intended to punish or make a victim whole. Others are assessed to offset administrative costs, like probation supervision expenses. Still others raise funds that go into government coffers for general use, like the DNA databank fee. 
 Governor Pataki's proposal has nothing to do with compensating victims. It simply allows local governments to offset the cost of supervising people on probation, essentially creating a probationer's tax. Twenty years ago, in weighing the pros and cons of probation fees, the National Institute of Corrections, an agency within the United States Department of Justice, said that fees like these ''represent double taxation: the assessment of a user fee is, in reality, payment for services already supported by general taxes paid by probationers.''
 Strangely enough, many of these fees and fines may be far harsher than the original punishment. Most probationers are not convicted of felonies, but are guilty of misdemeanors, petty offenses not punished by long jail time. Yet failure to pay fees and fines can land them in jail even if their actual offenses did not. While this sounds like something out of a Dickens novel, examples of this are multiplying as fees and fines are increased across the country.
 To be sure, financial punishment sounds like a relatively painless way of being tough on crime. After all, if given the choice between a financial penalty or time in prison, most of us would gladly reach into our pockets. And the state avoids the cost of actually locking someone up when fees and fines replace cell time. But this solution is merely the latest example of a policy that erects barriers to successful reintegration into society for those convicted of crimes. 
 Like the rest of us, many people on probation face multiple financial obligations. They are supporting families, paying rent or mortgages and making sure the lights stay on. Unlike the general population, however, some 80 percent of defendants in the justice system are indigent, according to the Center for Community Alternatives, a nonprofit organization that closely monitors these fees in New York. 
 If a $3,500 debt matters to you, imagine what it would mean to a poor person with a criminal conviction who is struggling to get a decent job and either return to the mainstream economy or enter it for the first time. The mere appearance of a justice system-imposed obligation on someone's credit history can flag a criminal history even if a court has sealed or erased a person's criminal record, or if the conviction information is years old, making it even more difficult to land a job.
 According to the National Institute of Corrections, ''The added stress caused by inability to pay may cause probationers to miss appointments, thus negating any positive effect of supervision and sometimes resulting in revocation for failure to comply with the conditions of probation.'' 
 Acknowledging that fees and fines can be a ball and chain that hold people back, the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit good governance group, has urged states to strike an ''especially careful balance between achieving reparative justice (for the victim or community), meeting the needs of the released person's family and creating a manageable, if difficult, obligation for the individual.'' 
 Governor Pataki's proposal does not strike that balance. It would be folly to proclaim our devotion to re-entry of prisoners into society with the one hand, while imposing financial burdens with the other that will make it harder for them to get jobs and stay out of jail.

HEADLINE: Here to Stay. For Now.

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
AFTER living for 14 years on four acres in Bedford, N.Y., Greg Smith and Deborah Dodds were ready for a change. With 9-year-old twins, they wanted a home in a neighborhood, the kind of place where there are lots of kids and a spare cup of sugar is as close as the kitchen next door.
 They found just the place, a four-year-old colonial on a cul-de-sac in the same Westchester town, and they put in an offer, but reconsidered when they could not get what they wanted for their five-bedroom, three-bath home, which they priced near $1.3 million. Rather than move, they have decided to invest in improvements to the home, a 1960's colonial, even though they still intend to move in the next couple of years.
''We don't want to build the Taj Mahal,'' Ms. Dodds said. ''We'll live here maybe two years afterward. We want it to be comfortable and economical.'' 
 It is a delicate balancing act. According to suburban homeowners, designers and builders, remodeling projects are increasingly being influenced by the uncertainty of the real estate market. When do you reach for the stars and when do you stick with the basics? For each homeowner, the answer is different. 
 Ms. Dodds said she and her husband examined their own needs while considering the comments of potential buyers who toured the house. The couple had already redone the kitchen, but, according to the real estate broker's feedback, buyers said they would have liked the house better if the master bathroom had been updated and if the house had a larger family room.
 ''We learned some things by putting it on the market,'' said Ms. Dodds, who runs two businesses from her home, one selling high-end women's clothing and the other teaching scrapbooking. ''It's very hard to compete against new construction.''
 Working with the interior designer Susan Marocco of Bedford, the couple decided to upgrade the bathroom for about $8,000. ''I don't have time to do a gut,'' Ms. Dodds said.
 That is not to say Mr. Smith and Ms. Dodds are not going to make some major improvements. They are planning to expand into the garage to create a large family room off the kitchen and build a separate two-car garage with a second story that could be used as an office or in-law apartment. The cost of that project has not been determined but could be in the neighborhood of $100,000, Ms. Dodds said.
 ''It will help with resale and make us comfortable the next couple of years,'' she said. 
 Like Mr. Smith and Ms. Dodds, Steven P. Grossman is remodeling his home, a 1970's high ranch in Bellmore, with an eye to selling it as well as for his own comfort. 
 Mr. Grossman, who listed the house about 18 months ago, could not sell it, even after he dropped the price $200,000 to $895,000; following the advice of his real estate agent, he had made no improvements before putting the house on the market. This time, he is taking a different approach.
 Based on buyers' negative comments, he created a plan to solve problems while making himself happy. He is replacing windows, altering the facade and putting on new decks. He has plans to upgrade the kitchen, gut the bathrooms and make cosmetic changes throughout.
 To treat himself, he replaced old sliding glass doors with a wall of windows that accentuate the water views.
 ''Every day I walk upstairs in my house and say that's the best money I spent,'' he said.
 Mr. Grossman estimates the cost of the improvements between $100,000 and $150,000 and says he has carefully assessed costs based on the impact the improvements may have on resale.
 For example, while he will be putting new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, he did not go for the top of the line. Rather than removing old cabinetry, he is having it painted and new hardware put on.
 ''I'm hedging whether I'm staying or going,'' he said. ''I didn't want to go full bore because one never knows if this is a bubble and when the bubble might burst.''
 Besides the real estate market and their personal comfort, Catherine and Stephen Candland of Greenwich, Conn., had one more consideration as they have restored and updated their turn of the century Arts and Crafts home for nearly 10 years: maintaining the architectural integrity of the house.
 Their major projects included turning an addition that once housed a doctor's office into a kitchen, family room, spare guest rooms and office. The third-floor attic was turned into bedrooms for two daughters, a family room, bathroom and laundry room. A master bedroom was created, a pool and patio added and numerous small steps taken to restore architectural features to the home.
 Now, with three daughters ages 13, 17 and 20, the Candlands think they are short-timers in the house. As they move forward on what will probably be their final major project, working with Stephanie Ladoff-Koch, the owner of Ladd Design of New Canaan, Conn., they are also factoring in how far they want to go in an uncertain market.
 ''We could have spent twice or even three times what we were going to spend on this project,'' Ms. Candland said. ''We decided we would balance it with our original three goals. 
 ''Historically Greenwich has held its value, but I think a number of things are happening in Connecticut and it's naive to assume that things won't slow down.''
 While they knew they wanted to take down a wall to open up the entryway, a decision on whether to add a stone gas fireplace had to be carefully weighed against what it would cost to open a hidden flue. 
 The Candlands decided to go with a fireplace, but chose electric, an alternative that would not require opening up the flue. 
 For some homeowners, especially those who expect to be staying put for a while, comfort outweighs the investment factor in home improvement. Darlene Branch and her husband, Leonard, of Orange, N.J., had hoped to move to a community with a better school system but found themselves priced out of the market in nearby places like Montclair and Glen Ridge and are considering private school for their children.
 For now, they are altering their six-bedroom Victorian home to better suit their needs as well as those of their 4-year-old twins. Ms. Branch said they went ahead with a $16,000 basement remodeling so the children would have a place to play, even though she was told the improvement would not contribute much to the home's resale value. 
 The Branches put off a major kitchen remodeling, choosing instead to invest in new windows and convert the oil furnace to gas for future energy savings. This summer she will make improvements to the outside of the house, replacing gutters and painting.
 Ms. Branch is also working with an interior designer, Nicole Bouknight, of Bloomfield, N.J., to redecorate the children's rooms and the living areas on the first floor.
 ''Even if you did all the renovations in the world, I don't think the market is going to hold,'' Ms. Branch said. ''So we decided let's do what makes us happy.''

HEADLINE: Culture and the Fate of Black Men

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Orlando Patterson would have us believe that some black men are disconnected from the American socioeconomic mainstream because of their membership in a ''cool pose'' subculture that celebrates conspicuous consumption, sexual conquest and violence. He argues that black youth mistakenly believe ''that culture is all there is.'' But they may be right, and he may be wrong. 
A recent study by Princeton sociologists found that blacks were far less successful than were equally qualified whites and Latinos in gaining employment at the bottom end of the New York City labor market. It concluded that discrimination ''continues to represent a major barrier to economic self-sufficiency for those at the low end of the labor market hierarchy.'' 
 It is crucial to place black cultural investments in their proper social and economic context, lest we risk playing down the extent to which racial discrimination continues to block the advancement of black men and women in America today.

HEADLINE: Immigrants and the Economics of Hard Work 

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IT is asserted both as fact and as argument: the United States needs a constant flow of immigrants to perform jobs Americans will not stoop to do.
 But what if those jobs paid $50 an hour, with benefits, instead of $7 or $10 or $15?
''Of course there are jobs that few Americans will take because the wages and working conditions have been so degraded by employers,'' said Jared Bernstein, of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ''But there is nothing about landscaping, food processing, meat cutting or construction that would preclude someone from doing these jobs on the basis of their nativity. Nothing would keep anyone, immigrant or native born, from doing them if they paid better, if they had health care.'' 
 The most comprehensive recent study of immigrant workers comes from the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that, unlike Mr. Bernstein's, advocates stricter controls on immigration. The study, by the center's research director, Steven A. Camarota, found that immigrants are a majority of workers in only 4 of 473 job classifications -- stucco masons, tailors, produce sorters and beauty salon workers. But even in those four job categories, native-born workers account for more than 40 percent of the work force.
 While it might be a challenge to find an American-born cab driver in New York or parking lot attendant in Phoenix or grape cutter in the San Joaquin Valley of California, according to Mr. Camarota's study of census data from 2000-2005, 59 percent of cab drivers in the United States are native born, as are 66 percent of all valet parkers. Half of all workers in agriculture were born in this country.
 ''The idea that there are jobs that Americans won't do is economic gibberish,'' Mr. Camarota said. ''All the big occupations that immigrants are in -- construction, janitorial, even agriculture -- are overwhelmingly done by native Americans.''
 But where they compete for jobs, he said, the immigrants have driven up the jobless rate for some Americans. According to his study, published in March, unemployment among the native born with less than a high school education was 14.3 percent in 2005; the figure for the immigrant population was 7.4 percent.
 While Mr. Bernstein would agree that the least-educated American workers are at a disadvantage, he does not favor curbs on immigration. Even the least-skilled Americans benefit from the presence of a large pool of immigrant workers, Mr. Bernstein said. He said that the 11 million illegal immigrants are consumers, too, creating demand for goods and services and the jobs they produce. He also said their willingness to work at low wages helps keep inflation in check, benefiting the nation as a whole.
 ''It's quite clear that immigrants lead to lower prices of goods and services, and the lower inflation helps boost the economy, and that helps all Americans,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''You have a significant increase in the labor supply due to immigrant inflows, yet the wage effects seem isolated among the least educated, and they're not huge.'' 
 But George J. Borjas, a professor of economics and social policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said he believed that the flow of migrants had significantly depressed wages for Americans in virtually all job categories and income levels. His study found that the average annual wage loss for all American male workers from 1980 to 2000 was $1,200, or 4 percent, and nearly twice that, in percentage terms, for those without a high school diploma. The impact was also disproportionately high on African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, Professor Borjas found.
 ''What this is, is a huge redistribution of wealth away from workers who compete with immigrants to those who employ them,'' he said.
 There is one place and one category of work in which the ''jobs Americans will not do'' mantra appears to be close to true --the salad bowl of California. Tim Chelling, the communications director for the Western Growers Association, a cooperative of big farm operators, said that last winter growers in California's Imperial Valley needed 300 workers to harvest lettuce and broccoli. 
 They went to the local unemployment office, he said, and posted a notice seeking workers, who would be paid about $9 an hour and receive bare-bones health insurance. ''Apparently one guy showed up, and he didn't last through the first morning,'' Mr. Chelling said. All the jobs went to Mexican laborers, most of them probably illegal, he said.
 Mr. Chelling, whose group supports liberalized immigration laws and guest worker programs, argued that the use of immigrant labor was not a question of money, though growers certainly prefer to pay low wages to keep costs down. Farm labor is back-breaking, he said, requiring endurance, dexterity and patience that few Americans possess. 
 Last weekend, some 500,000 people took to the streets of Los Angeles to protest a tough immigration bill passed by the House in December and to put pressure on the Senate, which is debating the issue now. In the crowd were very few African-American faces, noted Ronald W. Walters, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland. Their economic prospects are directly threatened by the huge influx of illegal immigrants, he said. African-Americans are competing for jobs in construction, hotels and restaurants, meat packing and textiles, he said, and they lose out to immigrants willing to accept lower pay and fewer benefits.
 ''The African-American leadership has a lot of angst about this,'' he said, adding: ''It's not just a black problem, but we are the most acutely affected. The fact is, it's hurting us.''
 Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute, said that the American economy is large enough to absorb most of the new immigrants without pushing too many native-born Americans to the margins. 
 But he said the situation could change dramatically if the economy were to enter a downturn, particularly in the housing sector where thousands of immigrants are laborers. If the housing bubble popped, Mr. Kotkin said, competition for the remaining jobs would be fierce and could stoke anti-immigrant sentiments. He recalled the anti-immigrant proposition approved by Californians in 1994, when the state was mired in recession. ''The important factor is the state of the economy,'' he said. ''An economy that is growing rapidly can absorb these people more easily than one that isn't.''

HEADLINE: That Sound You Hear? The Market Coming Down to Earth

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO; Reporting for this article was contributed by Ford Fessenden, as well as by Kathleen McGrory in Westchester, Faiza Akhtar and Sophia Chang on Long Island, John Koblin and Nate Schweber in New Jersey and Alejandro Lazo and Avi Salzman in Connecticut.

 BODY:
AS clusters of open-house balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area, from the New Englandy enclaves of Fairfield County, Conn., to the salt-sprayed boroughs of the Jersey Shore, the question remains: whither the housing market?
 Everyone, it seems, has an answer, and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time. If inventory is your gauge, the market is slackening. If prices are your prism, it's still going strong.
But in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents, buyers, sellers and economists, the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth. Prices are still in the clouds, but inventory is expanding and bidding wars, once commonplace, are increasingly rare.
 If the boom is over, there is no bust in sight. ''It's turning,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''It's neither a buyer's nor a seller's market.'' 
 Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill. (There are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers.) Brokers, meanwhile, are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices, and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes.
 ''A few years ago, sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink, and buyers were still coming and buying,'' said Cindy DeRose, a sales agent for Hudson Shores Realtors in Irvington, N.Y. ''It is still a healthy market. But it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work, frankly.''
 Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs. But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer.
 Though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state, there are differences from one community to the next, with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn, at least for now. 
 Frank Anthony, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker in Mendham, N.J., called the current market ''town sensitive.'' He compared a Cape Cod in East Hanover, N.J., that was first listed for $539,000 and sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in Millburn, N.J., that was listed for $775,000 and sold in two days. 
 Mr. Anthony says he believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met: ''nice house, nice location and nice price.'' 
 For all the talk of a bubble, prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south, with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated. Brokers say the $1 million mark seems to be a dividing line: houses priced for less sell quickly, while houses listed for more are sitting longer and, in some cases, going for less than their list prices.
 The most recent statewide real estate data for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year, but at a less breathless clip than the year before. 
 According to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states, the third quarter of 2004. New York State saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for single-family houses, over the same quarter in 2003; Connecticut, 15 percent; and New Jersey, 18.5 percent.
 By comparison, in the last quarter of 2005, housing prices in New York rose 12.6 percent over the year before, 11.9 percent in Connecticut and 14.6 percent in New Jersey. Westchester County's fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent. And some brokers say that housing prices may be leveling off. 
 ''It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour,'' Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices. ''We're just decelerating. It looks like the market is moving away from its peak.''
 Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit. Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.
 ''There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market,'' said Claudia DeNatale, who recently toured a lackluster three-bedroom condominium in Huntington Station listed for $425,000. ''There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic. When you talk about a drop, it should be significant.''
 What many buyers do report is greater choice. Indeed, inventory -- tight as a noose since 2000 -- is up across the region, sometimes markedly.
 On Long Island, the number of unsold houses in January stood at 23,470, a 67 percent jump from the year before. Inventory in Connecticut also rose. In Fairfield County, the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004. Inventories in some communities (Norwalk, Easton, New Canaan and Darien) were up more than 50 percent.
 New Jersey's inventory swelled, too, up 46 percent in January over the previous year. Westchester had the least growth in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. If you add in co-ops and condominiums, the rise in inventory was 21 percent.
 The chief executive of Westchester County's real estate board, P. Gilbert Mercurio, said the total number of residential properties now on the market is still less than half that of the mid-1990's. ''The real estate boom ate into the inventory in Westchester County, and it is only now starting to rebuild,'' he said.
 Whatever the exact inventory increases, the effect is a more relaxed home-buying environment. Kelly Sabloff has sampled both markets. In 2001, she and her husband, Matthew, relocating from Montreal, bought an expanded Cape for $515,000 in Stamford, Conn. In February, after selling it for $680,000, they moved a short distance to a center hall colonial, for which they paid $747,000. 
 ''The big difference I noticed was the choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff said. ''Granted I was in a different price range four and a half years later. But there was a sheer volume of choice. You didn't have the pressure of, 'If you don't put an offer down, you're going to lose it.' ''
 Bill Hanley, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors and manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, N.J., agreed. ''Before, we had one home for 10 buyers,'' he said. ''Now the one buyer can look at 10 homes.''
 For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration. Gary Harman watched in recent years as his neighbors sold Cape Cod-style homes for more than a half-million dollars. At the end of December, he put his house, in East Hanover, N.J., on the market for $539,000. None of the more than 25 people who went to see it made an offer. He then dropped the price three times, to $499,000, and late last month finally received an offer, which he accepted. 
 He had thought his house would stand out because of the abundant custom wood molding that he installed himself. ''The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don't even take that into consideration,'' he said. ''You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter.'' 
 Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house. Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say. 
 Lori and Greg Margolis have just put their 1960's ranch in Harrison, N.Y., on the market for nearly $2.2 million. It is a sizable property: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres. They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a ''complete 1980's abomination,'' by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors. 
 Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation. ''The market's not vibrant now,'' she said. ''It's a nice house, but it's a certain look. The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic. It's very conservative. This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house. People here like English country.''
 Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential. The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate. The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.
 Brokers say buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commutes. More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.
 Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some. ''When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value,'' she said. ''We are very impacted by taxes. I just lost a couple of $3 million customers to Connecticut.''
 Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt. There is Rye, N.Y., on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the ''Mc'').
 Last month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.
 Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew. And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, ''needs everything, everything.''
 But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the office of Country Living Associates in Westport, Conn.
 Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, Conn., on the market for $535,000. ''We sold it instantly,'' she said. But the buyer got cold feet, she said, and failed to move forward with an inspection. Three other buyers expressed interest but faded away, Mrs. Decker said. It was not until late March that a firm offer was made and accepted.
 ''Three years ago,'' she said, ''I think it would have sold -- and stuck -- right away.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Staying Out of Jail

BYLINE: By Kirsten D. Levingston. 
Kirsten D. Levingston is the director of the criminal justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

 BODY:
WHEN he released his budget in January, Gov. George Pataki boasted that New York was the safest large state in the nation. He also proposed programs to help people leaving prison ''become productive, law-abiding citizens.'' Indeed, the governor rightly links a convict's reintegration into society with public safety. 
 But nestled in Governor Pataki's budget is a proposal that would make it far harder for people on probation -- those sentenced to a period of correctional supervision in their communities instead of in prison -- to rejoin those communities and enter the economic mainstream. The governor's plan authorizes every county and the City of New York to pile thousands of dollars in fees and fines on probationers. 
These new fees would pay for the cost of things like electronic monitoring, drug testing and DNA databank submissions, adding more than $3,500 to an already daunting array of financial punishments that include the costs of, among other things, a crime-victim assistance fee and a cash bail fee that people convicted of crimes may face. Moreover, probationers must pay off these monetary obligations before they can emerge from probation supervision. 
 Today, these fees and fines serve varied purposes. Some are intended to punish or make a victim whole. Others are assessed to offset administrative costs, like probation supervision expenses. Still others raise funds that go into government coffers for general use, like the DNA databank fee. 
 Governor Pataki's proposal has nothing to do with compensating victims. It simply allows local governments to offset the cost of supervising people on probation, essentially creating a probationer's tax. Twenty years ago, in weighing the pros and cons of probation fees, the National Institute of Corrections, an agency within the United States Department of Justice, said that fees like these ''represent double taxation: the assessment of a user fee is, in reality, payment for services already supported by general taxes paid by probationers.''
 Strangely enough, many of these fees and fines may be far harsher than the original punishment. Most probationers are not convicted of felonies, but are guilty of misdemeanors, petty offenses not punished by long jail time. Yet failure to pay fees and fines can land them in jail even if their actual offenses did not. While this sounds like something out of a Dickens novel, examples of this are multiplying as fees and fines are increased across the country.
 To be sure, financial punishment sounds like a relatively painless way of being tough on crime. After all, if given the choice between a financial penalty or time in prison, most of us would gladly reach into our pockets. And the state avoids the cost of actually locking someone up when fees and fines replace cell time. But this solution is merely the latest example of a policy that erects barriers to successful reintegration into society for those convicted of crimes. 
 Like the rest of us, many people on probation face multiple financial obligations. They are supporting families, paying rent or mortgages and making sure the lights stay on. Unlike the general population, however, some 80 percent of defendants in the justice system are indigent, according to the Center for Community Alternatives, a nonprofit organization that closely monitors these fees in New York. 
 If a $3,500 debt matters to you, imagine what it would mean to a poor person with a criminal conviction who is struggling to get a decent job and either return to the mainstream economy or enter it for the first time. The mere appearance of a justice system-imposed obligation on someone's credit history can flag a criminal history even if a court has sealed or erased a person's criminal record, or if the conviction information is years old, making it even more difficult to land a job.
 According to the National Institute of Corrections, ''The added stress caused by inability to pay may cause probationers to miss appointments, thus negating any positive effect of supervision and sometimes resulting in revocation for failure to comply with the conditions of probation.'' 
 Acknowledging that fees and fines can be a ball and chain that hold people back, the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit good governance group, has urged states to strike an ''especially careful balance between achieving reparative justice (for the victim or community), meeting the needs of the released person's family and creating a manageable, if difficult, obligation for the individual.'' 
 Governor Pataki's proposal does not strike that balance. It would be folly to proclaim our devotion to re-entry of prisoners into society with the one hand, while imposing financial burdens with the other that will make it harder for them to get jobs and stay out of jail.

HEADLINE: Hey, I'm Walking Here

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

DATELINE: PUTNAM VALLEY 

 BODY:
FOR Jennifer Girsdansky, life in the outer reaches of suburbia has its charms. Her family's 26 acres allow her 2-year-old daughter, Sophia, plenty of room to roam and her 10-year-old son, Brandon, the chance to go sledding without leaving the property.
 But this car-dependent community, where parents turn into chauffeurs and neighbors cruise past one another at 40 miles an hour, can present challenges as well. Ms. Girsdansky, a 41-year-old single mother, says the neighborhood can feel a bit lonely. Lately it has even felt dangerous.
This summer, Carmel Central School District officials told Ms. Girsdansky that they were moving Brandon's bus stop from the base of the family driveway to another bus stop 75 feet down the winding, heavily trafficked Peekskill Hollow Road. 
 With no sidewalk to shepherd Brandon safely to the new stop, she appealed the decision to the school board and kept him out of class for six days in protest. She was unable to win over local officials, who insist that two bus stops within 75 feet encourage unsafe passing by impatient motorists. So she is now asking the state to intervene.
 But Ms. Girsdansky, a saleswoman, says she is wondering more and more often these days whether Putnam Valley is the place for her. ''I've considered moving a lot, especially lately,'' she said. ''I was definitely thinking more of an easier neighborhood, with sidewalks.''
 Suburbanites like Ms. Girsdansky have a greater number of pedestrian-friendly choices today than they might have had in the past. Faced with growing concerns about the byproducts of a car-centric culture -- social isolation, roadside dangers and just plain lethargy -- planners and developers in the subdivision suburbs are placing a new emphasis on sidewalks. 
 At BelleFair, a planned community in Rye Brook, residents stroll along an expansive web of sidewalks and footpaths to the meetinghouse and deli at the center of the development. In Yorktown, officials are planning a sidewalk that will connect a senior housing development to a commercial center. And in Edgemont, a well-to-do section of Greenburgh, parents are clamoring for a sidewalk on a sometimes treacherous stretch of road leading to an elementary school.
 The trend is by no means universal. Plenty of suburbanites find that their houses of worship and children's schools provide all the community they need. But Jeffrey Zupan, a Rockland County resident who is senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association in New York, said there was a yearning in some quarters for a life beyond car, office and living room.
 ''People who sit on the front porch talk to people who are walking by,'' he said. ''They become more neighborly. It's more like a village rather than each one in their own cocoon, whether it be in a vehicle or a house. And the sidewalk, in a sense, represents that bridge between the street and the house.''
 The push for walkable communities has won support in public health circles: researchers and advocates are emphasizing the role of sidewalks and bicycle paths in combating the nation's obesity epidemic.
 But critics say some of the recent efforts to get suburbanites on their feet are misguided. A favorite target is the New Urbanist movement, a loose coalition of intellectuals, planners and developers who have pushed for dense, walkable communities like BelleFair as an antidote to suburban sprawl. 
 The Florida towns of Seaside and Celebration, the latter completed by the Walt Disney Company in 1996, are most frequently associated with the movement. But its influence has spread across the country in recent years, with communities sprouting up in Texas, Maryland and Oregon, among other places.
 Dorn C. McGrath, a George Washington University emeritus professor of urban and regional planning, says a handful of New Urbanist-inspired developments have worked. But communities like BelleFair, where houses sell for up to $1.2 million, have become enclaves of the wealthy, he said -- and these pale imitations of small-town America have little hope of breaking the nation's love affair with the vehicle.
 ''People just don't sit around on their porches anymore,'' he said. ''Life is different. And the New Urbanists have glorified this thing to the point where it has become a cult. And it is often a cult of the wrong. What they seek is a return to the days of Williamsburg, but without cars and without television and without the Internet.''
 Critics have also taken aim at ''lifestyle centers'' like the long-planned Ridge Hill Village in Yonkers, which will combine retail shopping with residences, sidewalks and an open-air ''town square.'' Detractors say these developments are substituting a privatized, sanitized version of civic life for the ultrademocratic ''sidewalk ballet'' that the urban planning icon Jane Jacobs discovered in her own Greenwich Village nearly a half-century ago.
 Philip A. Amicone, mayor of Yonkers, says the critique of the lifestyle center is misplaced. ''People call it Disneyfied,'' he said. ''Not true. Disney copied it from America. America didn't copy it from Disney.'' 
 But if Yonkers is contemplating an entirely new civic space with the Ridge Hill development, planners and politicians are also seeking to revitalize -- or reinvent -- the street life of the sagging city center.
 In February Mr. Amicone and three developers -- Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse of Baltimore, Fidelco Realty Group of Millburn, N.J., and Cappelli Enterprises of Valhalla -- announced plans for a $3.1 billion overhaul of the waterfront, downtown and Nepperhan Valley sections of the city. The plans, still taking shape, include a minor league baseball stadium, retail and residential development, refurbished sidewalks and a series of river walks along the Saw Mill and Hudson Rivers.
 Wesley (Harry) Perstine, 71, owner of Harry's Shoe Repair in Getty Square, a faded commercial promenade in the heart of the Yonkers downtown, says he looks forward to a new energy in the area. But Mr. Perstine, surrounded by walls covered with black-and-white photographs of Muhammad Ali and Justice Thurgood Marshall, says he is worried that the streets of the new Yonkers could become inaccessible to the working poor. ''Anytime a city begins to rebuild, they're looking for a particular class of people,'' Mr. Perstine said. ''And the people who have been here for years -- there's no place for them.''
 IN downtown White Plains, where the shift to an upscale office and retail center is nearly complete, the concern is not so much with gentrification as with aesthetics and safety. John Nolon, counsel to the Land Use Law Center at Pace University, says the city has made some strides of late. The Galleria mall at the heart of the downtown remains a concrete fortress closed off to the pedestrian, he said, although the newer City Center entertainment, retail and residential complex does a better job engaging the sidewalk.
 Still, Josh Moreinis, a planner who lived in downtown White Plains for five years before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, said the combination of towering office buildings and wide boulevards had ''created a situation where cars are king and pedestrians are targets.''
 Rick Ammirato, executive director of the White Plains Business Improvement District, a coalition of downtown businesses, says the area is not the concrete canyon that critics have made it out to be. Recently added planters and benches have made the sidewalks pedestrian-friendly, he said, and a vacuumlike contraption called the ''gumbuster'' has eliminated most of the sticky spots.
 Brad Kahn, director of the Active Living Network in Seattle, says safe and attractive sidewalks are vital if cities and towns in Westchester and across the country hope to get residents off their recliners. ''The context, the built environment, is really critical to promoting healthy behaviors,'' he said.
 Reid Ewing, a research professor at the National Center for Smart Growth at the University of Maryland, cautioned that race and education are greater predictors of obesity than immediate access to a sidewalk or bicycle path. But a study he helped write in 2003 found a link between sprawl and weight.
 Westchester, one of 448 urban-area counties surveyed in the report, was less sprawling than average. But Mr. Ewing said that was not cause for celebration. ''Better than average in the United States,'' he said, ''is like being one of the smartest kids in a really slow class.'' 
 The county is trimmer than average according to a 2004 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey, with 15.5 percent of residents qualifying as obese compared to 23 percent nationwide. But health advocates say Westchester could afford to shed a few pounds.
 With that in mind, in 2003 county officials began giving schoolchildren pedometers. And since last year, 250 senior citizens and stroller moms have signed up for twice-weekly county-sponsored walks in White Plains inside The Westchester mall, a sort of suburban sidewalk par excellence.
 In Yorktown, Margaret Golebiowski, 79, a resident of the Beaveridge Apartments senior housing complex, gets her exercise walking to a nearby outdoor shopping center to pick up prescription drugs and groceries. But the march along Route 118 can feel dangerous, she said. She looks forward to a new sidewalk that the town is planning along the road to accommodate Beaveridge residents.
 Ms. Golebiowski, an Irish native who immigrated from England on the Queen Elizabeth a half-century ago, said the walk along the busy thoroughfare does not quite equate with her childhood ramblings through the Irish village of Kiltyclogher, where ''you talked to everybody.'' But it does provide a connection to the outside world, she said, and to something that may be even more important for the modern-day suburbanite: ''I do have to shop, you know.''

The war in Iraq has entered a bloodier phase, with American casualties steadily declining over the past five months while the killings of Iraqi civilians have risen tremendously in sectarian violence, spurring tens of thousands of Iraqis to flee from mixed Shiite-Sunni areas.
 The new pattern, detailed in casualty and migration statistics and in interviews with American commanders and Iraqi officials, has led to further separation of Shiite and Sunni Arabs, moving the country toward a de facto partitioning along sectarian and ethnic lines -- an outcome that the Bush administration has doggedly worked to avoid over the past three years.
The nature of the Iraq war has been changing since at least late autumn, when political friction between Sunni Arabs and the majority Shiites rose even as American troops began to carry out a long-term plan to decrease their street presence. But the killing accelerated most sharply after the bombing on Feb. 22 of a revered Shiite shrine, which unleashed a wave of sectarian bloodletting. 
 About 900 Iraqi civilians were killed in March, up from about 700 the month before, according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, an independent organization that tracks deaths. Meanwhile, at least 29 American troops were killed in March, the second-lowest monthly total since the war began. 
 The White House says that little violence occurs in most of Iraq's 18 provinces. But those four or five provinces where most of the killings and migrations take place are Iraq's major population and economic centers, generally mixed regions that include the capital, Baghdad, and contain much of the nation's infrastructure -- crucial factors in Iraq's prospects for stability. 
 The Iraqi public's reaction to the violence has been substantial. Since the shrine bombing, 30,000 to 36,000 Iraqis have fled their homes because of sectarian violence or fear of reprisals, say officials at the International Organization for Migration in Geneva. The Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration estimated at least 5,500 families had moved, with the biggest group, 1,250 families, settling in the Shiite holy city of Najaf after leaving Baghdad and Sunni-dominated towns in central Iraq.
 The families are living with relatives or in abandoned buildings, and a crisis of food and water shortages is starting to build, officials say.
 ''We lived in Latifiya for 30 years,'' said Abu Hussein al-Ramahi, a Shiite farmer with a family of seven, referring to a village south of Baghdad that is a stronghold of the Sunni Arab insurgency. ''But a month ago, two armed people with masks on their faces said if I stayed in this area, my family and I would no longer remain alive. They shot bullets near my feet. I went back home immediately and we left the area early next morning for Najaf.''
 Mr. Ramahi's family and other migrants are now squatting in a derelict hotel in the holy city.
 ''It's almost a creeping polarization of Iraq along ethnic and sectarian lines,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a military specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 In the chaos, he said, ''we see a slow, steady loss of confidence, a growing process of distrust which you see day by day as people at the political level bicker. Everything has become sectarian and ethnic.''
 The shifting violence and new migration patterns are fueling discussion about whether Iraq is devolving into civil war. Although that determination may be impossible to make in the short term, the debate itself could increase the pressure President Bush is facing at home to draw down the force of 133,000 American troops here. Even if American deaths keep falling, polls show the American public has little appetite for engagement in an Iraqi civil war.
 Commanders in Iraq say the insurgent groups in the country, particularly Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, have shifted the focus of their attacks in an effort to foment civil war and undermine negotiations to form a four-year government. ''What we are seeing him do now is shift his target from the coalition forces to Iraqi civilians and Iraqi security forces,'' said Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, a senior spokesman for the American command. ''The enemy is trying to stop the formation of this national unity government; he's trying to inflame sectarian violence.''
 Dozens of bodies, garroted or executed with gunshots to the head, are turning up almost daily in Baghdad alone. The gruesome work is usually attributed to death squads or Shiite militias, some in Iraqi police or army uniforms. Meanwhile, powerful bombings, a favorite tactic of the Sunni Arab-led insurgency, continue to devastate civilian areas and Iraqi bases or recruitment centers. 
 The number of kidnappings of Iraqis is surging because of an explosion of criminal gangs working for their own gain or with armed political groups. Scores of civilians are abducted every week, usually for ransoms of $20,000 to $30,000. In recent weeks, masked men have stormed offices in Baghdad and hauled away all the workers.
 At the same time, American commanders have decreased the number of their patrols and have tried to push the Iraqi security forces into a more visible role. 
 That shift, along with improved armor and bomb detection, may partly explain the drop in deaths. Last October, 96 American troops died. That number has decreased every month since, but fell most sharply between February and March -- to 29 in March from 55 in February.
 Iraqi civilian deaths generally increased in the same period, from 465 in October, according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, which tallies deaths from a range of news reports, a method believed to give rough though excessively low estimates. 
 The broad trend is also supported by statistics on the number of attacks. A senior Pentagon official said that attacks on Americans, Iraqi forces and Iraqi civilians remained around 600 per week since last September but that the focus of the attacks had changed. In September, 82 percent of attacks were against American-led forces and 18 percent against Iraqis; in February, 65 percent were against the foreigners and 35 percent against Iraqis. 
 Top American officials are concerned that despite the growing number of trained and equipped Iraqi security forces being fielded, and the large number of insurgents killed or captured in the past six months, the number of overall attacks has not declined, the Defense Department official said.
 ''It should be worrisome to us that it's still at the same level,'' said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the trend. ''With the number of operations that are occurring and the number of people we are detaining growing, and truly with the number of tactical successes that we're having, you would expect to see a reduction in the trend.''
 American officials say the solution to the sectarian bloodshed lies in the Iraqis' quickly forming a national unity government, with representatives of all major groups checking one another through compromise. 
 But with each political milestone -- the transfer of sovereignty in 2004, two sets of elections in 2005, the referendum on the constitution -- the Americans have asserted that the country would stabilize. Instead, the violence has continued unabated, sometimes changing in nature, as it is doing now, but never declining. And as the resulting migration continues, Iraq's political groups could have even less incentive to compromise with one another, as they separate into their enclaves.
 Many Iraqis say they are fleeing out of fear of increasingly partisan Iraqi security forces.
 The police and commando forces are infested with militia recruits, mostly from Shiite political parties, and are accused by Sunni Arabs of carrying out sectarian executions. One Sunni-run TV network warned viewers last week not to allow Iraqi policemen or soldiers into their homes unless the forces were accompanied by American troops.
 ''The militias are in charge now,'' said Aliyah al-Bakr, 42, a Sunni Arab schoolteacher who had two male relatives abducted and executed by black-clad gunmen in Baghdad on Feb. 22. ''I'm more afraid of Iraqi militias than of the Americans. But the American presence is still the cornerstone of all the problems.''
 Some of the migration is happening within Baghdad, with families moving from one block to the next, from neighborhood to neighborhood, increasingly segregating the capital.
 Others are fleeing across wide swaths of desert. At least 761 families have settled in Baghdad after moving from Anbar Province and other Sunni-dominated areas to the west, according to Iraqi government statistics. The same is happening on the Sunni Arab end -- there are reports of 50 families moving from Baghdad to the Sunni city of Falluja.
 Aid groups have been handing out mattresses, blankets, cooking sets and other gear to families throughout central and southern Iraq.
 Jemini Pandya, a spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration, says it is a short-term response to what could be a more lasting issue. "We've been doing emergency work,'' she said. ''The situation for those displaced won't be resolved anytime soon.''

HEADLINE: Nationalism and Populism Propel Front-Runner in Peru 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: MOQUEGUA, Peru, March 28 

 BODY:
In a presidential campaign filled with symbolism, the front-runner here found a perfect image for his hard-charging crusade: on Tuesday, he jumped on a chestnut mare and, with his followers sprinting behind him, galloped to the central plaza to promise to revolutionize this Andean country.
 The candidate is Ollanta Humala, 43, who was seeking to evoke the image of the authoritarian man on horseback known as the caudillo. He says that if elected on April 9, he will waste no time before cracking down on the multinationals he says cheat citizens and arresting the crooked politicians he says have plundered Peru. As the leader of the newly formed Nationalist Party, he also says he will ally himself with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who wants to form a bulwark against the Bush administration.
 Mr. Humala, whose first name means ''warrior who sees all,'' is as populist as they come on a continent that has been swept by leftist leaders mining popular discontent with free-market policies and suspicions of the United States. His antiglobalization stance and talk of transforming the economy provoke fear in the entrepreneurial class; the stock market suffered its biggest tumble in five years when he rose in the polls. 
 But his message -- Peruvians first -- is compelling to many in this country of 27 million. 
 ''We nationalists are going to found a new country,'' said Mr. Humala, a wiry man with close-cropped hair who campaigns in a red T-shirt that says ''Love for Peru.''
 ''Who is afraid of change?'' he said. ''Are the people afraid of change? No! Those who are afraid are the ones in power because they know if the nationalists get to power, Peru will change.''
 It is a simple, scripted message from which he rarely deviates, repeating it to reporters and his growing following, with little elaboration. The polls show it is working. His approval rating, 11 percent in November, has grown to 33 percent, putting him ahead of Lourdes Flores, a former member of Congress who stands at 27 percent, and Alan Garcia, a former president whose administration from 1985 to 1990 left Peru a shambles, now at 22 percent. 
 Mr. Humala says he hopes that voters in Andean villages, where his support is strong, will help give him more than 50 percent of the votes so he can avoid a runoff.
 ''He's with the people,'' said Victor Herrera, 40, who was among the thousands who followed Mr. Humala on his recent swing through this arid desert in southern Peru. ''He's not like the other candidates, who are with the big businessmen.''
 Though Mr. Humala wants to be thought of as another in a long line of leftist leaders to surge in Latin America, his background is a far cry from that of President Evo Morales of Bolivia, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil or Mr. Chavez, who all grew up poor and spent years building social movements.
 Rather, he attended an elite private school in Lima, served in the army, which has been criticized for widespread rights abuses, and studied in France. 
 Mr. Humala's father, Isaac, founded an ultranationalist movement, etnocacerismo, named after a 19th-century military hero. It speaks of the superiority of the Indian race over those descended from the Spanish, advocates revenge by Indians and mixed-blood Peruvians against the descendants of the Spanish and includes ideas like sentencing corrupt officials to death and closing the borders. 
 His mother said homosexuals should be shot so ''there is not so much immorality in the streets.'' A brother, Antauro, a former army officer, led an attack by 150 army reservists on a police station last year, killing four officers. He was demanding the resignation of President Alejandro Toledo. A thousand soldiers retook the station and arrested Antauro, who remains in custody. Another brother, Ulises, considered by the family to be the standard bearer for etnocacerismo, is also running for president as a candidate of a fringe party, leading to a split with Ollanta.
 Mr. Humala was part of his father's movement, and he and Antauro led a military uprising in 2000 during the last days of President Alberto Fujimori's quasi-dictatorship. ''It's very hard to decide where Antauro ends and Ollanta begins,'' said Cynthia McClintock, a Peru specialist at George Washington University. ''Humala was clearly once in that movement, and the overtones of racism and militarism are certainly very worrisome to people who think of themselves as on the left.''
 But in an interview, Mr. Humala said he had distanced himself from his relatives. ''They are free to express ideas, but I reject them,'' he said. ''My family is the people. The Humalas come second.''
 As he bounds across a stage like a talk show host, declaring his love for Peru, he comes across as a fierce nationalist ready to battle the affluent and anyone who opposes him. 
 He offers little detail about his plans, though he pledges to ''build an alternative model to this neo-liberal model.'' The economy may have grown an average of 5 percent a year since Mr. Toledo took office in 2001, but economists say it has failed to produce prosperity for average Peruvians, leaving many discontent and searching for another path.
 ''The economic model is finished, it hasn't been the country's economic needs,'' Mr. Humala said. ''There's been growth, but no development.''
 He accuses the multinational mining companies that drive the economy of having obtained sweetheart contracts, and he promises to squeeze them. He has criticized Peru's free trade agreement with the United States, suggesting that he would scrap it. And he says he would rewrite the Constitution, which he says favors foreign capital. Instead, he said, he wanted the government to get involved in some private projects, like the Camisea natural gas development.
 Such talk worries the private business sector. ''If he wins the election, I would predict a certain amount of capital flight and a fall in the stock market,'' said Fritz Du Bois, director of the Peruvian Economic Institute, a free-market policy analysis group.
 Mr. Humala, however, relishes the conflict with industry, saying, ''Our motherland is not for sale.'' Still, he is not seen by everyone as the selfless man of the people he paints himself to be. His credibility has been challenged by some of the same people he professes to represent -- the highland Indians who suffered most in Peru's war with the fanatical Shining Path rebel group.
 In the interview, Mr. Humala laughed nervously when asked about accusations that he killed peasants in the early 1990's when he commanded an army base in the conflict-torn Upper Huallaga Valley. A handful of families have filed criminal complaints against Mr. Humala, saying he committed atrocities, from ''disappearing'' their relatives to torture.
 Mr. Humala, who retired from the army in 2004 as a lieutenant colonel, calls the allegations part of a smear campaign sponsored by rivals and ''the elitist sectors who handle human rights themes.''
 ''I have not violated human rights,'' he said. ''This is coming out in the context of Ollanta Humala being the No. 1 candidate nationally.''
 Indeed, Mr. Humala's popularity has not been hurt by the accusations, prompting Mario Vargas Llosa, Peru's most famous author, to question the direction of the country's politics. ''What is happening in the country for such political, moral and cultural blindness to take hold?'' Mr. Vargas Llosa, who lives in Spain, said on a recent trip to Peru. ''Maintain democracy or go to dictatorship: that is what is at play in these elections.''
 A recent United Nations study of Peruvian opinions found that 73.5 percent of respondents believed that the country needed an authoritarian government. Mr. Humala seems to offer that kind of leadership.
 ''We've lost our morals, and Ollanta, with his army background, is the right person for the job,'' said Francisco Carvajal, 50, a laborer in Ilo, another campaign stop. ''I'd like to see him as president. The ones we've had have been liars and thieves.''

HEADLINE: In a Wired South Korea, Robots Will Feel Right at Home

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
South Korea, the world's most wired country, is rushing to turn what sounds like science fiction into everyday life. The government, which succeeded in getting broadband Internet into 72 percent of all households in the last half decade, has marshaled an army of scientists and business leaders to make robots full members of society.
 By 2007, networked robots that, say, relay messages to parents, teach children English and sing and dance for them when they are bored, are scheduled to enter mass production. Outside the home, they are expected to guide customers at post offices or patrol public areas, searching for intruders and transmitting images to monitoring centers. 
If all goes according to plan, robots will be in every South Korean household between 2015 and 2020. That is the prediction, at least, of the Ministry of Information and Communication, which has grouped more than 30 companies, as well as 1,000 scientists from universities and research institutes, under its wing. Some want to move even faster.
 ''My personal goal is to put a robot in every home by 2010,'' said Oh Sang Rok, manager of the ministry's intelligent service robot project.
 Reeling from the Asian financial crisis of 1997, South Korea decided that becoming a high-tech nation was the only way to secure its future. 
 The government deregulated the telecommunications and Internet service industries and made investments as companies laid out cables in cities and into the countryside. The government offered information technology courses to homemakers, subsidized computers for low-income families and made the country the first in the world to have high-speed Internet in every primary, junior and high school.
 As with robots and most other specific technologies, the government has had a strong hand in guiding businesses and research centers. Failures have occurred -- most spectacularly in biotechnology, when the cloning scientist, Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, was exposed as a fraud -- but the successes are many. 
 South Koreans use futuristic technologies that are years away in the United States; companies like Microsoft and Motorola test products here before introducing them in the United States.
 Since January, Koreans have been able to watch television broadcasts on cellphones, free, thanks to government-subsidized technology. In April, South Korea will introduce the first nationwide superfast wireless Internet service, called WiBro, eventually making it possible for Koreans to remain online on the go -- at 10 megabits per second, faster than most conventional broadband connections.
 South Korea, perhaps more than any other country, is transforming itself through technology. About 17 million of the 48 million South Koreans belong to Cyworld, a Web-based service that is a sort of parallel universe where everyone is interconnected through home pages. The interconnectivity has changed the way and speed with which opinions are formed, about everything from fashion to politics, technology and social science experts said. 
 Chang Duk Jin, a sociologist at Seoul National University who has studied the effects of technology on society, said it had profoundly influenced domestic politics. Two years ago, after the opposition-led National Assembly impeached President Roh Moo Hyun, a consensus began forming on the Internet that the move was politically motivated -- two hours after the vote took place, Mr. Chang said.
 ''That quickly led to mass demonstrations,'' he said. ''That kind of thing had never happened in Korea before. Everyone is connected to everyone else, so issues spread very fast and kind of unpredictably.''
 There has been at least one unpredictable side effect: fierce witch hunts. In a case that caused national soul-searching, a woman riding the subway with her dog last year refused to clean up after it defecated in the car. One angry passenger photographed her with a camera-equipped cellphone and later posted the photos. Soon, all of wired South Korea seemed to be on the hunt for ''Dog Poop Girl.'' Several misidentified women were verbally attacked, and finally the woman herself was identified on the Internet and humiliated as the topic of countless online discussions. 
 Such problems have led the government to consider curbing anonymity on the Internet, a proposal that has drawn strong opposition here. In another response, in February, the government released a 256-page ''IT Ethics'' textbook for junior and high school students. Teachers are expected to spend 30 hours instructing from the textbook, whose chapters include ''Healthy Mobile Phone Culture,'' and ''Protecting Personal Privacy.'' 
 ''Education has lagged behind the technology,'' said Park Jung Ho, a professor of computer science at Sunmoon University here.
 The government, though, is pushing ahead relentlessly. It has drawn a precise timetable on specific technologies to develop or invent, one of them robotics.
 Mr. Oh of the Communication Ministry said South Korea lagged behind American, Japanese and European competitors in robotics but was aiming to be No. 3 by 2013. While other countries have focused on developing military, industrial or humanoid robots, he said, South Korea decided three years ago to develop service robots that, instead of operating independently, derive their intelligence from being part of a network.
 Late last year, three types of robots were distributed to 64 randomly selected households, as well as two post offices, with mixed results, Mr. Oh said. In October, a second phase in the testing will put robots in 650 households and 20 public places.
 By 2007, the networked robots are expected to be on the market. Yujin Robot started developing prototypes in 2004 and has sold 100, mostly to universities and research institutes, said Shin Kyung Chul, the company's president. It is the leader in making small, $500 robots that move around the house using sensors, vacuuming or sweeping. They have become popular gifts for newlyweds.
 One of the networked robots -- the two-foot-tall Jupiter with a big monitor in its chest, a round rotating head with big eyes that change shape to emulate emotions -- can recognize faces and voices. Jupiter recited a nursery rhyme and danced, as Mr. Shin explained his vision of a robot-centered ''intelligent society.''
 Kim Mun Sang, director of the Center for Intelligent Robotics, which groups about 500 scientists in a project by government and industry, said networked robots needed a ''killer app'' before they could become fully integrated into the wired society. He said the conditions were not ripe yet and would not be for another ''5 to 10 years.''
 ''But eventually robots could change how we live in a way we can't predict right now,'' Mr. Kim said. ''It's like the PC. No one ever thought the PC and the Internet would transform our society the way they have.''

HEADLINE: Shanghai Surprise

BYLINE: By Nancy Hass

 BODY:
Pearl Lam knows what we think about when we think about Chinese design: ''Fakes. All those counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags. The miles of Prada and Christian Dior. Or Ming chairs, reproduced over and over. It's very depressing. But we can't move into the 21st century unless we confront that.''
To say that Lam, who owns the Contrasts Gallery, with outposts or staff in Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Hong Kong and London, has herself moved past cheap imitation into the current century is an understatement: it would be more accurate to say that she has charged headlong into her own vision of the future. Bankrolling a group of emerging Chinese artists, commissioning pieces from international figures like Andree Putman and Andre Dubreuil, and mounting traveling exhibitions, Lam has made Contrasts not merely Asia's leading showcase for avant-garde objects, but also the place where China's nascent design industry is actually being born. And Lam, the 30-something scion of a wealthy real estate family who wraps herself in Azzedine Alaia and Jean Paul Gaultier, is a glamorous midwife indeed. ''I am only interested in utter newness,'' she says, her accent a hybrid of London private schools and Hong Kong high society. ''I have respect for history, but no reverence for it.'' 
 Lam began Contrasts in 1992, but in the last year the gallery has been riding the wave of international interest in all things Chinese, especially contemporary art. In the wake of decades of proto-Pop and post-Mao irony, a generation of artists is exploring abstraction and installation with vividly original results. 
 Chinese video art and photography are already strong on the world stage. Last year, for the first time, the Venice Biennale included a Chinese pavilion; in the fall, Christie's and Sotheby's held groundbreaking auctions in Hong Kong of contemporary Chinese art, and this spring Sotheby's will hold its first such auction in New York.
 Cutting-edge art has a natural context in the sleek architectural landscape of a city like Shanghai, which Paul Goldberger, of The New Yorker, recently called ''a strangely exuberant version of the 'Blade Runner' aesthetic'' and which Lam calls home base, along with London and Hong Kong. As developing economies go, China firmly believes that the future is carved in granite, neon, stainless steel and glass. What's missing, according to Lam, is an indigenous design culture, the ultimate mating of art and architecture: ''We are just starting out. We don't have the tools or materials to support a high-end industrial design culture. You can't find a laser cutter to cut titanium, for instance, you have to go to a shipyard.''
 Cutting materials by hand, she says, is time-consuming, but the lack of infrastructure has another profound implication: artists can't look for inspiration in the materials and technology itself. That's a particular disadvantage when you're trying to inspire painters and sculptors to think like designers. ''So much of what is great in design stems from seeing what is possible,'' Lam says. To that end, she takes European designers to China and organizes trips abroad for her stable of artists. ''Luckily, the Chinese already understand that art and design are one. In the West, it's only recently that people have accepted that concept, but historically that's the way we have regarded objects.''
 With pockets as deep as her ambition, Lam's investment seems to be paying off: Contrasts was among the blue-chip dealers at Design.05 in Miami, the show held in concert with Art Basel Miami Beach. ''We kept hearing about Pearl from the Paris dealers,$(2$) said Amy Lau, the event's co-director. ''They said she was treading where no one else was, and they were completely right.'' Contrasts drew big crowds, with pieces like Shao Fan's ''Work No. 1 of Year 2004,'' an ''exploded'' Ming-dynasty-style chair whose parts were captured in acrylic and seemed almost to hang in midair. The Victoria and Albert Museum acquired a similar piece by the artist last year, its first purchase of Chinese contemporary design by an artist from mainland China. Among the other attention-grabbing pieces was a huge chair by XYZ Design, a single rippling ribbon of titanium -- hand-cut, of course.
 But Lam isn't the type to sit around waiting to be invited to show her artists' work. Since the mid-1990's, she has organized and financed a series of exhibitions. In 1997, a show on 21st-century chinoiserie featured avant-garde takes on the 17th-century aesthetic. Another show, ''Awakening: La France Mandarine,'' is to travel to Paris in 2009. It explores everything from the French concession, which spurred the explosion of Shanghai Deco in the 1930's, to the dreaded inundation of counterfeit designer products in the 90's. Some Chinese people may have cringed over Lam's comments, which stated plainly that copying had choked off creativity, but Lam remains defiant.
 ''To make people think, to shake up their perceptions, you have to be daring. You have to be honest about the mistakes of the past, not just smile and pretend it didn't happen, isn't still happening. There never has been a tradition of that kind of honesty in China, there couldn't be. Now all that is changing, everything is changing.''

HEADLINE: On 126th St., Harlem Lanes Opens Its Doors, and Alleys

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Siri Cortez was celebrating her sixth birthday at Harlem Lanes yesterday when someone mentioned cake. She immediately put down her bowling ball and turned her back on two pins left standing at the end of the lane. 
 No worries, Siri thought, she could always pick up that spare next year.
''I'm coming here when I turn 7,'' she said with a huge grin. ''I'll knock all those pins down when I come back.'' 
 Siri and the rest of her family joined the crowd yesterday at the official opening of Harlem Lanes, a 25,000-square-foot bowling alley and sports lounge on 126th Street at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.
 It is the first bowling alley in Harlem since Lenox Lanes closed in the 1980's.
 ''I'm excited,'' said Gail Richards, who owns the new establishment with Sharon Joseph, her niece.
 ''After four and a half years in the making,'' Ms. Richards said, ''It's like a new baby being born.''
 By the time the baby has its first birthday, a reservation to hold a party at Harlem Lanes might be hard to get.
 ''Our birthday parties are already booked through June,'' said Ms. Joseph, who was raised in Harlem and still lives there.
 Ms. Richards, a clinical psychologist with the Board of Education, and Ms. Joseph, a former investment analyst, hatched the idea of bringing bowling back to their old neighborhood during a stroll through Harlem in October 2001.
 ''We had been thinking about investing in Harlem and were just going over the possibilities,'' said Ms. Richards, who now lives in Bronxville, in Westchester County.
 ''We wanted to open a business that we thought could be a vital part of the renaissance that is taking place in Harlem,'' she continued.
 On that October day, Ms. Joseph mentioned that her sister, Tanya Joseph, an avid bowler who lives in Harlem, was annoyed at having to travel downtown to bowl in Manhattan, at Leisure Time Bowling in the Port Authority, Bowlmor Lanes on University Place or AMF Chelsea Piers Lanes.
 ''My sister always said that she wished there was a place closer to home where she and her friends could bowl,'' Ms. Joseph said. ''So we started giving the idea of a bowling alley serious consideration.''
 Ms. Richards, who once owned Ambiance, a clothing store in Harlem, liked the idea.
 ''Bowling is a very interactive activity,'' she said. ''It's a sport that is not age- or gender-specific.''
 In the ensuing months, the women made frequent visits to the other Manhattan alleys, handing out questionnaires that asked people where they lived and how often they went bowling. The pair soon determined that many other people were in Tanya Joseph's bowling shoes.
 ''Those other alleys were filled with customers from Manhattan and the Bronx who also preferred to bowl much closer to home,'' Ms. Richards said. ''That's all we needed to know.''
 Harlem Lanes was created with loans from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which is a federal economic development initiative, and the New York City Investment Fund, which is affiliated with the nonprofit Partnership for New York City, as well as financing from equity investors.
 The facility, which the owners said cost $4.7 million to develop, is on the third and fourth floors of the six-story Alhambra Ballroom building.
 It has 24 lanes; a sports bar with large, flat-screen televisions, music and strobe lights; a dining menu; a room for private parties; an arcade room; and a nattily attired doorman.
 ''Harlem Lanes? Third floor,'' he tells visitors.
 The alleys also include additional lounge space, which in late evening lends Harlem Lanes a touch of lovers' lane. 
 ''Oh, yeah, you can find more than just bowling here,'' said Ms. Joseph, chuckling. ''I would definitely say that Harlem Lanes is a good place for singles to meet.''
 ''Not only is this a place where our Harlem neighbors can really get to know one another,'' she added, ''but it is a Manhattan destination for all New Yorkers, and hopefully, for tourists as well.''

HEADLINE: Staying Power Assured, A League Looks to Grow

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
At the beginning of its second decade, Major League Soccer is no longer only about survival. From a feckless minor league in the only true global team sport, M.L.S. is emerging, on several levels, as an enticing and promising soccer frontier. 
 In Europe, the nexus of the soccer world, teams are earning tremendous sums from television contracts and merchandise sales, but they are also losing money because uncontrolled player salaries have skyrocketed. The soccer landscape in Europe looks like baseball's in the United States.
M.L.S. has a budget for players, the type of cost control that attracted Red Bull, the Austrian company that makes a popular energy drink of the same name, to buy the MetroStars in a $100 million transaction. 
 The 12-team league will grow to 13 next year with the addition of Toronto; to 14 in 2008 with a team in St. Louis, Milwaukee or Cleveland; possibly to 15 in 2009 if Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., is able to find financing for a $1 billion development project; and to 16 in 2010 with the addition of a team in New York City. 
 Officials from cities like San Diego and Las Vegas have expressed interest in M.L.S., which has grown adept at playing the competing sites against one another and extracting money from municipalities. (Chicago's stadium in Bridgeview, Ill., was entirely paid for with public money.) The league could also return to the Bay Area, which the San Jose Earthquakes left this season for Houston.
 Los Angeles, Chivas USA, Columbus and F.C. Dallas play in soccer stadiums; Chicago's opens in June. Stadiums in Colorado and Toronto are under construction. The Red Bulls expect to move to their stadium in Harrison, N.J., in 2008, and Real Salt Lake could have a development deal in several months. It is about what the league calls alternate revenue streams, from parking, concessions and concerts.
 M.L.S. will soon announce a new TV deal with ABC, ESPN and Univision, the Spanish-language network. For the first time, the league will receive rights fees. 
 ''We believe we have a business model that works,'' Commissioner Don Garber said of the single-entity system in which the league owns all player contracts and teams can spend about $2 million for players. ''In Europe, the only people making money are the players and the agents. We believe we have momentum, and that things are, finally, rolling our way.''

HEADLINE: In Remote Pakistan Province, a Civil War Festers

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL; Salman Masood contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan, for this article.

DATELINE: DERA BUGTI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Explosions at gas pipelines and railroad tracks are common in this remote desert region. Now, roadside bombs and artillery shells are, too. More than 100 civilians have been killed in recent months, along with dozens of government security forces, local residents and Pakistan's Human Rights Commission say. 
 This is the other front of Pakistan's widening civil unrest, not the tribal areas along the Afghan border where the United States would like the government to press a campaign against Islamic militants, but the restive province of Baluchistan, home to an intensifying insurgency.
It is here, say local leaders and opposition politicians, that Pakistan, an important ally in the United States' campaign against terrorism, has diverted troops from the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban to settle old scores as it seeks to develop the region's valuable oil and gas reserves. 
 One visit makes it clear that, despite official denials, the government is waging a full-scale military campaign here. Rebel leaders say they have several thousand men under arms, fighting what they estimate are 23,000 Pakistani troops. 
 During a 24-hour trek on camel, horse and foot across the rugged, stony terrain in early March, the fighting was plain to see. Military jets and surveillance planes flew over the area, and long-range artillery lighted up the distant night sky. 
 This fight is altogether separate from the Taliban insurgency on Afghanistan's border or the Shiite-Sunni violence that sporadically flares in and around the provincial capital, Quetta, and it threatens to dwarf the nation's other conflicts.
 It is about the ethnic rights and self-rule of the Baluch people, who are distinct among Pakistanis. They speak their own language, Baluchi, which has its roots in Persian, and are probably the oldest settlers in the region.
 In particular, tensions have been aggravated by President Pervez Musharraf's determination to develop the area's oil and gas fields, the largest in the country, as well as his aim to build a pipeline across the region to carry oil from Iran and a strategic deep sea port to expand trade with China, local residents say. 
 They charge that General Musharraf has shown little regard for their concerns and that for years their province has received paltry royalties on its resources, while remaining one of the country's poorest regions. 
 The government has branded two of the rebel leaders, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, nearly 80, and Balach Marri, 40, ''miscreants,'' outlaws who oppose economic development to retain a hold over their tribes.
 In an interview under the shade of a rocky overhang, Mr. Bugti and Mr. Marri, who share the names of the tribes they lead, dismissed the charges. They are not opposed to economic development, they said, but rather to the Pakistani government's military campaign to suppress them. 
 ''The military government has imposed military rule and this has forced the Baluch to defend their land and resources against the might of the armed forces of Pakistan assembled in our area,'' Mr. Bugti said, perched in a carved wooden armchair as tribesmen sat around him cradling Kalashnikov rifles. 
 ''The dispute is about the national rights of the Baluch,'' he added, ''and if the government accepted these rights then there would be no dispute.'' 
 Mr. Bugti and others said that the government was using its American-supplied jets and helicopter gunships against them. They said they had found bomb fragments with ''Made in U.S.A.'' stamped on them. 
 Indeed, huge craters and fragments from American-designed MK-82 bombs lay beside a badly damaged school in the village of Mararar, the results of a bombing raid that the Baluch fighters said had occurred at the beginning of March. 
 Another bombing raid on or around March 14 hit two bulldozers building a road, the fighters said. A collection of bomb fragments gathered by tribesmen from other raids revealed a ''valve solenoid'' made in New York, and part of a gas generator made in Mesa, Ariz. 
 Last year, the Baluch political leaders presented a 15-point agenda to the central government. The demands included greater control of the province's resources, protection for the Baluch minority and a halt to the building of military bases that local residents say have proliferated here. 
 Concern over the issues had been building for years, said Suret Khan Marri, a historian living in Quetta, the provincial capital, and the concerns and violence reach far beyond the Bugti and Marri tribes. 
 ''The movement is there,'' he said in an interview. ''Sometimes it is crushed. Now it is the fifth insurgency, and it has spread all across the Baluch area.''
 Armed resistance by Baluch nationalists has been a repeating occurrence since the birth of Pakistan in 1947, when tribal leaders, Mr. Bugti among them, only grudgingly joined Pakistan after having ruled independent territories under the British. 
 The bitterness today is such that the tribal leaders compare the situation to the 1970's, when Bangladesh broke from Pakistan. ''If grievances have come to this level -- that we do not mind if Pakistan disintegrates -- then things are bad,'' Mr. Marri, the rebel leader, said. 
 The terrain here is marked by harsh, rocky desert, rising into craggy mountains and cut through with narrow gorges that supply many hiding places for shepherds, or guerrilla fighters. In the summer, temperatures soar to more than 120 degrees. 
 The shadowy Baluchistan Liberation Army, one of three armed resistance groups born in the 1970's, has claimed responsibility for many of the recent attacks, including the killing of three Chinese engineers working on the deep sea port, at Gwadar. Mr. Marri said that he did not know who was leading the group, but that it was neither a Bugti nor a Marri. 
 The most recent violence has included summary killings of settlers from the Punjab, whom Baluch nationalists blame for stealing jobs and land. 
 Hundreds of political party members, students, doctors and tribal leaders have been detained by government security forces, many disappearing for months, even years, without trials in well-documented cases. Some have been tortured or have died in custody, say officials of Pakistan's Human Rights Commission.
 A Baluch doctor, Bari Langove, 36, said he had examined a student leader, Dr. Allah Nasar Baloch, in a prison ward in Quetta six months ago and found him so debilitated that he could neither walk nor talk at first. 
 ''He was mentally exhausted and wholly unable to speak,'' Dr. Langove said in an interview in Quetta. ''We examined him and found he had post-traumatic stress disorder, symptoms of loss of short-term memory, insomnia, loss of appetite and energy.'' 
 In places like Dera Bugti and Kohlu, government forces have carried out reprisals against villagers, Baluch leaders and human rights officials say. In a case documented by the Human Rights Commission, the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force commanded by army officers, killed 12 men from Pattar Nala on Jan. 11 after a mine explosion near the village killed some of its soldiers. 
 Two old men from the village who went to the base to collect the bodies were also killed. The next day, the 14 bodies were handed over to the women of the village. 
 Local fighters say the Frontier Corps has carried out 42 such reprisal killings in the last three months, the latest involving six villagers during the week of March 6.
 The government offensive began after a rocket attack on General Musharraf as he opened a military base in Kohlu on Dec. 17 -- an attack for which officials blamed Marri rebels, and Mr. Marri in particular. 
 Shortly afterward, government forces stormed the town of Dera Bugti, Mr. Bugti said, adding that they were burning shops and houses there still, including his family home. 
 The government has played down the fighting, and denies that the Pakistani Army is even deployed in Baluchistan, saying that it is merely using the Frontier Corps to run a police operation to stem violence. 
 In interviews, the police chief, Chaudhry Muhammad Yakub, put the number of rebels at no more than 1,000. The provincial governor, Owais Ahmed Ghani, said 36,000 Frontier Corps soldiers were deployed in Baluchistan, with two-thirds concentrated along the Afghan border. Both predicted that the Baluchistan conflict would be over within two months.
 In all this, Mr. Bugti is an unexpected participant. He has been a prominent player in regional politics for many years and was governor of Baluchistan. He has spent time in detention on charges of murder during a long and colorful life. 
 Educated under the British Raj, he is a man from a bygone era, who said he attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London in 1953. 
 Now, forced to flee his home, he lives an austere life, camping out under the stars with his loyal tribesmen, a Kalashnikov propped by his aluminum walking stick. 
 ''I have had a good and full life,'' he said, unperturbed. ''It is better to die quickly in the mountains than slowly in your bed.'' 
 He warned that the government would be foolish not to negotiate with the senior tribal leaders. ''If we are removed from the scene, I can guarantee the government will have a heck of a time from the younger generation, because they are more extreme,'' he said. 
 One of his grandsons, Brahamdagh, 25, is commanding the Bugti resistance fighters, and he appeared silently every so often to brief his grandfather. He took to the mountains in 2002 with just 50 to 60 men. 
 Brahamdagh contended that he now had more than 2,000 fighters in Dera Bugti and thousands more civilian helpers. He said the Marris had roughly the same number in Kohlu. In addition, small cells of fighters are in every district of the province, he said. 
 ''There are so many groups,'' he said. ''Three to four guys get together and decide what to do, to hit a railway or a bus. We are showing our bitterness. We are fighting the government to show we are not happy with you and you should leave our homeland.'' 
 Mr. Marri, who arrived unannounced one afternoon, on foot and accompanied by a dozen armed fighters, is another of the younger generation. The third son of the leader of the Marri tribe, he has spent most of his life outside Pakistan. 
 In 2002, he returned to run for Parliament but spent most of his time in his home in Kohlu, the capital of the Kohlu district, until forced to flee by the government offensive. ''If they think they can pressure us like this, then they don' t know us,'' he warned. ''The Baluch people have woken up.'' 
 The Human Rights Commission and opposition political parties have urged both sides to seek a political solution to the conflict. Yet at the moment there is no dialogue. 
 Two parliamentary committees set up last year to look into Baluch grievances have stalled, and General Musharraf has been blunt in his determination to use force against anyone opposing his vision for the region.
 In their mountain stronghold, Mr. Bugti and Mr. Marri, and a third leader, Ataullah Mengal, in his home in Karachi, are disparaging about talks with the government. 
 ''They are not worth sitting with at the table,'' Mr. Marri said. ''The general keeps offering peanuts when my rights are at stake. We are not against negotiations, but only negotiations that are worthwhile.'' 
 Mr. Bugti offered his own grim prognosis. ''I don' t see it ending,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Long Safe for G.O.P., House Seat Is Now in Play

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., March 28 

 BODY:
The 24th Congressional District, which winds through the vineyards, farms and small cities of central New York, has sent Republicans to Congress for at least two generations. But this year, the retirement of its longtime incumbent and the growing discontent over the war in Iraq have given Democrats fresh hope of taking the seat.
 The incumbent, Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress, announced on March 17 that he would not run for re-election, after 24 years in office. That has prompted skirmishes in both parties, with two prominent Republicans and three Democrats competing for the seat. 
On first glance, it appears that the district would be a safe one for the Republicans. It has leaned reliably toward Republicans in most elections. No Democrat has been elected to Congress from here since Harry S. Truman's presidential victory in 1948.
 Indeed, Mr. Boehlert assured both President Bush and the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, that he would be replaced by a Republican.
 But Democratic leaders, both here and in Washington, point to a number of factors that encourage them.
 For one, the district has been competitive in the last two presidential elections: in 2000, President Bush carried the district by only 3,000 votes, with 48 percent; in 2004, he won by a still relatively small margin of 17,000 votes, with 53 percent. Furthermore, while the Republicans have an edge in registration, about a third of the voters in the district are not enrolled as either Democratic or Republican and are considered swing voters.
 A conversation with a voter will nearly always place jobs as the most pressing issue in this region, followed by high medical costs, particularly for the aged. But while the economy has been a concern here for years, what is new and prominent is the growing discontent with the war in Iraq.
 ''Jobs are a big issue here, and we really need more jobs,'' said Jason Matlock, 27, a cook at Henry B's Restaurant in Seneca Falls. ''But the war is an issue for everyone. I have friends who are there right now. You had a lot of patriotism from people who wanted to support the troops. But now, a lot of people are against it. A lot of people think we've been there too long.''
 Democratic leaders say they are particularly encouraged by the erosion of President Bush's popularity as the war continues. Even Republican leaders acknowledge that discontent with the war has become an issue here.
 ''It's increasingly a cause for concern for people,'' said State Senator Raymond A. Meier, a Republican who is running for the Congressional seat. ''People feel that they don't know what the plan or direction is for getting out of Iraq.''
 Mr. Meier said the Bush administration should have ''a much more definitive discussion with the American people to lay out what the plan is.''
 He added, ''People don't necessarily want to see a detailed timetable, but they want to see better articulated benchmarks.''
 The residents of the district proudly describe themselves as being in the heartland of the state. The district includes several medium or small cities, like Utica, Rome and Auburn. But much of it is rural, and people here pride themselves in having small-town values.
 Even the television stations post the daily menus for the school cafeterias.
 The 24th, experts say, also is not deeply ideological.
 ''It's not a heavily partisan district one way or another,'' said Philip Klinkner, a professor of government at Hamilton College, in Clinton, N.Y.
 ''Boehlert is a Republican, but a very moderate one,'' Mr. Klinkner said. ''This is certainly a district that may be willing to vote for a Democrat, under the right circumstances.''
 In signs of his maverick ways, Mr. Boehlert voted against a ban on a late-term abortion procedure and for increasing the minimum wage.
 Mr. Meier, 53, has put together an impressive campaign, having garnered the support of 7 of the district's 11 Republican county chairmen. His aides say he has raised about $150,000 so far, and in elections for the State Senate he has had the support of the Conservative Party.
 Already the House campaign has produced sparks. Mr. Meier has been criticized by Democratic leaders in Washington and New York for broadcasting television ads, paid for by his State Senate campaign funds, on lobbying reform in Albany. The ads ran before Mr. Boehlert announced he would retire.
 ''Inappropriately skirting campaign laws is quite a way to introduce yourself to voters,'' said Blake Zeff, a spokesman for the State Democratic Party. ''During this time of corruption and deception in Washington, D.C., it appears that Raymond Meier is a step in the wrong direction.''
 Mr. Meier said the ads were ''perfectly legal'' and ''were touting a bill that I've sponsored to prohibit gifts from lobbyists.''
 He added that they ran before he knew Mr. Boehlert planned to retire, a point disputed by Democratic officials.
 Mr. Meier faces a vigorous Republican primary challenge from Brad Jones, a former mayor of Seneca Falls. Mr. Jones, 54, announced his candidacy last year, long before the congressman disclosed plans to retire. At the time, Mr. Jones said he considered Mr. Boehlert too liberal for the district.
 The three Democratic candidates are busy trying to make their case to the voters of this huge Congressional district, a horseshoe-shaped area that takes in counties from Herkimer in the northeast to Seneca and Ontario Counties to the west.
 ''The Republicans want everyone to believe that this is a Republican-leaning district,'' said Michael A. Arcuri, 46, one of the three.
 Mr. Arcuri, who is the Oneida County district attorney, added: ''There are a huge number of swing voters. And Boehlert's moderate positions on most issues make me believe that the district would go for someone of either party, as long as he had the moderate views of this district.''
 Les Roberts, another Democratic candidate, said the district ''had been much more driven by the personality of the congressman than ideology.''
 The third Democrat in the race is Leon Koziol, 47, a former member of the Utica City Council.
 Mr. Roberts, 44, a former official with the United States Public Health Service, said the Democrats were heartened about their prospects.
 ''Democrats are in the mainstream in this district,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''What people really care about is having someone with clear plans to revitalize the economy here, solve the energy crisis and help get us out of Iraq.''
 The date of the primary is Sept. 12.

''To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward! . . . Words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.'' So Feste the jester laments in ''Twelfth Night.'' Or pretends to lament. Or truly does lament, under the pretense of pretense. (Like our own late-night jesters -- David Letterman, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert -- Feste is ironic even about being an ironist.) He's not really the Lady Olivia's fool, he says: he's ''her corrupter of words,'' and, like Shakespeare's still greater Fool in ''King Lear,'' he uses corruption of language to purify meaning. In his age, as in ours, wise fools sabotage words to get at the truth. 
 If this paradox makes sense to you, then you're part of the target market for Colson Whitehead's parablelike third novel, ''Apex Hides the Hurt.'' His protagonist, whom Whitehead leaves appropriately nameless, is a ''nomenclature consultant'' -- his very job title is jargon -- legendarily expert at naming commercial products. The apex of his achievement is to give the name Apex to a Band-Aid knockoff sold in a Benetton-ish variety of skin tones. When the novel begins, he's had a crisis of conscience, manifesting itself in a strange wound that helps lead him to a breakdown. His old firm tries to lure him back by sending him to adjudicate a dispute in a Midwestern town. Should it keep the name Winthrop, should it rename itself New Prospera (the alternative favored by the software tycoon who's moved his operation there) or should it revert to its original name, Freedom, bestowed by the former slaves who founded it after the Civil War? 
 At first his choice seems obvious. He sees that ''New Prospera'' has ''that romance-language armature . . . the lilting a at the end like a rung up to wealth and affluence, take a step. A glamorous Old World cape draped over the bony shoulders of prosaic prosperity. . . . He reckoned it would look good on maps.'' ''Winthrop''? Jeez, why not just call it WASPville? And ''Freedom''? That's a brand name ''from the B-GON days, an artifact of the most pained and witless nomenclature . . . so defiantly unimaginative as to approach a kind of moral weakness.'' On the other hand, since Whitehead's guy happens to be African-American, can he really bring himself to take a stand against Freedom? And on the other other hand, the whole dispute seems pointless. ''Tear the old signs down, put up new ones in their place -- it didn't change the character of the place, did it? It didn't cover up history. Not for the last time, he wondered what his clients believed they could achieve. And what exactly he was doing here.'' 
 Whitehead withholds his hero's choice until a couple of pages from the end of the novel. Let's just say it may be the one right name for this or any town -- and that it was a wise precaution to have his contract stipulate that the citizens have to live with it for a year. (I hope it's not giving away too much to add that his triumph doesn't cure him.) The parodically conventional mystery provides the novel's forward motion, but -- and here's the paradox -- what keeps you reading this critique of language is its language, and our perverse delight in the ingenious abuse of words. Corporate-speak is an easy target, and Whitehead wastes little time on such sport. He also dispatches journalese with a drive-by, when his hero reads a newspaper profile of himself: ''Did he really 'wink knowingly'?'' The fun begins when corrupted language corrupts his hero's sensibility. In one brilliant set piece, his guy wanders into a swampy wood: ''Fruit has splendid packaging. . . . Its seeds will be deposited in spoor miles away and its market dominance will increase. . . . Natural selection was market forces. . . . City, country: everywhere emptiness sat waiting in boxes, waiting to be opened. Every single thing in his vision was biodegradable. Which was cool. Because 100 percent recyclable material, people really dug that these days.''
 This is blasphemy, both cultural and literary, at its cruelest and most exhilarating, a poke in the eye to the English Romantics and American Transcendentalists whose cult of Nature was until recently America's true civil religion. Those spacious skies and majestic purple mountains. Whitehead sides with neither Winthropian nostalgia -- and forget Freedomist nostalgia, too -- nor New Prosperian progressivism: and he's an anthropologist, not a controversialist. True, he's bracingly fierce about America's ''peculiar institution'' -- not much controversy there -- in a riff on how the ex-slaves of Freedom might have named their streets: ''Take Kidnap to the end, make a left on Torture and keep on 'til you get to Lynch. Follow the lights 'til you get to Genocide and stop at the dead end.'' Yet to his hero, such nomenclatural revisionism would be as uselessly old-school as the tree-named thoroughfares of Winthrop. ''Was he supposed to right historical wrongs? He was a consultant, for Christ's sake. He had no special powers.''
 The issue of naming has an obvious resonance for African-Americans -- the town's ex-slave co-founders, Goode and Field, clearly didn't get their names (no different in ancestral implication from Winthrop) from Africa. Whitehead's hero, reflecting on the change from ''colored'' to ''Negro'' to ''Afro-American'' to ''African-American,'' despairs of ever arriving at ''the name that will give me the dignity and respect that is my right.'' Every few years, he notes, ''someone came up with something that got us an inch closer to the truth. . . . As if that thing we believed to be approaching actually existed.'' What's truly scary here goes deeper than race. ''Isn't it great when you're a kid and the whole world is full of anonymous things?'' his hero thinks. ''Everything is bright and mysterious until you know what it is called and then all the light goes out of it. . . . Once we knew the name of it, how could we ever come to love it?'' This reads like a sunnier version of the passage in Samuel Beckett's ''Molloy'' which tells us that in our interior depths we find ''no things but nameless things, no names but thingless names.'' Whitehead's word ''love'' suggests that he doesn't go all the way into the darkness with Beckett, whose Malone wearily argues that there's ''no use indicting words. They are no shoddier than what they peddle.'' Still, the ideal language seems to be no language at all.
 And here's the ''and yet'' you knew was coming: Whitehead communicates his critique of language by way of language -- which is the only imaginable delivery system. The old-time modernists used to think that honesty and precision in language, what Pound called ''direct treatment of the 'thing' whether objective or subjective,'' could Make It New, or as Eliot put it, ''purify the dialect of the tribe.'' But like Shakespeare's fools, and like many writers of his own generation, Whitehead stakes what hope he has on indirection. He aims for purity not with plain statement, but by recontextualizing corrupted language. ''Locked and loaded'' is a cliche, but when Whitehead has his hero fantasize about cheerleaders with '''pom poms locked and loaded,'' he's found a fresh way to suggest the aggression implicit in sexual tantalization. If you've got nothing to work with but a charnel house of dead language, play Dr. Frankenstein.
 A reader whoring after certainty could nail Whitehead on the novel's contradictions. In one passage, racism is a unique and radical evil: ''Before colored, slave. Before slave, free. And always somewhere, nigger.'' In another, it's simply part of ''the march of history,'' in which tribes and nations subjugate their predecessors, then get subjugated themselves: ''Nobody lasts because there's always somebody else.'' At times, our hero believes people are ultimately nameable -- ''We spent our lives trying to keep our true names inside and hidden'' -- yet the examples he gives (''Liar,'' ''Bed Wetter,'' ''Romantic,'' ''Failure'') are so superficial that they belie any notion of human complexity. Is ''love,'' which dies in the process of naming, a real thing, or is there nothing but ''emptiness'' in all-too-transparent packaging? But why fault Whitehead for failing to enunciate a coherent theory of language and life -- have you got one? ''Apex Hides the Hurt'' seems to promote only one theory: that of Negative Capability. (At this late date, do I really need to quote Keats praising Shakespeare's embrace of ''uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason''?) Its hero experiences the old familiar barrage of conflicting impulses: to believe, to doubt; to trust, to despair; to love, to say the hell with it. And words, which we've devised both to share and to withhold, to help and to exploit one another, to unite us and divide us, are only the dead presidents we pass back and forth in a living human economy, with all its mutual enrichment and cutthroat competition. There happens to be a perfectly good word to characterize Whitehead's enterprise, but to tell you would ruin his ending. And I've said too much already.

HEADLINE: Countless Dens of Uncatchable Thieves

BYLINE: By Tom Zeller Jr.

 BODY:
YOU'VE probably never met Sergey Kozerev, a former student at the State University of Technology and Design in St. Petersburg, Russia, but it's possible that he's mugged you.
 In the online world, he operates under the pseudonym Zo0mer, according to American investigators, and he smugly hawks all manner of stolen consumer information alongside dozens of other peddlers at a Web site he helps manage.
''My prices are lowers then most of other vendors have and I will deliver them in real time,'' reads a typically fractured Zo0mer post. 
 At the same forum, another user, ''tabbot,'' offers ''any U.S. bank accounts'' for sale. 
 ''Balance from 3K and above: $40,'' he writes. ''Regular brokerage accounts from 3K and above: $70.'' 
 Tabbot also offers full access to hacked accounts from credit unions. One, with a $31,000 balance, is being sold for $400. ''I can try search specific info such as signature, ssn, dob, email access,'' tabbot writes. ''Account with an extra info will be more expensive.''
 The online trade in stolen financial data is thriving. So the news last week that the United States Secret Service has been Hoovering up identity thieves, document forgers and other members of online ''carding'' sites -- Web forums that have become outposts for peddling hacked account numbers, bank passwords and PIN numbers, as well as the viruses, scripts and phishing scams designed to steal them -- seemed a coup.
 But however deserving those caught in this most recent sweep might be (20 have been arrested across the United States and one in Britain over the last three months, the agency said), the fact remains that in the transnational, Internet-driven market for stolen financial and consumer data, some thieves are simply easier to nab than others.
 And while Russians and Eastern Europeans like Zo0mer have become the top bananas in the stolen data trade, the English-speaking -- particularly American -- players are really the lowest-hanging fruit. 
 ''I deal with them only from an intelligence perspective,'' said Gregory Crabb, an investigator with the United States Postal Inspection Service and the economic crimes division of Interpol, referring to English-speaking carders. ''And only to know if the big players in Eastern Europe and Russia are recruiting. They are a dime a dozen, and relatively easy to track down and pop.''
 Not surprisingly, despite ruling like dark knights behind their own cryptic pseudonyms, American traders are often exposed under harsh light as middling rubes or barely post-adolescent power-trippers who were easily duped by undercover agents working the same boards. 
 Even Operation Firewall, the Secret Service sledgehammer that managed to infiltrate and shatter the largest English-language crime board, Shadowcrew.com, in October 2004, has done little, two years later, to slow the global data trade. 
 ''The Secret Service says the defendants are part of a 'highly organized international criminal enterprise,' '' blogged Brian McWilliams, the author of ''Spam Kings'' and a keen follower of cybercrime, at the time of the Shadowcrew arrests. ''But I have a hard time believing that we're talking about a real sophisticated group of criminals here. One of the defendants, 20-year-old Paul A. Mendel Jr., aka Mintfloss, lives with his grandparents in Albany, N.Y.''
 To be fair, prosecutors estimated that Shadowcrew had done damages in excess of $4 million over its two-year history. That's not pocket change, and the true tally is surely much higher. And those arrests have led to others, which no one can argue is a bad thing. 
 But consider that just one young American, 22-year-old Douglas Cade Havard, using real contacts with the Russian underworld, managed to steal, along with a Scottish accomplice, more than $11 million in two years, according to investigators. 
 In one scheme, the pair, now in British prisons, encoded stolen account numbers onto blank cards and withdrew over $1.3 million from various Western banks in just 10 months. Of course, they were receiving the stolen account data from -- and were kicking most of the proceeds back to -- Russian hackers, who are presumably still at large.
 There are other recent American arrests. Seventeen-year-old Hunter Moore of Manchester, N.H., was nabbed in a Secret Service sting and pled guilty in August to identity fraud and making counterfeit credit cards while living with his grandmother. 
 And a Virginia Tech student, Benjamin W. Pinkston, was among seven people arrested in last week's return of Operation Rolling Stone. According to The Roanoke Times, he was released to the custody of his parents on Tuesday and told to stay off the Internet. A judge eased that restriction, when it was suggested it would make it hard for the young man to do his homework. 
 Meanwhile, American law enforcement can often only watch the real kingpins like Zo0mer (which he spells with a signature zero) from afar. 
 ''It's a big job to navigate the treaties and the rights to privacy in disclosing information to foreign law enforcement,'' Mr. Crabb said. 
 And that's just the beginning. Even when banks and credit card companies are willing to share the details of a breach (and many would prefer to keep mum rather than risk publicity), it is equally daunting to try to win the attention and cooperation of foreign investigators, Mr. Crabb said. 
 This is particularly true in parts of the former Eastern Bloc, where law enforcement is often facing down more immediate local problems -- organized crime, tax schemes, corruption -- and might understandably place the plight of American banks and consumers a bit lower on their priority list. 
 Indeed, in some countries, Mr. Crabb suggested, law enforcement officers responsible for combating online data thieves may have never owned a credit card themselves. 
 ''That is actually one of the first things I tell financial institutions when I'm educating them about this,'' Mr. Crabb said. ''Take that credit card out of the equation. Those law enforcement officials don't have one. They don't understand the power of one. It's a hurdle that we have to overcome.'' 
 And even when a big fish is caught, as happened last summer with the arrest in Ukraine of Dmitro Ivanovich Golubov, aka ''Script,'' according to authorities, there is little that can be done when he is released. 
 Mr. Golubov's capture was described in The Wall Street Journal by Larry Johnson of the Secret Service, as ''one of the most significant apprehensions of a high-level Eastern European responsible for criminal activity on the Internet.''
 Still, to the dismay of American law enforcement officials (and some of their Ukrainian counterparts), Mr. Golubov was quietly released from prison in December while awaiting trial.

HEADLINE: At the Four A's, a Focus on Getting Stronger

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS the leaders of Madison Avenue prepare to gather for a major annual conference, they are being advised to heed some famous words from the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: What does not kill you makes you stronger.
 The advertising industry is confronting some of its most daunting changes since the mid-2oth Century, when television replaced radio as the mainstream medium of choice. The challenges also offer significant -- and lucrative -- opportunities, say several executives who are scheduled to speak at the conference. But agencies must be willing to rethink traditional approaches and jettison those that are hopelessly outdated, the executives say.
''It's a harsh reality that more industry sectors are more and more competitive, more brutal, in the battle for market share and brand equity,'' said Anthony J. Hopp, chairman and chief executive at Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 ''The agencies that will succeed are the ones not frozen in the era of 30-second television commercials and can find the new ways to engage and connect with consumers,'' he added. ''If you're not doing that, you're not going to be in business.''
 Mr. Hopp is to speak in his capacity as the current chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the Four A's, which is the conference sponsor. The meeting -- formally called the 2006 management conference for agency chief executives -- is to begin tomorrow at a resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., and continue through Friday. 
 As agencies remake themselves, ''there's no 'one size fits all' model any more,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, who will also address the meeting. ''Our members want to learn what's working and what's not working.'' 
 The conference is ''focusing internally this year, more of an information-sharing, nitty-gritty, getting-inside-the-business kind of meeting,'' Mr. Drake said.
 ''We don't have any clients yelling at us,'' he added with a laugh, referring to the senior managers of consumer product makers who are usually part of the agenda. Rather, the speakers are leaders of agencies of all sizes and specialties, along with executives from Internet companies like aQuantive, the CondeNet division of Advance Publications and Google. 
 There are more speakers than in previous years from the ranks of smaller, creatively focused independent agencies. Such boutiques are garnering attention for landing assignments from large advertisers that previously only worked with bigger agencies. The increasing willingness of companies like Coca-Cola, General Motors and Unilever to hire smaller shops is among the most profound changes affecting Madison Avenue.
 ''It's a slight red herring to focus on size,'' said Carl Johnson, a partner at Anomaly, a New York boutique with clients that include the Lifetime cable network, Maxim magazine, Nike and the new Virgin America airline.
 ''There are some good agencies that are very big,'' said Mr. Johnson, who formerly was chief operating officer for one, TBWA Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. ''And 'small' and 'good' are not necessarily the same thing.
 ''The biggest differentiator is whether agencies believe in anything, whether they have strong core values, whether they're willing to challenge the status quo,'' he added. ''You'd be hard pressed to say what most agencies believe in, other than survival.''
 Mr. Johnson cited independents like Bartle Bogle Hegarty and Wieden & Kennedy as models for the next generation of agency because of their ability to ''create a mission, a cause, that everyone can sign up for, whether employees or clients.''
 The leader of a much bigger agency than Anomaly praised the role being played by the new creative independents.
 ''The birth of new agencies and new resources has been lifeblood for our industry,'' said Ron Berger, chief executive and chief creative officer for the New York and San Francisco offices of Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas.
 Mr. Berger, who will speak at the conference in his capacity as the 2004-6 chairman of the Four A's, cited an upstart participant in the men's college basketball tournament to make a point.
 ''Is George Mason being in the Final Four a statement that big-time college basketball is dead?'' Mr. Berger asked. ''Or is it a statement that the sport has a great vitality because talent is all over?''
 Another welcome development, Mr. Berger said, is the arrival of ''a new generation of leadership'' at bigger agencies. He listed executives like Andrew Robertson, president and chief executive at BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom, who is also to speak at the conference, and David Jones, chief executive of Euro RSCG Worldwide.
 ''These are people for whom 'new media' isn't 'new media,' '' Mr. Berger said. ''It's 'media.' '' 
 Mr. Drake said the organizers expected 390 people to attend the conference, which will be the 88th annual meeting of the Four A's. That would be the highest attendance since 2000, when the conference attracted 450 people during the dot-com boom. Four A's attendance is considered a gauge of the health of the advertising economy.

HEADLINE: The Health of a Nation

BYLINE: By Allan B. Hubbard. 
Allan B. Hubbard is assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IN the past five years, private health insurance premiums have risen 73 percent. Some businesses have responded by dropping healthcare coverage, leaving employees uninsured. Other employers pass the costs on to workers, both by raising co-payments and premiums and by denying workers the wage increases they need to afford these higher prices.
 What is driving this unsustainable run-up in health insurance costs, and how can we make things better? 
Health care is expensive because the vast majority of Americans consume it as if it were free. Health insurance policies with low deductibles insulate people from the cost of the medical care they use -- so much so that they often do not even ask for prices. And people don't recognize the high premium costs of this low-deductible insurance because premiums are paid by employers. Finally, the tax code subsidizes these expensive, employer-purchased insurance policies.
 To control health care costs, we must give consumers an incentive to spend money wisely. We can do this by encouraging the purchase of high-deductible policies and providing the same tax benefits for out-of-pocket health spending that employer-provided insurance enjoys. The overall cost to the consumer will be no greater than it is now and, in most cases, significantly lower. And no consumer is better than the American consumer at driving prices down and quality up.
 The president has proposed a package of reforms that will spur such changes by building on the success of consumer-directed Health Savings Accounts and the insurance policies that go with them. Health Savings Accounts allow people to save money tax-free to pay their out-of-pocket health costs, as long as they have high-deductible health policies to cover catastrophic expenses. Enrollment in these accounts has grown rapidly since their introduction in 2003, with more than three million people now contributing to them. 
 The president's reforms would make these plans even more attractive by providing payroll tax relief to those who hold Health Savings Accounts (currently the accounts are only exempt from income taxes); giving employers more incentive to offer and contribute to the accounts; and making it easier for consumers to get the information they need to make good decisions about the health care they purchase. 
 The accounts aren't just good for the health care system -- they're a good deal for American families. Catastrophic policies have affordable premiums that bring health insurance into reach for lower-income families. And the low premiums compensate for most, if not all, of the policies' higher deductibles.
 Consider the following two real policies offered by the same insurer in Columbus, Ohio, for a healthy family of four earning $50,000 a year. A Health Savings Account policy has a premium of $3,750, a deductible of $3,000, and co-insurance of 20 percent up to a maximum of $5,000. Meanwhile, a traditional Preferred Provider Organization policy has a premium of $5,800, a deductible of $1,000, and 10 percent co-insurance up to a maximum of $2,000. 
 If the family's medical bills totaled $1,000, they would save $1,900 by choosing the Health Savings Account policy. Under the president's policy proposals, the savings would jump to $3,200. Even if something catastrophic confronted the family with $10,000 in medical bills (fewer than 20 percent of families face costs this high in a year), under the current law, the family would pay only $400 more by choosing the Health Savings Account rather than the P.P.O. Under the president's proposals, they'd save $1,600. That's why 40 percent of these Health Savings Account-based policies are purchased by families with incomes lower than $50,000. 
 These affordable policies are also an attractive option for employers that might not otherwise provide health insurance. With premiums rising, only 60 percent of companies offered their workers health insurance in 2005, compared with 69 percent in 2000. A recent study showed that a third of the small businesses offering policies based on Health Savings Accounts had not previously offered their employees insurance at all. 
 Imagine how the world might look if patients, armed with information about the price and quality of health care, set out to find the best possible value. We saw this with Lasik eye surgery, a procedure not covered by most insurance plans. Its price fell by almost half, and the number of procedures performed increased 10-fold from 1998 to 2002, as more doctors began providing the service and customers shopped around. Informed consumers could bring down costs throughout the health care industry by choosing only high-value care, making providers raise quality and lower prices to compete for their business, and spurring the development of the kind of cost-effective innovation we see in other parts of the economy.
 Heath Savings Accounts will help unleash this consumer power. This makes them both a good deal for the people who enroll in them and good medicine for the system as a whole. They give consumers more choices while strengthening their role in reducing waste, promoting competition and increasing value. By enabling consumers and doctors to make health care decisions that are right for them, we can greatly improve the effectiveness, affordability and value of our health care spending.

HEADLINE: New York City Losing Blacks, Census Shows 

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
An accelerating exodus of American-born blacks, coupled with slight declines in birthrates and a slowing influx of Caribbean and African immigrants, have produced a decline in New York City's black population for the first time since the draft riots during the Civil War, according to preliminary census estimates.
 An analysis of the latest figures, which show the city with 30,000 fewer black residents in 2004 than in 2000, also revealed stark contrasts in the migration patterns of blacks and whites.
While white New Yorkers are still more likely than blacks to leave the city, they are also more likely to relocate to the nearby suburbs (which is where half the whites move) or elsewhere in the Northeast, or to scatter to other cities and retirement communities across the country. Moreover, New York remains a magnet for whites from most other states. 
 In contrast, 7 in 10 black people who are moving leave the region altogether. And, unlike black migrants from Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit, most of them go to the South, especially to Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia. The rest move to states like California, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan with large black populations. 
 Also, New York has a net loss of blacks to all but five states, and those net gains are minuscule.
 ''This suggests that the black movement out of New York City is much more of an evacuation than the movement for whites,'' said William Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution, who analyzed migration patterns for The New York Times.
 The implications for a city of 8.2 million people could be profound. If the trend continues, not only will the black share of New York's population, which dipped below 25 percent in 2000, continue to decline, particularly if the overall population grows, but a higher proportion of black New Yorkers will be foreign-born or the children of immigrants.
 Many blacks are leaving for economic reasons. Jacqueline Dowdell moved to North Carolina last year from Hamilton Heights in Upper Manhattan in search of a lower cost of living. Once an editor at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, she now works as a communications coordinator for a health care company in Chapel Hill.
 ''It was a difficult decision, but it was a financial decision,'' said Ms. Dowdell, 39, adding that the move also gave her time to research her family's roots in Virginia.
 ''I just continued to spend so much money trying to live without thinking about the future,'' she said. ''I was focused on surviving, and I wanted to make a commitment to more quality of life.''
 The analysis of migration from 1995 to 2000 also suggests that many blacks, already struggling with high housing costs in New York City, are being priced out of nearby suburbs, too. 
 Among black married couples with children, only about one in three who left the city moved to nearby suburbs, compared with two in three white married couples with children. More black married couples with children moved to the South than to the suburbs. 
 Over all, more black residents who left New York City moved to Florida than to New Jersey.
 But black residents who left the city were more likely to remain in the region if they had higher incomes and were college educated. And while black migrants to the South include some aspiring professionals, a larger share were lower income, less educated and elderly. 
 ''All this suggests that New York City out-migration of blacks is unique in its scope -- net losses to most states -- and pattern -- especially destined to the South,'' Dr. Frey said. 
 Reversing a tide from the South who altered the complexion of the city earlier in the 20th century, the number of American-born blacks leaving the city has exceeded the number arriving since at least the late 1970's. 
 ''You have older people who leave the North just to go back to a place that is kind of slower, or where they grew up or went on vacation when they were younger -- and when you retire, your money doesn't go very far in New York,'' said Sylviane A. Diouf, a historian and researcher at the Schomburg Center and co-author of a study of black migration. ''You also have young college-educated people who find that the South has lots of economic potential and a lower cost of living.''
 The slower pace appealed to Gladys Favours, who worked for a city councilwoman from Brooklyn and moved from East New York seven years ago to a town of fewer than 1,000 people near Charlotte, N.C, after she was unable to find another job. 
 ''I lived in New York for almost 50 years and loved what it offered in schools, entertainment and convenience, but I lost my job and finding one at my age would pay half of what I was making,'' she said. ''I was divorced and moved here with my 11-year-old -- I was afraid of the crime, and black boys don't fare too well in New York.''
 Her son is now in college and she is working for the county emergency services department. 
 ''I'm 60 now,'' she said. ''I think I was ready for the quietness.''
 While residential segregation persists, racial and ethnic minorities, including immigrants, have become more mobile, with lower-skilled workers lured to growing cities in the South and West for construction, retail and service jobs and professionals applying for the same opportunities that had been previously open mainly to whites. 
 ''Some foreign-born blacks are moving out, too -- to the suburbs as well as to other parts of the country, particularly South Florida,'' said Nancy Foner, a distinguished professor of sociology at Hunter College.
 Andrew Hacker, a political scientist at Queens College, cited other factors. ''After 15 or 20 years with, say the Postal Service or U.P.S., employees can put in for transfers to other parts of the country,'' he said. ''As a result, more than a few middle-class black New Yorkers have been moving back to states like North Carolina and Georgia, where they have family ties, living costs are lower, neighborhoods are safer, schools are often better and life is less hectic.''
 In 1997, Christine Wiggins retired as an assistant bank manager after 25 years. She left Queens Village and followed her brother, who worked for New York City Transit, to the Poconos. 
 ''It was hard for him, he had to commute,'' she said. ''But we wanted to get away from the city.''
 The East Stroudsburg, Pa., area, where radio advertisements lured first-time homebuyers, was among the 15 top destinations for black residents leaving New York City. More black New Yorkers moved to Monroe County in the Poconos than to either the Rockland or Orange County suburbs of New York. 
 Over all, the city's black population grew by 115,000 in the 1990's, a 6.2 percent increase. (New Yorkers in the armed forces or who are institutionalized are not counted as residents.) 
 Those early estimates of the 30,000 drop in black population since 2000, a 1.5 percent decline, suggest that among blacks, the arrival of newcomers from abroad and higher birthrates among immigrants were not keeping pace with the outflow.
 Last year, a study by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group, found that while the gush of immigrants continued into the 21st century, it appeared to have slowed somewhat.
 A net loss of black residents, even between censuses, would apparently be the first since the Civil War. In 1863, after mobs attacked blacks during the draft riots, many fled New York City. ''By 1865,'' Leslie M. Harris wrote in ''In the Shadow of Slavery,'' the city's ''black population had plummeted to just under 10,000, its lowest since 1820.''

COUNTING DOWN -- Delphi's chief executive, Robert S. Miller, will speak to the Detroit Economic Club today. Delphi, the auto parts maker, asked a federal judge on Friday for permission to throw out some of its labor agreements, a move that could cost 20,000 union workers their jobs. The request could set up a confrontation that Delphi's largest union, the United Automobile Workers, said could lead to a lengthy strike. 


WRAPPING UP -- Closing arguments begin today in Atlantic City in the case of two men who blame Vioxx, the painkiller once sold by Merck, for their heart attacks. Merck has won two cases and lost one in the legal fight over Vioxx, which it withdrew from the market in 2004 after a study showed it could double the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In its defense in this case, Merck said the plaintiffs had pre-existing conditions that were more likely the causes of their heart attacks.

HEADLINE: Split Within House G.O.P. Adds to Budget Uncertainty 

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
Republican moderates and conservatives are at odds over the House's $2.8 trillion budget proposal, throwing passage of the spending plan into doubt this week as fiscal policy continues to vex Congressional Republicans.
 Both blocs have presented their demands to the House leadership, putting pressure on Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the new majority leader, as Republicans try to stave off an embarrassing election-year budget defeat that would complicate their push to pass the annual spending bills.
''We have 232 Republicans in the House, and trying to come to a position on the budget is always difficult,'' said Mr. Boehner, who has been actively seeking a resolution acceptable to both factions. 
 But it may be more difficult than usual this year. Conservatives, who are convinced that Republican voters want the party to get serious about fiscal restraint, are balking at talk of exceeding the spending cap and want to put new budget rules in place to lower future spending. Moderates, saying social programs have been shortchanged and worried about races in swing districts, want at least $7 billion in extra spending.
 Given the likelihood that no Democrats will help, as well as the relatively thin Republican majority, the leadership cannot afford to lose many conservatives or moderates if they hope to prevail.
 ''They can't give up any group of 15 on either side,'' said Representative Mike Castle, a moderate Republican leader from Delaware.
 Mr. Castle and almost two dozen other Republicans say they want a 2 percent increase in health, education and social spending. That would be in line with the program approved by Senate Republicans, who broke President Bush's recommended $873 billion spending ceiling on discretionary programs in approving their own plan. Moderates say those programs have faced stagnant spending while increases have gone to domestic security and the Pentagon. 
 ''I believe that the current budget proposal does not accommodate really crucial city safety net needs, education needs and health care needs,'' said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut. ''I have tried as clearly as I possibly could to lay out my concerns, which frankly are shared by a significant number in the caucus. This is not a little matter.''
 House conservatives would like substantially less spending. But they have indicated they are willing to accept the $873 billion for programs under Congressional control as long as they receive some promises on new budget rules.
 ''I think no budget is better than a budget that sends the wrong message to the American people about our commitment to fiscal discipline,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the leader of the Republican Study Committee.
 In an hourlong meeting with the leadership last week, the conservatives laid out their requirements for backing the budget: the opportunity to vote on new limits for emergency spending, new authority to challenge spending on pet projects, and a commitment for votes on a line-item veto and a special commission to consider eliminating programs.
 Mr. Pence said the leadership's need to round up budget votes gave conservatives an opportunity to push for budget controls that could end up producing more savings than any demand to lower spending for 2007. But those proposals are likely to encounter resistance from members of the Appropriations Committee, who see them as a challenge to their power, adding another complication.
 Leadership aides concede that the spending plan is provoking an intense fight within the party at a time when Republicans hardly need another split, considering the glaring divisions over immigration policy and the effort by some Republicans to move away from Mr. Bush and his declining popularity. The failure to enact a budget could be another fiscal black eye for Republicans who have presided over deficit spending and were forced last month to approve an increase in the federal debt limit to nearly $9 trillion.
 Republicans say they will still be able to move ahead this year on spending bills even if they fail to agree on a budget and could simply enforce the spending limit on themselves. Senior officials acknowledge privately, however, that it was probably a mistake to delay a House budget vote and let the Senate go first, since its approval of $16 billion in overall extra spending emboldened House moderates.
 Members of the leadership say they believe they can win a narrow victory and may have to promise moderates to redistribute some money from the military and other areas to social needs when the spending bills are written. That approach has worked in the past, but Mr. Castle and other Republicans could resist this time and require up-front concessions, even though they are aware a budget failure would be a setback for Republicans.
 ''I try to be a good Republican,'' Mr. Castle said, ''but I try to be a good congressman, too.''

HEADLINE: For Argentina's Sizzling Economy, a Cap on Steak Prices

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 2 

 BODY:
Few things are more treasured by Argentines than a juicy steak sizzling on a grill. So when President Nestor Kirchner recently urged consumers to boycott beef, and ordered government ministries to cease their purchases, it was a sign that something had gone drastically wrong.
 But his campaign failed to have the desired effect, and Mr. Kirchner has now prohibited the export of most cuts of beef, the most emblematic of the country's exports. In both cases, the objective was the same: to force down the price so that Argentines could continue to eat some of the world's most savory meat at some of the cheapest prices.
 His tools do not stop there, though. On a crusade to freeze the prices of hundreds of basic consumer goods, Mr. Kirchner has returned to an instrument that is a controversial part of Argentina's past, associated with an era of four-digit inflation: price controls. 
 Price controls have a long and checkered history here and in the rest of Latin America. But they have not been widely used in recent years, other than in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, as most governments shifted to a free-market economy, in which supply and demand determine prices. 
 Orthodox free-market economists regard price controls with distaste. They argue that such measures, though meant to benefit the poor, distort market forces and, as producers are forced to absorb increased expenses without compensation, lead to reductions in supply and investment that end up hurting not just the farmer or factory owner, but also the consumer.
 ''It's always easy to impose controls, but hard to eliminate them,'' said Juan Luis Bour, the chief economist at the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research here. ''The more successful you are in the short run, the more problems you are generating in the long term, because you are creating a disequilibrium.''
 Other economists, too, are warning that Mr. Kirchner, who has so far been a successful steward of Latin America's third largest economy (after Brazil and Mexico), could be sowing the seeds of a new disaster. After suffering a traumatic collapse four years ago, the government devalued the peso significantly and declared the largest debt default in history.
 Since then, the recovery has been remarkable. Argentina's economy has rebounded by nearly 9 percent annually over the past three years. But that growth spurt has been accompanied by a surge in inflation that worries Mr. Kirchner, who faces an election next year if he wants to serve a second four-year term.
 In an effort to hold the official inflation rate to 1 percent a month, Mr. Kirchner has sought to persuade producers and stores to agree to voluntary freezes on prices of hundreds of products, including sugar, flour, noodles, bread, shampoo and pencils. Because red meat accounts for more than for 4.5 percent of the consumer price index here, more than seven times its weight in the United States index, it has become the government's most visible and symbolic target.
 On a per capita basis, people here may be the biggest consumers of beef in the world. Each year, the average Argentine eats nearly 150 pounds of beef, more than twice as much as an average American does.
 Their tastes are so ingrained, in fact, that Argentines largely ignored Mr. Kirchner's original boycott call. With disposable income rising now that the economic crisis is over, they are eager to consume more and better varieties of food, with red meat at the top of the list.
 ''I always buy beef, and I'm not going to stop now just because a politician tells me to,'' Amelia Rava, a homemaker, said outside a supermarket here Thursday. ''If I came home without beef, the family would kill me.''
 Besides, no sooner had Mr. Kirchner urged Argentines to switch to other types of meat than ''the price of chicken, fish and pork also started rising,'' complained Leonor Martino, another homemaker. ''So where is the benefit for me if the price of everything is going up?''
 Mr. Kirchner's first attempt at jawboning producers into forgoing price increases came a year ago, when oil companies here wanted to charge more for fuel and lubricants. When Shell ignored his suggestion, he ratcheted up the pressure and told Argentines they should buy ''nothing, not even a can of oil,'' from the company.
 Late last year came the supermarkets' turn. After Mr. Kirchner warned the owners of two leading chains to ''stop extorting us,'' they and other companies agreed to 60-day price freezes. Those expired, but have been renewed and expanded to about 300 products, with some supermarkets voluntarily adding other goods in order to win the favor of consumers.
 In its campaign to hold the line on prices, the government has also begun looking beyond food products. For instance, in late February, with the school year about to begin, the Finance and Education Ministries negotiated an agreement with private schools in which those institutions agreed to freeze tuition, after increases of up to 40 percent last year.
 Similar accords have frozen the prices of more than 200 widely used medicines, and natural gas prices have also been subjected to policies that inhibit increases. But Mr. Kirchner's campaign against meat producers and middlemen is his biggest, most audacious yet.
 On Thursday, he intensified his criticisms of meat producers, saying that some of them were ''scoundrels'' profiteering at the nation's expense, and he threatened to impose even harsher measures. The first protest demonstrations also broke out in the countryside last week, with ranchers and their supporters holding rallies at which they threatened to block highways and bridges.
 The ranchers are particularly upset at the 180-day prohibition on exports, which is aimed at increasing the domestic beef supply. They argue the decree will affect the country's credibility as a reliable exporter and lose them ground in new markets where they have become big players, like Russia.
 ''Producers are perplexed and bewildered,'' said Fernando Saenz Valiente, a leading beef broker at the main producers' market here. ''Some are already switching from cattle to agriculture, and planting soy or sunflowers because they can't be sure of what is going to happen.''
 It is not clear how long the government expects the price freezes to last. The economy minister, Felisa Miceli, told the daily Clarin last week that even though ''the tendency toward increases has been deactivated'' and stores are ''complying with the price agreements,'' the government must also ''wait for things to happen to think about the next step.''
 In the meantime, Mr. Kirchner's supporters here are introducing legislation to send official inspectors into stores to assure compliance with the accords. Those that are not would be subject to fines and public censure.
 ''These are voluntary, negotiated agreements, so nobody is putting a gun to anybody's head, and the stores are still operating with a margin of profit,'' said Diego Kravetz, the bill's main author. ''But this is something that needs monitoring on a permanent basis'' and ''requires the involvement of civic and consumer groups.''

HEADLINE: IRAQI SHIITE BLOC SPLITS OVER CALL FOR NEW PREMIER

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and JOEL BRINKLEY; Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi and Qais Mizher contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 2 

 BODY:
Iraq's dominant Shiite political bloc fractured Sunday when its most powerful faction publicly demanded that the incumbent Shiite prime minister resign over his inability to form a unified government. The split came as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Jack Straw, the British foreign minister, paid an urgent visit to Iraqi leaders here to convey in the most forceful terms yet that their patience for the country's political paralysis was wearing thin.
 It was not clear whether the joint visit by Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw, the top emissaries of the two countries that led the invasion of Iraq three years ago, played a direct role in the splintering of the Shiite bloc, and whether that schism would lead to forward movement on forming a new government, which has been stalled for months.
The developments suggested that a new phase in Iraq's convulsions might have started by opening a possibly violent battle for the country's top job between rival Shiite factions, which both have militias backing them. The incumbent prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, has said he will fight to keep his job, and his principal supporter is Moktada al-Sadr, a rebellious cleric whose Mahdi Army militia has resorted to violence many times to enforce his wishes. 
 Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw, who came here unannounced in a driving rainstorm from a meeting in England punctuated by antiwar protests, told reporters they did not want to intervene in the dispute over the prime minister. But at the same time they pointed out that Mr. Jaafari had been unable to win enough political support to form a government since his nomination on Feb. 12.
 ''They've got to get a prime minister who can actually form the government,'' Ms. Rice said after a meetings with Iraqi leaders -- which included a visibly uncomfortable photo session with Mr. Jaafari -- inside the Green Zone, the fortified part of Baghdad that houses the Iraqi government and American Embassy. She added, ''I told them that a lot of treasure, a lot of human treasure, has been put on the line to give Iraq the chance to have a democratic future.''
 Neither Ms. Rice nor Mr. Straw would specify whether they had applied even tougher pressure on the Iraqi leaders. But Ms. Rice's references to the loss of lives -- more than 2,300 American soldiers alone have died here since the March 2003 invasion -- and the many billions of dollars spent clearly reflected the growing impatience in Washington and London for more progress. 
 The fracturing of the Shiites became clear in the late afternoon, as a senior official in the leading Shiite party, Sheik Jalaladeen al-Sagheir, said in a telephone interview that his party was putting forward another candidate to replace Mr. Jaafari. ''I've asked Jaafari to resign from his job,'' said Sheik Sagheir, a deputy to the Shiite bloc's leader, Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim. ''The prime minister should have national consensus inside the Parliament, and he should have the support of the international body.''
 Any dispute between the Shiite bloc's two biggest factions -- Mr. Hakim's party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and the party led by Mr. Sadr -- carries with it the possibility of armed violence. The factions are longtime rivals, have backing from Iran and operate militias with members in the Iraqi security forces. Their militias fought street battles last August throughout Baghdad and the south, even hijacking double-decker buses to storm office buildings.
 Nasr al-Saadi, a Sadr member of Parliament, said Sunday that Mr. Jaafari still had the backing of Mr. Sadr's faction. ''He was elected in a democratic way,'' Mr. Saadi said, referring to the fact that Mr. Jaafari won his nomination in a secret ballot among the Shiite bloc's 130 members. ''This is democracy. I haven't been informed that the Shiite alliance will change candidates.''
 The eruption among the Shiites could also redraw Iraq's political coalitions, if some Shiite politicians leave the bloc to side with other groups in the 275-member Parliament. That would weaken the religious Shiites, and it is one of the great fears of the most powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Since cobbling together the fragile Shiite coalition in late 2004, the ayatollah and his aides have been working hard to keep it together to ensure that the religious Shiites assume power over Iraq's minority Sunni Arab and Kurdish populations through elections. 
 The Supreme Council's defection came a day after a senior Shiite politician, Kassim Daoud, called for Mr. Jaafari to step down. Mr. Daoud has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Mr. Jaafari, as has Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi, a deputy in the Supreme Council. Mr. Mahdi lost to Mr. Jaafari by just one vote in February's balloting.
 Negotiations to form the government have been deadlocked over Mr. Jaafari's nomination. The Constitution gives the largest bloc in Parliament the right to appoint a candidate, but a two-thirds vote of the entire assembly is needed to install the government. In late February, the main Sunni Arab, Kurdish and secular blocs demanded that the Shiites withdraw Mr. Jaafari and select someone else. 
 Last Tuesday, Mr. Hakim fired the opening salvo in his campaign to unseat Mr. Jaafari by having his aides tell reporters that the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, had informed Mr. Hakim that President Bush preferred another candidate. That set off a furor here, with Mr. Jaafari saying in an interview that the Americans should stop interfering. ''I accept this position because it's an Iraqi, democratic choice,'' he said.
 Mr. Hakim, a former exile in Iran, and Mr. Mahdi were among the dozen Iraqi leaders who met with Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw on Sunday.
 Others in the Shiite bloc who oppose Mr. Jaafari include the Fadhila Party, led by a fundamentalist cleric who has called for Mr. Khalilzad's resignation, and many independent politicians. 
 Mr. Mahdi is considered the front-runner to replace Mr. Jaafari, but a compromise candidate could end up on top because of the enmity of the Sadr faction toward Mr. Mahdi and the Supreme Council. Options include Hussain al-Shahristani, a former nuclear physicist, and Ali Allawi, the finance minister and a cousin of Ahmad Chalabi, the former Pentagon favorite.
 Mr. Mahdi visited Washington last fall and was believed to have the backing of the Americans at the time. A rotund, bearish-looking man, he is a Western-educated proponent of free market economics, having disavowed earlier Maoist beliefs. He owns a house in the south of France, and American officials hope his exposure to the West tempers Islamist ideals honed by years in Iran.
 Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw flew into Baghdad in an unusual thunderstorm early on Sunday and were driven to the Green Zone in armored military vehicles. Sectarian violence and migrations have been soaring across Iraq partly because of the power vacuum, and American officials, including Ms. Rice, say a new government must be formed quickly to help stabilize the situation. 
 ''The Iraqi people are losing patience and that's showing up in polling, it's showing up, I'm told, in cartoons, it's showing up in the news coverage here,'' she said. In the evening, after the rains had ended, Ms. Rice said she had carried ''a very direct message'' to the Iraqis, and they had responded favorably.
 Asked whether she had indicated to Mr. Jaafari that he drop out, she said only that ''the message to all parties'' was to form a government quickly. She added that Iraq's leaders ''have to realize there is a particular urgency to this case.''
 Ms. Rice was last here in October, Mr. Straw in February. They made plans to spend the night -- a rarity for a visiting American official, particularly since an insurgent rocket attack on Al Rashid hotel in 2003 while Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz was staying there. 
 The decision to stay overnight was intended as something of a political statement. Last month, a senior official noted there was concern within the administration that it seemed hypocritical for top officials to assert that progress was being made in Iraq while refusing to spend more than a few hours. Visiting dignitaries also rarely leave the Green Zone.
 The world outside the zone is often awash in blood. The American military said Sunday that two soldiers had died from the crash on Saturday evening of an Apache attack helicopter, shot down south of Baghdad. Two other soldiers were killed Saturday in Baghdad by a roadside bomb, and a soldier died from noncombat injuries sustained in an operation on March 30 in Kirkuk.
 In Diyala Province, gunmen killed two civilians in Balad Ruz, and insurgents blew up a Shiite mosque northeast of Baquba. A policeman in Baghdad was killed, as was a lawyer in Basra. Six bodies were found in Baghdad, two of them abducted hospital workers; all had been shot in the head. Armed men kidnapped Waleed Subhi al-Dulaimi, the official in charge of religious tourism.

HEADLINE: Australia to Sell Uranium to China for Energy

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Monday, April 3 

 BODY:
Australia, one of the United States' closest allies, signed an agreement with China on Monday to sell uranium for use in China's nuclear power plants, in its continuing drive to meet its soaring energy needs. 
 The deal also opens the door for Chinese investment in Australian uranium mines.
 The agreement, negotiated over the last year in Beijing, is the highlight of a three-day trip to Australia by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China, and underscores the importance of Australia as a base for China's widening demand for natural resources. 
 Mr. Wen spent Sunday in Western Australia, the state that provides much of the raw materials Australia exports to China. 
 Australia is scheduled to deliver its first liquid natural gas to China from the North West Shelf gas development in Western Australia in the next several months and is already one of China's biggest suppliers of iron ore. 
 But because uranium is used in nuclear weapons, it is in a different category from that of other commodities. 
 The conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard has emphasized that China has agreed not to use Australian uranium in its weapons program, or for other military purposes. 
 The Australians also emphasize that China, unlike India, which the Bush administration agreed last month to provide with nuclear technology, has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Australia described the accord as a safeguards agreement that stipulated conditions for the sale and will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 A senior Australian official in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Sunday that the United States was ''hardly in a position'' to criticize the sale of uranium for peaceful purposes to China after announcing that it would seek an exemption from Congress to sell fuel to India for its civilian nuclear plants. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was informed of Australia's plans to sell uranium to China on her visit here last month. ''She simply listened to the fact we have negotiated an agreement within the framework of the'' nonproliferation treaty, the Australian official said. 
 An American specialist on nuclear issues, George Perkovich, who criticized the Bush administration's accord with India as allowing India to amass nuclear weapons, said he did not consider China a similar case. 
 Unlike India, China had all the fissile nuclear material it needed for weapons, said Mr. Perkovich, the director of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
 ''There is every reason to think China will be using uranium for civilian uses,'' he said. ''If you're a country that sells uranium to countries for nuclear power, there is no argument for not selling it to China.'' 
 The deal with China, which was signed in the capital, Canberra, has been greeted with fanfare in Australia, and was preceded by a long interview of Prime Minister Wen in the newspaper The Australian. 
 Mr. Wen made clear that China's growing economic relationship with Australia locked in an important American ally as an important Chinese friend as well. ''We believe that countries which are allied with the United States can also be China's friends, and Australia is one of them,'' he said. 
 The Howard government, while supportive of the Bush administration in Iraq, has told the United States that it cannot count on Australia to be at its side in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan. 
 The uranium accord comes as China tries to reduce its heavy reliance on fossil fuels. It has nine nuclear power reactors, but has announced an ambitious program to build as many as three reactors a year. 
 Australia holds an estimated 40 percent of the world's reserves of easily extractable uranium and sells it in the form of uranium oxide to the United States, Canada and South Korea for use in civilian nuclear reactors. 
 The sale of uranium has long had opponents in Australia, who have argued that because uranium is used in nuclear weapons, it should be left in the ground. Australia has no nuclear power industry of its own, and uranium production has been limited to three operating mines. The argument that nuclear power can help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases has also cut opposition to the deal. 
 But in an effort to show that it supports an economic boom that rides so heavily on exports of natural resources to China, the major opposition party, the Australian Labor Party, indicated this weekend that it would favor more expansive uranium production. That leaves the small Green Party as the major vocal opponent to the sale. 
 After visiting India last month, Mr. Howard said his government might reconsider its current position on not selling uranium there. 
 One of the features of the accord signed Monday for which China was most eager, Australian officials had said, is an agreement that China could invest in the Australian uranium industry. 
 The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Fu Ying, last year went to the state of South Australia and visited the Olympic Dam uranium mine, which is owned by BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company. 
 The Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said recently that once a safeguards agreement was reached on uranium sales, there was no reason that a Chinese company could not apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board for approval to invest in uranium mining. 
 Amplifying on those remarks, an Australian official at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said over the weekend that it was likely that the Chinese would seek minority equity in a uranium mining company as a way of assuring its supply. The agreement to be signed Monday paved the way for such an investment, he said. 
 Formal negotiations for the accord with China began in Beijing in August, but informal talks began many months before, Australian officials said. The negotiations were led by John Carlson, director general of the Australian Safeguards and Nonproliferation Office, and were completed last month. 
 According to an account by the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department, Australia will rely on China's inspections agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear monitoring arm of the United Nations, to ensure that the Australian uranium is used only for nuclear power reactors.

HEADLINE: Citing a Legal Snarl, Official at Deutsche Bank Resigns 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 2 

 BODY:
Unable to shake a long-running legal dispute with a former client of his bank, the supervisory board chairman of Deutsche Bank, Rolf E. Breuer, resigned on Sunday, saying he wanted to ''relieve Deutsche Bank of further discussion'' of his case.
 Mr. Breuer, 68, has been under a legal cloud since early 2002, when he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the German media mogul Leo Kirch in a television interview. Mr. Kirch sued Mr. Breuer, accusing him of precipitating the financial collapse of his empire. 
The Federal Court of Justice in Germany granted Mr. Kirch a partial victory in January, ruling that Deutsche Bank had violated its contractual obligations toward one of Mr. Kirch's companies, and could be held liable for damages.
 Lawyers for Mr. Kirch recently challenged Mr. Breuer's fitness to lead Deutsche Bank's annual meeting in June. Officials at the bank said Sunday that a judge in Frankfurt had indicated that he might rule against Mr. Breuer.
 Such a decision would have hindered the bank, according to these officials, at a time when it was defending its chief executive, Josef Ackermann, against criminal charges in an unrelated case.
 ''He just felt it was becoming almost impossible for him to function,'' a senior executive said of Mr. Breuer, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''If he carried on, he was going to tie the bank up in knots.''
 Deutsche Bank said it would appoint Clemens Borsig, its chief financial officer, to be Mr. Breuer's replacement. That choice is unusual, since after a chairman leaves, the chief executive normally moves up into that post, as Mr. Breuer did in 2002.
 Mr. Ackermann, however, is a Swiss-born investment banker who has expressed little interest in serving on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board. Mr. Borsig, 57, is the ranking German executive at the bank, with extensive experience in the energy and auto parts industries.
 Mr. Borsig's current post will be divided between two non-Germans: Anthony Di Iorio, an American, who will become chief financial officer, and Hugo Banziger, a Swiss, who will be chief risk officer.
 Several executives said that Mr. Breuer's departure had no implications for Mr. Ackermann, who has said he would stay in his job, despite a pending trial on charges that he wrongly awarded severance payments to executives of Mannesmann while he was a director there.
 In February, Deutsche Bank's board extended Mr. Ackermann's contract until 2010. Unlike Mr. Breuer, Mr. Ackermann has not had a court rule against him and is not facing legal challenges to his authority. In a statement, he said that Mr. Breuer had made a ''highly honorable decision.''
 For Mr. Breuer -- an imposing figure who led Deutsche Bank's expansion into investment banking with the acquisition of Bankers Trust in 1999 -- the resignation is an abrupt end to a long career.
 Mr. Breuer's troubles began in February 2002, when he said during a 1-minute, 37-second interview on Bloomberg television that ''everything you read and hear'' about the Kirch Group suggests that ''the financial sector isn't prepared to provide further'' loans or equity.
 Lawyers for Mr. Breuer contended that Kirch's financial woes had been well known, and that Mr. Breuer had a right to express himself. But Mr. Kirch sued, saying the remarks sealed his company's fate.
 The federal court, ruling on an appeal, issued what amounted to a split decision. It said Deutsche Bank was not responsible for the collapse of the entire group, but had breached its obligations to one of its subsidiaries. 
 Mr. Breuer's departure comes nearly a year after he was ousted from the board chairmanship at Deutsche Borse, operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
 Hedge funds that owned shares in Deutsche Borse pushed for Mr. Breuer's resignation after he supported a takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange in December 2004 orchestrated by the chief executive, Werner G. Seifert. Mr. Seifert, also forced to resign, has just published a book giving his side of the story, which features Mr. Breuer's role.

HEADLINE: New Top Aide Is Trying to Show the White House Can Play Well With Others

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
It was just a few hours after President Bush named Joshua B. Bolten as his new chief of staff last Tuesday, and Mr. Bolten was already acting on one of the White House's top priorities: soothing disgruntled Republicans. 
 He placed dozens of phone calls, not just to House and Senate leaders but also to young Republican mavericks who had criticized Mr. Bush as engaging in out-of-control spending.
''It was not just a courtesy call,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, who had been pushing that same day for deeper spending cuts than Mr. Bush or House leaders had proposed. ''He was calling to solicit input from back-bench conservatives on how the White House might do a better job of interacting with Congress.'' 
 In almost three years as Mr. Bush's budget chief, Mr. Bolten showed a knack for pushing the White House's financial agenda without alienating Republicans on Capitol Hill. As chief of staff starting in mid-April, he will have to employ that skill on a broader basis as he tries to reunify Republicans behind the administration and keep Mr. Bush's presidency from sinking into lame-duck status. 
 With Mr. Bush immersed in the war in Iraq and his popularity at its lowest levels ever, once reliable Republican allies in Congress are balking on spending, taxes, immigration and even national security. 
 Irritation about the perceived hubris at the White House, suppressed when Mr. Bush was popular, is now coming from many directions: from hard-line fiscal conservatives like Mr. Pence, from moderates like Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, and from pragmatic power brokers on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. 
 ''You can't stonewall the legislative branch of government,'' Ms. Snowe said Friday in an interview. ''They should call on Congress more than they have.''
 Mr. Bolten's record as budget chief, and before that as deputy White House chief of staff for policy and as policy director of Mr. Bush's 2000 campaign, shows him to possess a necessary deftness and diplomacy. But it also suggests that he is unlikely to lead an effort to redirect the administration in any fundamental way. 
 Mr. Bolten has been an integral part of the team that developed and carried out the policies now at the root of the administration's political problems, especially on domestic concerns.
 While he has a reputation outside the White House as being a pragmatist and a deal maker, he has been a steely advocate for Mr. Bush's agenda of tax cuts, spending cuts and a sweeping overhaul of entitlement programs like Social Security.
 It is not clear what influence, if any, Mr. Bolten will have over issues of national security, and especially over Iraq, once he takes over from Andrew H. Card Jr. as chief of staff. His experience in foreign affairs is relatively limited, and in that sphere he will be dealing with the administration's heavyweights, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, not to mention the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley. 
 But Mr. Bolten will be a constant presence at Mr. Bush's side during a critical period, and the years he has spent in the president's orbit suggest that he will carry considerable clout, particularly when it comes to managing constituencies inside and outside the administration.
 ''He's extraordinarily good at dealing with other people,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, a former top economic adviser to Mr. Bush who is now dean of Columbia Business School. ''He is not after credit for himself. He is after getting the job done.'' 
 Perhaps the most important indicator of Mr. Bolten's political skills is the contrast between his popularity in Congress and the open hostility that many top Republicans had toward Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., his predecessor as budget director.
 Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida and a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, became so enraged at Mr. Daniels's refusal to answer questions that the two barely spoke.
 But Mr. Young describes himself as one of Mr. Bolten's biggest fans. When Mr. Young insisted that Florida needed more money for hurricane relief in 2004 than the administration had proposed, Mr. Bolten met with him for more than an hour and eventually agreed to add more than $2 billion to the package of emergency spending.
 ''The minute Josh took over, he and I established communications that worked very well,'' Mr. Young said. ''He was more than willing to listen, and on occasions when he agreed he would even change his position.''
 A graduate of Princeton University and Stanford Law School, Mr. Bolten worked for the United States trade representative and as a White House adviser for the first President Bush. During the Clinton administration, he worked for Goldman Sachs in London. 
 When the younger Mr. Bush, as governor of Texas, began contemplating entering the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Bolten moved to Texas to advise him. 
 ''He signed up with the Bush campaign very early, and he is extraordinarily close with everyone in the inner circle,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005.
 Since Mr. Bush's election victory in 2000, Mr. Bolten has had a central role in matters of economic policy. 
 Current and former administration officials say Mr. Bolten did not act as a master strategist but rather as a coordinator for Mr. Bush's top initiatives. As deputy chief of staff during Mr. Bush's first two years in office, Mr. Bolten kept a chart on his wall to set priorities and keep track of timing. 
 As director of the Office of Management and Budget, which determines the president's annual budget proposal for the entire federal government, Mr. Bolten was the point man for reducing the deficit, which is expected to top $400 billion this year.
 Mr. Bolten has had some success. Spending on nonmilitary discretionary programs, the domestic initiatives like space exploration and education that Congress reauthorizes each year, has been virtually flat for two years in a row. Adjusted for inflation, spending on scores of popular programs has been cut. 
 But domestic discretionary programs account for less than one-fifth of government spending. The other four-fifths -- spending on the military, swollen by the war in Iraq, and on entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- have climbed sharply each year since Mr. Bush took office.
 Fiscal conservatives within the Republican Party say Mr. Bush has done too little to keep spending under control. They complain that he has yet to veto a bill, even last year's huge highway spending bill that was packed with thousands of special-interest projects.
 And while Republican lawmakers praise Mr. Bolten for his diligence and expertise, many say they are unsure whether he will be able to get Mr. Bush back on track.
 ''We always felt as House conservatives that we had a sympathetic ear with Bolten,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. Referring to Mr. Bolten's appointment as chief of staff, he said, ''The question is, How much good could he do in that position?''
 Mr. Young of Florida, one of the most senior Republicans in the House, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Bolten would have no choice but to take their cues from Congress.
 ''Presidents in their second terms, with few exceptions,'' Mr. Young said, ''don't have the persuasion that they have when they first come into office.''

HEADLINE: The Math Whiz vs. the Media Moguls in a Battle for Millions

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
Amid the flash of the Internet bubble, Henry C. Yuen, the chairman and chief executive of Gemstar-TV Guide International, did things his way. 
 Despite running a company worth more than $20 billion in early 2000 and being partners with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, he operated out of low-rent offices in Pasadena, Calif. A visitor to the headquarters recalls that using a fax machine required unplugging the telephone because there was only one line. A former Gemstar employee recalled Mr. Yuen driving to lunch four blocks from the office, but then parking two blocks away to avoid paying a valet charge.
 But even as Mr. Yuen was pinching pennies, he was manipulating hundreds of millions in revenue to make the company look more profitable, according to prosecutors and investors. 
 Mr. Yuen was forced out as Gemstar's chairman and chief executive more than three years ago, after the company acknowledged that revenue had been inflated and the stock price collapsed. News Corporation's involvement with Mr. Yuen -- it owns 41 percent of Gemstar -- resulted in 2002 in a $6 billion write-down, the biggest such hit Mr. Murdoch has taken in his storied career. 
 An investigation into Mr. Yuen's conduct by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a tangle of other litigation, show that Mr. Yuen, a mathematician and lawyer who built Gemstar by developing and aggressively defending patents for television viewing, still casts a long shadow over the News Corporation and Mr. Murdoch. 
 News Corporation, through Gemstar, has pursued Mr. Yuen with unusual vigor, going so far as to file a victim statement asking a court to overturn Mr. Yuen's plea agreement in a criminal case. In addition to his other legal troubles, including a class-action lawsuit, Mr. Yuen faces an arbitration dispute with Gemstar, in which Mr. Murdoch seeks to force Mr. Yuen to return earnings totaling some $100 million, including $2 million in annual salary he still receives under the severance agreement. 
 Neither Mr. Murdoch nor Mr. Yuen would comment for this article. But several people who work closely with Mr. Murdoch say Gemstar's tough stance has been a response to Mr. Yuen's hardball tactics.
 ''Rupert doesn't look back, he doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about Henry,'' Lawrence A. Jacobs, group general counsel for the News Corporation, said in an interview. He added, however, ''This is one of the few people we've ever dealt with who clearly committed fraud.''
 Ripples from the Gemstar debacle go beyond financial losses. Gemstar represented the beginnings of a partnership between News Corporation and the media billionaire John C. Malone that has become hotly contentious. 
 Last month, in a civil action brought by the S.E.C., a federal district judge in Los Angeles ruled that Mr. Yuen had committed accounting fraud while running Gemstar by misrepresenting some $200 million worth of revenue in seven transactions from 1999 to 2002. At a hearing Wednesday, the judge, Mariana R. Pfaelzer, will deliberate on the S.E.C.'s request that Mr. Yuen pay more than $60 million in restitution. Mr. Arkin said his client intended to appeal. Separately, a spokesman for the United States attorney in Los Angeles said a criminal inquiry on Mr. Yuen was continuing. 
 Mr. Yuen, who is 57, has maintained that he was the target of an orchestrated effort by Mr. Murdoch's allies to commandeer the business he had built. 
 His lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, asserted: ''To some extent, this company, News Corporation, set out to blow up my guy and they did it. It's too bad it came to this. I think we have severely diminished our opportunity to benefit from the genius of Henry Yuen and his vision and entrepreneurship.''
 Gemstar's early chapters were far more promising for Mr. Yuen. The son of a Hong Kong lawyer, he moved to the United States when he was 17 to study mathematics at the University of Wisconsin and then at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. At Caltech, he became friends with another doctoral student, Daniel Kwoh, with whom he would found Gemstar in 1989. ''He played soccer very well, even though he was kind of smallish -- he was very fast, very decisive,'' Mr. Kwoh recalled in an interview. 
 Mr. Yuen went on to gain a law degree from Loyola University. He put his knowledge of math and law together with Mr. Kwoh to invent VCR Plus, a patented system for simplifying the way people program their videocassette recorders. Although relatively few people used VCR Plus, Gemstar was able to persuade both hardware makers and publishers of TV listings, including Mr. Murdoch's TV Guide, to pay license fees for it. 
 Mr. Yuen's next innovation was to buy up companies that had developed interactive programming guides that would help navigate the growing numbers of TV options.
 Mr. Yuen could be ruthless. Outside Gemstar, he acquired the nickname ''patent terrorist'' for his willingness to sue potential partners like Thomson Electronics or Time Warner. Framed copies of the company's patents decorated the conference room. 
 Within the company, he was abrupt and secretive as a chief executive, and former colleagues say his only confidant was Elsie M. Leung, Gemstar's longtime chief financial officer. Three Gemstar employees said Mr. Yuen would suddenly turn to Ms. Leung in meetings with other executives and begin speaking with her in Cantonese. ''I would not say of Henry that sweetness and diplomacy were his strong suit,'' Mr. Arkin said. 
 In another of Mr. Yuen's many legal tangles, he has been in lengthy litigation with his ex-wife, Molly Yuen, the mother of two of his four children. She contended in a 1996 lawsuit that Mr. Yuen forged her signature on divorce documents a decade earlier and that she was not aware of the faked divorce for years. She argued that the divorce was intended to deprive her of a claim on Mr. Yuen's growing fortune. Mr. Yuen denied the accusations and, although the divorce matter was settled in 2000, the couple remains in litigation over payments Mr. Yuen stopped making to her two years later. 
 Mr. Kwoh left the company in 1997 after what he described as a dispute over business strategy, which he declined to elaborate on. Although he and Mr. Yuen both live in Pasadena, they have not spoken since, Mr. Kwoh said. 
 Mr. Malone and Mr. Murdoch had tried separately and together to buy out Mr. Yuen. They both coveted Gemstar's rich profit margins from licensing; in 1998 the company had a profit of $38.7 million on revenue of $126 million. Indeed, amid the hoopla over convergence at the time, Mr. Yuen thought that his on-screen guide would be the ultimate toll-keeper for the media and told colleagues that Gemstar would someday be bigger than Microsoft. 
 After his efforts to buy Gemstar failed, Mr. Malone became a big shareholder in TV Guide by merging a company with his own on-screen guide business into it. Then in 1999, Mr. Murdoch proposed to Mr. Yuen that Gemstar acquire TV Guide for $9.2 billion in stock. This time, he agreed, with conditions: Mr. Murdoch would end up the biggest shareholder, but he would get an employment contract putting him firmly in charge for five years. Mr. Yuen next turned to buying companies to produce so-called electronic-book readers. Mr. Murdoch hailed Mr. Yuen in Business Week magazine as ''a brilliant strategist.''
 But cultures and strategies clashed. Mr. Murdoch felt that TV Guide was being neglected in favor of Mr. Yuen's electronic ventures. He began convening weekly management meetings at TV Guide's offices in New York that Mr. Yuen would attend by teleconference. According to one person who attended, Mr. Yuen would often put the meeting on hold after only a few minutes, leaving the sound of Muzak coming through the speaker as his contribution. 
 In private meetings, Mr. Murdoch and Peter Chernin, News Corporation's president, pressed Mr. Yuen to replace Ms. Leung as chief financial officer. Mr. Yuen refused. Mr. Yuen's lawyers described this as ''a campaign to take over Gemstar and oust Dr. Yuen'' in court filings, but News Corporation officials and lawyers deny this. They say they became increasingly concerned that Gemstar, under Mr. Yuen and Ms. Leung's direction, was overstating the growth prospects for the electronic publishing guides. 
 The Gemstar board began an internal investigation that led to revenue restatements that would total some $330 million. As the accounting issues became public in 2002, Gemstar's stock withered and the boardroom turned venomous. Mr. Yuen and Mr. Murdoch met several times -- accompanied only by Mr. Arkin on Mr. Yuen's side or Mr. Chernin with Mr. Murdoch -- to negotiate a graceful exit for Mr. Yuen. 
 Those negotiations led to Mr. Yuen's and Ms. Leung's departures in November 2002. But to Mr. Yuen's surprise, a nearly $30 million severance negotiated with Mr. Murdoch was placed in escrow by Gemstar at the behest of the S.E.C. 
 Mr. Yuen has admitted that shortly after Gemstar received a broad subpoena from the S.E.C., he deleted information from a hard drive in his Gemstar office, including e-mail and corporate documents. Then, the day before he was scheduled to testify before the S.E.C., Mr. Yuen installed a program that erased other files. A week later, he had the hard drive removed from his office, according to the criminal plea he entered into last year. 
 Mr. Yuen's lawyers say this was an error in judgment, not an admission that he had committed fraud. In pleading guilty to the obstruction charge last October, Mr. Yuen had agreed to serve six months of home detention and spend two years on probation. But both the S.E.C. and Gemstar, in its victim's brief, petitioned a federal district judge, John Walter, to reject the deal. 
 Richard L. Stone, a lawyer for Gemstar with Hogan & Hartson in Los Angeles, argued that as a result of the conduct by Mr. Yuen and others, Gemstar had already paid more than $70 million to settle shareholder lawsuits, plus a $10 million fine to the S.E.C. 
 In addition to the billions of dollars in market value Gemstar's shareholders had lost, Mr. Stone said, Gemstar has incurred more than $100 million in legal fees related to investigating and pursuing Mr. Yuen. 
 In December 2005, Judge Walter rejected the terms of the plea and Mr. Yuen withdrew it. 
 Last year Mr. Yuen struck a deal with the S.E.C. under which he would have paid some $14 million and avoided trial. But Mr. Yuen insisted that the money come from the frozen $30 million severance. When the judge rejected that request, Mr. Yuen told his lawyer, ''I have no other funds.'' This was unexpected, given that, among other earnings, Mr. Yuen had sold $59 million of Gemstar stock in the spring of 2002. 
 The S.E.C.'s case against Mr. Yuen proceeded to trial, where he and Ms. Leung testified that he did not knowingly order or commit any accounting fraud. In her ruling against Mr. Yuen on March 20, Judge Pfaelzer wrote that she ''did not find the testimony of either Yuen or Leung to be persuasive or credible.'' 
 All the others implicated in the Gemstar troubles, including Ms. Leung; Gemstar's auditor, KPMG; and three other former Gemstar executives have agreed to settle the S.E.C. claims against them. KPMG had paid $10 million, and Ms. Leung has agreed to pay $1.35 million. 
 For Mr. Murdoch's company, one of the scars from its involvement with Mr. Yuen is a deal it concluded with Mr. Malone shortly after the merger, in September 2000. Mr. Malone traded his 21 percent interest in Gemstar-TV Guide for a roughly 12 percent nonvoting interest in the News Corporation that, combined with 6 percent he already held, made him the conglomerate's largest shareholder outside the Murdoch family. Given the coming collapse in Gemstar shares, that proved to be a brilliant move for Mr. Malone. Two years ago, he surprised Mr. Murdoch by converting his stock into voting shares. Last year, Mr. Murdoch put in place a poison pill to stave off his erstwhile friend and partner. 
 Gemstar now occupies a relatively quiet corner of the News Corporation. Mr. Murdoch's and Mr. Yuen's vision for the electronic programming guide as a major money maker has yet to materialize. Gemstar shares closed on Friday at $3.06, down from $41 in 2000. 
 Mr. Yuen has spent much of his time since Gemstar at a house in the Pasadena hills and at another house in Laguna Beach, Calif. People close to Mr. Yuen wonder why he did not move on from Gemstar while he had the chance. Had he taken the buyout offers for the company in the late 1990's, he would have walked away with $300 million. 
 Another former member of Gemstar's management team, who, like others interviewed for this article asked not to be identified because of the litigation surrounding Mr. Yuen, recalled asking Mr. Yuen shortly after the merger with TV Guide why he had not cashed out. Mr. Yuen's response: ''Sitting at the beach with all that money is my idea of hell.''

PERSON: Caleb Foote

HEADLINE: Caleb Foote, Law Professor And Pacifist Organizer, 88

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Caleb Foote, whose moral sense influenced him to go to prison for refusing to do even noncombatant work in World War II, then led him to become a law professor known for advocacy of criminal rights, died on March 4 at a hospital in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 88.
 The cause was a blood infection, said his daughter, Heather Foote. 
Mr. Foote was born in Cambridge, Mass., on March 26, 1917. He graduated in 1939 from Harvard, where he was managing editor of The Harvard Crimson, and earned a master's degree in economics in 1941.
 The Quaker faith of his mother drew him to pacifism, and he was hired that year by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization, to open its Northern California office. His draft board had denied his request for conscientious objector status in 1940, deciding that his religious argument for the status was based more on humanist principles than on theology.
 Mr. Foote then refused an order to report to a camp to perform alternative service, and as a result in 1943 he was convicted for violations of the Selective Service Act.
 ''Only by my refusal to obey this order can I uphold my belief that evil must be opposed not by violence but by the creation of goodwill throughout the world,'' Mr. Foote said in an interview with The Associated Press.
 He served six months at a federal prison camp, then resumed his work with the fellowship, spending much of his time speaking out against the internment of Japanese-Americans. In 1943, he helped produce a pamphlet on the subject, titled ''Outcasts,'' with the photographer Dorothea Lange.
 In 1945, Mr. Foote was again sentenced for draft law violations and served a year at a federal penitentiary. He was pardoned by President Harry S. Truman. From 1948 to 1950, Mr. Foote was executive director of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors.
 He then decided to go to law school, inspired by the desire to address the racial and economic inequalities he had witnessed in the criminal justice system, his daughter said. In 1953, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was managing editor of the law review.
 The next year, he became a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law. He persuaded a federal judge to reverse the conviction of an American Indian man whose lawyer had been incompetent. At a law school convention in New York in 1954, Mr. Foote called for the strengthening of civil remedies for false arrest.
 In 1956, he moved to Penn's law school, where he led a student team that studied New York City's bail system and recommended changes. He became a leader in bail reform, and, in 1966, his book, ''Studies on Bail'' was published. He argued that the bail system was biased against the poor and an unfair burden on falsely accused defendants. He even argued that bail was inherently unconstitutional.
 In 1965, Mr. Foote became a professor at the Boalt School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, where he specialized in family and criminal law. 
 In 1968, after student protests rocked Berkeley, he was a co-chairman of an investigative committee that recommended changes that including giving the campus autonomy from the rest of California's university system.
 He retired in 1987 and moved to Point Reyes Station in Marin County, Calif., where he became active in local conservation efforts and lived until his death. 
 In 1993, he did a study for the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco showing that the corrections department's share of state expenditures had grown to 8.2 percent from 3.9 percent over the past 10 years, while higher education's part had fallen to 9.3 percent from 14.4 percent.
 Besides his daughter, of Washington, Mr. Foote is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Hope Stephens; their sons, Robert Foote of Copper Hill, Va.; Andrew Eliot Foote of Los Angeles; Ethan Foote of Santa Rosa; and David Foote of Volcano, Hawaii; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Enron Trial, A Calculated Risk

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and KURT EICHENWALD; Alexei Barrionuevo reported from Houston for this article, and Kurt Eichenwald from Dallas.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 3 

 BODY:
Two of the country's best corporate salesmen are about to make the most important pitches of their lives.
 After 32 days of testimony from 22 witnesses, prosecutors rested their case last week in the criminal trial of Enron's former chief executives, setting the stage for the defense to take over as of Monday.
 Now the trial has moved to what may be the make-or-break moment for both sides: the testimony of Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay. Mr. Skilling could take the stand as early as Wednesday.
 If history is any guide, the words and even the attitudes of the two polished corporate chieftains, both of whom built their careers on persuasively marketing their business and themselves, could determine whether they leave the courtroom as free men or spend time in prison. 
 The testimony is fraught with peril. Often in white-collar cases, former corporate executives have taken the stand hoping to explain away the government case, only to demonstrate an arrogance and evasiveness that allowed the jurors to think that the defendants were knowing participants in crimes.
 ''History is filled with defendants who had their testimony blow up in their face,'' said Stephen Meagher, a former federal prosecutor who now runs his own law firm in San Francisco. ''It is a little like pulling the pin on a hand grenade and hoping that you get it to the other side before it blows up.''
 Experts say that a jury is willing to lay aside all of the previous evidence and make its judgment based on whether it finds the defendant believable. 
 ''The defendants put the whole case on the line when they testify,'' said Mark Zauderer, a partner at the law firm of Flemming Zulack Williamson Zauderer, and a specialist on juries. ''Once they take the stand, the whole focus changes from the government evidence to whether the jurors can buy the credibility of the defendants.''
 But that, of course, cuts two ways, experts said. Not only will the jurors put the government's evidence to the test based on the defendant's testimony, but they will do the same with any points that the defense lawyers have scored in the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.
 ''Skilling or Lay could undo in a stroke whatever progress the defense has done against the government's witnesses if the jury doesn't believe they are being forthcoming,'' Mr. Meagher said. 
 Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling face complex balancing acts in their testimony. For example, Mr. Skilling prides himself on his intelligence and he has made no secret of his desire to get on the stand and explain the workings of Enron in detail. But, lawyers said, going too far with that approach could backfire on him.
 ''It would be a mistake for Skilling to come across as a very shrewd, very knowing guy because it could lead the jury to conclude that he should have known of these irregularities,'' said John J. Fahy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Fahy Choi in Rutherford, N.J. Such a conclusion could lead a jury to decide that Mr. Skilling acted with willful blindness when he failed to see wrongdoing around him, a deduction that could be used to support a conviction.
 Moreover, the jurors will not be the only people listening to their testimony. If Mr. Skilling or Mr. Lay presents a defense that strikes Judge Simeon T. Lake III, who is hearing the case in Federal District Court, as simply not credible, their decision to testify could result in longer sentences for committing perjury if they are ultimately convicted.
 The testimony of the defendants underscores their ignominious fall after Enron's collapse. Once they were celebrated as Houston's greatest corporate citizens. They had the ear of many a power broker, from City Hall to Wall Street and even the White House. Those days are gone. Now, they can only hope to persuade the 12 people on the Houston jury that they are not liars and crooks.
 In the courtroom, the defendants are a study in contrasts. Mr. Skilling usually sits up straight and stares at the witness with wide eyes. His expression has been pained at times, as when his protege, Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer, testified against him. 
 Mr. Lay often slouches in his chair, looking with an impassive poker face at the witness, frequently scanning the jurors' faces. During some tough moments, as when Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former treasurer, was testifying, Mr. Lay turned his chair and put his back to the witness stand.
 While their legal teams plan a combined defense, Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay face different challenges in responding to the government's case. Mr. Skilling, 52, is charged with 28 counts of conspiracy, fraud and insider trading for time he spent as both chief executive and as the company's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Lay, 63, is charged with six counts of fraud and conspiracy, mostly related to the four months he spent as chief executive after reassuming the post when Mr. Skilling suddenly resigned in mid-August 2001. 
 In contrast to their situation with Mr. Lay, who kept a low profile and gave no sworn testimony before the trial, prosecutors will have about 2,000 pages of Mr. Skilling's previous testimony with which to challenge him. After Enron's bankruptcy filing in December 2001, Mr. Skilling gave sworn testimony to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission and did television interviews proclaiming his innocence. On the stand, Mr. Lay will describe his life like a Horatio Alger story, of growing up poor in rural Missouri, then rising to create what became the seventh-largest corporation in the world. Mr. Skilling will tell jurors about how a fast-rising management consultant joined the fledgling Enron and transformed the natural gas industry. 
 Both will buttress their cases with character witnesses. For Mr. Lay, these will include some of Houston's leading lights, like Philip J. Carroll Jr., the former Shell Oil Company chief executive; Robert Lanier, a popular former mayor; and Drayton McLane Jr., the owner of the Houston Astros. They are expected to highlight Mr. Lay's philanthropy and other civic acts.
 In Mr. Skilling's case, his character witnesses will focus on why he claims he abruptly resigned as chief executive -- because of physical and mental exhaustion and out of concerns for his family -- after only six months in the job.
 Both men have spent an extraordinary amount of time plotting strategy with their lawyers. Mr. Skilling has practically become a lawyer himself. He set up the Houston offices for Daniel Petrocelli, his lead lawyer, across the street from the courthouse. He secured office space there for himself, his wife and his younger brother, Mark, a lawyer who moved back to Houston from Istanbul to help Mr. Skilling with his defense.
 Mr. Skilling has forged a close bond with Mr. Petrocelli, who is only three months older than him and exhibits the same brash confidence. 
 Every morning, Mr. Skilling picks up Mr. Petrocelli at his hotel at 7 a.m. in his Mercedes and they stop at a Chevron station to get coffee before heading to the courthouse. In the months leading up to the trial, Mr. Skilling burned the midnight oil at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers seven days a week. Now Mr. Petrocelli says he makes him go home about 8 p.m. after he dines with the lawyers, so that he can appear rested during the trial.
 Both Mr. Petrocelli and Michael W. Ramsey, Mr. Lay's lead lawyer, say that neither defendant has received any coaching or done any mock trials in preparation for testifying. ''Nada,'' said Mr. Petrocelli, who said he was not worried that theemotional Mr. Skilling could lose his temper or otherwise blow up on the stand. ''I am sure he will have his moments,'' Mr. Petrocelli said, ''but I have a high degree of confidence that he will be fine.''
 Both men have fought to contain their feelings in court and generally emerge from the courthouse smiling at day's end. But there have been flashes of raw emotion. Mr. Skilling seemed especially pained as he watched Mr. Fastow and David W. Delainey, who headed the wholesale division and later the retail energy division, testify that Mr. Skilling took part in broad deceptions. 
 And after Mr. Glisan outlined what he said were public fabrications by Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling about the health of the company, Mr. Lay, uncharacteristically, erupted outside the courthouse. ''I've never heard so many lies in one day in my whole life,'' Mr. Lay told reporters, according to several accounts. Mr. Lay's wife, Linda, nodded her head and added, ''Unbelievable.''
 Recent white-collar criminal trials have demonstrated high stakes when a chief executive takes the stand. For example, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, tried to portray himself as unknowledgeable about many aspects of his own business to explain how he could have been unaware of the company's multibillion-dollar accounting fraud. Mr. Ebbers was convicted, with many legal analysts portraying his testimony as simply unbelievable.
 Another chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski from Tyco, testified at his criminal trial that he accidentally failed to report $25 million in special bonuses on his taxes and also accidentally overlooked disclosing those payments in the company's public filings. The jury rejected his arguments and convicted him on charges of looting the company.
 Other former chief executives have seen their sentences grow as a result of their testimony at trial. For example, Paul A. Bilzerian, the former chairman of the Singer Corporation, received a four-year prison sentence, one of the longest handed down during the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's, as a direct result of his testimony. During that testimony, Mr. Bilzerian made statements that the judge found unbelievable, like claiming to have no knowledge that he was legally required to file a tax return. 
 ''If Mr. Bilzerian had not testified at all at the trial, his sentence would not be what it was,'' Judge Robert Ward, who presided over the Bilzerian case in federal court, said at the time of sentencing.
 Indeed, many chief executives who have testified at their own criminal trials have found that the aggressive, cocksure attitude that helped them climb the corporate ladder can undermine their jury appeal.
 ''The skills that made them a charismatic leader of a company don't always translate into making them a good witness for the defense,'' said Robert Mintz, a former prosecutor who is a partner at McCarter & English. ''Historically the odds are stacked against a C.E.O. taking the stand.''


GRAPHIC: Photos: Kenneth L. Lay, left, and Jeffrey K. Skilling will soon face the questions. (Photographs by Michael Stravato for The New York Times)Chart: ''Building the Case''In the trial of Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, the former top executives at Enron, other former Enron executives have said that Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay orchestrated and were aware of the strategies used to conceal problems that led to Enron's collapse. In cross-examination, defense lawyers have tried to portray what happened as resulting from a credit collapse and suggest normal business practices are being criminalized by the government. Here is some of what witnesses have said and what the defense has argued, so far.Key Government Witnesses Former position1. Mark E. Koenig -- Director, investor relations2. Paula H. Rieker -- Board secretary, manager investor relations3. Wesley H. Colwell -- Chief accountant, wholesale energy trading4. David W. Delainey -- Chief executive, Enron Energy Services5. Andrew S. Fastow -- Chief financial officer6. Ben F. Glisan Jr. -- TreasurerThe DefendantsKenneth L. Lay -- Chairman and chief executiveJeffrey K. Skilling -- Chief executiveManaging and manufacturing earningsEVENT: Second quarter 2000 earnings releaseCORROBORATING WITNESSESMark E. KoenigPaula H. RiekerWesley H. ColwellTESTIMONY: One day before Enron was to report earnings, they were 33 cents a share, exceeding analysts' expectations by penny. The next day, earnings were reported at 34 cents. Mr. Koenig said he met with Mr. Skilling and Richard A. Causey, the chief accounting officer, to talk about why the earnings were raised. During this time, reserves in the wholesale energy trading division were tapped to increase earnings, which violated accounting rules, according to Mr. Colwell.QUOTATION OR KEY FACT: Mr. Koenig recalled that at the meeting with Mr. Skilling and Mr. Causey, ''There was a determination made to report 34 cents for the quarter.'' Mr. Colwell said he heard that it was Mr. Skilling's ''preference'' that the reserves be tapped to meet earnings.DEFENDANT INVOLVEDKenneth L. LayJeffrey K. SkillingDEFENSE RESPONSE: Mr. Colwell said that neither Mr. Lay nor Mr. Skilling had ever asked him directly to manipulate the division's earnings or to tap its reserves.Hiding lossesEVENT: March 29, 2001, meeting in Mr. Skilling's officeCORROBORATING WITNESSESMark E. KoenigDavid W. DelaineyTESTIMONY: At the meeting, a decision was made to shift $200 million in losses from the retail division to the profitable wholesale division. As a result, the retail division reported $40 million in first-quarter profits. Mr. Skilling told analysts the division had ''explosive growth.'' Mr. Lay would later echo those words.QUOTATION OR KEY FACT: Mr. Delainey said, ''There was no business purpose but to hide the loss and I knew that was not proper. . . . That was the worst conduct I had ever been a part of, and everybody knew exactly what was going on.''DEFENDANT INVOLVEDKenneth L. LayJeffrey K. SkillingDEFENSE RESPONSE: Mr. Delainey acknowledged that Mr. Skilling did not give a direct order to shift any losses and he said that Mr. Causey, the chief accounting officer, told him the shift was a proper business resegmentation.EVENT: Aug. 15, 2001, meeting in Mr. Lay's officeCORROBORATING WITNESSESBen F. Glisan Jr.TESTIMONY: After Mr. Skilling resigned, Mr. Fastow told Mr. Lay that international assets were overvalued by $5 billion to $7 billion and that a huge restructuring or sale of the company would be necessary.QUOTATION OR KEY FACT: Mr. Lay told a BusinessWeek reporter five days later that Enron was ''probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been in.''DEFENDANT INVOLVEDKenneth L. LayDEFENSE RESPONSE: Mr. Glisan said that it was no surprise that the assets declined in value. That summer Enron had tried to sell its international portfolio. A deal to sell the assets to a sheik from the United Arab Emirates fell through when the sheik fell ill.Misleading analysts, investors and employeesEVENT: Dec. 2000, trading volatilityCORROBORATING WITNESSESMark E. KoenigDavid W. DelaineyTESTIMONY: Top executives portrayed Enron as a ''logistics'' company as opposed to one that made most of its money from trading. The reason was that trading companies had more volatile earnings and were valued less on Wall Street. In fact, Enron was primarily a trading company.QUOTATION OR KEY FACT: In December 2000, the wholesale unit had a one-day gain of $485 million in commodities trading, followed a few days later by a one-day loss of $551 million.DEFENDANT INVOLVEDKenneth L. LayJeffrey K. SkillingDEFENSE RESPONSE: The defense tried to show through Mr. Delainey and others that Enron had risk limits on speculative trading and that trading earnings were outsized in late 2000 because of the West Coast energy crisis. But witnesses insisted that volatility and big bets were driving Enron's bottom line.EVENT: Oct. 23, 2001, meeting with employeesCORROBORATING WITNESSESBen F. Gilsan Jr.TESTIMONY: One day before the employee meeting, Mr. Glisan said he told the finance committee of the board, including Mr. Lay, that Enron's liquidity was ''strained'' and that the company might need to write down some of its international assets.QUOTATION OR KEY FACT: At the employee meeting, Mr. Lay said the ''underlying fundamentals'' of Enron were ''the strongest they had ever been'' and that liquidity was ''strong.''DEFENDANT INVOLVEDKenneth L. LayDEFENSE RESPONSE: Notes taken by Ms. Rieker at the finance committee meeting showed that Mr. Glisan and Mr. Fastow said liquidity was adequate. Ms. Rieker's notes also showed that Mr. Causey said that one of Enron's biggest international assets, a British water company called Wessex, would not need a write-down.Undisclosed partnerships and side dealsEVENT: May 1999 board meeting discussing creation of the LJM partnershipCORROBORATING WITNESSESAndrew S. FastowTESTIMONY: Mr. Fastow said that Mr. Skilling defended his role in the partnership, which was being created to help Enron with its earnings. As part of the plan, Mr. Fastow was guaranteed $800,000 a year in profits.

He should get profits because he has skin in the game.''DEFENDANT INVOLVEDJeffrey K.

HEADLINE: Assets of Foundations Sprint Past Milestone, but Lower Payout Is Foreseen

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Foundation assets climbed above $500 billion for the first time last year, according to estimates issued yesterday by the Foundation Center.
 Nonetheless, the center, a research and educational group that tracks grants, expects total giving by foundations to fall this year as concerns about the national deficit, higher oil prices, volatility in the stock market and the war in Iraq weigh on the minds of foundation managers.
While 59 percent of foundations responding to the center's annual survey said they would increase their giving this year, 30 percent said they intended to cut it. 
 ''So many foundations predicted very small increases, and more than in the past said they planned to decrease their giving,'' said Loren Renz, the center's vice president for research. ''Even though those predicting gains outnumber those with plans to decrease giving, it seems the gains will be more than offset by the declines because those predicting gains are predicting small gains.''
 Inflation is also playing a role, eroding assets and the value of foundation giving; assets have not grown since 2000, after adjustment for inflation. Similarly, while giving among foundations reached an estimated record level of $33.6 billion last year, in inflation-adjusted terms that was slightly less than the peak amount reported in 2001.
 The nation's independent and family foundations, which together are generally known as private foundations, number more than 67,000 and continue to account for a vast majority of foundation giving. But the rate of growth among private foundations last year was the lowest since 1990, and giving by newer types is increasing rapidly.
 ''Independent and family foundations have dominated the numbers for years, but I think it's fair to say that the boom years for that form of philanthropy are waning,'' said Sara L. Engelhardt, president of the center. ''During their boom a lot of other models for giving became popular, and they've started to take hold.''
 The most robust rate of growth in giving last year was by community foundations, which are flourishing. Their giving increased an estimated 10.9 percent to a record $3.2 billion, a record for them even after adjustment for inflation.
 One factor in that big increase was that ''community foundations all over the country helped receive and channel and give funds for Katrina,'' said Jennifer Leonard, president and executive director of the Rochester Area Community Foundation in upstate New York and chairwoman of the community foundations leadership team at the Council on Foundations.
 Corporate giving was also spurred by disasters last year. Corporate foundations increased their giving by an estimated 5.8 percent, to a record $3.6 billion.
 ''I can remember when corporations were concerned that shareholders would react badly to their charitable giving,'' said Ms. Renz, the Foundation Center executive, ''but now it's considered good citizenship and good marketing.'' 
 Still, private foundations continue to account for the largest share of foundation giving. The Ford Foundation saw a $1 billion increase in assets in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and gave away $512 million, a 12.8 percent increase over the $454 million it gave away a year earlier. Ford pledged roughly $12 million to recovery and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, about half of which it has already disbursed, and has put $10 million into a program to support artists that it is underwriting together with the Rockefeller, Rasmussen and Prudential foundations.
 Susan V. Berresford, Ford's president and chief executive, said the foundation would most likely give away even more this year as a result of its asset increase and continuing disaster-related contributions. 
 But Ms. Berresford also voiced a note of caution. ''We believe the problems we work on will be with us over the long term, and we want to be a steady supporter and have an ability to stick with people working on them over long periods of time,'' she said. ''We have to be careful not to presume we will always have a billion dollars in new assets each year.''
 The Skoll Foundation and another fund that the eBay co-founder Jeffrey S. Skoll maintains at the Community Foundation Silicon Valley reduced their grants slightly last year, to $20 million.
 ''We made some exceptional grants the year before, like the $8 million we gave to Oxford University to create the Skoll Center, and so were down a bit this year,'' said Sally Osberg, president and chief executive.
 Ms. Osberg said the Skoll philanthropies, which control about $600 million in assets, had already given away $18.5 million this year. ''We'll probably get to around $25 million,'' she said. ''Jeff continues to build the foundations, and they're both growing at a healthy rate.''

HEADLINE: The Wall That Keeps Illegal Workers In

BYLINE: By Douglas S. Massey. 
Douglas S. Massey, a professor of sociology at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, is the author of ''Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Age of Economic Integration.''

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
THE Mexican-American border is not now and never has been out of control. The rate of undocumented migration, adjusted for population growth, to the United States has not increased in 20 years. That is, from 1980 to 2004 the annual likelihood that a Mexican will make his first illegal trip to the United States has remained at about 1 in 100.
 What has changed are the locations and visibility of border crossings. And that shift, more than anything, has given the public undue fears about waves of Mexican workers trying to flood into America. 
Until the 1990's, the vast majority of undocumented Mexicans entered through either El Paso or San Diego. El Paso has around 700,000 residents and is 78 percent Hispanic, whereas San Diego County has three million residents and is 27 percent Hispanic. Thus the daily passage of even thousands of Mexicans through these metropolitan areas was not very visible or disruptive. 
 This all changed in 1992 when the Border Patrol built a steel fence south of San Diego from the Pacific Ocean to the port of entry at San Ysidro, Calif., where Interstate 5 crosses into Mexico. This fence, and the stationing of officers and equipment behind it, blocked one of the busiest illicit crossing routes and channeled migrants toward the San Ysidro entry station, where their numbers rapidly built up to impossible levels.
 Every day the same episode unfolded: the crowd swelled to a critical threshold, whereupon many migrants made what the local press called ''banzai runs'' into the United States, darting through traffic on the Interstate and clambering over cars. 
 Waiting nearby were Border Patrol officers, there not to arrest the migrants but to capture the mayhem on video, which was later edited into an agency documentary. Although nothing had changed except the site of border crossings, the video gave the impression that the border was overwhelmed by a rising tide of undocumented migrants.
 In response to the ensuing public uproar, the policy of tougher border enforcement was expanded to all of the San Diego and El Paso area in 1993 and 1994. So migrants began going to more remote locations along the border in Arizona. In 1989, two thirds of undocumented migrants came in through El Paso or San Diego; but by 2004 two-thirds crossed somewhere else. (My statistics on Mexican immigration come from a study I have been undertaking with financing from the National Institutes of Health since 1982.) 
 Unlike the old crossing sites, these new locations were sparsely settled, so the sudden appearance of thousands of Mexicans attracted considerable attention and understandably generated much agitation locally. Perceptions of a breakdown at the border were heightened by news reports of rising deaths among migrants; by redirecting flows into harsh, remote terrain the United States tripled the death rate during border crossing. 
 Less well known is that American policies also reduced the rate of apprehension, because those remote sectors of the border had fewer Border Patrol officers. My research found that during the 1980's, the probability that an undocumented migrant would be apprehended while crossing stood at around 33 percent; by 2000 it was at 10 percent, despite increases in federal spending on border enforcement. 
 Naturally, public perceptions of chaos on the border prompted more calls for enforcement and the hardening strategy was extended to other sectors. The number of Border Patrol officers increased from around 2,500 in the early 1980's to around 12,000 today, and the agency's annual budget rose to $1.6 billion from $200 million. The boundary between Mexico and the United States has become perhaps the most militarized frontier between two nations at peace anywhere in the world.
 Although border militarization had little effect on the probability of Mexicans migrating illegally, it did reduce the likelihood that they would return to their homeland. America's tougher line roughly tripled the average cost of getting across the border illegally; thus Mexicans who had run the gantlet at the border were more likely to hunker down and stay in the United States. My study has shown that in the early 1980's, about half of all undocumented Mexicans returned home within 12 months of entry, but by 2000 the rate of return migration stood at just 25 percent. 
 The United States is now locked into a perverse cycle whereby additional border enforcement further decreases the rate of return migration, which accelerates undocumented population growth, which brings calls for harsher enforcement. 
 The only thing we have to show for two decades of border militarization is a larger undocumented population than we would otherwise have, a rising number of Mexicans dying while trying to cross, and a growing burden on taxpayers for enforcement that is counterproductive. 
 We need an immigration policy that seeks to manage the cross-border flows of people that are inevitable in a global economy, not to repress them through unilateral police actions.

HEADLINE: Border Of Insanity

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
This is a special edition of ''Lou Dobbs Tonight,'' news, debate and opinion. Live from Pyongyang, North Korea, Lou Dobbs:
 Good evening from North Korea. We had to go halfway around the world, but we've finally got good news for the working men and women of America angry about illegal immigration. Tonight you'll hear our exclusive report from the nation that proudly calls itself the Hermit Kingdom.
But first, more bad news from Washington. Despite my personal trip to Cancun for last week's summit meeting, President Bush remains hostage to foreign interests. My soaring ratings apparently mean nothing to the White House or the Senate Republicans working on an amnesty plan for the illegal immigrants now carrying Mexican flags through our streets. 
 Tonight's poll question deals with those protesters and where they get their money. As these reconquistadors plot to make California a province of Mexico, have they made a secret deal to turn the Los Angeles port over to an Arab company? Cast your votes at loudobbs.com. We'll have your answers later.
 A report out today refutes the claims that the American economy benefits from immigration and free trade. If you're a regular viewer, you already know that's a myth. But maybe these figures will knock the rose-colored glasses off a few so-called mainstream economists. The new report, from the Minutemen Institute of Research Study Analysis, shows that previous cost-benefit estimates ignored three crucial factors: 
 Since Nafta opened the border, the importing of cheap tortilla chips has worsened America's obesity epidemic by 475 million pounds.
 Intermarriage between immigrants and natives is expected to reduce the projected height of the average future worker, leading to a 2.4 percent decrease in earning potential.
 Americans lose 38.7 billion minutes of productive work time per decade sitting through telephone instructions to ''dial 2 for Spanish.''
 Add in those costs, and the net loss to the American economy is $4.3 trillion. I can't say it often enough: there's nothing free about free trade.
 No one understands that better than our hosts here in North Korea, the world's most economically independent nation. They know the hazards of foreign labor and foreign goods. ''Buy North Korean'' is more than a slogan here. Outsourcing is outlawed.
 How do they stay strong? Let's find out from the North Korean military leader in charge of border security. Thank you for joining us, General ---- excuse me, could you pronounce your name for our viewers?
 No. 
 No?
 That is an internal matter.
 Ah. Let's talk about something that's no secret: the difference between our borders. Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans annually sneak into the U.S. How many people make it up here across your southern border each year?
 Approximately zero.
 I can believe it. I sure didn't see any South Korean flags on the streets today. We got nothing but blank looks when we asked for the hiring spot for foreign laborers. What's stopping them? Is the whole border fenced?
 There are two fences across the Demilitarized Zone. Also thousands of artillery systems and land mines.
 I wish you could brief President Vicente Fox of Mexico and members of Congress. I bet they've never thought of land mines -- well, maybe Tom Tancredo has. And you also have 700,000 border agents?
 The number of troops is classified.
 But the point is, the message that our defeatists at home need to hear, is that with enough determination, you can seal the border. Nobody's digging tunnels under your fences, right?
 Actually, a few have dug tunnels.
 But you said that there have been virtually no crossings.
 In this direction. Some of our citizens have fled south.
 But what they could be looking for? You've got a self-sufficient economy.
 These are isolated cases of mental delusion. They believe tales of places where workers own personal telephones and bicycles -- even cars. [Laughs.] Fortunately, we apprehend most of them. 
 Well, the next time you catch one, I've got something you can share with him. I'd like to present you with a copy of my book ''Exporting America.''
 A foreign book? No, thank you.
 A man of principle. I respect that, General. 
 Up next, a tour of Pyongyang's finest restaurants, where you won't find any enchiladas -- or Mexican busboys. Stay tuned as we bust the myth that there are some jobs North Koreans won't do.

HEADLINE: Out of Consumers' Sight, Radio Tags Gain Ground

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The television advertisement from I.B.M.'s "Help Desk" campaign that began running this winter shows a big rig skidding to a halt in front of a desk, blocking the road in a desolate landscape. There, a young woman at the desk calmly informs the astonished truck driver headed for Fresno, Calif., that he is lost.
 "This is the road to Albuquerque," she says. How does she know he is off course? "RFID radio tags on the cargo. Helps track shipments." 
 Experts in RFID (radio frequency identification) wince at I.B.M.'s plug for its inventory-tracking abilities. It appears to confuse RFID with different radio-based technology, which can track the location of a truck (but not its contents) via satellite.
 In reality, the RFID tags on boxes and shipping pallets cannot convey information reliably for more than a few feet. And grabbing that information requires special scanning devices far more likely to be found at loading docks than inside a truck. The big advantage of the tags, however, is that they can contain more information than standard bar codes and several hundred can be scanned at once.
 Still, misleading as the ad was technically, it told a larger truth: RFID is still obscure to most consumers, but it is approaching commercial viability fast enough that I.B.M. wants the world to know it is a player. So do software giants like SAP, Microsoft and Oracle, and hardware heavyweights like Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems, which recently bought a minority stake in ThingMagic, a start-up manufacturer of RFID readers. 
 Perhaps more tellingly, Texas Instruments, a leading vendor of radio tags, hung on to that fast-growing $120 million-a-year segment of its business when it sold the rest of its sensors and controls operation in January for $3 billion.
 "Vendors are starting to see how they can make this into a real business," said Reik Read, an analyst who follows RFID for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. For now, Mr. Read said, the field is still too new to be a major factor in the valuation of any of the publicly traded companies he follows other than Intermec of Everett, Wash., which owns important RFID patents. That will change by 2008, he added. 
 The RFID world is still dominated by pilot projects, but the line between research and standard practice is getting hazier. Wal-Mart used such tags to track more than 10 million cases of goods through distribution centers in Texas by the end of last year, to make its vast supply network more reliable and efficient. Tesco, the British retailer, has said investments in the technology to prevent theft of CD's and DVD's are paying off. And Pfizer has begun putting tags on every package of Viagra it sells in the United States to combat counterfeiting and in anticipation of growing pressure from regulators to use the technology in the prescription drug industry.
 Manufacturers like Gillette and its new parent, Procter & Gamble, are using RFID data captured by retailers like Walgreen to study the effectiveness of promotions. Among other things, the data highlights how much profit is lost when items scheduled for a promotion are sitting in warehouses when they should be on shelves. This month, the shipping company DHL will begin a program for an Asian electronics manufacturer to ship RFID-tagged boxes to customers returning goods for repair, pick up the products and track the items through the repair process.
 "We are now seeing a lot of business applications being developed to use the data," said Erik Michielsen, an RFID specialist at ABI Research, a market research firm in Oyster Bay, N.Y.
 RFID technology comes in two forms. Passive tags consist of paper-thin microchips that are attached to equally thin antennae; they use power captured from signals broadcast by scanning devices to respond with the chips' encoded data. Active tags, which are larger, have a longer range and are more expensive, come with a small battery or other power source. They are widely used in toll collection systems like EZ Pass and for tracking valuable goods or animals.
 While the roots of the technology are decades old, interest mushroomed when leading retailers and manufacturers came together in 1999 to begin working toward open standards that, like bar codes, could be used throughout the economy. The pace accelerated in 2004 when Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense announced they would require suppliers to begin using passive RFID tags on cartons and pallets of goods.
 Those mandates generated unrealistic expectations in some quarters about the technology's ability and how rapidly it could expand. Many suppliers delayed investing and numerous obstacles emerged, including intellectual property battles, confrontations with privacy advocates and vendors failing to figure out ways to cut tag and reader costs as quickly as expected. There have also been delays in agreeing on standards, and many systems have not worked reliably. 
 Hurdles continue to come up. In mid-March, researchers disclosed that RFID tags could be tampered with to spread viruses through distribution networks. 
 There is also the sobering reality that nearly all the most promising results so far could have been achieved at similar cost - or more cheaply - with older technology or better management.
 But a growing number of businesses say they can now see how RFID could become more economical and powerful over time. "RFID is entering its adolescence," said Christine Overby, an RFID expert at Forrester Research, a technology research firm based in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: G.M. Board Gives Chief Some Time

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3 

 BODY:
The board of General Motors expressed support Monday for Rick Wagoner, the company's embattled chief executive, as G.M. announced a long-anticipated deal to sell a majority stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for $7.4 billion.
 It marked the board's first public comment on Mr. Wagoner since a spate of recent bad news, but analysts said it did not indicate unconditional backing. Indeed, accounting missteps prompted a board investigation two weeks ago after one error forced G.M. to increase its losses in 2005 by $2 billion, to $10.6 billion.
In a statement announcing the G.M.A.C. sale, G.M.'s lead outside director, George M. C. Fisher, said, ''This transaction along with the other progress G.M. has been making on its turnaround plan is an important milestone.'' 
 He went on, ''While there is still much work to be done, the G.M. board has great confidence in Rick Wagoner, his management team and the plan they are implementing to restore the company to profitability.'' 
 Mr. Wagoner is board chairman as well as chief executive.
 Boards rarely feel compelled to issue statements of support for leaders of healthy companies, said Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 ''It's giving Rick Wagoner time to address his problems and make progress on a turnaround,'' Professor Useem said. 
 But he added, ''I wouldn't want to interpret it as a long-term show of support. There's a limited amount of time before they want to see results.'' 
 At a news conference, Mr. Wagoner said he appreciated the board's gesture, adding that he felt he had the backing of G.M.'s union workers up through the company's ranks. ''I take heart in the confidence of the G.M. team, from the floor of the shops to the G.M. boardroom,'' Mr. Wagoner said.
 The G.M. board on Sunday approved the sale of the 51 percent stake in G.M.A.C. to a group of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management. The consortium also includes Citigroup and Aozora Bank of Japan. Under the deal, which was months in the making, the consortium will pay G.M. $7.4 billion, with another $2.7 billion in cash distributions later for a closing value of $10.1 billion. 
 G.M. said the deal would yield a total of $14 billion over three years, including the net book value that will accumulate from certain lease and retail assets retained by G.M. from G.M.A.C. 
 The arrangement is subject to regulatory and other approvals. The companies expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter.
 G.M. disclosed last year that it would sell a controlling interest in G.M.A.C. with two goals in mind: split G.M.A.C.'s credit rating off from that of the parent company, in an effort to return G.M.A.C. to investment grade and raise cash that G.M. needs to finance the development of new vehicles to reverse its slide in market share.
 Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, however, said the sale would not automatically accomplish G.M.'s goal of lifting G.M.A.C. from junk status. It downgraded both G.M. and G.M.A.C. last year, reflecting G.M.'s sales slump and fears over the impact of the Delphi Corporation bankruptcy, the parts supplier spun off by G.M. in 1999. Both are rated BB.
 If the deal closes successfully, S.& P. said it would raise G.M.A.C.'s rating to BB-plus, still a junk rating. ''They accomplished something,'' Robert E. Schulz, an S.& P. analyst, said. ''But we don't see that 51 percent-49 percent arrangement as earning an investment grade.''
 Still, he said, the proposed sale would increase G.M.'s cash, now at $20 billion, to about $27.4 billion, which would give it more cash than Ford Motor, which ended 2005 with $25 billion in cash.
 G.M.A.C. has been a lone bright spot for G.M., earning $2.4 billion in 2005, when G.M. lost more than $12 billion on its automotive operations.
 Even so, the price of the sale was lower than analysts had expected. When talk first surfaced last summer that G.M. might sell a controlling interest in G.M.A.C., analysts estimated it could bring up to $16 billion. Most recently, the stake was expected to fetch about $11 billion.
 Mr. Wagoner, however, said, ''When you add it up, it's a very good deal.''
 Shares of G.M. fell $1.13, to $20.14. 
 One use of the cash raised by the sale will be for incentives that G.M. is expected to offer members of the United Automobile Workers at Delphi, which asked a bankruptcy court judge last week to let it void its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wage and benefit rates.
 Under its proposal, the pay of U.A.W. members would drop from nearly $28 an hour to $22 later this year, and to $16 an hour next year. That assumes that the U.A.W. agrees to the deal and that G.M. provides incentives of $50,000 a worker to soften the impact.
 Otherwise, Delphi said, it would impose wages of $12.50 an hour. If Delphi were to do so, the U.A.W. warned, it could face a strike that could shut down G.M. and could lead to a bankruptcy filing by G.M.
 G.M. also has agreed to offer incentives to 13,000 Delphi workers who retire or leave the company, and has said it will take back 5,000 workers who worked for G.M. before it spun off the parts unit in 1999.
 G.M. has not made a formal commitment to provide the $50,000 per worker, but the chief executive at Delphi, Robert S. Miller Jr., said Monday he expected G.M.'s help. He noted G.M. has said the Delphi bankruptcy will cost it at least $5.5 billion, and as much as $12 billion.
 But in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Miller said Delphi does not want to ''unduly burden G.M. because we want them as a customer going forward.''
 Last week, Delphi said it would close or sell 21 of 29 plants in the United States, eliminating 20,000 union jobs, and cut another 8,500 jobs of salaried employees worldwide. 
 Mr. Miller said he did not expect to change his mind and keep any of the 21 plants, adding that union officials also needed to be willing to accept concessions at those factories if Delphi is to have a chance of finding buyers. ''They need to be competitive on those plants or nobody will want them,'' Mr. Miller said.
 His speech drew a handful of protestors from a union group, Soldiers of Solidarity, who marched in the rain across from the Masonic Temple, where Mr. Miller spoke. 
 Greg Shotwell, an organizer of the group, took issue with Mr. Miller's push for concessions, noting that Delphi had come up from its original demand for a wage cut to $9.50 an hour. Mr. Miller made mention during his speech of a protestor's sign that read, ''Miller isn't worth a buck'' referring to the $1-a-year salary he is drawing while Delphi is operating in bankruptcy. Quipped Mr. Miller, ''It must have been a typo.''

HEADLINE: Chavez Uses Aid To Win Support In the Americas

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez is spending billions of dollars of his country's oil windfall on pet projects abroad, aimed at setting up his leftist government as a political counterpoint to the conservative Bush administration in the region. 
 With Venezuela's oil revenues rising 32 percent last year, Mr. Chavez has been subsidizing samba parades in Brazil, eye surgery for poor Mexicans and even heating fuel for poor families from Maine to the Bronx to Philadelphia. By some estimates, the spending now surpasses the nearly $2 billion Washington allocates annually to pay for development programs and the drug war in western South America.
The new spending has given more power to a leader who has been provocatively building a bulwark against what he has called American imperialistic aims in Latin America. Mr. Chavez frequently derides Mr. Bush and his top aides. In March, he called Mr. Bush a ''donkey,'' a ''drunkard'' and a ''coward,'' daring him to invade the country. 
 But with the biggest oil reserves outside the Middle East, Mr. Chavez is more than an irritant. He is fast rising as the next Fidel Castro, a hero to the masses who is intent on opposing every move the United States makes, but with an important advantage. 
 ''He's managed to do what Fidel Castro never could,'' said Stephen Johnson, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ''Castro never had an independent source of income the way Chavez does. Chavez is filling a void that Castro left for him, leading nonaligned nations.''
 It remains unclear exactly how much the government has spent, because the state oil giant, Petroleos de Venezuela, has not made detailed financial records public, and its balance sheets have been shielded from independent audits. Mega-projects, like Mr. Chavez's utopian plan of building a gas pipeline through the Amazon from Venezuela to Argentina, are not likely to materialize.
 But Mr. Johnson estimates that Venezuela pledged $3 billion in aid last year to its neighbors, including generous bond purchases that made the government a lender of last resort across the continent. 
 The Center of Economic Investigations, an economic consulting firm in Caracas, issued a study recently that said Mr. Chavez had spent more than $25 billion abroad since taking office in 1999, about $3.6 billion a year, while First Justice, a leading opposition party, put the figure at $16 billion, based on Mr. Chavez's own declarations.
 What is clear is that upward of 30 countries as far away as Indonesia have received some form of aid or preferential deals.
 His government has purchased $2.5 billion in Argentine debt, the Venezuelan finance minister, Nelson Merentes, recently said, and was selling oil at cut-rate prices to 13 Caribbean countries and buying a big stake in Uruguayan gas stations. Some projects are as ambitious as the planned $3 billion purchase of 36 Brazilian oil tankers. Others are as modest as the $3.8 million in aid Venezuela has provided to four African countries.
 Critics see the spending as a reckless exercise in populist decadence intended to burnish Mr. Chavez's image as the region's leading statesmen while embarrassing the Bush administration, the Venezuelan leader's principal obsession since American officials gave tacit support to a failed coup against him in 2002. Venezuela may be enjoying record high oil prices, they say, but it remains poor and mismanaged.
 Mr. Chavez is ''spending considerable sums involving himself in the political and economic life of other countries in Latin America and elsewhere, this despite the very real economic development and social needs of his own country,'' said John Negroponte, the American director of national intelligence, in February at a Congressional hearing in Washington.
 Antonio Ledezma, an opposition leader and one of the president's more determined foes, said the policy's aim was to build ''a political platform with an international reach.'' 
 Mr. Chavez celebrates the spending as revolutionary largesse, intended to further his dream of unifying Latin America in a way Simon Bolivar could only dream of. 
 With the price of Venezuelan crude rising fivefold since Mr. Chavez was first elected in 1998, the spending has not hurt international reserves or Venezuela's credit worthiness. Oil analysts say the sustainability of that situation depends on the flow of revenues, the price of oil and the amount of crude Venezuela's oil industry is able to produce. 
 ''From a fiscal perspective,'' said Michelle Billig, director of political risk at the Pira Energy Group, a New York consulting firm, ''there's a lot of concern over the lack of savings and what an expansionary fiscal policy could do to their macroeconomic outlook should there be a downturn in prices or supply.''
 Critics who have questioned Venezuela's spending are roundly denounced by the government, which says its focus remains on providing for Venezuela's poor. Indeed, Venezuela plans this year to deposit $10 billion into a fund for social programs, Mr. Chavez said in February, up from $8 billion in 2005.
 The programs, government officials contend, have helped reduce poverty to below 30 percent of the population. Social scientists in Venezuela dispute the claim, saying that poverty still hovers at well over 50 percent. 
 Whatever the truth, polls show that Venezuelans, even those who strongly support Mr. Chavez, are increasingly concerned about the spending abroad. 
 While the president enjoys the support of a majority of Venezuelans, polls by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Washington polling company that has worked for Venezuela's opposition movement, show that fewer than 30 percent of Venezuelans believe the country should spend its oil revenue abroad.
 Even in Mr. Chavez's strongholds like Catia, a tumbledown neighborhood in western Caracas, it is not hard to find those concerned about the foreign spending, even if they support the government.
 ''They should first take care of their own house before taking care of others,'' said Benjamin Delgado, 71, a retiree who otherwise backs the government. ''I think Chavez does it so he seems bigger. He wants to be seen as an international leader. There are many things about him I support. Giving away money for exactly nothing, I don't like that.''
 Big deals -- often announced on Mr. Chavez's weekly nationwide television and radio broadcast -- go to the heart of the president's persona, that of a revolutionary out to remake a region he says has suffered under Washington's thumb. In the process, critics note, the Venezuelan government has fallen short on the more mundane aspects of governing, like fixing bridges, building homes or running hospitals.
 ''I do think this is a vulnerability of Chavez, that he prefers the grandiose to the pedestrian,'' said Michael Shifter, a policy analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group, who recently visited Caracas. 
 There is little doubt, however, that the spending has won Mr. Chavez stature and support abroad. For Argentina, the debt purchases helped President Nestor Kirchner, Venezuela's left-leaning ally, to pay off that country's $9.8 billion debt to the International Monetary Fund, ending Argentina's stormy relationship with the group. 
 In Cuba, Venezuela has supplied nearly 100,000 barrels of cut-rate oil per day -- a deal Cuba repays with doctors and other services -- making Mr. Chavez a benefactor on a par with the Soviet Union, which once bankrolled Castro's economy.
 In the Bronx this past winter, Citgo, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, provided heating fuel at a 40 percent discount to some 8,000 low-income residents of 75 apartment buildings.
 Even in Philadelphia, where thousands of households are benefiting from a program by Citgo to provide heating oil at a significant discount, people were won over, despite Mr. Chavez's antagonism toward Mr. Bush.
 ''All I can say is thank God for him for being able to help me and some others get some oil,'' said Geraldine Shields, a homeowner who received 200 gallons of free oil in January and will be able to buy fuel at a 40 percent discount. ''It's time somebody starting thinking of the little guy.''

HEADLINE: A Heroine Walking in the Shadow of Death

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: MEERWALA, Pakistan 

 BODY:
When I met Mukhtar Mai here two years ago, she was at her wits' end. Her campaign to fight rape and illiteracy had run out of money, and she was selling family possessions to keep her schools operating.
 Now so much has changed. Mukhtar, who also goes by the name Mukhtaran Bibi, has become an international celebrity. Her autobiography is the No. 3 best seller in France and is coming out this fall in the U.S., movies are being made about her, and she has been praised by dignitaries like Laura Bush and the French foreign minister.
Pakistan has also provided a paved road, electricity and telephone service to this village, she herself has learned to read in one of her own schools, and her new aid group is flourishing. 
 Best of all, her campaign is really working: more women seem to be prosecuting rapes and acid attacks, and there's some evidence that such violence is dropping.
 But partly because of her success, there's a good chance that Mukhtar will be murdered. ''The traditional landowners want me dead,'' Mukhtar said sadly. ''And the government doesn't want me around, either.''
 President Pervez Musharraf is a modern man, and I'm sure he is privately repulsed by acid attacks and rapes. In some respects, he's doing a fine job -- above all, he's presiding over a stunning 8 percent economic growth rate (those socks you're wearing may be manufactured in Pakistan). 
 But Mr. Musharraf seems to feel that Mukhtar is casting a spotlight on Pakistan's dark side, so he is leading an effort to bully her into silence. 
 The authorities confiscate Mukhtar's mail and feed vicious propaganda to sympathetic journalists, portraying her as a liar, a cheat and an unpatriotic dupe of India (and of me).
 ''My life and death is in God's hands,'' she said. ''That doesn't bother me. But why does the government keep treating me as if I were a liar and criminal?''
 A top police official has threatened to imprison her for fornication, which would discredit her and remove her from the scene. The charge is ludicrous, for Mukhtar is constantly chaperoned -- by rape victims who have sought sanctuary here and sleep on the floor beside her each night.
 ''For the first time, I feel that the government has a plan to deal with me,'' Mukhtar told me. And that plan, she said, is to kill her or throw her into prison. 
 Naseem Akhtar, the principal of Mukhtar's elementary school for girls, added, ''I want you to know that no matter how we are killed, even if it looks like an accident, it isn't.''
 The threats have come from high up. Brig. Ijaz Shah, a buddy of President Musharraf's, traveled to Lahore in December to deliver a personal warning. He met Dr. Amna Buttar, an American citizen who has interpreted for Mukhtar in the U.S. and heads a Pakistani-American human rights organization that is supporting her (www.4anaa.org). 
 According to Dr. Buttar, Mr. Shah started by defending the president's record on women's rights. But then, alluding to a planned visit by Mukhtar to New York, he added: ''We can do anything. We can just pay a little money to some black guys in New York and get people killed there.''
 That's right. The racism is the least of it: one of President Musharraf's closest aides was warning that unless Mukhtar piped down, the government of Pakistan might murder her and her American interpreter on the streets of New York. I asked the Pakistani government why it would do that, and Mr. Shah sent me a statement acknowledging that he had met with Dr. Buttar, but he said it had been a social visit and denied that he had threatened to kill anyone. ''The allegations to this effect are baseless,'' he said.
 Just for the record, I don't believe him. Mr. Musharraf should fire him at once.
 I make a big deal of Mukhtar because if poor nations like Pakistan are to develop, they need to empower women. When a country educates girls, they grow up to have fewer children and look after them better. They take productive jobs. And plenty of studies show that as women gain influence over family budgets, the money is less likely to go for tobacco, soda or alcohol, and more likely to be invested in small businesses and in children's education.
 This means that gender equality is not only a matter of simple justice, but also essential for fighting poverty and achieving economic development. If Pakistan is to become a rich and powerful country, it must empower its women -- and that is what Mukhtar's revolution is all about.
 So General Musharraf, back off! Leave Mukhtar alone, and go find Osama.

HEADLINE: Flunking the Oil Addiction Test

 BODY:
The muscle cars of yesteryear don't seem quite so impressive any more. In fact, as Matthew L. Wald pointed out in The Times the other day, the most powerful 2005 Toyota Camry, the ultimate plain-vanilla family sedan, accelerates more quickly than some 1975 Pontiac Firebird models. A 2005 Nissan sports wagon can outrun a '65 Mustang. 
 These examples confirm a disturbing truth: most of the fancy technology developed over the years by automakers here and abroad has been used to make cars bigger and faster. Greater fuel efficiency -- the very thing that would reduce America's oil dependency, as well as its contribution to global warming -- has taken a back seat. Indeed, fuel economy has actually declined in the past 20 years, largely because of the popularity of minivans and S.U.V.'s, and other vehicles collectively known as light trucks.
 On Wednesday, the Bush administration published new standards for S.U.V.'s and other light trucks, except for the very biggest. Officials called the standards ''the most ambitious fuel economy goals for light trucks ever developed.'' Measured against the need, as well as against what manufacturers are capable of doing with off-the-shelf technology, they are also extremely disappointing.
 The standards call for an 8.1 percent increase in miles per gallon over the four model years from 2008 to 2011. That change will save 10.7 billion gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of the new vehicles, the administration says, equal to about 227 million barrels of oil. That's useful, of course, but it really amounts to only about 25 days' worth of gasoline at today's consumption rates, and less than three weeks' worth of current oil imports -- a baby step toward President Bush's goal of reducing America's dependency on foreign oil.
 Buried deep in the rules is one other disappointment: a reassertion of the administration's view that only the federal government has the authority to set fuel efficiency standards and that any state program that has the effect of changing these standards is illegal.
 This is a direct challenge to a recent California law requiring automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions from new cars by 30 percent by 2016 -- a target that can be reached, as a practical matter, only by significant increases in efficiency. 
 This matter will ultimately be resolved in the courts or by Congress. In the meantime, the administration has missed another opportunity to address the twin problems of oil dependence and warming.

HEADLINE: One Big Insurer Decides to Offer Flood Coverage, Selectively

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
After decades of declining to sell flood insurance, the private insurance industry is tip-toeing into the business, starting with coverage in three inland states, one of the largest insurance companies said yesterday. The focus is on selected homes where risk is low and with premiums that might most appeal to princes and millionaires. 
 The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, which caters to wealthy homeowners and ranks eighth in the United States in sales, said it had begun offering the coverage in Arizona, Colorado and Illinois. Chubb said it expected to find a strong market among owners of expensive homes, especially after months of headlines about the devastating flooding from Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast.
By the end of the year, Chubb said, it expects to be selling flood insurance in 15 states, including Florida. But it plans to restrict sales to its existing home insurance customers and only to those whose homes are not sitting along beaches or riverfronts, where the risk of damage and even inundation is high. 
 It is also staying away from the other gulf states and most of the Atlantic Seaboard.
 ''We're being thoughtful about managing our overall catastrophe exposure,'' said Peter Spicer, who helped develop the new coverage. 
 Until now, only the federal government has sold flood insurance for homes. It has been bare-bones coverage and has been limited to no more than $250,000, leaving many homes with far less money than needed for rebuilding after a disaster. 
 Private insurers have contended that only those people expecting to be flooded would buy the coverage and that claims would bankrupt them. Chubb's approach is to continue to refuse coverage in the riskiest situations.
 The heavily subsidized government insurance sells for an average of $450 a year for maximum coverage. Chubb says most of its policies will probably cost at least $1,000, and many will probably run into multiple thousands of dollars for houses worth up to $15 million.
 ''We are going to charge what we believe is an adequate rate,'' Mr. Spicer said.
 Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group in New York, said he expected other home insurers to also begin offering flood insurance ''in a careful and limited manner.'' 
 Private insurers are not likely to replace the government insurance agency, he said, because ''so many properties are located in areas of such extremely high risk'' that only the government would be willing to insure them.

HEADLINE: 3 Miles and World Away, Vigil for the Accuser

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., April 3 

 BODY:
One by one, the people who gathered Monday at North Carolina Central University for a candlelight vigil and rally knelt to write on one of the teal blue banners laid in front of them.
 Some wrote notes to the black woman and student at this university who accused three white Duke University lacrosse players of sexually assaulting her at an off-campus party in mid-March. ''From Duke, much love and tears on your behalf,'' one wrote. Another wrote in support: ''Does the hue of my skin give you free access? No.''
About 250 of them stood together for an hour or so, listening to speakers who condemned both violence against women and racism, and who addressed the strained community ties in this city. It was the first organized event at North Carolina Central in support of the woman, who had been hired as an exotic dancer for a party at a Duke-owned house on March 13 and who said she was raped late that night. 
 The investigation is continuing, and no one has been charged.
 ''We want the woman to know that we're not going to let this issue just slide by,'' Renee Clark, the president of the student government association, said before addressing the crowd. ''We're not going to let Duke keep sweeping this under the rug just because they want to save their lacrosse team's season.''
 North Carolina Central, a historically black college on the south side of Durham, does not have a lacrosse team, nor does it have the acreage and the landscaped lawns of Duke, which is about three miles away on the other side of town. Its undergraduate students are mostly black, and the cost of tuition and housing is about $9,500 a year. Duke's students are mostly white, and the total cost to attend is about $44,000 a year, according to the university's Web site. 
 At the rally, students from both universities and other speakers from the community explained that they supported the woman, regardless of her race or economic background. 
 Still, the issues of race and class could not be avoided, considering the glaring differences between the universities, both of them steeped in tradition, that share this city.
 ''Things get hushed up pretty quickly at Duke, because they have money and can lawyer up pretty quickly,'' Clark said. ''How many lawyers do the lacrosse players have? It's like the O. J. Simpson dream team. Here, we couldn't afford that, and if the situation was the opposite, our players would be in jail right now.'' 
 The lawyers for the accused Duke players met Monday to discuss the case, just as the lacrosse team was heading to practice. The players, who have not spoken to the news media since the woman's accusations became public, jogged from the locker room to the field with their facemasks on, speechless. Their season has been suspended indefinitely, pending the investigation. 
 For the first time in more than a week, not a single television camera was there to greet them. The reporters were headed to North Carolina Central, for the rally. 
 Some students at North Carolina Central were just hearing the news about their fellow student, who is a 27-year-old mother of two. Her age and family status are not unusual at this university, which has undergraduates of all ages. A flier sent out by the university last week detailed the facts of the case.
 But one student thought that was not enough.
 In front of the student union last Thursday, Tolulope Omokaiye, a senior marketing major, grabbed a microphone during a rally for student elections. A D.J. was blasting hip-hop music at the time.
 ''Stop dancing and cut the music already,'' Omokaiye, who does not know the woman, said as she began to cry. ''A student here has been raped, don't you know that? She's one of our own. Wake up. We need to support her.''
 Later, she said: ''I wanted everyone to realize that racism and classism are alive in Durham. We needed to start a dialogue.'' 
 James H. Ammons, the North Carolina Central chancellor, said he had been out of town in the past two weeks and did not have a chance to address the students. Still, he said, he felt it was important to tell them to let justice take its course and not to take the law into their hands.
 ''There is a temptation to rush to judgment, until the investigation has been completed or until they decide whether or not to bring charges,'' he said in a telephone interview Sunday. ''We must concentrate on our efforts to heal the tensions that are testing our community.''
 But some students say it is too late to douse emotions.
 ''There's a lot of potential violence once Central students really grab hold of this,'' said Jami Hyman, a freshman from Winston-Salem. ''I wouldn't be surprised if someone got shot or something.''

HEADLINE: Apartment Prices Up Again After a Slump in Manhattan

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Shaking off months of fretting over rising interest rates and bursting real estate bubbles, affluent buyers stepped up their purchases of large Manhattan apartments in the first three months of the year, pushing average sale prices above those of a year ago, according to several market reports released yesterday.
 After several quarters of declining average prices and withering sales, the average sale price was reported to be $1.3 million, a 7 percent increase from the same quarter in 2005, according to one report, by the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
Although the increases were far below the 25 percent to 30 percent annual increase reported the year before, brokers celebrated the new numbers as an indication of a second wind blowing in a housing market that had been buffeted by caution and anxiety.
 ''Compared to what my friends in California and Las Vegas tell me, New York seems to be holding its own,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 Pamela Liebman, president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said, ''It shows that the New York market, after having a lackluster fourth quarter, is back in full swing with strong numbers across the board.'' She said recent transactions logged by her firm suggested that the stronger sales trend would continue into next quarter's figures as well.
 Indeed, according to sales figures provided by Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales of apartments with two or more bedrooms rose 44 percent in the first quarter of this year, to 1,017 from 705 in the last quarter of 2005.
 Yet there were some signs of caution in the figures released yesterday. Although prices were up 7 percent to 8 percent from figures reported a year ago, depending on the report, they remained below the spikes in prices reported last spring. And the inventories of unsold apartments also rose significantly, with a rising supply of new condominiums coming to the market. Hundreds of additional new or newly converted condominium apartments are due to come on the market this year.
 Each brokerage firms tracks inventory differently, but in the first quarter they showed the same trends. Prudential Douglas Elliman put the current unsold inventory of apartments at 6,904, up 60 percent from the 4,327 it reported a year ago and 16 percent from the previous quarter. Corcoran listed 9,206, more than double the 4,492 it listed a year ago, and up 10 percent from the previous quarter.
 Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm that prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, said that when the changing mix of apartments sold is taken into account, using the average price per square foot, condo prices actually declined slightly from the previous quarter, by 4.2 percent, while co-op prices rose by 2.8 percent. 
 Mr. Miller said that looking at the numbers this way suggested that price appreciation was ''essentially flat.''
 ''Right now I see there being parity between buyers and sellers,'' he said. 
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, offered a more optimistic interpretation. ''People really became confident again, and people got bonuses at the end of the year,'' he said. ''The strength continues to be there.'' 
 During the second half of last year, sales of studio apartments and one-bedrooms remained strong, perhaps as buyers rushed to lock in mortgage rates, and were up this quarter as well. Although prices per square foot on smaller apartments have sharply trailed larger ones over most of the last decade, Mr. Heym's data showed that average prices on one-bedroom and studio apartments in Manhattan were both about $905 a square foot, close to the $1000 average for all apartments.

HEADLINE: Albany Leadership Puts Taxes Into Pet Projects and Private Clubs 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 3 

 BODY:
The taxpayers of New York State, it turns out, subsidize private hunting clubs. The state allocated $50,000 to repair the leaky roof of one such club near Albany, in the district of the powerful Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. And the state borrowed $200,000 to install air-conditioning and fix up another hunting club on Long Island that is championed by powerful lawmakers. 
 New York taxpayers have also been committed to spending nearly a million dollars in recent years to spruce up baseball fields in the districts of key lawmakers, including $250,000 to renovate a ball field in the district of Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island. The state even agreed to put $250,000 toward a ''flight-worthy B-17'' that Gov. George E. Pataki authorized for the American Airpower Museum on Long Island.
These allocations -- which state officials call ''member items'' or ''economic development funds'' and critics call pork -- do not appear anywhere in the state budget. Instead, they are listed as lump sums to be divided later in secret by the three men who control state government: Governor Pataki, a Republican; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and Senator Bruno, the Republican majority leader. 
 And, even in flush times, most of the money for these projects is borrowed, adding $1.7 billion since 1997 to the state's debt load, which the comptroller's office says has surpassed $48.2 billion, not counting the borrowing of the state's public authorities, some of which finance the capital projects.
 Most of the recipients of the money appear to be worthwhile causes of some sort: charities, nonprofit groups, or cultural organizations that serve a public purpose. But critics say that the general secrecy of the process, the fact that it is often driven by politics, and the fact that members of the majority party in each legislative house control who gets what raise questions about the fairness of the spending and whether more worthy causes are shortchanged.
 Just how the leaders divide the largess has long been one of Albany's best-kept secrets. The budget that was passed last week allocates $200 million to be spent from Community Projects Fund-007, but does not say what it will be spent on. It simply says it will be ''subject to a memorandum of understanding'' between the governor's budget director, the secretary of the Senate Finance Committee, and the secretary of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, which means the leaders get to choose.
 The budget also authorized using even more borrowed money for unspecified projects next year. 
 But two reports examining the spending, based on data that the state provided under the Freedom of Information Law, have shed new light on its magnitude and breadth. The Center for Governmental Research, a nonprofit policy organization based in Rochester, recently published an analysis of the $1.7 billion for pet projects that the state has borrowed and allocated since 1997, along with a list of the beneficiaries, at www.cgr.org.
 And on Monday, the Empire Center for New York State Policy, which is affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group, released a list of the other major source of what it calls the state's pork-barrel spending -- a look at the $479 million in funds that have been allocated over the last three years as member items in the budget. The group put the lists of those expenditures up on its Web site, www.empirecenter.org.
 Their lists show what the state allocated, but in some cases, they said, some of the money may not have been spent yet.
 ''It's bad government, because the grants are not based on any known criteria,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, the executive director of the Empire Center. ''There are no performance guidelines, there is no application process, and at the end, we don't even know if the money was spent on what it was supposed to be spent.'' 
 The Center for Governmental Research found geographic discrepancies in how the money is spent. It found that while two counties, Albany and Dutchess, received about $1,000 worth of capital money a resident, some 40 other counties received less than $100 a person. New York City's share was $29 a person.
 The center's report highlighted a number of unusual allocations, including $300,000 to build 10 new hangars for an airport in Akron, in western New York, that is run by a group called the Christian Airmen. The group's Web site says that one of its purposes is to ''evangelize in the aviation community.''
 Among the other allocations were at least $190,000 to renovate lodges of the Order of the Sons of Italy in Nassau County and Yonkers and thousands of dollars for Elks lodges around the state. The state also gave $3,000 to the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association. Religious organizations get state aid, too, with more than $1 million going to restore the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany and $50,000 allocated to help a Long Island synagogue develop a library. 
 New York's secrecy about the expenditures is unusual. Sometimes lawmakers seeking re-election -- or the governor -- send out press releases to brag about the money, or cite it at ribbon cuttings in their districts. But state officials have never volunteered the lists of projects as a whole. 
 Mr. McMahon noted that while members of Congress are debating whether their process for funneling money to pet projects, known as earmarking, is open enough, the federal government at least requires disclosure of each project in Congressional reports that accompany legislation. In Albany, by contrast, the member items are kept secret. The Empire Center's lists, released by the state, do not say exactly what the money is for or even which official requested it.
 It was not always so. Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker, said the budget used to list the items one by one. ''What we found was the governor vetoed the Democratic member items and didn't veto the Republican member items,'' he said. ''So the Little League uniforms of Republican members was appropriate and important and the Little League uniforms of Democratic members were not appropriate and not important.''
 John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Bruno, said that the $50,000 allocation for the upstate hunting club, the Brunswick Sportsman's Club, was to repair the roof. ''It met all the criteria of the program,'' Mr. McArdle said.
 The other hunting club that got state money, the Peconic River Sportsman's Club in Manorville on Long Island, notes on its Web site that while it is private, it takes pains to keep strong community ties through programs with the state. It also notes that the club played host to 107 people attending the Republican National Convention in 2004.
 ''We were advised that many of the politicians that participated thoroughly enjoyed seeing the symbol of the Republican Party hanging over our fireplace,'' the site said.

HEADLINE: California Bill Calls for Cuts In Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
California may become the first state to impose limits on the emissions of all greenhouse gases, under legislation introduced yesterday in the State Assembly.
 The bill requires that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming be reduced by 145 million tons, or 25 percent less than the current forecast, by 2020. That would bring the emissions back to the 1990 level. 
The gases in question are produced when fossil fuels are burned, whether in motor vehicles, power plants or other industrial facilities. Many scientists have linked the growing concentration of these gases in the atmosphere to an observed increase in surface temperatures.
 The bill, which was introduced by the Assembly speaker, Fabian Nunez, Democrat of Los Angeles, also requires the California Air Resources Board to set up a mandatory emissions reporting and tracking system to ensure compliance with the limits, which many of the state's business leaders have opposed.
 The legislation could have more than a statewide impact, because California has traditionally led the nation in pollution-control efforts. Standards and rules established by the air control board have often been emulated by other states.
 ''As California goes, so goes the rest of the world,'' said Fran Pavley, a Democratic Assembly member and a co-sponsor of the bill. ''As California leads and innovates, we believe that Congress and other states will also implement economywide clean energy standards.''
 The sponsors of the bill said its emissions limits were in line with goals established last summer by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, in an executive order.
 ''The speaker said this bill was his top legislative priority this year,'' said Craig Noble, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group that is supporting the bill. ''The governor has said he wants to reduce emissions. That means we have a very good chance of getting a first law in the nation to set statewide limits on emissions.''
 That could mean a greater reliance on solar and wind-generated energy. Mr. Schwarzenegger also has been promoting the use of hydrogen as an automotive fuel.

PERSON: Barry Bingham Jr., 

HEADLINE: Barry Bingham Jr., Louisville Publisher, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Douglas Martin contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Barry Bingham Jr., former editor and publisher of The Louisville Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, whose corrosive feud with two sisters led to the 1986 sale of the newspapers in a high drama that ended the family stewardship of an acclaimed journalistic enterprise, died yesterday in Louisville, Ky. He was 72. His daughter, Mary C. Bingham, said he died of respiratory failure after a long bout with Hodgkin's disease. 
 The sale of the two newspapers to the Gannett chain was reluctantly ordered by Barry Bingham Sr., the 80-year-old patriarch of the family, as a last resort to end a bitter struggle between Barry Jr. and his sisters, Sallie Bingham and Eleanor Bingham Miller, over control of the family properties. A television station as well as AM and FM radio stations in Louisville and a printing company were also sold, to other buyers.
 The sales brought $432 million but closed out three generations of Bingham family pilotage and an era of liberal journalism in Louisville. 
 In national news coverage and in a chorus of investigative books, the divestiture was portrayed as a tragedy mirroring the tortured Mississippi Delta families of William Faulkner's novels: a story of poor strivers rising to great wealth but tormented by pride, distrust, sibling intrigue and implacable disagreements -- a family devoted to the arts, the theater, education and social progress torn apart by fights over money and control that ultimately lay waste to the enterprise that had made it all possible.
 The Binghams, a proud clan of Southern patricians often compared with the Kennedys for their wealth and history of tragic deaths, had built their Kentucky media empire over nearly 70 years. The cornerstone was The Courier-Journal, a recipient of eight Pulitzer Prizes and a champion of civil rights and other liberal causes. The newspapers were the first to install an independent ombudsman to hear complaints by the public, and they offered employee benefits unheard-of elsewhere in the industry, including subsidized day care, paternity leave and flexible worktime options. 
 In 1971, Barry Bingham Jr., a 38-year-old Harvard-educated former marine, succeeded his father, Barry Sr., as editor and publisher of both the morning Courier-Journal and the afternoon Times and as the operating head of WHAS-TV, a CBS affiliate; the radio outlets; and Standard Gravure, the printing company. He and his sisters and parents were the principal stockholders of the companies, although Barry Sr. remained as chairman of them and, along with his wife, Mary, controlled 95 percent of the voting stock.
 Over the next 15 years, despite circulation losses and rising costs in a stagnant economy, Barry Jr. presided over essentially healthy companies and burnished The Courier-Journal's reputation for high journalistic and ethical standards. 
 But years of family tensions surfaced in 1984 after Barry Jr. insisted that his mother, his wife and two sisters leave the boards of the companies. He said he wanted more professional boards. His parents said he wanted mainly to remove the outspoken Sallie, a feminist who had become critical of his management. Sallie refused to resign and, in what she saw as a humiliation, was voted out. 
 She responded by demanding a buyout for her stock. Barry Jr. made an offer of $26.3 million, but she rejected it as laughably low and threatened to sell to outsiders, the ultimate slap at a family that prided itself on solidarity. She said her holdings were worth $80 million. Her brother said the company could not afford that. Negotiations went nowhere. 
 The relationship between Barry Jr. and Eleanor also deteriorated. She told him that she wanted to own and operate the broadcast enterprises or that she, too, might sell out. A plan to swap his stock in WHAS for her stock in the newspapers was floated. But Eleanor insisted that Sallie and Barry Jr. agree to a stock price before the swap could proceed. Gridlock set in.
 After a failed attempt at compromise, Barry Sr. announced that all the companies would be sold. Barry Jr. accused his father of betrayal. Sallie called it a positive step, and Eleanor said it was a relief. A few months later, the newspapers were sold to Gannett for $306.9 million. WHAS went to the Providence Journal Company for $85.7 million; the radio stations went to Clear Channel Communications for $20.1 million, and an Atlanta businessman picked up Standard Gravure for $20 million. 
 The story of the Binghams gave rise to several books, including ''The Patriarch: The Rise and Fall of the Bingham Dynasty,'' by Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones, and ''House of Dreams,'' by Marie Brenner. ''Passion and Prejudice: A Family Memoir,'' by Sallie Bingham, said that the family reputation for public service and liberality was a myth, and that its history was actually a lurid tale of incest, suicide, fortune-hunting men, cheated women, even a murder. The family denounced it as ''maliciously skewed.'' 
 George Barry Bingham Jr., who, like his father, never used his first name, was born into a fortune in Louisville on Sept. 23, 1933. The family empire was founded in 1916 when his grandfather, Robert Worth Bingham, a teacher's son, married Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, the daughter of Henry Flagler, who invented south Florida as a world-class resort. Eight months after the marriage, she died and left $5 million to her spouse. 
 With his legacy, Robert bought the two Louisville newspapers and Melcombe, a 40-acre estate with a Georgian mansion overlooking the Ohio River in Glenview, Ky. It remains the family home. His Courier-Journal championed women's suffrage, the League of Nations, labor unions and Franklin D. Roosevelt; his reward was appointment as ambassador to Britain. He died in 1937, and the newspapers passed to his son, Barry Sr.
 Barry Jr., one of five children of George Barry Bingham Sr. and the former Mary Clifford Caperton, grew up shy, chubby and with a reading disability that he worked hard to overcome. He attended the Brooks School in North Andover, Mass., and graduated from Harvard in 1956 with a bachelor's degree in history. After two years as an officer in the Marines, he worked as a broadcast researcher in the news divisions of CBS in New York and NBC in Washington.
 He returned to Louisville in 1963 and went to work for WHAS. A year later his younger brother, Jonathan, 22, was electrocuted in a freakish accident. In 1966, his older brother Worth, 34, who had been groomed to succeed their father at the newspapers, was killed in another freakish accident: a surfboard protruding from his car hit a parked vehicle, pivoted abruptly and snapped his neck.
 Barry Jr. moved into the executive suite. When his father retired in 1971, he took over as editor and publisher. Later that year, he learned he had Hodgkin's disease, a form of lymph cancer that had killed his grandfather. After months of chemotherapy, the cancer went into remission. 
 Mr. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, described Mr. Bingham yesterday as ''a serious man'' and ''more passionate about media than anyone I've ever known.'' Had he continued as publisher, Mr. Jones said, ''he would have operated The Courier-Journal as a moral as well as a journalistic and economic institution.'' 
 His tenure at the newspapers was marked by declining circulation but aggressive news coverage that won three Pulitzer Prizes. The Courier-Journal's reputation for placing principle before profit was preserved, though critics called the newspaper arrogant, patronizing, even communistic. In 1975, a mob smashed its windows to protest its support for court-ordered busing to integrate the public schools.
 Barry Jr. imposed rigid conflict-of-interest standards on employees and adhered to them himself, refusing to socialize with politicians and remaining aloof from Louisville's society. That contrasted with his forebears' tradition of elegant parties, Kentucky Derby breakfasts and a social circle of celebrities and national leaders in politics and the arts. Barry Jr. was active in some civic affairs, but his pleasures were solitary: hunting and woodcutting on the family estate.
 After the sale of the newspapers, Barry Jr. received $45.6 million, while Sallie and Eleanor got $55 million each. The largest share, $106 million, went to their parents, while $85 million went to a family trust. Barry Sr. died in 1988, and his wife died in 1995 at the age of 90.
 In the late 1980's, Barry Jr. published a monthly newsletter on journalistic ethics called Fineline, and he continued for many years to serve on the boards of Louisville arts and cultural institutions, but he was never again on the national stage.
 Besides his daughter Mary, of Washington, he is survived by his wife, the former Edith Stenhouse, whom he married in 1963; another daughter, Emily S. Bingham, of Louisville; two sons from his wife's first marriage, Philip John Franchini, of Topanga Canyon, Calif., and Charles Wharton Bingham, of Louisville; four grandchildren; and his sisters, Sallie, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Eleanor, of Louisville.


CORRECTION-DATE: April 5, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Barry Bingham Jr., former editor and publisher of The Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, referred incorrectly to his battle with Hodgkin's disease. It had been in remission since the early 1970's, the family said; he had not been suffering from it in recent years. The obituary also misstated the background of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, who married Robert Worth Bingham, founder of the family businesses. She was the widow of Henry Flagler, the early developer of South Florida, not his daughter.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Fall 2.9%, Dragged Down by G.M.

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3 

 BODY:
A sharp drop at General Motors helped push down auto sales nationwide in March, despite pitches from American carmakers for consumers to take advantage of the latest deals.
 G.M.'s ''March Madness'' promotion did little to end the skid in sales, while incentives at the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler also seemed to do little to lift overall results.
Total sales at G.M. fell 14.4 percent in March in part because a successful promotion led to abnormally high sales in March a year ago. G.M. is also taking a hit as it weans itself off sales to rental car companies. Ford's sales fell 4.5 percent; Chrysler posted a 1.6 percent increase.
 Over all, vehicle sales in the United States dropped 2.9 percent in March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.5 million, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. 
 While Detroit's three auto companies had a lackluster month, Toyota again turned in a strong performance. Toyota's sales rose 6.9 percent, more than any other automaker. For Detroit, that meant another month of losing market share. In fact, Toyota nudged the Chrysler Group out of its long-held position as the nation's No. 3 vehicle seller. It outsold Chrysler by 874 vehicles in March.
 G.M.'s share dropped the most, to 23.5 percent, according to Autodata, from 26.7 percent in March 2005. Toyota had 14.2 percent of the market in March, compared with 12.9 percent a year ago. 
 In a sign of the times facing Detroit, Ford has said its goal this year is not to gain market share but to stop the bleeding. On Monday, the company said it was making some progress toward that end.
 ''We're not there yet, but we are reducing the rate of decline,'' said George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst. He added a caveat: ''It's a good start. We'll just have to see how this unfolds for the rest of the year.'' 
 Ford, which along with G.M. has lost about a point of market share each year for the last five years, had 18.9 percent of the American vehicle market in March, compared with 19.3 percent last year.
 The competitive environment has produced a quarrel among G.M., Ford and Chrysler over the use of promotions. Incentive spending is a particularly sore subject at General Motors, which led last year's pricing wars but is now trying to spend less on such promotions. Its executives are making no secret about their distaste for Chrysler's increased use of incentives, including a no-interest financing deal that just expired. 
 ''Everybody is entitled to play this game,'' said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief sales analyst. ''We accept it for what it is, but it does complicate some of the things we're doing.''
 According to Autodata, incentive spending at G.M. fell 25 percent, to $3,114 a vehicle, a drop of $1,067, from last March. At Chrysler, meanwhile, incentive spending per vehicle rose $523, to $4,241 a vehicle, the highest average in the industry. 
 Ford continued to see success with its new midsize cars, but analysts questioned whether the Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr were selling fast enough. Much like General Motors with its line of redesigned sport utility vehicles, Ford is staking much of its turnaround on the success of its new cars. Sales of all three models have risen about 15 percent since January, and Mr. Pipas said the company was pleased with that growth. ''Our focus in introducing new products today is not to go after sales titles,'' he said.
 Ford's S.U.V. sales continued to decline in March. Most notably, sales of the newly redesigned Explorer were down 31 percent. 
 While slow S.U.V. sales at Ford dragged overall sales down, S.U.V.'s helped lift sales for the month at Chrysler. The Jeep brand showed an 8 percent increase, more than any other Chrysler nameplate. 
 S.U.V. sales were also up at Toyota, which received a sizable lift from the RAV4, the automaker's smallest utility vehicle. Sales of the RAV4, which has been redesigned, were up 116 percent over last March.
 On the other end of the spectrum, the Chevrolet Tahoe was the standout among a field of poorly selling large S.U.V.'s. Sales of the Tahoe, also newly redesigned, were up 20 percent.
 David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities, said that was an encouraging sign for G.M., which has had steady increases in Tahoe sales since January despite a soft market for large S.U.V.'s.
 ''They're playing the hand they were dealt, and I think they're playing it pretty well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Social Security And Medicare In an Impasse Over Trustees

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3 

 BODY:
President Bush and the Senate are at an impasse over the appointment of trustees for Social Security and Medicare, crippling the panel that supervises the two programs. 
 This, in turn, has delayed the annual reports on the financial condition of the programs, which together account for more than one-third of all federal spending. Under federal law, the reports are supposed to be sent to Congress by April 1.
Since 2000, Social Security and Medicare have had two public trustees: John L. Palmer, former dean of the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, and Thomas R. Saving, an economist at Texas A&M. 
 Their terms have expired, and Mr. Bush has renominated them, but the Senate has taken no action. Senate leaders of both parties say they want to follow the precedent of having the public trustees serve no more than one term. But the White House said Monday that the Senate should approve the president's nominees.
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a champion of Social Security in his 24 years in the Senate, advocated the appointment of public trustees as a way to increase public confidence in the program. The trustees are supposed to make sure that assets of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are properly managed. They also try to ensure that the administration's annual reports to Congress are as reliable as possible.
 In the absence of public trustees, the administration has delayed sending the 2006 reports to Congress.
 In a joint statement issued with last year's reports, Mr. Palmer, a Democrat, and Mr. Saving, a Republican, broke with the Bush administration and said that Medicare's financial problems were more severe than those facing Social Security. At the time, Mr. Bush was expressing more alarm about Social Security and was trying to build support for private investment accounts.
 Mr. Palmer and Mr. Saving were appointed by President Bill Clinton in October 2000 to four-year terms. Under the Social Security Act, they were allowed to complete work on a fifth report -- the one issued on March 23, 2005. 
 Mr. Bush nominated each man for an additional four-year term last November. The Senate has not held a confirmation hearing.
 Since the first public trustees were confirmed in 1984, none have served more than one term. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, have indicated that they want to follow that tradition, since a major purpose of having public trustees is to obtain new perspectives.
 Marilyn Moon, a health economist who served as a public trustee from 1995 to 2000, said: ''It's good to have turnover. The whole idea of a public trustee is to have someone who comes in with fresh eyes and can ask, 'Are there things that could be done better?' ''
 Kenneth A. Lisaius, a White House spokesman, reaffirmed the president's support for Mr. Palmer and Mr. Saving on Monday. ''We urge the Senate to act quickly on these nominees,'' Mr. Lisaius said. ''These individuals are well qualified, and there is important work to be done.''
 The impasse results, in part, from a partisan squabble. 
 Under federal law, the two public trustees ''may not be from the same political party.'' The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, has recommended a Democratic candidate to the White House, but has not publicly identified the person. Republicans said they understood that the White House found the candidate too partisan. 
 Democrats said the White House was partly responsible for the impasse because the president had delayed sending nominees to the Senate and had not consulted Congress.
 The trustees of Social Security and Medicare -- four administration officials and the two public trustees -- typically meet and approve the annual reports just hours before they are issued. But before scheduling such a meeting, Mr. Saving said, the administration ''needs to know whether we will be confirmed or not.''
 Mr. Palmer said, ''It would be a shame to issue the reports without public trustees.''
 In 1990, the reports were issued even though the public trustees' positions were vacant.
 The reports estimate spending and revenue for Social Security and Medicare over 75 years. Most of the estimates are prepared by civil servants, including actuaries and economists, who see the presence of public trustees as a way to guarantee that the figures are not slanted to suit any political point of view.

HEADLINE: The Economics Of Henry Ford May Be Passe

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HENRY FORD was 50 years old, and not all that different from a lot of other successful businessmen, when he summoned the Detroit press corps to his company's offices on Jan. 5, 1914. What he did that day made him a household name.
 Mr. Ford announced that he was doubling the pay of thousands of his employees, to at least $5 a day. With his company selling Model T's as fast as it could make them, his workers deserved to share in the profits, he said. 
 His rivals were horrified. The Wall Street Journal accused him of injecting ''Biblical or spiritual principles into a field where they do not belong.'' The New York Times correspondent who traveled to Detroit to interview him that week asked him if he was a socialist.
 But the public loved it. The country was then suffering a deep recession, and the Ford news seemed to offer hope. Within 24 hours, 10,000 men were lined up outside the Ford employment office in Michigan. The following year, Mr. Ford was mentioned as a future presidential contender.
 The mythology around this story holds that Mr. Ford wanted to pay his workers enough so they could afford the products they were making. 
 In fact, that wasn't his original reasoning. But others made the point, and, in time, it became part of Mr. Ford's rationale as well. The idea became a linchpin in an industrial philosophy known as Fordism.
 More production could lead to better wages, which in turn would lead to more spending by the public, yet more production and eventually even higher wages. 
 ''One's own employees ought to be one's own best customers,'' Mr. Ford said years later. ''Paying high wages,'' he concluded, ''is behind the prosperity of this country.''
 This turned into a pillar of 20th-century economic wisdom. It's time to ask, though, whether Mr. Ford's big idea is as ill suited to this century as his car company seems to be.
 By any reasonable standard, the last few years have been bad ones for most people's paychecks. The average hourly wage of rank-and-file workers -- a group that makes up 80 percent of the work force -- is slightly lower than it was four years ago, once inflation is taken into account. That's right: Most Americans have taken a pay cut since 2002. 
 But you would never know it by looking at the headline numbers on economic growth. From the standpoint of the broad national economy -- the value of the goods and services the country produces -- the last few years have been stellar. Despite two wars, soaring oil prices and business scandals, the economy has been growing more than 3 percent a year.
 Henry Ford would have no idea what to make of this.
 What was so comforting about Fordism was that it suggested that the economy operated on a virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle. Only when the middle class did well could the country do well. And as the country grew ever richer, so would the middle class.
 In the last few years, however, the economy has kept growing in large part because high-income families -- the top 20 percent, roughly -- have done so well and have been such devoted spenders. Globalization and new technology have helped many white-collar workers make more money, even as those same changes have closed factories and depressed wages for others. Stock portfolios and houses on the coasts, meanwhile, are much more valuable than they once were, making their owners more willing to spend.
 In fact, well-off families, not cash-short ones, have been the ones increasing their borrowing and cutting their savings the most in recent years, according to the Federal Reserve. In 1992, the top fifth of households, as ranked by income, accounted for 42 percent of consumer spending. By 2000, the share had grown to almost 46 percent, and it is probably not much different today. That may sound like a small change, but it's an enormous amount of money, a shift of $300 billion a year in spending from the poor and middle class to the affluent.
 In Michigan, Ford and General Motors have been cutting thousands of jobs, creating the country's sickest local economy and hurting even well-to-do suburbs. Yet the Suburban Collection, a car dealership north of Detroit, sold 90 Bentleys last year, up from 70 in 2004. David Butler, a manager there, said he expected to sell more than 100 Bentleys this year. The car costs at least $180,000. The dealership also opened a Lamborghini showroom in January. It is true that Rolls-Royces aren't selling very well, but the main reason seems to be that Mr. Butler's customers don't feel comfortable being seen in a $300,000 car when the state is suffering so badly. ''It's not that they can't afford it,'' he said. ''It's because of the image it would give.''
 Wages are likely to rise slightly in 2006, but stagnation seems to be the norm over the long term. Except for a span of a few years in the late 1990's, the hourly pay of most workers has done no better than inflation for the last 30 years. Even some Democrats, who have long embraced Fordism, are coming to the conclusion that Mr. Ford's reassuring cycle is not the only thing that can keep the American economy humming. ''You don't need an equitable distribution to have a sustainable recovery,'' said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist in Washington. 
 Politically, though, I am not so sure that the current trends are sustainable. Before the 1990's boom lifted wages, stagnating pay had helped cause a series of upheavals: Bill Clinton's election, the Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan phenomena, the Republican takeover of Congress. Today, with the boom fading from memory, protectionism is on the rise, and President Bush's approval ratings are miserable. 
 So it seems as if now would be a good time to start talking about what to do. There has never been a shortage of ideas: helping more teenagers to finish college, training middle-age workers to switch careers, embarking on public projects like better highways and high-speed trains. Or we could pretend it's still 1914.

HEADLINE: Some People Return, but Only One in 10 Businesses Has Reopened

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Anyone looking for a potent symbol of the battered state of the economy here seven months after Hurricane Katrina might stop by the offices of Don Hutchinson, the city's economic development director. People seeking assistance from Mr. Hutchinson's agency are greeted by a pair of revolving doors that have been sheathed in plywood and shut since shortly after the storm struck at the end of August. Visitors must enter through a side door.
 There are any number of signs signaling a steady but unsure recovery in New Orleans, from a vibrant nightlife in pockets of town to census estimates that suggest that the city is repopulating at a much faster pace than predicted a few months ago.
Yet those signs of optimism only bring into sharp relief the alarmingly sluggish pace at which the city's economy is recovering. By Mr. Hutchinson's count, fewer than one in 10 businesses has reopened its doors since a surge of water buried four-fifths of the city. By comparison, New Orleans officials estimate that 40 percent of the residents have returned home. 
 Before Katrina struck, New Orleans was home to 22,000 businesses, the vast majority of them small establishments with 99 or fewer employees. Today, barely 2,000 of those have reopened. 
 ''The recovery in New Orleans is going more slowly than we had hoped,'' said David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's, which grades the financial health of municipalities. ''We look at the numbers from Mississippi and Alabama and see what we expect to see: a lot of people hurting, but lots of rebuilding activity to the point where I would describe the economies there as strong.'' By contrast, Mr. Wyss said, ''there's far less activity in New Orleans than you would expect six or so months after a hurricane.'' 
 Most of the businesses that have resumed operations fall into one of two categories: restaurants (29 percent of the food establishments operating in the city before Katrina have reopened, according to the city) and large companies with the economic means to fix up their facilities and cover the extra costs of doing business in an area that is functioning but disabled. 
 ''Small businesses don't have the large cash reserves like the big guys do,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. 
 A lack of working capital, though, is only one potential hurdle confronting a small business here. Another is a lack of customers. 
 Ruston Henry, for instance, the younger half of a father-son team that ran the H & W drugstore in the Lower Ninth Ward, figures that they need to borrow more than half a million dollars before they are able to reopen. 
 But money, Mr. Henry said, is not their main concern. The Lower Ninth Ward, still without drinkable water or gas, is an unpopulated swath of town that has lain in ruins since the levees were overwhelmed, drowning the area.
 ''We were a neighborhood pharmacy,'' Mr. Henry, 44, said. ''And what's a neighborhood pharmacy without a neighborhood?'' They have applied for a Small Business Administration loan to gut, refurbish and restock a store that Mr. Henry described as having been destroyed by the flooding. (Flood insurance, he said, would cover only a small part of their losses.) 
 But they are in no rush, Mr. Henry said, to reopen this storefront, which his father and a partner established in 1963. 
 Thousands of business owners are apparently confronting the same sorts of issues. There is no reason to reopen a shuttered auto repair shop in the Ninth Ward or New Orleans East, an area north and east of downtown where a majority of the city's black professionals lived before Katrina, when most of the cars one sees in these devastated communities are abandoned vehicles destroyed by the storm. 
 A tour of the ravaged eastern half of the city shows mile after mile of abandoned businesses and vacant malls. It does not seem to make a difference whether a business is part of a chain, like a McDonald's or a Rite Aid, or a big-box retailer like Toys ''R'' Us, or simply a mom-and-pop dry cleaner or boutique store. All sit unoccupied -- forlorn, damaged reminders of how far New Orleans must go to recover from what many describe as the worst natural disaster in modern American history. 
 In the meantime, Mr. Henry and his wife, Kim, a self-employed environmental engineer, are living with their two teenage children in Jackson, Miss., where Mr. Henry found work as a pharmacist with Wal-Mart. The couple, who lived in the Lower Ninth before the storm, also lost their home.
 Virgil Robinson Jr., the chief executive of Dryades Savings, a black-owned bank based in New Orleans, said, ''You would think we would be making lots of commercial loans to business damaged by the storm, but so far we're not.'' Businesses, like homeowners, Mr. Robinson said, are putting off making big decisions until federal authorities publish new flood maps, which will provide critical guidance for rebuilding. 
 They are also seeking ''a clearer sense of which communities will be coming back when,'' Mr. Robinson said, before seeking money to rebuild. 
 ''There's so much uncertainty that basically most of our customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' he said. 
 A lack of housing is proving another roadblock for even the most well-intentioned businesses, as is the lack of essential services. Dryades's crosstown rival, Liberty Bank and Trust, one of the country's largest black-owned banks, was situated in a six-story glass tower in New Orleans East before Katrina struck. It invested the money required for its head office to be ready again for occupancy by January, yet two more months would pass before BellSouth could re-establish phone service and Internet access in a part of town covered by six feet or more of water. 
 ''We basically need to rebuild the entire telecommunications infrastructure in the eastern half of the city,'' said Merlin Villar, BellSouth's director in the area. Pockets, though only pockets, of New Orleans East have phone service, Mr. Villar said, and BellSouth is in the process of replacing switching stations and trunk lines destroyed by flooding. 
 Liberty reopened its headquarters in late March, though the building that was once occupied by some 75 employees now has perhaps 15 workers.
 ''Housing is still a big issue,'' said Alden J. McDonald Jr., the bank's chief executive. ''We can only move back employees who have been able to find a place to live back in New Orleans.'' The majority of Liberty's employees, including Mr. McDonald, are working out of a temporary beachhead that the bank established in Baton Rouge shortly after the storm, 80 miles to the north and west.
 ''My feeling is we're only at the beginning of the Katrina curve,'' said Ken Murray, an entrepreneur who has founded two companies in New Orleans. ''I think another year or two will pass before we fully understand how big a chunk of activity was taken out of the city's economy.''
 That is a phenomenon, however, that Mr. Murray will be observing from afar. Shortly after the storm, he moved his two businesses -- one a 50-person sales and marketing firm called Parker, Murray & Associates, founded in 1990, and the other a software start-up, VanillaSoft, that employed 16 people before the storm -- to Dallas. That affects other businesses because he relied heavily on local merchants for supplies and services, but he said he felt that he had no choice but to leave town. 
 Mr. Murray cited both a lack of housing and the uncertainty of the business climate for years to come as two of the primary factors prompting him to move his operations to Texas. 
 ''I'm talking to a lot of other business owners who want to be part of the recovery, but share my concerns,'' he said. 
 Those who express optimism about the future of the New Orleans economy note that most of the city's hotels are again open for business, as are the majority of companies in the central business district. Economic development ideas that languished before the storm -- like a vague plan to establish New Orleans as a worldwide center for biotechnology innovation -- have been revived as city leaders hope to leverage the sympathy expressed by people around the country into actual businesses.
 At first glance, the employees of Energy Partners would seem to provide some hope. The company, a publicly traded oil exploration business, chose to move back into its downtown headquarters in December, despite the many headaches that persisted, including unreliable mail service and an incomplete health care system. 
 Yet while Energy Partners and its chief executive, Richard A. Bachmann, exhibited the kind of can-do spirit that the city needs these days, the company also embodies the precarious nature of the local economy. Whether Energy Partners and its 100 or so employees will stay in New Orleans remains to be seen. The company's commitment to New Orleans, Mr. Bachmann said, is no stronger than the city's will to reform itself. If he does not think that city, state and federal officials have made progress on a number of fronts over the next year -- from shoring up the levee system, much of which is federal responsibility, to an overhaul of a public school system that ranked as one of the worst in the nation -- then he may leave town.
 ''There are a number of companies like us that are working for change that will leave if it continues to be the same old business as usual,'' Mr. Bachmann said. 
 Yet for some, business as usual would be a dream come true. Mr. Robinson of Dryades Savings described ''the general unreliability of everything right now.'' The electrical equipment at his downtown branch, two blocks from the corner of Canal and Bourbon Streets, was destroyed when the basement of his building took nine feet of water. He ordered new equipment and lined up electricians, but delivery of the equipment took much longer than expected. And he learned the hard way about the demands on tradesmen working in New Orleans now. He had initially hoped to reopen the branch in December, but it did not open until March.
 ''The concept of a completion date is a very fluid concept right now,'' Mr. Robinson said.

HEADLINE: 6,000 Pilots At Delta Air Vote to Strike

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY and CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The nearly 6,000 pilots at Delta Air Lines, proving resistant to a second round of concessions, voted overwhelmingly to approve a strike should their contract be voided by an arbitration panel, the pilots' union said yesterday. The panel is expected to issue a ruling by April 15.
 The decision by the pilots gives negotiators on both sides more than a week to narrow their differences and avoid a work stoppage that many believe would lead to a liquidation of Delta. Among the issues is the company's request for $305 million in annual pay cuts; the pilots have offered $140 million. 
''The Delta pilots will strike if their contract is rejected,'' said Lee Moak, a pilot and chairman of the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.
 Delta filed for bankruptcy protection in September, and after the filing both sides agreed to arbitration rather than have a bankruptcy judge rule on management's motion to void the pilots' contract and impose lower wages and other conditions.
 Like the judge overseeing bankruptcy, the arbitration panel was supposed to issue a ruling on whether the contract should be thrown out. But the pilots have vowed not to work without a contract if the ruling goes against them. The panel has encouraged both sides to settle the matter rather than wait for the panel to either void or let stand the pilots' contract. 
 The chief executive of Delta, Gerald Grinstein, said last week that the airline, entirely dependent on lenders who could withdraw financing in the event of a strike, could not survive a shutdown lasting even 24 hours.
 Fallout from a strike would be an economic blow to Atlanta, where Delta is based, and the Southeast as well as the 50,000 workers whose jobs at the airline would be in jeopardy.
 ''I don't think there's going to be a strike,'' said Roger King, an airline analyst at CreditSights, an independent credit research firm. He said the strike vote was another negotiating tool for the union.
 Both the union and management said they would prefer a settlement. The pilots, the only major work group at Delta represented by a union, made $1 billion in annual concessions in 2004. And the union says that improvement in the airline industry -- planes are flying fuller even as airlines raise prices -- means that Delta does not need another $305 million in concessions.
 But Delta management contends that the industry's recovery is fragile and that it faces an intense long-term threat in its East Coast market from low-cost carriers, like Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways.
 Some passengers are already avoiding Delta. ''I just don't want to take any chances,'' said Charlotte D. Sutton, a management professor at Auburn University in Alabama, who decided after hearing about the strike vote yesterday to use another airline for a July trip she and her daughter are taking to Lima, Peru.
 ''When something like this happens you can never be sure how it's going to turn out,'' Ms. Sutton said. Using another carrier will probably force her to make a less convenient connection than Atlanta, which is Delta's hub, she noted.
 Chris Evans, who works for an engineering firm in Elizabeth City, N.C., is planning vacations to Norfolk, Va., and to Las Vegas, and said Delta offered reasonable fares and connections to both places. ''I would like to buy the ticket on Delta,'' he said. For now, he said, he is waiting.
 Mr. Evans called Delta several weeks ago and asked about a potential strike. He said a reservations agent told him that she was also concerned about a strike. ''She did agree that that if the pilots strike, the airline would be closed,'' he said. The agent assured him that if it came to that, another airline would honor his ticket, with a $50 change fee.
 Josh Bernoff, a technology analyst in Boston, is taking a family vacation April 17 to Hawaii. He is partly sticking with Delta, switching from a direct Delta flight from Boston to Honolulu via Salt Lake City, to a Delta flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Then, he is continuing to Hawaii on another airline to avoid the chance of being stranded in Hawaii.
 ''I didn't want our vacation to be ruined,'' said Mr. Bernoff, a Delta frequent flier. ''One Delta agent I spoke with basically said, 'Don't worry about it.' That's easy for them to say.''
 Of the pilots and management, he said, ''It's clear that they're engaging in brinksmanship. In the meantime, there are thousands of travelers like me that don't really know what is going to happen with our reservations.''

HEADLINE: Port Owner Says City Is Wavering on Waterfront Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It can be eerily quiet or a raging symphony of foghorns, ship alarms, diesel engines, clanging steel and shouted commands from tugboat captains at any time of day or night at the Erie Basin Bargeport in Red Hook. The operation, home to 200 barges and tugs, is one of the last remnants of Brooklyn's working waterfront.
 Nearby, a developer has tentative plans to convert the long-abandoned Revere sugar works into waterfront housing, loftlike offices, stores and a marina, a proposal that has divided the community. 
The owners of the barge port, Robert J. Hughes Jr. and his cousins, fear that the project will be the beginning of the end for their operation and 680 blue-collar jobs.
 ''People spend all that money on apartments, but after a few nights of foghorns, it's not so quaint anymore,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''They might want us to limit our operations to 12 hours a day. My concern is that over time, we'll find it untenable to be here.''
 But some residents and business owners welcome the developer's plans to put apartments and stores in place of a vacant eyesore that has plagued Red Hook for decades.
 The debate over the Revere property has become a test case for the city's plans to establish industrial business zones to offer manufacturers and light industries incentives and a refuge from escalating real estate prices and development. A city commission will vote tomorrow on whether to establish the boundaries for 16 such zones, Red Hook being the most contentious. 
 City officials had initially placed the Revere site inside a proposed industrial zone that stretches across parts of Red Hook, Gowanus and Sunset Park, in Brooklyn. That would have prevented the developer from building housing. But now they are recommending that the site be removed from the zone.
 ''The city has to decide whether they'll live up to the policy they're putting out there,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''They haven't even approved it yet, but they're wavering already.''
 The developer, Joseph J. Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities, played down the conflict, saying his project can easily coexist with the barge port. ''It's not that noisy. I don't see anyone complaining about boats going back and forth,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, everyone wants to see something good come from this site, which has been closed for decades.''
 New York City has lost hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs since the 1950's, many of them in Red Hook, a small peninsula where thousands of dockworkers once lived and worked. Unemployment is still relatively high there, but restaurants, artists and residential developers are moving in. Ikea is building a store on the east side of the Revere site and a Fairway supermarket is opening to the west.
 At the same time, there has been a resurgence of light manufacturing, which the industrial zones are intended to protect and nurture. Michael DiMarino, owner of Linda Tool and Die Corporation, a precision metal fabricator with clients like NASA and Boeing, is breathing a sigh of relief that he is within the industrial zone.
 In recent years, the Bloomberg administration has aggressively rezoned large swaths of crumbling, once industrial neighborhoods like Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Long Island City for high-rise housing. Then critics began to worry that speculation and rising real estate prices would undermine many of the remaining blue-collar industries.
 Now the city is pledging not to make zoning changes within the industrial zones. The city also plans to provide incentives to manufacturers and light industries that move into them.
 ''Just having the industrial zones is a step forward,'' said Adam Friedman, executive director of the New York Industrial Retention Network and a member of the city commission that will vote tomorrow. ''We would've liked to see more areas included. Demand is very strong for industrial space.''
 Carl Hum, director of the city's Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses, said that his staff had recommended including the Revere property, an eight-acre collection of crumbling buildings and piers, in an ''ombudsman'' zone that would allow the city to consider alternatives like housing and shopping malls. 
 ''We want to make sure that folks think creatively about this site,'' Mr. Hum said.
 Mr. Sitt bought the property last year for $40 million. He said he wanted to work with the community to create a mix of housing, offices and stores that it could embrace. Even in an ''ombudsman'' zone, he said, the project would still have to go through a rigorous public review.
 John McGettrick, co-president of the Red Hook Civic Association, supports Mr. Sitts's effort to move the Revere property out of the industrial zone. ''Red Hook has been a mixed-use neighborhood for 100 years,'' he said. ''You have people living a block away from the site.''
 Dorothy Shields, president of the tenants association at Red Hook Houses East, also supports Mr. Sitt. ''We need jobs,'' she said.
 At the other end of an arm of land that sweeps into the harbor and protects the deep waters in Erie Basin sits the barge port. Mr. Hughes, who first moved to Erie Basin in the 1970's, and his tenants use the barges for bridge repairs and to move millions of tons of sand and gravel for construction projects, as well as heating oil and gasoline.
 The South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation and Community Board 6 have sided with Mr. Hughes, as does Ray Hall, a founder of Red Hook Rising, a community group. ''We don't support housing on the property,'' Mr. Hall said. ''We want to keep it a working waterfront. We need retail and manufacturing jobs.''
 Other industrial waterfront areas -- in Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Manhattan -- have given way to residential uses, said Tom Fox, the president of New York Water Taxi, one of 22 maritime businesses in Red Hook. ''There are plenty of places to build luxury housing,'' he said, ''but there's only one working waterfront.''

HEADLINE: Syria Imposing Stronger Curbs On Opposition 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, April 4 

 BODY:
Just months ago, under intense international pressure to ease its stranglehold on neighboring Lebanon, the Syrian government was talking about ending the ruling Baath Party's grip on Syrian power and paving the way for a multiparty system.
 But things have moved in the opposite direction. Syrian officials are aggressively silencing domestic political opposition while accommodating religious conservatives to shore up support across the country.
 Security forces have detained human rights workers and political leaders, and in some cases their family members as well. They have barred travel abroad for political conferences and shut down a human rights center financed by the European Union. And the government has delivered a stern message to the national news media demanding that they promote -- not challenge -- the official agenda.
 The leadership's actions were described in interviews with top officials as well as dissidents and human rights activists. They reflect at least in part a growing sense of confidence because of shifts in the Middle East in recent months, especially the Hamas victory in Palestinian elections, political paralysis in Lebanon and the intense difficulties facing the United States in trying to stabilize Iraq and stymie Iran's drive toward nuclear power. 
 The detentions, the press crackdown, the restrictions on travel and the overall effort to crush dissent are also a response to a fragile domestic political climate and concern over a growing opposition movement abroad.
 ''I may not be keen on early morning arrests, but this regime was being threatened,'' Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Dardari, a Londoneducated technocrat charged with steering Syria's economic overhaul, said in an interview. ''The survival of this regime and the stability of this country was threatened out loud and openly. There were invitations for foreign armies to come and invade Syria. So you could expect sometimes an overreaction, or a reaction, to something that is really happening.''
 On Tuesday, Amnesty International condemned the Syrian crackdown and called on Damascus to release ''all of those arrested due to their beliefs.'' Human Rights Watch said it was sending a letter to the government protesting the arrests. 
 The government has also sought to fortify its position with a nod to a reality sweeping not just Syria, but the region: a surge in religious identification and a growing desire to empower religious political movements like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The latter group recently won 88 seats in the Egyptian Parliament in spite of government efforts to block its supporters from voting. 
 The Syrian government has gone further to accommodate religious conservatives than in the past, officials and religious scholars said. 
 It has appointed a sheik, as opposed to a secular Baathist, to head the Religious Affairs Ministry; allowed, for the first time, religious activities in the stadium at Damascus University; and permitted a speech emphasizing religious practices and identity to be given to a military audience. President Bashar al-Assad has increasingly inserted references to religious identity and culture into his speeches.
 Most striking was the government's recent decision to reverse itself one month after trying to limit activities taking place in mosques. The Religious Affairs Ministry effectively ordered mosques closed for all activities but prayers, but a few weeks later the decision was deemed a greater threat to a government controlled by the Alawites, a minority religious sect, than the potential for political organizing among the majority Sunni Muslims.
 ''Before, religion for the regime was like a ball of fire, '' said Abdul Qader al-Kittani, a professor of Islamic studies at Fattah Islamic University here. ''Now they deal with it like it could be a ball of light.'' 
 He added: ''Two factors pushed the regime toward this direction. The first is the beat of the street. The second is external pressures on the regime.'' 
 Damascus has a very different feel from that of a few months ago, when investigators for the United Nations Security Council issued a report suggesting that the Syrian state -- not just individuals -- was behind the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in February 2005 and that the authorities here had defied the United Nations Security Council by refusing to cooperate with its investigation. 
 The new investigator heading the inquiry, Serge Brammertz of Belgium, has kept a far lower profile and taken a less confrontational approach than his predecessor, Detlev Mehlis of Germany. Syrian officials have responded by agreeing to allow President Assad to be interviewed.
 With the pressure off, the arrests have been stacking up since January, according to local human rights groups and individuals who say they were picked up by the authorities. 
 In Damascus, Ammar Qurabi, the former spokesman for the Arab Organization for Human Rights-Syria, was held for four days after returning from political conferences in Washington and Paris. In Aleppo, Samir Nashar, a businessman and opposition leader, was detained for three days after returning from attending political conferences abroad. 
 The goal was to deliver a message, some of those arrested said: the government will not tolerate any contact between internal opposition figures and a growing opposition movement abroad that is being encouraged by former Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, who recently forged an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which is outlawed here.
 ''This time they wanted to relay a message or a warning: the Muslim Brotherhood, Khaddam and street protests are prohibited,'' said Hussein al-Odat, an opposition leader in Damascus who said he was detained last week by security forces for two hours. ''They said, 'It is clear, and we will not be merciful.' ''
 Ibrahim Hamidi, the Damascus bureau chief for the pan-Arab newspaper Al Hayat, and the first to report on the new prohibitions, said the government was operating this way because of the changing regional situation. ''Now they believe they can get away with it,'' he said.
 Ayman Abdel Nour, a Baath Party member who promoted the idea of reforming the party from inside, said he had grown so disillusioned that he planned to move his business -- a Web site that gives voice to calls for reform -- from Damascus to the United Arab Emirates. 
 He said he had been told that the party planned to purge all those with reform agendas from its ranks. ''They say they have a fixed time period to crack down and finish off the opposition,'' Mr. Abdel Nour said.
 Human Rights Watch and several Syrian-based human rights organizations say that at least 30 people involved in politics or human rights work have been detained since January, and that several have not been heard from since. Human rights leaders in Damascus say the numbers are likely to be higher because most families are too afraid to report the arrests to their organizations.
 Sami al-Abbas, a novelist, and Farouk Hamad, a poet, were arrested Monday for meeting with opposition leaders, said Razan Zaytouneh of the Syrian Human Rights Information Link, a local organization. 
 Muhammad al-Habash, a member of Parliament and general manager of the Islamic Studies Center in Damascus, says that in spite of the restrictions, Syria is far more relaxed than it was five years ago when, he said, he would not have been allowed to meet with a foreign reporter. 
 He also praised the government's recent accommodations to religion, saying, ''They realize we need Islamic power, especially at thistime,'' and he endorsed the ban on allowing travel to attend political conferences abroad.
 ''It is not a suitable time to allow people to travel abroad to participate in opposition conferences,'' he said. ''We have to be real.''

HEADLINE: The Papuans Say, This Land and Its Ores Are Ours

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 2 

 BODY:
Titus Natkime, 31, the son of a tribal leader who encountered the first Americans to walk into the wilderness of Papua nearly 50 years ago, was clearly upset with his employer the American mining company, Freeport-McMoRan. 
 For generations, Mr. Natkime's clan has laid claim to much of the land in Papua, the Indonesian province where Freeport mines some of the world's largest copper and gold reserves. Now it was time for a payback, he said.
He brought out a draft document showing Freeport's offer: $250,000 to set up a foundation for the clan, plus $100,000 annually, a sizable amount in Indonesia's most remote and poorest province. 
 ''Why should I accept it?'' asked Mr. Natkime, who works in the company's government relations department, though he is hardly an ardent spokesman. ''It's an insult.'' In comparison, he said, Freeport was making tens of millions of dollars every day. In the end, the family accepted the money, he said, but he is planning a lawsuit and demanding royalties. 
 Such defiance is symptomatic of the growing troubles in Papua, where four people have been killed in recent weeks in protests against Freeport. And it shows that times are changing for multinational companies and governments long used to working out concessions in remote areas with a handshake, over the heads of local people. 
 In March, Citigroup echoed the theme, saying in a report that such companies could no longer afford to ignore environmental and social issues. ''In recent years, a groundswell of public opinion has caused sustainable development to become a serious business consideration for investors,'' the report said. 
 Mark Logsdon, an American geochemist who has visited the Freeport mine, agreed. Mining companies must seek and take seriously the ''consent of the governed,'' he said. ''Whether in Indonesia, Latin America or Africa, the increase in communications capability means that the essential isolation of 'resource colonies' is largely a thing of the past.'' 
 The protests in Papua provide an example of what can happen when a natural resource company, backed by an unpopular central government and a heavy-handed military, fails to pay careful attention to the local people, whose lives have been disturbed and who feel the riches in the ground are theirs, not the foreigners'.
 At one time, there was hardly a place more remote than Papua, where Freeport's first explorers encountered Papuans armed with bows and arrows and wearing penis gourds, practices that still exist. Yet, try as the government might to preserve that isolation -- for the past two years it has banned foreign journalists from the province, granting only very occasional permits -- the extent of the problems is impossible to hide. 
 In March, long-simmering tensions exploded when Indonesian riot police officers and several hundred Papuan protesters clashed in the provincial capital, Jayapura, leaving three policemen and an air force officer dead. 
 Freeport's profits are soaring as gold prices have reached 25-year highs of more than $550 an ounce. The company, which is based in New Orleans and is in partnership in the Papua mines with the Rio Tinto group of Australia, is one of Indonesia's biggest taxpayers, and has been for many years. 
 But Papuans argue that they have never received a fair portion of the estimated $33 billion in direct and indirect benefits the company says it provided to Indonesia from 1992 to 2004.
 Repeated efforts to reach the spokesman for Freeport in Indonesia, Siddharta Moersjid, were unsuccessful. 
 As evidence of the neglect, the Papuans, who are indigenous Melanesians with broad features and curly hair that contrast with the Malay heritage of most Indonesians, point to their relative lack of progress compared to the rest of Indonesia.
 In the current ugly mood, the people around the mine give short shrift to the more than $150 million that the company says it has spent on community development. 
 Instead, they complain that they have lost their most precious assets: their land; their river system, which is used as a waste chute; and their sago plants, which have disappeared under more than 90 square miles of mine waste, accumulating at a rate of some 700,000 tons a day. 
 Resentment is compounded by the presence of the Indonesian military, an almost entirely non-Papuan force that is often most intent on extracting its own cut of the province's resources, which run not only to gold and copper but also to timber. 
 ''Freeport is being held hostage for its relationship with the armed forces and the police,'' said Agus Sumule, a professor of agriculture at the University of Cenderawasih, the province's main campus. ''There is no way they can do their operations without the armed forces, and that's because of their bad relationship with the local people.'' The tight grip of the military fuels calls for independence that send shudders through the Indonesian authorities, he said. 
 The government knows it is in a tough position. The defense minister, Juwono Sudarsono, justified the ban on foreign journalists in February, saying they believed in human rights standards that did not necessarily apply in Papua. ''Papua is a very touchy issue for us,'' he said. 
 From the start, it has been sensitive for Freeport, too. The Natkimes are a case in point. 
 Freeport has already paid for Mr. Natkime's travel across the United States, financed his English language training in New Zealand and given him a house in Jakarta. In a further effort to placate his family's claims, it offered him the job in government relations. 
 But he wants more, not just for him but for all Papuans. 
 This contrasts sharply with how the company appeased Mr. Natkime's father, Tuarek, in 1967. Balfour Darnell, a self-described roughneck who built Freeport's first base camps, soothed Tuarek Natkime's suspicion of the outsiders with a simple tool that was half hatchet and half hammer. 
 ''Boy, that did it,'' Mr. Darnell said of Mr. Natkime's evident pleasure, according to the account in the book ''Grasberg,'' by George A. Mealey, a former Freeport executive. ''He was in seventh heaven with that thing.'' 
 With the promise of a few sacks of salt, the tribal leader said he would clear a landing area for the company helicopter. ''So we blasted off and that was the end of that meeting,'' Mr. Darnell marveled. ''We were safe.'' 
 Now, in the age of Tuarek Natkime's more educated, more worldly son, it is not clear anymore how safe.

HEADLINE: Take Back the Towers

BYLINE: By Dennis Smith. 
Dennis Smith, a retired New York City firefighter, is the chairman of a financial services company for first responders.

 BODY:
THE effort to rebuild the World Trade Center site continues to go nowhere. The planned memorial lacks start-up money and faces public indifference. Those behind the proposed museum have not shown that they have any clear idea how to represent the memory of a day of murder, pain and loss. And most important, there is no real government-business-real estate coalition supporting the commercial plans of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the developer Larry Silverstein, who holds the lease. 
 We've reached a stage where the state and local government, so often the causes of delay, are the only players with the ability to move things forward. It is time for them to invoke their trump card: the takings clause of the United States Constitution. 
 To understand why, consider how all facets of the project have reached the point of inertia. Those behind the memorial, centered on its two reflecting pools, have still not satisfied the public or the politicians on several aesthetic questions. 
 For example, the memorial must display the names of those who died at ground zero, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa., as well as those killed in the 1993 attack on the twin towers. But to the consternation of many (perhaps most) of the 9/11 families, the designers seem determined to place the names haphazardly, and without reference to time or place of death. 
 The debate over the names points to a larger problem: many in the artistic community seem unable to accept the influence that the families of the victims have among the public. Until the designers understand the role of the families and that they are building over a tomb -- bodies of hundreds of the 2,749 who died there were never recovered -- the project will languish. As for the museum, the most obvious setback was the disastrous decision to have it house the controversial International Freedom Center, which was eventually reversed by Gov. George Pataki. But since then, another series of seemingly intractable issues has arisen: the footprint space and exhibition areas have been reduced, there are problems with handicapped access, there have been warnings that crowd movement could be dangerous in an emergency and, most important, Alice Greenwald, the director, has yet to say what specifically the museum will contain. 
 Finally, of course, there is the problem of financing. It is too late to say that the money should have been raised before the design of the memorial and associated projects was accepted. But it seems clear that corporations and individual benefactors are reluctant to pony up the half-billion dollars needed for an effort with so many unanswered questions attached to it.
 There is only one way to move forward: Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the City Council should send a home-rule message to Albany and demand the confiscation of the World Trade Center site under the eminent domain clause. At a time when counties and municipalities across America are seizing houses and small businesses to build shopping malls just to increase their tax bases, there are plenty of justifiable reasons -- included lost tax revenues -- to demand the return of ground zero. 
 Is taking the site legally practicable? ''As long as the land were used for public purposes such as monuments, museums, or other public buildings, it can certainly be condemned under the U.S. Constitution,'' says Vicki Been, a professor of real-estate law at New York University Law School. ''Even if some (or most) of the land were transferred to private parties to build commercial or residential space, the Supreme Court has held that such economic development is a public purpose.''
 The alternative -- waiting for the current players to get their act together -- makes no sense. Even if the project were to regain momentum, the plan is to build 10 million square feet of commercial space that is not only unneeded but will also mostly fail to rent. The Freedom Tower will be an eyesore as well as a terrorist target, and few will want to work there. 
 Mayor Bloomberg has recognized the financial folly of such large-scale building in an area that needs careful neighborhood development. With his business skills and political savvy, he is the natural choice to become chief engineer and contractor of a smaller, smarter, more appropriate ground zero. 
 Four decades ago, the 12 blocks that form the trade center site were taken through eminent domain from a group of electronics merchants and other small-business owners. That was David Rockefeller's idea, and his brother Gov. Nelson Rockefeller made it happen. Now it is up to Governor Pataki to give Mr. Bloomberg a similar opportunity. Ground zero does not belong to the Port Authority or the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation or Larry Silverstein. It is our property. We should get it back.

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary Is Said to Be Thinking of Quitting 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has expressed interest in leaving his job in the next several months, a person close to him said Tuesday, as speculation raced through Washington that the White House was seeking Mr. Snow's replacement.
 President Bush did little to tamp down the talk after a morning meeting about health care in the Roosevelt Room, where he responded with a tepid endorsement to a question about whether Mr. Snow would stay. The Treasury secretary was in the room as the president spoke. 
''Secretary Snow is here at the table,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's been a part of this discussion. I'm glad you brought him up. He has been a valuable member of my administration, and I trust his judgment and appreciate his service.''
 When Mr. Bush has been asked in the past about whether Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld would remain in his job, he has spoken out more forcefully and enthusiastically. 
 Several prominent Republicans who consult regularly with the White House said on Tuesday that Joshua B. Bolten, the president's incoming chief of staff, was interested in a replacement for Mr. Snow who could more powerfully communicate the administration's message that the American economy is strong. 
 Another Republican who is in close contact with the West Wing staff said White House officials were expecting Mr. Snow to step down.
 ''They're waiting for Snow to do the right thing,'' the Republican said. ''They thought he would have gotten the message right now and submitted his resignation.''
 The Republicans and the person close to Mr. Snow were granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations and thinking within the administration.
 Mr. Snow's spokesman, Tony Fratto, declined to comment. 
 Speculation about Mr. Snow's departure has ebbed and flowed for more than a year but has intensified since Mr. Bush announced last week that Mr. Bolten would be his new chief of staff. Mr. Bolten, who once worked at Goldman Sachs, is said to be interested in filling the Treasury post with someone from Wall Street who could help reassure financial markets worried about record-high budget and trade deficits.
 Although Mr. Bush has been resistant to a Treasury secretary from the investment and financial worlds, Republicans say that he is less so now and that he recognizes that his economic team needs more credibility.
 Names circulating in Republican circles as possibilities for the Treasury job include Stanley O'Neal, the chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs. 
 Some Republicans questioned whether either man would be seriously interested in the Treasury post, which in this White House has not been the powerhouse position it was when Robert E. Rubin held it under President Bill Clinton.
 Mr. Bush's Treasury secretaries -- Paul H. O'Neill, the former chief executive of Alcoa, was Mr. Snow's predecessor -- have not had their own voices on economic matters and have been effectively subordinate to Karl Rove, the president's political adviser and deputy chief of staff. Although Mr. Bolten has told associates that he wants to overhaul his economic team, it is unclear if he wants to change its basic structure.
 Mr. Snow, who has been in the job for three years, has long said he will return to the private sector at an appropriate time. The person close to Mr. Snow who said that the secretary was interested in stepping down in the next several months appeared to be reflecting that thinking, but also appeared to be defensively positioning Mr. Snow so that any resignation could be portrayed as his own.
 In his remarks in the Roosevelt Room, Mr. Bush indicated that he had given Mr. Bolten a strong hand to reorganize the White House, but only so far as he approved. Republicans have criticized the departing chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., as fatigued and slow to react to national crises over the past year, including Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''I told Josh that he is -- will organize the White House in such a way that he is comfortable with and that meets my needs,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And my needs are to have good, crisp information so I can make decisions on behalf of the American people.''
 Mr. Bolten is to take over on April 14, and the president said he looked forward to his recommendations on ''how to get this White House for the last two and a half years of my administration to continue to function in an effective way.''

HEADLINE: Dark Days for Philippine Democracy

 BODY:
Filipinos thought they had put an end to electoral chicanery and governmental intimidation when they overthrew the Marcos dictatorship two decades ago. Unfortunately, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has completely lost touch with the ideals that inspired that 1986 ''people power'' movement. 
 Mrs. Arroyo is no Ferdinand Marcos, at least not yet. But this onetime reformer is reviving bad memories of crony corruption, presidential vote-rigging and intimidation of critical journalists. Unless the Philippine Congress and courts find ways to rein in her increasingly authoritarian tendencies, democracy itself may be in danger.
This was not the outcome people expected five years ago when Mrs. Arroyo, then the vice president, was swept into power on a wave of popular discontent with her discredited predecessor, Joseph Estrada. In those days, Mrs. Arroyo, a professional economist, was seen as an earnest reformer. She won further credit by pledging not to run for a new six-year term in 2004. 
 But then she changed her mind, and her style of government as well. Her narrow re-election victory became tainted after a tape revealed her discussing her vote totals with an election commissioner while ballots were still being counted. She survived an impeachment attempt over that incident. But she was forced to send her husband into exile over charges that he took bribes from gambling syndicates. 
 Earlier this year she briefly declared a state of emergency in response to allegations of a coup threat that others disputed. Since then she has been intensifying pressure on a wide range of political critics and especially on the press. Government officials have warned news outlets that they will be held to restrictive new guidelines, the justice secretary talks darkly about a journalistic watch list, and the staff members of a well-known center for investigative journalism have been threatened with sedition charges. No Philippine government has made such efforts to muzzle the press since the Marcos era. 
 President Bush has repeatedly hailed Mrs. Arroyo as an important ally against international terrorism. He now needs to warn her that by undermining a hard-won democracy, she is making her country far more vulnerable to terrorist pressures.

HEADLINE: Today's Russian Newspapers

BYLINE: COMPILED BY RACHEL THORNER

 BODY:

Beginning today, a summary of the top stories in the Russian newspapers will appear on this page Monday through Friday.

RUSSIA'S TOP NEWS

DEFENSE MINISTER PROPOSES MILITARY REFORMS: Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov presented a series of military reforms to President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday at the second All-Army Officers' Conference. Mr. Ivanov's performance will "determine his future career," Kommersant reported, suggesting that Mr. Putin will be evaluating him as his possible successor in 2008. The proposed changes include increasing the minimum age for officers and establishing compulsory retirement at 45.
 The defense minister has introduced military reforms in response to recent hazing incidents that have tarnished his reputation. The most notorious case was that of Andrei Sychev, the 18-year-old conscript soldier who was beaten so brutally by his classmates in February that his legs had to be amputated. The incident caused uproar among human rights activists in Russia, Europe and the United States. 
 Mr. Ivanov is often cited as a leading candidate to replace Mr. Putin, along with the first deputy prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, who is lagging behind the defense minister in popularity ratings. Mr. Putin's presence at the conference indicates his support for Mr. Ivanov's potential candidacy, Kommersant said, underscoring the Kremlin's preference. But The Moscow Times said that Mr. Ivanov must take steps not to "fall behind Medvedev, who has also been intensely covered by the media in recent weeks." 

RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN STRENGTHEN TRADE TIES: Mr. Putin and his Kazakh counterpart, Nursultan Nazarbaev, confirmed their countries' economic ties at a meeting on Tuesday at the Kremlin. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia have signed preliminary agreements to create a trade alliance, and have invited Ukraine to participate. Mr. Putin said the countries "would be glad" if Ukraine joined their ranks, but expressed doubts at its willingness, Izvestia reported. Mr. Putin and Mr. Nazarbaev did not, however, resolve major issues during their meeting, including railroad and pipeline tariffs, Vremya Novostei reported.

OTHER NEWS

KOMMERSANT

CHECHNAY'S CELLULAR CONNECTION MORE ACCESSIBLE: Megafon, a major cellular operator, halved its tariffs in Chechnya in a deal that took two weeks to negotiate. The newspaper suggests that the Chechen government will prevent the company's competitors from operating in the region.

RETRACTION ON "CONTRABAND" PHONES: The Ministry of Internal Affairs retracted its accusation that the cellular distributor Evroset had imported $19 million worth of contraband Motorola handsets. The 167,500 phones were seized at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport on the grounds they were models not approved for use in Russia. Motorola refuted the claim, calling the authorities' actions "a threat to foreign companies in Russia."

RUSSIA'S NEW ACTION MOVIE: Andrei Kavun, a Russian film director, will soon contribute a new film, "Hunt for the Piranha," to the country's flourishing action genre. The movie is based on an Aleksandr Bushkov novel, in which the protagonist is taken captive on an island.

GAZETA

REGISTRATION FOR CHARITIES MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT: United Russia, the pro-Kremlin parliamentary majority, has submitted a bill that would require newly-established charitable organizations to obtain permission to register from the government. The legislation would "seriously complicate" the registration procedure, the paper said. The newspaper called the bill a "second attempt in the last half year by authorities to limit the rights of social organizations," referring to the new controversial law that restricts the activities of non-governmental organizations.

ORTHODOX LEADER CRITICAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS: A top Orthodox leader denounced human rights organizations on Tuesday, claiming that activists protecting homosexuals, abortion, and euthanasia are undermining Russian society.

OPPOSITION LEADER CREATES NGO: Irina Khakamada, a 2004 presidential candidate and outspoken critic of Mr. Putin, has begun her own non-governmental organization, Our Choice, after announcing she was resigning from politics. She explained her resignation as temporary, saying that "today politics does not exist in Russia."

IZVESTIA

POLAND'S FORMER COMMUNIST LEADER DEFENDS HIMSELF: In an interview with the paper, the former Communist leader of Poland, Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski, who is facing criminal charges for his actions while defense minister, defended his declaration of martial law in 1981. "Our military position is what saved Poland," he said.

CITY REQUIRES PARKING LOTS: City authorities have passed a law that prohibits the construction of new buildings without parking lots. The article predicts that the new regulations will either decongest the sidewalks and playgrounds of illegally parked cars, or that construction companies will simply disregard the law.

ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA

KASPAROV NO LONGER NO. 1: Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion turned opposition leader, has been replaced by Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria as the world's highest scoring grandmaster in chess, according to the World Chess Federation.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Offers Aid To Rivals 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores, whose all-in-one retailing model has forced scores of competitors to close their doors over the last 40 years, is turning to an unusual business plan: helping its rivals. 
 The giant discount retailer, under increasing assault by critics, announced a wide-ranging effort yesterday to support small businesses near its new urban stores, including the hardware stores, dress shops and bakeries with which it competes.
Wal-Mart said it would offer those businesses financial grants, training on how to survive with Wal-Mart in town and even free advertising within a Wal-Mart store. 
 Wal-Mart acknowledged the program was not entirely altruistic. The company is trying to open 50 stores in urban neighborhoods in the next two years, and the aid to small businesses could help build support in cities like Los Angeles and New York where it has met strong resistance.
 ''We see we can be better for communities than we have been in the past if we are willing to stretch ourselves and our resources,'' Wal-Mart's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said in a conference call with reporters yesterday from Chicago, where Wal-Mart plans to open its first urban store.
 Criticism of Wal-Mart's wages, health insurance and pricing strategy has crescendoed in the last year, with the release of a feature-length film attacking the company and the passage of a law in Maryland that, unless struck down, would force the retailer to increase spending on health care. 
 There is also growing evidence that the negative publicity is hurting the company. An internal Wal-Mart report, prepared in 2004, found that 2 percent to 8 percent of consumers surveyed had stopped shopping at the chain because of ''negative press they have heard.''
 On a confidential company Web site, Mr. Scott recently wrote that criticism of the chain had slowed its expansion. Community opposition has foiled efforts to build stores in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, which are crowded with small businesses. 
 In response, Wal-Mart has issued a flurry of announcements intended to burnish its image, among them expanding its health insurance to more employees and investing in businesses owned by women.
 The Wal-Mart jobs and opportunity zones are to be set up in 10 metropolitan areas where the chain wants to build stores. Wal-Mart said it would choose sites traditionally overlooked by retailers -- urban neighborhoods with high unemployment, contaminated land and old shopping centers in need of revitalization. The new stores are expected to create at least 15,000 jobs.
 The first zone will be the West Side of Chicago, where Mr. Scott announced the program yesterday. The company would not say what other cities it was considering. 
 In the zones, the company will identify local businesses to spotlight in newspaper advertisements and to feature on Wal-Mart's in-store radio network, which plays throughout the day. (Mr. Scott said ''it would not be healthy'' to leave out competitors.) 
 Wal-Mart will hold seminars to coach the businesses on how to compete with the giant discount stores -- by, for example, intensifying customer service, for which Wal-Mart often receives low marks. An annual report on trends in Wal-Mart's business will be distributed exclusively to those companies. 
 At the same time, Wal-Mart will invest $500,000 in local chambers of commerce, to be used for small-business Web sites and business improvement seminars. ''This is a commitment to reach beyond our stores,'' Mr. Scott said. 
 He said Wal-Mart would not lose money on the program because urban stores were expected to attract more shoppers -- and profits -- than suburban and rural outlets. 
 Critics claimed that the proposed jobs and opportunity zones were an effort to divert attention from the company's negative impact on local economies. 
 A study conducted by several economists, and presented at a conference held by Wal-Mart last fall, found that after the company's arrival in a county, total earnings for workers, retail and nonretail, fell 2.5 percent to 4.8 percent. One reason for the decline is that Wal-Mart pressures its suppliers to cut their costs and that may lead to lower wages for the workers of suppliers. 
 A different study, conducted by an economic research firm hired by Wal-Mart, found the retailer's pricing strategy had made industries more productive, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and increasing net consumer purchasing power by $118 billion last year, or about $401 for every American. 
 Chris Kofinis, a spokesman for Wake-Up Wal-Mart, a union-backed group prodding the company to improve wages and benefits, said the new program was ''bitterly ironic'' because it was ''asking Wal-Mart to help solve the problems it created.'' 
 The program, he said, leaves major issues like Wal-Mart's average wages, which amount to less than $20,000 a year, unaddressed. ''What this is,'' he added, ''is another P.R. stunt in a litany of P.R. stunts.''

HEADLINE: Big Gain for Rich Seen in Tax Cuts For Investments 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The first data to document the effect of President Bush's tax cuts for investment income show that they have significantly lowered the tax burden on the richest Americans, reducing taxes on incomes of more than $10 million by an average of about $500,000.
 An analysis of Internal Revenue Service data by The New York Times found that the benefit of the lower taxes on investments was far more concentrated on the very wealthiest Americans than the benefits of Mr. Bush's two previous tax cuts: on wages and other noninvestment income.
 When Congress cut investment taxes three years ago, it was clear that the highest-income Americans would gain the most, because they had the most money in investments. But the size of the cuts and what share goes to each income group have not been known. 
 As Congress debates whether to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, The Times analyzed I.R.S. figures for 2003, the latest year available and the first that reflected the tax cuts for income from dividends and from the sale of stock and other assets, known as capital gains. 
 The analysis found the following:
 Among taxpayers with incomes greater than $10 million, the amount by which their investment tax bill was reduced averaged about $500,000 in 2003, and total tax savings, which included the two Bush tax cuts on compensation, nearly doubled, to slightly more than $1 million.
 These taxpayers, whose average income was $26 million, paid about the same share of their income in income taxes as those making $200,000 to $500,000 because of the lowered rates on investment income. 
 Americans with annual incomes of $1 million or more, about one-tenth of 1 percent all taxpayers, reaped 43 percent of all the savings on investment taxes in 2003. The savings for these taxpayers averaged about $41,400 each. By comparison, these same Americans received less than 10 percent of the savings from the other Bush tax cuts, which applied primarily to wages, though that share is expected to grow in coming years. 
 The savings from the investment tax cuts are expected to be larger in subsequent years because of gains in the stock market.
 The Times showed the new numbers to people on various sides of the debate over tax cuts. Stephen J. Entin, president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, a Washington organization, and other supporters of the cuts said they did not go far enough because the more money the wealthiest had to invest, the more would go to investments that produce jobs. For investment income, Mr. Entin said, ''the proper tax rate would be zero.''
 Opponents say the cuts are too generous to those who already have plenty. Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said after seeing the new figures that ''these tax cuts are beyond irresponsible'' when ''we're in a war; we haven't fixed Social Security or Medicare; we've got record deficits.''
 Because of the tax cuts, even the merely rich, making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, are falling behind the very wealthiest, particularly because another provision, the alternative minimum tax, now costs many of them thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars a year in lost deductions. 
 About 3.5 million taxpayers filing their returns for last year are being hit by the alternative tax. But that figure will balloon this year to at least 19 million taxpayers, making as little as about $30,000, unless Congress restores a law that limited its effects until now, according to the Tax Policy Center in Washington, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, whose estimates the White House has declared reasonable. 
 The tax cut analysis was based on estimates from a computer model developed by Citizens for Tax Justice, which asserts that the tax system unfairly favors the rich. The group's estimates are considered reliable by advocates on differing sides of the tax debate. The Times, which also did its own analysis, asked the group to use the model to produce additional data on the effect of the investment tax cuts on various income groups. The analyses show that more than 70 percent of the tax savings on investment income went to the top 2 percent, about 2.6 million taxpayers. 
 By contrast, few taxpayers with modest incomes benefited because most of them who own stocks held them in retirement accounts, which are not eligible for the investment income tax cuts. Money in these accounts is not taxed until withdrawal, when the higher rates on wages apply. 
 Those making less than $50,000 saved an average of $10 more because of the investment tax cuts, for a total of $435 in total income tax cuts, according to the computer model. 
 During last week's debate on whether to restore limits on the alternative minimum tax or make permanent the cuts in investment income taxes, House leaders chose as their spokesman Representative David L. Camp, a Michigan Republican. He said Republicans favored continuing investment tax cuts because that would help more people and would especially benefit those making less than $100,000. 
 ''Nearly 60 percent of the taxpayers with incomes less than $100,000 had income from capital gains and dividends,'' he said on the House floor. 
 But I.R.S. data show that among the 90 percent of all taxpayers who made less than $100,000, dividend tax reductions benefited just one in seven and capital gains reductions one in 20. 
 Mr. Camp, who had said in an interview that his figures were correct, said Monday through a spokesman that he had been misinformed by the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. But his office said he supported making the investment tax cuts permanent because cutting these rates was ''good policy and good for our economy.'' 
 President Bush, in his budget, urged Congress to make permanent the reduced taxes on investment income. He also proposed limiting the effects of the alternative minimum tax through next year, saying a permanent solution ''is best addressed within the context of fundamental tax reform.''
 The Congressional Budget Office estimated that making the investment tax cuts permanent would cost the government $197 billion over 10 years. But advocates of eliminating taxes on investments say there is no cost to the government because lowering taxes on such income encourages more investment, which should lead to more and higher-paying jobs. Taxes on wages from those jobs should more than offset the tax savings to investors, said Mr. Entin, an advocate of eliminating taxes on most investment income as a way of promoting economic growth. 
 However, the Congressional Research Service, an arm of Congress that analyzes issues, concluded in a January report that lower taxes on investment income may translate into lower savings because people need fewer investments to earn the same after-tax income. In another report, the research service showed how lower taxes on investment income can encourage investment outside the United States, creating jobs, but not for Americans.
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates for the poor, and several mainstream policy research organizations say the investment tax cuts will have insignificant positive effects and may even damage long-term economic growth by contributing to soaring budget deficits. In an era of budget deficits, ''the net effect is a wash or may even be negative,'' said Robert Greenstein, the executive director of the center. 
 There have been three tax cuts for individuals under President Bush. The top tax rate on compensation was trimmed twice and is now 35 percent, from 39.6 percent when President Bush took office. Most compensation also faces a 1.45 percent Medicare tax, which is matched by the employer, making the effective federal tax rate on high earners 37.9 percent. 
 Then, the top rate for most investment income was reduced to 15 percent in 2003, from the 39.6 percent for dividends and 20 percent for profits on asset sales that were in effect when Mr. Bush took office. 
 A result is that the wealthiest Americans now pay much higher direct taxes on money they work for than on money that works for them.

HEADLINE: Sampling Newly Minted Plays by the Fest-Full

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 3 

 BODY:
Turning 30 can be scary. Perhaps that's why most of the playwrights presenting new works here at the Humana Festival of New American Plays, which celebrated that big birthday this year, decided to splurge, conceptually speaking. The three stages at the Actors Theater of Louisville are awash in bold ideas wrapped in colorful theatrical packaging.
 Eric Coble's ''Natural Selection,'' a comedy set in an apocalyptic near future, considers the dehumanizing effects of globalization, mechanization and other headline-making contemporary ills. In Jordan Harrison's ''Act a Lady,'' the mysteries of gender and the transforming power of art upend a small Midwestern town in 1927. Sharr White dissects the myths of the ''Greatest Generation'' in ''Six Years,'' a drama that, in fact, sprawls across a full quarter-century of American history. And Charles L. Mee and Anne Bogart concoct a visually stimulating fantasia on the reclusive life and elusive work of the artist Joseph Cornell in ''Hotel Cassiopeia.'' 
But the most accomplished and rewarding play in the festival was a small but searing drama peopled by everyday characters and driven by an off-the-rack plot. Examining yet again the disintegration of a contemporary marriage in ''The Scene,'' Theresa Rebeck proved that in theater, too, the best things can come in small -- and sometimes even familiar -- packages.
 Ms. Rebeck's sharply observed, often blisteringly funny play benefited from a superior cast of four and incisive direction from Rebecca Bayla Taichman (coincidentally or not, the best acting and directing in the festival). Set in Manhattan, among ambitious 20- and 30-somethings on the fringes of the entertainment industry, ''The Scene'' depicts the toxic effects of chronic disappointment on the psyche of a once-promising actor sinking slowly into the quicksand of middle age.
 Charlie, played with great gallows humor and sensitivity by Stephen Barker Turner, is comfortably wed to Stella (Carla Harting), a booker on a talk show who brings home most of the money and tends to dominate the marital conversation, too. (Discourse among driven New Yorkers, Ms. Rebeck smartly acknowledges, often consists of alternating arias of angry or aggrieved self-obsession.)
 At a party, Charlie and his friend Lewis (David Wilson Barnes) fall under the queasy spell of a beautiful young blonde, Clea (Anna Camp), whose confused vocabulary and daffy aspect belie a shrewd understanding of male psychology.
 Lewis cautiously tries to put the moves on Clea; Charlie is initially scornful. But an instinctive antagonism is transformed into something more complicated when Charlie later interrupts Lewis's first date with her. In emotional free-fall from a humiliating encounter about a phantom job, Charlie finds himself suddenly bewitched by this symbol of all he thinks that he disdains -- the meretricious allure of shallow showbiz -- and he falls fast and hard.
 On paper, Ms. Rebeck's play might seem simple to the point of schematic. But scenes that could come across as boilerplate domestic drama -- wife discovers husband and mistress in flagrante; wife seeks comfort from husband's best friend, who has long carried a torch for her -- crackle with raw, even brutal feeling, and all the play's characters are drawn with empathy and insight. Even the seemingly cliched femme fatale, played with recklessly funny verve by Ms. Camp, accrues unexpected layers of complexity. 
 Ms. Rebeck is an established playwright who has also worked in television, and she clearly knows how the savage, mercurial economics of the entertainment industry can shatter the fragile ego and wreak havoc on domestic equilibrium. Gifted, good-hearted and smart, wanting all the right things for all the right reasons, Charlie still comes up with nothing, and the mystery of his failure, and the mystery of his contemporaries' success, plagues him to distraction -- and to destruction.
 In insisting on the resounding nature of that destruction, unfortunately, in a deeply miscalculated last scene, Ms. Rebeck betrays the subtlety and honesty of much of what has come before. As the lights dim on the lurid denouement of Charlie's moral annihilation, you half expect to hear the ''ka-chung'' that signals a dramatic turning point in a ''Law & Order'' episode. This fine play doesn't need a flashy but false ending.
 The psyche of an ultimately more successful artist is investigated in ''Hotel Cassiopeia,'' a typically elliptical work from the symbiotic imaginations of two regular visitors to the Humana festival. With a script by Mr. Mee and direction by Ms. Bogart, ''Hotel Cassiopeia'' seeks to project on the stage, in the manner of a magic lantern, the interior landscape and exterior experience of Joseph Cornell (1903-72), the American artist celebrated for his quirky assemblages perfumed with nostalgia and longing.
 Created and performed by Ms. Bogart's Siti Company, ''Hotel Cassiopeia'' is itself a 90-minute assemblage of word-play, movement, video projections, dance and film clips that will strike some as a haunting theatrical dreamscape, others as a ponderous and abstruse whimsy. The second in a planned series of four collaborations between the Siti Company and Mr. Mee exploring the lives and works of American artists (the first was ''bobrauschenbergamerica''), it eschews narrative and mundane biographical detail, preferring instead to evoke emblematic emotional states and key relationships in Cornell's life through oblique visual and aural imagery.
 But audiences without a Cornell lexicon at hand for assistance may find the play's visual syntax to be as inscrutable as it is alluring.
 A much more linear approach to biography marks Mr. White's ''Six Years,'' which marches through more than 20 years of postwar American history in strict rhythm, stopping every half-dozen years to take the temperature of a marriage in St. Louis. The psychological trauma experienced by World War II veterans, often glossed over in celebratory examinations of the generation, is Mr. Sharr's large subject, but his play follows a well-trodden microcosmic path. Say hello, once again, to the triple A's of bourgeois American affliction: alcoholism, adultery and anomie.
 Michael J. Reilly and Kelly Mares play Phil and Meredith Granger, a young married couple reunited in 1949, six years after Phil mysteriously disappeared after being injured in the war. His emotional fragility is signaled by the fragmentary dialogue leaking in slow dribbles from tightly clenched lips. (Her inability to finish a sentence is not as easily explained.)
 Mr. White's play is sturdily fashioned, and his desire to debunk the notion that post-traumatic stress disorder was born post-Vietnam is admirable. But with a few exceptions (David Hare's similarly structured ''Plenty'' comes to mind), theater does not treat material of this expansive, episodic scope with the richness of texture available to novelists. For all the violent ups and downs experienced by the Grangers, ''Six Years,'' directed with simple economy by Hal Brooks, remains a frustratingly flat theatrical experience.
 By contrast, ''Act a Lady,'' a cross-dressing comedy written by Mr. Harrison and directed by Anne Kauffman, draws the audience to its big, friendly bosom with its sweet story of humble American menfolk learning to embrace their inner drag queen back in the 1920's. But sweep aside the diverting frippery, like the fancy play-within-a-play construction, which alternates backstage scenes with histrionic snippets from a melodrama set in 18th-century France, and Mr. Harrison's tidy homilies about the fluidity of gender and the inspiring power of ''art'' look flimsy.
 Without providing any reasonable context, Mr. Harrison expects us to believe that, for charitable purposes (we're told they're doing it ''for the kids''), two burly masculine fellows, comfortably allied with the town's effeminate misfit, would happily cavort onstage with the polish and professionalism of East Village drag-bar divas with a dozen years of Charles Ludlam plays under their garter belts. Even the most outlandish of Mr. Ludlam's plays, I'm afraid, have a greater respect for psychological and social truths than Mr. Harrison evinces here.
 Then again, Mr. Harrison's frothy concoction seems a meticulously researched piece of cultural history next to Mr. Coble's preposterous ''Natural Selection,'' directed by the Actors Theater of Louisville's artistic director, Marc Masterson.
 This dark sci-fi comedy, set in the future at a theme park where visitors come to observe ''genuine native people in genuine native habitats,'' is annoyingly lacking in internal logic. The play presents the natural world as hopelessly despoiled for much of its running time, and also as man's last hope for salvation. How's that, exactly?
 ''Natural Selection'' has some funny jokes, and it handily takes the festival prize for sheer ambition in its desire to envision where various pernicious cultural trends will lead us, but as serious topical satire, it is mostly obvious and jejune.
 There's not much point in aiming high if you can't hit your target. And is it really necessary for playwrights to dream up new worlds? As Ms. Rebeck's intimate and affecting play reminds us, the one we live in still provides durable material for theater that moves us, makes us laugh and allows us to see even a small frame of experience in a new light.

The festival continues through April 8 in Louisville, Ky.; (800) 428-5849 or www.actorstheatre.org.

HEADLINE: Looking for Poetry in the Newsroom, and Finding It

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH

 BODY:
For David Tucker, an assistant managing editor of the Metro section of The Star-Ledger of Newark, there is poetry in the maligned and grimy practice of journalism. Here's ''City Editor Looking for News,'' his poetic rendering of a frantic editor haranguing his hapless reporters. The editor cries: 
 Tell me what it's like. Make me fall in love
 with the dirtball murder in Kensington, the wasted life 
 of the 16-year-old crack-dealing honor student
 who might have been a star for U.C.L.A., the priest
 who tried to save him, the boy's chalk silhouette
 fading on the rainy street, the killer who shot him
 because he wanted his shoes and loved nothing in this life
 but the crazed Rottweiler he kept on a silver leash.
 At the end of the poem, he tells them, profanely, to stop loafing: ''It's almost deadline.''
After the poem was published in The Missouri Review, ''it kind of made the rounds with the guys in the newsroom,'' said Mr. Tucker, 58, who looks like the veteran editor he is, a little sedentary, with ruffled hair. ''And they said to me, 'Boy, that's a great self-portrait.' '' 
 This month, after leading a dual life for nearly 30 years as a journalist who writes poetry on the side, Mr. Tucker is publishing his first book with a mainstream publisher. The book, ''Late for Work,'' won the Katharine Bakeless Nason Prize for poetry, awarded by the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, which included $1,000 and publication by Houghton Mifflin. The judge was another poet of work, Philip Levine.
 ''He draws from areas that American poetry hasn't been involved in,'' Mr. Levine said in a telephone interview. ''Wallace Stevens was an insurance executive, but you would never know that, reading his poetry. David was able to aestheticize his own work in a way that seemed miraculous.''
 Much of the power of Mr. Tucker's poetry, Mr. Levine said, ''comes from the fact that he is still engaged in this kind of work.'' He noted that he himself had written from memory about working on an assembly line. But because Mr. Tucker is still on the job, Mr. Levine said, ''he is constantly stocking up on new imagery.''
 Indeed, sitting through The Star-Ledger's morning news meeting with him, while editors discuss ''the prison guard story'' and ''the transportation trust fund bond deal,'' it is easy to imagine him taking it in, turning the mundane into verse in his head.
 Mr. Tucker's poetry is informed by the plain-spoken, straightforward language of newspapers. But he is also a poet of silences. In the poem ''And This Just In,'' he writes: ''And in Metro we're leading/with the yawn that traveled City Council chambers/this morning, then slipped into the streets/and wound through the city.'' 
 In his foreword to the book, Mr. Levine writes, ''The writing is so precise and economical, the language so familiar and ordinary, that if you're not reading closely, you can miss how glorious the achievement is.''
 Mr. Tucker tries to transform the ephemeral stories that are the journalist's stock in trade into mythic narratives, but at the same time to find in them a specific and enduring humanity. 
 In ''Messengers,'' reporters come back to the office after covering a fire that killed two little girls: 
 as they slouch to their desks, 
 coats still on, and begin
 to punch in the names:
 Serena, 7, Natasha, 9, name
 of the landlord, names
 of the inspectors, staring
 at their keyboards,
 smelling of smoke.
 In ''Perspective,'' a reporter writes an article about a train wreck, and Mr. Tucker singles out the cliches for scrutiny: ''unprecedented, shocking, blazing,/ devastated, and that old standby: stunned.'' 
 Mr. Tucker grew up poor in Tennessee, at one point in a shack with an outhouse. His mother, Chloe, was hospitalized for depression several times. The family fortunes improved when the Tuckers moved to Linden, a town where his father, Willie Ray, operated a bulldozer. 
 It was from his father that Mr. Tucker began to appreciate the variety and richness of language. ''My father quoted every line of Shakespeare that he learned in high school,'' he said. On the job, he recalled, his father would start reciting lines from ''Julius Caesar'' or ''The Merchant of Venice'' to Mr. Tucker and his brothers, out of the blue: ''Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look./He thinks too much; such men are dangerous,'' or ''The quality of mercy is not strain'd./It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven/Upon the place beneath.''
 Mr. Tucker was the first in his family to attend college. He was active in the antiwar movement and graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It was in the poet Donald Hall's class there that he decided that he wanted to become a poet. 
 ''I was blown away,'' he remembered. ''He was like the campus rock star at the time. He had a beautiful reading voice.''
 After college, he worked as a caretaker. He published his first poem in The Seneca Review in 1972. He married and had a daughter, Calisa, now 35. (He has two daughters, Emily, 27, and Amy, 25, from his second marriage, to Beth Johnson, an administrator at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.) 
 Mr. Tucker decided to become a journalist, he said, ''because of the simple romance of working with words all day.''
 ''I just fell in love with everything about it,'' he said. ''Journalism was an adventure. I liked the instant publication, the quick turnaround, writing something that does have a ripple effect.''
 But, he added, ''I didn't love it as much as I loved poetry.'' His first job was as a stringer for United Press International in Toronto, providing baseball box scores. He later became U.P.I.'s sports editor in New York, and came to The Star-Ledger in 1997 after serving as city editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
 All along, he rose at 5 a.m. and stole time on weekends for poetry. He constantly revises, and he says it sometimes takes years for him to finish a poem.
 He has had no trouble placing his work in literary magazines. He figures he has had some 60 poems printed in publications like The New York Quarterly and The Literary Review. 
 A few years ago, Mr. Tucker began sending a manuscript of his poems around, entering contests for which the prize was publication of a book. In 2003, he won a competition sponsored by the Hudson Valley Writers' Center. The prize was $500 and publication of a chapbook, a slim, softcover volume, printed in a limited edition. He called it ''Days When Nothing Happens.'' Recently, two of his poems were selected by Robert Pinsky for the online magazine Slate. 
 When Mr. Tucker won the Bakeless prize, he phoned Mr. Levine. ''He said, 'Did this really happen?' '' Mr. Levine remembered. Mr. Tucker, he said, was worried that it was a dream. 
 But Mr. Tucker is not just a poet of journalism. He has taken other parts of himself and turned them into poetry, too. In his collection are love poems and poems to his cats. 
 ''This morning I want to talk to you about cats,'' he writes, in ''Talking to Cats While Making Breakfast'':
 and only about cats, and the elegant
 meaninglessness of cats, the indifference
 of your slowly blinking eyes, your shallow pretense 
 to understand all that we say, sure that this lecture
 will end in tuna fish.
 But don't mistake Mr. Tucker for one of those journalists who would like to give it all up to do ''my own writing.'' 
 He enjoys the rough-and-tumble of New Jersey politics too much. ''There are so many scandals going on,'' he said. 
 '''The governor did what?''' Mr. Tucker cried, in mock horror. ''And he's holding a press conference?''

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Hits 5-Year High in Broad Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A rally in stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite index to a five-year high yesterday after oil prices fell and two Federal Reserve officials said inflation was under control. Takeover speculation also contributed to the advance.
 The Nasdaq rose 8.62 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,345.36, its highest close since February 2001. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,305.93. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.91 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,203.85.
 The S.& P. 500 retreated in four of the last five weeks on speculation that the Fed would keep raising interest rates to combat inflation. Last week, the central bank pushed the benchmark rate a quarter-point higher for a 15th consecutive time and signaled that further increases might be ahead. 
 Yesterday's drop in oil prices helped ease that concern. Oil for May delivery fell 0.8 percent, to $66.23 a barrel, in New York on speculation that stockpiles were rising.
 In addition, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said in a speech that the economy was expanding at a ''solid pace'' while inflation was ''low and stable.'' And Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, said in another speech that globalization had helped cut inflation.
 A measure of financial shares rose 1.1 percent and contributed the most to the S.& P. 500's gain among 10 industry groups. Citigroup rose 80 cents, to $48.21, after the Fed reversed a March 2005 order that barred the company from major acquisitions.
 Computer Sciences, a computer services company, added $2.51, to $59.80, on news that it hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to consider a possible sale and that it planned to eliminate 5,000 jobs. Biomet, a maker of artificial hips and knees, jumped $3.38, or 9.7 percent, to $38.16, for the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500, after a report on CNBC that it was also considering a sale.
 Google led the Nasdaq higher, climbing $14.64, to $404.34, after Mark D. Stahlman, an analyst for Caris & Company, said the company might add a music download service, challenging iTunes from Apple Computer. Apple lost $1.48, to $61.17.
 Seven stocks advanced for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.51 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board. Utilities, which become more attractive when interest rates and bond yields are lower or stable, added 1.1 percent for the second-biggest advance among the S.& P. 500 groups.
 AES, a power producer, increased 45 cents, to $17.13. The company said fourth-quarter profit surged 75 percent on higher electricity rates in Brazil and Argentina and lower taxes.
 Retailers rallied on lower oil, with an S.& P. 500 measure climbing 1.1 percent. Best Buy gained $1.56, to $57. Lowe's, the home improvement chain, increased $1.33, to $65.51. 
 Caterpillar and 3M led industrial stocks higher. Caterpillar climbed $1.80, to $75.30, and was the top contributor to the Dow average after the world's largest Caterpillar dealer, Finning International, said 300 trucks and graders valued at $1 billion would be needed to mine oil reserves in sand in Alberta, Canada. 
 3M, the diversified manufacturer, added $1.16, to $77, after it said it was considering a sale of a pharmaceuticals unit to focus on products that take less time to bring to market.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged yesterday, leaving the yield at 4.86 percent. Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price -- 99.646
High Rate -- 4.550
Coupon Yield -- 4.630
Low Rate -- 4.520
Median Rate -- 4.545
Total applied for -- $40,914,806

HEADLINE: City Hall Gets More Efficient, Despite a Hurricane (or Two)

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina subsided, the city of New Orleans faced a new deluge: requests from contractors and homeowners for permits to rebuild thousands of homes, businesses and municipal buildings.
 But the city government was suffering its own crisis. Apart from the physical havoc the hurricane wreaked, much of the staff was gone, seeking refuge in other states. The city's inspection and permits team was less than half the size of its pre-hurricane level, while demand for permits was far greater than before.
What New Orleans needed was an efficiency rarely seen in even the best-run governments. So it turned to the Internet, where business-to-government commerce, involving transactions and other procedures, is becoming more common. The city's experience is the most notable example of how such transactions are faring. 
 ''We had to inspect 110,000 homes in six weeks, and I had nobody to send out to do the inspections,'' said Greg Meffert, the city's chief technology officer. ''There's not exactly a handbook on that.''
 Mr. Meffert addressed the problem by installing new software on dozens of Internet kiosks set up in public buildings citywide. About 90 days after the August storm passed, the new system was up and running. Now businesses and homeowners can type in the address of the home they need to have rebuilt, and the system does much of the rest. 
 It knows, for instance, that homes on certain parts of a given street have taken in four feet of water; it also knows the size of the home, the assessed value and the likely extent of damage. From there, it determines whether homeowners can rebuild (as opposed to demolish), and whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay for it. 
 City Hall supervisors review the applications on the day they are filed. The next day, applicants can log on and print their building permits. The city knows the condition of the homes because it ascertained exactly how much water each precinct was under, and has preprogrammed the system to assess damage accordingly. If an application is outside the bounds of building ordinances, the permit will be denied. (If there is a questionable application, the city will send an inspector.) 
 ''That was the lifeblood of the process,'' Mr. Meffert said. ''That allowed us to get going with rebuilding the city.'' 
 Under the new system, the city has issued about 625 permits daily. Before the storm, Mr. Meffert said, the average was about 45 permits, and contractors and homeowners waited in line at City Hall for nearly two hours, sometimes much longer.
 ''They'd cut the line off at 2 o'clock just so they could close at 5,'' said Christopher Marino Jr., the general manager of Roman Builders in Slidell, La., north of New Orleans. ''And after the storm, City Hall unlocked the doors at 8 a.m., and there'd be a line just to get into the elevator.'' Mr. Marino, whose company was based in New Orleans before Katrina, said he hired an employee just to sit in line for permits. ''Now, instead of paying someone to do that for eight hours a week, I have to have someone do it for maybe three hours a month,'' he said.
 Homeowners get another break from the new system, Mr. Marino said. Permits for a $90,000 renovation cost contractors about $500, whereas homeowners get them free, which is a posthurricane policy. ''So they can get it themselves and not get aggravated at me because they think I'm overcharging,'' Mr. Marino said. ''It helps me get jobs.''
 Paul W. Taylor, the chief strategy officer for the Center for Digital Government, a consultant firm in Folsom, Calif., said most of the strides made in business-to-government transactions have been in construction, as cities have tried to serve companies supporting the housing boom. 
 Over the last two years, in particular, Mr. Taylor said, governments have set up systems in which builders can communicate with city inspectors through wireless Internet devices to process and check the status of field inspection requests. 
 ''That's allowed a huge amount of time and money savings for the building trades, and by extension, homeowners,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Plus, there's nary a complaint from inspectors being able to spend more time in the field, rather than going back and forth to their computers handling these kinds of requests.''
 Many cities have also moved the licensing and renewal process online, helping new companies determine which agencies require which licenses, and allowing executives to enter their information once, and feed it to the relevant agencies.
 ''Now these people can actually focus on running their businesses, instead of having to call or travel around to get all the relevant paperwork done,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 E-commerce companies that build government-related applications said that their services were growing more complex, as municipal technology leaders responded better to their business constituency.
 ''Businesses have really been driven by their experiences with companies like FedEx, U.P.S. and Amazon,'' said Maury Blackman, a senior vice president of Accela, which produces software for government agencies, including the inspection software used in New Orleans. ''Just like customers of those companies can see where their packages are at any given moment, businesses want to know exactly whose desk their application is sitting on in City Hall.''
 Mr. Blackman said that his company was working on systems that would help agencies simultaneously review architectural plans online, rather than circulating physical plans. The paper-shuffling now takes about six months. ''We believe we can get that down to two months by collaborating online,'' he said.
 Mr. Taylor of the Center for Digital Government said that word spreads quickly once a city agency cuts costs or serves businesses more efficiently online. ''Digital government is one of those fast-following spaces,'' he said.
 Which puts Mr. Meffert of New Orleans in the geek spotlight in a city not known for technology wizardry.
 ''It's pretty wild getting e-mails from some superhigh-tech cities asking me how we did that, then realizing, 'Wait a minute, I didn't have roads a few months ago,' '' Mr. Meffert said. ''But it's human nature. A lot of times you don't innovate unless you're forced to, and city halls typically have the luxury of not being forced to innovate.''

HEADLINE: Software Out There

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
THE Internet is entering its Lego era. 
 Indeed, blocks of interchangeable software components are proliferating on the Web and developers are joining them together to create a potentially infinite array of useful new programs. This new software represents a marked departure from the inflexible, at times unwieldy, programs of the past, which were designed to run on individual computers.
As a result, computer industry innovation is rapidly becoming decentralized. In the place of large, intricate and self-contained programs like Microsoft Word, written and maintained by armies of programmers, smaller companies, with just a handful of developers, are now producing pioneering software and Web-based services. These new services can be delivered directly to PC's or even to cellphones. Bigger companies are taking note.
 For example, Google last month bought Writely, a Web-based word-processing program created by three Silicon Valley programmers. Eric Schmidt, the Google chief executive, said that Google did not buy the program to compete against Microsoft Word. Rather, he said, it viewed Writely as a key component in hundreds of products it is now developing. 
 These days, there are inexpensive or free software components speeding the process. Amazon recently introduced an online storage service called S3, which offers data storage for a monthly fee of 15 cents a gigabyte. That frees a programmer building a new application or service on the Internet from having to create a potentially costly data storage system.
 Google now offers eight programmable components -- elements that other programmers can turn into new Web services -- including Web search, maps, chat and advertising. Yahoo offers a competing lineup of programmable services, including financial information and photo storage. Microsoft has followed quickly with its own offerings through its new Windows Live Web service. 
 Smaller companies are also beginning to share their technology with outside programmers to leverage their competitive positions. Salesforce.com, a fast-growing company that until recently simply offered a Web-based support application for sales personnel, published standards for interconnecting to its software not too long ago. That made it possible for developers inside and outside the company to add powerful abilities to its core products and create new ones from scratch.
 One result is that sales representatives using Salesforce's customer relationship management software to organize their workday can now make telephone calls using Skype, the popular Internet service, without leaving the Salesforce software.
 The idea of modular software, where standard components can be easily linked together to build more elaborate systems, first emerged in Europe during the 1960's and spread to Silicon Valley in the 70's. 
 Despite its promise, however, modular software has generally been limited by corporate strategies that have held customers and other programmers hostage to proprietary systems. 
 Those limitations have eased almost overnight, mostly because of the open-source software movement, which promotes making information available to everyone.
 The shift toward sharing, which in its grandest conception has been termed Web 2.0, has touched off a frenzy of software design and start-up activity not seen since the demise of the dot-com era six years ago.
 ''These tools are changing the basic core economics of software development,'' said Tim Bray, director of Web technologies at Sun Microsystems and one of the designers of a powerful set of Internet conventions known as Extensible Markup Language, or XML, which make it simple and efficient to exchange digital data over the Internet.
 By lowering the cost of software development and thus the barriers to entering both existing and new markets, modular software is putting tremendous pressure on the corporations that have dominated the software industry. 
 It is also affecting Silicon Valley's venture capitalists. Start-ups have begun to bypass the venture capital firms, relying instead on individual investors, called ''angels,'' or out-of-pocket financing, largely because new ventures are not as expensive.
 In many cases, the start-ups do not even require the traditional Silicon Valley garage. The new companies are ''virtual,'' and programmers work from home, relying on nothing more than a personal computer and a broadband Internet connection.
 Early examples of the trend were tiny companies with significant ideas, like the consumer Internet software start-ups Flickr, a Web-based photo-sharing site, and Del.icio.us, which makes it possible for Web surfers to categorize and share things they find on the Internet. Both were acquired last year by Yahoo.
 For some, the new era of lightweight, lightning-fast software design is akin to a guerrilla movement rattling the walls of stodgy corporate development organizations.
 ''They stole our revolution and now we're stealing it back and selling it to Yahoo,'' said Bruce Sterling, an author and Internet commentator.
 Even more striking is the suggestion that a broad transformation of software development might reverse the trend of outsourcing to India, where highly skilled but low-paid programmers are plentiful.
 ''Transforming the economics of software development completely transforms the rationales for outsourcing,'' Michael Schrage, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher, wrote in the current issue of CIO magazine.
 The new economics of software development poses a fresh challenge to the dominant players in the industry. In 1995, when Microsoft realized that the Netscape Internet browser created a threat to its Windows operating system business, it responded by introducing its own free browser, Internet Explorer. By doing so, Microsoft, which already held a monopoly on desktop software, blunted Netscape's momentum.
 Last November, Microsoft introduced a Web services portal called Windows Live and Office Live. 
 But as the world's largest software publisher, it still faces the delicate challenge of creating free Web services. Many of Microsoft's standard PC applications, in the new world of on-demand software, are migrating to the Internet.
 At the Emerging Technologies Conference, held in San Diego last month, Ray Ozzie, one of Microsoft's three chief technical officers, showed a prototype effort that uses the Windows clipboard, which moves data among different desktop PC programs, to perform the same function for copying and transferring Web information.
 Mr. Ozzie, who used the Firefox browser (an open-source rival to Internet Explorer) during his demonstration, said, ''I'm pretty pumped up with the potential for R.S.S. to be the DNA for wiring the Web.''
 He was referring to Really Simple Syndication, an increasingly popular, free standard used for Internet publishing. Mr. Ozzie's statement was remarkable for a chief technical officer whose company has just spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars investing in a proprietary alternative referred to as .Net.
 Moreover, the balance of power is shifting, Mr. Ozzie said. ''For years, vendors like Microsoft have put huge resources into tools to build composite applications,'' he said. ''With mash-ups, the real power becomes the people who can weave the applications together.''
 Microsoft is not the only company threatened by the simple tools of the Web 2.0 movement. Adobe Systems, which recently acquired Macromedia, publisher of the widely used Flash graphics standard, is under pressure from Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a new development technique for creating interactive Web applications that look and function like desktop programs.
 At the technology conference, Adobe showed a bridge between Ajax and Flash, making it possible for Ajax programmers to easily add Flash graphical abilities.
 America Online has made a similar strategic shift by adding a set of ''programmers' hooks'' to its AOL Instant Messaging service to attract independent software developers to connect to its previously proprietary messaging platform.
 Many technologists agree that as software development moves online, the risk will be particularly intense for large software development organizations like I.B.M.'s Global Services, the consulting arm to the company, according to Mr. Bray of Sun.
 I.B.M. is testing a faster development system based on Ajax, Web services and XML, said Rod Smith, the company's vice president for emerging technologies.
 ''We're testing it with customers now to see how disruptive it is,'' he said.
 Mr. Smith acknowledged that the new software development trends present challenges. ''Inside I.B.M., do-it-yourself software is an oxymoron,'' he said.
 Another new idea comes from Amazon, whose Web Services group recently introduced a service called the Mechanical Turk, an homage to an 18th-century chess-playing machine that was actually governed by a hidden human chess player.
 The idea behind the service is to find a simple way to organize and commercialize human brain power.
 ''You can see how this enables massively parallel human computing,'' said Felipe Cabrera, vice president for software development at Amazon Web Services.
 One new start-up, Casting Words, is taking advantage of the Amazon service, known as Mturk, to offer automated transcription using human transcribers for less than half the cost of typical commercial online services.
 Mturk allows vendors to post what it calls ''human intelligence tasks,'' which may vary from simple transcription to identifying objects in photos.
 Amazon takes a 10 percent commission above what a service like Casting Words pays a human transcriber. People who are willing to work as transcribers simply download audio files and then post text files when they have completed the transcription. Casting Words is currently charging 42 cents a minute for the service.
 Other examples are also intriguing. A9, Amazon's search engine, is using Mturk to automate a system for determining the quality of photos, using human checkers. Other companies are using the Web service as a simple mechanism to build polling systems for market research.
 The impact of modular software will certainly accelerate as the Internet becomes more accessible from wireless handsets.
 Scott Rafer, who was formerly the chief executive of Feedster, a Weblog search engine, has recently become chairman of Wireless Ink, a Web-based service that allows wireless users to quickly establish mobile Web sites from anywhere via Web-enabled cellphones.
 Using modular software technologies, they have created a service called WINKsite, which makes it possible to use cellphones to chat, blog, read news and keep a personal calendar. These systems are typically used by young urban professionals who are tied together in loosely affiliated social networks. In London, where cellphone text messaging is nearly ubiquitous, they are used to organize impromptu gatherings at nightclubs.
 Recently, Wireless Ink struck a deal with Metroblogging, a wireless blogging service, to use its technology. Metroblogging, which already has blogs in 43 cities around the world, lets bloggers quickly post first-person accounts of news events like the July 2005 London bombings.
 ''Here are two tiny start-ups in California that care about Karachi and Islamabad,'' Mr. Rafer said. ''It's weird, I'll grant you, but it is becoming increasingly common.''

HEADLINE: Government Debt in State Is Figured at $227 Billion

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 4 

 BODY:
New York State and local governments and their public authorities are circumventing the voters in amassing debt that now amounts to nearly a quarter-trillion dollars, according to a report issued on Tuesday examining public borrowing in New York. 
 The report by the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy group, presents an exhaustive overview of the extent of borrowing by New York State, its 583 public authorities and its local governments. Legislators have come under withering criticism for passing a budget last week that would more than double the new debt proposed over the next two years by Gov. George E. Pataki. 
The report says the state is already borrowing beyond its means. In another recent analysis, the commission said that New York had the third-highest debt of any state relative to its revenues, trailing only Massachusetts and Hawaii. 
 Most of New York's new debt is issued through public authorities, a practice that is the subject of wide criticism because it allows political leaders to avoid going to voters to approve new borrowing plans, as is required under the state Constitution.
 Of the $227 billion in public debt tallied by the commission, $45 billion is to be paid off directly by state revenue and $86 billion by local governments, including $52 billion by New York City. In addition, $56 billion is to be paid from the revenue from specific projects, such as tolls from bridges. And $40 billion more comes from debt issues on behalf of private entities, including universities or hospitals.
 Asked about the report on Tuesday, Mr. Pataki focused on the Legislature's borrowing plans. 
 ''I'm very concerned about the level of borrowing, state debt in the legislative budget, and that's one of the areas that we think should be addressed,'' Mr. Pataki said in a news conference in Albany. Under Mr. Pataki's budget proposal, state-supported debt would rise to $51.6 billion by the fiscal year ending in March 2008, although lawmakers want to add nearly $5 billion to that amount.
 Legislative leaders have argued that the debt in their proposal is higher because they are responding to court orders to pump billions of dollars of new money into New York City schools, but that Mr. Pataki has not done so. 
 Mr. Pataki has also proposed extending New York's borrowing reach abroad. In his January executive budget proposal, he authorized the state's Dormitory Authority to issue bonds to help finance an expansion of Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem in Jerusalem, where Ariel Sharon is being treated. 
 The State Legislature rejected the proposal in its own budget, which it submitted to the governor last week. The Pataki administration and legislative leaders are now negotiating their differences in the overall budget.
 The Citizens Budget Commission report recommends overhauling the constitutional limits on state- and city-supported debt so that state leaders do not feel compelled to go around the voters when seeking to borrow more. The report also proposes a number of steps to make public authorities more transparent and prudent in their borrowing. 
 ''We're using and misusing authorities to borrow,'' said Charles M. Brecher, the research director of the Citizens Budget Commission and a professor at New York University. ''Clearly we need to fix the misuses.'' 
 Many political leaders reject the idea that the state is borrowing beyond its means.
 In comments to reporters on Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, cited the state's improving credit rating, which has been upgraded several times in recent years, as proof of prudent fiscal management. 
 ''Would you report please that the state has never enjoyed a higher bond rating then it presently has today,'' he said. ''The experts that rate the state and what we do and how we do it think the state is doing the best job that's ever been done. Would you report that? Would that be a headline tomorrow? It's never been better.''
 Mr. Brecher said credit ratings were not necessarily the best measure of the state's ability to handle its debt. 
 ''They're telling people how likely you are to get your money back if you buy this bond,'' he said of the credit rating agencies. ''The state has done things to increase the likelihood of that. They dedicate a specific tax and say we're going to pay the bondholders back with this money before we turn it over to the general fund. 
 ''What it doesn't say is that if you have a lot of debt, you have less money to pay for schools, health care, and all the other things that the state wants to do,'' he said.
 In a separate report on Tuesday, New York City's Independent Budget Office said the city's economic base was expanding at a faster rate than the growth in its outstanding debt.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Yonkers: Council Approves Downtown Development 

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
The City Council unanimously approved an agreement last night that would kick-start a $3.1 billion plan to revitalize downtown's depressed business district and redevelop 400 acres in West Yonkers, including four miles of riverfront. The agreement gives three real estate developers exclusive rights to draw up a master plan for the project, which includes stores, apartments, offices, a movie theater and a minor-league baseball stadium. Mayor Philip A. Amicone and the developers signed the agreement on Feb. 2, but the plan could not go forward without the Council's approval. The vote came after the Council and the developers agreed to revisit the sales prices assigned to city-owned properties within the boundaries of the project. FERNANDA SANTOS (NYT)

HEADLINE: Lowly Status of Women In a Land Struggling to Rise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

Kabul in Winter
Life Without Peace in Afghanistan
By Ann Jones
Illustrated. Metropolitan Books. 321 pages. $24.
 In December 2002, Ann Jones flew to Afghanistan and volunteered her services to a small charity. It was a year after the United States, in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden, had ended its high-altitude bombing of the countryside. ''Somehow I felt obliged to try to help pick up the pieces,'' writes Ms. Jones, a journalist and the author of ''Women Who Kill.'' That job, she quickly learned, was impossible, for reasons she itemizes in this furious polemic. There were too many pieces, too many warring factions, too many agendas, too much bad faith and too little money.
''Kabul in Winter'' is three things at once. It is, in its own way, a travel book. Ms. Jones, a keen observer, captures her surroundings in crisp vignettes, some appalling, others quite comic, like her description of a senseless melee on the street in Kabul, or the manic protocols of Afghan drivers. The humor is mordant. This is a country whose main English-language guidebook cheerily informs its readers: ''There is a lot to see in the city, even if most of it is wrecked.'' 
 ''Kabul in Winter'' is also a work of impassioned reportage, a sympathetic observer's damage assessment of a country torn apart by warlords, religious fanatics and ill-advised superpower conflicts dating back more than a century. Ms. Jones pays special attention to the condition of Afghan women, visiting them and talking with them in their homes, in the schools (where, for a time, she teaches English instructors) and in the prisons. 
 Last and least, ''Kabul in Winter'' is a diatribe, a barely coherent rant directed at President Bush (sneeringly designated, far too many times, as Bush the Lesser) and a host of other actors, both domestic and international. Ms. Jones comes loaded with so much ammunition that by the time she stops blazing away, there's no one left standing. Aid organizations, journalists, warlords, the mujahedeen, the Taliban, President Hamid Karzai, the British, the Russians, Afghan men, development experts, contractors, the World Bank and the Agency for International Development -- all earn her withering scorn. 
 Ms. Jones starts from a political position that many readers will distrust. She views the United States as an imperialist power bent on shaping the world to its narrow interests and, with malice aforethought, imposing free-market economics on the oppressed peoples of the world. She considers the hunt for Mr. Bin Laden a foolish adventure and, although she does not say so outright, seems to regard his criticisms of American foreign policy as quite sensible. 
 On the big picture, then, Ms. Jones offers a fairly predictable catalog of abuse. But as an observer and analyst of Afghan society, and of the multiple problems bedeviling it, she can be eloquent and persuasive. Above all, she is a compassionate voice for the plight of Afghan women, who, on her evidence, will have to make enormous strides to move from miserable to merely abject.
 Ms. Jones visits the obstetrics ward of a hospital where midwives, to speed a difficult birth along, resort to beating the mother and showering her with curses. The mother, if she is lucky, will give birth to a son. Women in Afghanistan have no value other than their bride price, which poor families hurry to collect as soon as possible. (When Ms. Jones tries to explain the concept of a blind date to her language students, one says, ''Like my wedding.'') A friend tells Ms. Jones that her cousin has recently given birth to a baby girl, who is fat and happy, although the mother, ''of course,'' is sad. Her husband has not spoken to her except to say, ''If you do this to me again, I will kill you.''
 Wife-beating is universal. Many young women, in despair at being married off to a man they fear or loathe, douse themselves with gasoline and light a match. The hospitals in Afghanistan are filled with such cases. When a woman brings shame on her family for any reason -- the reasons can be many and, by Western standards, trivial -- suicide is the only option. Most discouragingly, Ms. Jones found, women themselves see nothing particularly wrong with this arrangement. 
 Afghans created this social structure all by themselves. But the West has plenty to answer for in other areas. Most frustrating of all is the evil born of good intentions. Ms. Jones, in her search for housing, quickly discovers that the stampede of international relief organizations, who buy up the best apartment blocks, has created a negative trickle-down effect. As real estate prices go up, residents at each step of the economic ladder drop by one rung. 
 Western aid organizations pay high salaries, by Afghan standards, distorting the local economy. Teachers, doctors and other desperately needed professionals prefer to work as drivers, interpreters or messengers for Western companies, whose missions overlap or duplicate one another, and whose thinking tends to be overly ambitious and unrealistically short-term. Just a few schools, built at minimal cost, might make more of a difference than the current goal of attaining universal literacy, Ms. Jones argues.
 Afghans keep hearing about international support and a torrent of foreign aid, but with no electricity, few roads, houses reduced to rubble and overcrowded classrooms (where the old jihadist-inspired textbooks are still in use), they have begun to wonder where the money is. Nostalgia for the days of Soviet occupation is growing, Ms. Jones writes. The Soviets, at least, put up some apartment buildings.
 Ms. Jones learns to cherish small gains. Rosemary Stasek, a Democratic City Council member from Mountain View, Calif., breezes into Kabul with $5,000 in donations from her constituents and in two weeks renovates the five main rooms of a women's prison. The author herself is also responsible for changing the equation, if only by the merest fraction. Despite hardships and setbacks, she gets her students, all high school English teachers who can barely speak English, to forget the rote method of learning and start to talk. This, she writes, ''was to be my personal response to 9/11 and my tiny contribution to the recovery of Afghanistan.'' It's something, in a country that has nothing.

HEADLINE: A City Office Will Open To Support Arts Groups 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday that the city would create a new office to ''aggressively pitch New York City around the world as the nation's art and cultural capital'' by helping nonprofit organizations, especially those in the arts, cope with the high costs that threaten their survival. 
 ''We won't and can't be complacent,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that he was determined not to cede New York's status as a world cultural center. ''In the creative sector, as in so many other areas, at one time New York City didn't have to compete with other cities,'' he said at a conference at the Museum of Modern Art that brought together 220 officials, artists, business people and academics. ''Now we do. Other cities are quickly learning the benefits of being a creative hub.'' 
The daunting challenges facing artists hoping to thrive in New York were underscored by one participant at the conference, Creative New York. The choreographer Bill T. Jones said that it was meaningless to talk about ''creative capital'' without first addressing the decline in support for arts groups and the precarious existence of individual artists.
 ''You don't make a damn cent in dance,'' he said. ''So when I'm asked to be on this panel and asked to be part of the new economic engine of New York City -- are we serious?''
 His dancers ''are real depressed; I would dare say they are despairing,'' he said. ''And that made me feel very sad, and, I dare say, angry.'' 
 The new office, which will include at least two employees and be part of the city's Economic Development Corporation, represents a recognition that skyrocketing rents have made it much harder for smaller arts groups to flourish. It will help such groups navigate the real-estate market, obtain technical advice and attract financing. 
 The conference was intended as a response to a report in December that described the ''creative sector'' -- defined broadly to include advertising, publishing and broadcasting as well as the arts -- as a critical element of the city's economy. The Partnership for New York City, an alliance of business leaders, organized the conference, along with the city, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Center for an Urban Future, a Manhattan-based research organization that prepared the report with help from the consulting firm Mt. Auburn Associates.
 ''This is our competitive advantage, and we are losing it,'' said Robin J. Keegan, a research fellow at the Center for an Urban Future and co-author of the report. 
 While many conference participants offered suggestions for maintaining the city's cultural edge, an equal number provided a grim diagnosis of the city's prospects for remaining at the vanguard of global cultural production.
 There was little agreement about the exact nature of the problem. Some said that globalization added challenges to the city's future as a cultural hub. 
 ''We're moving into a world where everybody in the world will have access to the best of everything, at the touch of a button,'' said Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director at Carnegie Hall. ''From the point of view of culture, it makes it all the more important that everything we do here in New York City be the very best and most extraordinary.''
 Barry Diller, a leading media investor and the chief executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp, said India, China and South Korea were now the true hotbeds of creativity because of their governmental support for technological investments. ''New York's ability on into the future to remain the communications capital is really questionable,'' he said. 
 Other speakers focused on the local problems facing creative workers. 
 Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's, said that because once-bohemian neighborhoods were no longer affordable, ''what is vital is to make sure that our transportation system is effective,'' so creative workers who have been priced out of Manhattan can still reach their jobs and even form new communities of artistic ferment. 
 James Schamus, a co-president of Focus Features and a producer of the film ''Brokeback Mountain,'' said that since 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, the tighter restrictions on entering the United States have made New York seem less hospitable to international artists. Widely reported abuses of American-held prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba and elsewhere have also taken their toll, he said. ''Water-boarding your potential clients is really not good for the culture,'' he said, referring to a form of torture, and he received scattered if nervous applause. 
 Mr. Diller seemed swayed by some of those arguments. ''We're certainly not an inviting place that greets people with a big happy smile to come into the melting pot,'' he said.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, told the gathering that New York City had lost 894,000 residents from 2000 to 2004 and that those who left were in general better educated than those who remained. ''We're constantly having to replenish our supply of people who power this city, particularly creative people,'' he said.
 Cities in Europe and Asia are ''stealing our cultural institutions,'' he said, adding, ''We've got to stay ahead of the pack.'' 
 The new office will be similar to those that already exist for the financial, media, real estate, biotechnology and retail industries. According to Andrew M. Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation, the entire nonprofit sector accounts for 720,000 jobs in the city, or roughly a fifth of the work force, and the number of nonprofit employers, now 40,000, grew by 57 percent from 1990 to 2002. The office will try to help nonprofit groups secure low-interest or tax-exempt loans through the city's Industrial Development Agency, he said.

HEADLINE: Lifting Rates in '00, Fed Knew of Market Risk

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
In May 2000, the Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate by the most in five years, even as its chief forecaster warned of the economic consequences of a possible stock market collapse. 
 ''What lies ahead is certainly less attractive than the landscape of the past few years,'' Michael Prell, former head of the Fed's research and statistics division, said in a May meeting on interest rates, according to transcripts for 2000, which were released yesterday in Washington.
The record of exchanges between Alan Greenspan, then Fed chairman, and his colleagues provides a window into the Fed's thinking as central bankers tried to slow an economy that had grown by more than 4 percent for three consecutive years. The transcripts show Fed officials grappling with how to raise interest rates without putting too many people out of work or threatening the stock market.
 ''When we've attempted to apply the brakes in past expansions, we generally ended up skidding into a ditch,'' Mr. Prell said at the May 2000 meeting. Mr. Prell also said that ''in the current cycle, there would seem to be a risk of a particularly large decline in the market, given that, by many conventional metrics, we experienced a speculative bubble of extraordinary proportions.'' Mr. Prell is now a private consultant.
 The Fed raised its benchmark rate by half a percentage point at that time, to 6.5 percent, the sixth increase in eight meetings.
 By March 2001, the economy was in recession after a 64 percent decline in the Nasdaq composite index and a 25 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the previous 12 months, and the Fed was cutting rates at the fastest pace in Mr. Greenspan's tenure.
 In December 2000, after data showed that the economy had expanded in the third quarter at the slowest pace in four years, Fed policy makers began to openly debate whether the economy would slide into a recession. 
 The Fed's rate committee voted unanimously that month to say that ''economic weakness'' was now a bigger threat than inflation, a signal that a rate reduction would come soon.
 The Fed's response to the stock market bubble is still a topic of debate.
 Mr. Greenspan has said on several occasions that the Fed should cushion the effect of bubbles rather than pop them and risk wider damage to the economy. The current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, shares that view.
 The Fed publishes its transcripts with a five-year lag. A policy statement is released immediately after the end of each rate meeting and minutes of those meetings, which summarize the discussion, are released about three weeks later.

HEADLINE: In Bid to Rebuild Razed Bridge, Recovery and War Vie in Iraq

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: HUSAYBA, Iraq, April 2 

 BODY:
Last August, under daily attack from car bombs and mortars, the Marines took down the only bridge over the Euphrates River for miles around.
 Now they are trying to rebuild it.
With the bridge down, marines say, insurgents and foreign fighters can no longer infiltrate as easily into this town near the Syrian border in western Anbar Province, the heavily Sunni Arab area that has formed the heart of the insurgency. But Iraqis who live on the river's northern bank grumble that they have no easy way to get to town to buy and sell goods or to see the doctor.
 ''The biggest complaint I hear is that we took down the bridge,'' said Lt. Col. Nick Marano, commander of the Marine battalion here. ''We have to replace it and we will.''
 The shifting priorities illustrate the trade-off between combat and reconstruction that the American military is still grappling with, but especially in remote regions like this one, where the Iraqi government is still almost nonexistent. 
 The Marines' effort is also a test of the Bush administration's declaration that it will focus this year on holding and rebuilding Iraqi towns, rather than departing after military operations and allowing insurgents to return.
 Though the orders from Washington are to clear, hold and build, accomplishing that on the ground is proving difficult. 
 The centerpiece of the nationwide effort, announced by the State Department last year, was supposed to be 18 provincial reconstruction teams in cities and towns around the country. But security conditions have limited the number created to only four so far, in Hilla, Mosul, Kirkuk and Baghdad, although two more are scheduled to open in about a month. 
 [In Washington on Wednesday, a senior United States government official attributed the delay in expanding the program to reluctance by the American military to take on additional duties guarding the provincial reconstruction teams and their headquarters in the field. ''One can understand that, that they want to focus on their own principal duties, which are in war fighting,'' the official said. ''So the program has had a lot of growing pains.'']
 In Husayba, the Marines are the only reconstruction team around. They use local labor as much as possible, but Colonel Marano is not sure he will be able to find a company that can handle the work.
 In addition, the bridge project has not been budgeted by the provincial government, several marines said. 
 Hoping for an interim fix, Colonel Marano inquired recently about moving a little-used pontoon bridge installed by Army engineers miles down river. He was told that the unit was to rotate back to the United States soon, and would be taking its bridge back.
 For now, small boats ferry residents across the river. 
 Another major project -- to rebuild the Iraqi customs building at the border crossing with Syria, which was destroyed by three car bombs in a huge explosion last year -- won't begin until June or July. Trade with Syria, both legal and illegal, has long been the mainstay of the economy here, and Colonel Marano said the 17 Sunni sheiks in the area lobby him constantly to reopen the crossing. 
 Colonel Marano said he was spending $14 million on smaller projects around the region, fixing roads and schools, removing rubble and installing water treatment facilities. He said he told the sheiks, some of whom aided the insurgents last year, that they would see an economic payoff if they demonstrated their loyalty. 
 ''I have told them it's a performance-based relationship,'' he said. ''As long as the security situation remains good we will work the infrastructure improvements and provide jobs for their tribes.'' 
 He added, ''The moment there's an attack against marines or Iraqi soldiers, I expect them to provide intelligence about who did it.''
 Last year, American commanders were describing Husayba and several neighboring towns, known as the Qaim region, as a major insurgent haven. Some of them were foreign fighters who crossed over the Syrian border, but others were Iraqis who had been forced out of Falluja and other cities closer to Baghdad and taken refuge here, he said.
 Husayba then ''was like a Wild West border town,'' recalled Lt. Evan Lopez, who was stationed here on his first Iraq tour in 2004 and 2005 and is now back. Insurgents lobbed mortar shells and rockets every night at the small Marine outpost. Patrols were attacked so regularly by roadside bombs and sniper fire that they were eventually abandoned, he said.
 With the American forces stretched thin throughout western Iraq, it was not until last November that 2,500 marines, along with Army units, mounted an operation to clear the city. 
 Most of the town's residents had fled, their houses taken over by insurgents, some of whom fought back fiercely, marines say. The Marines estimated that they killed 250 fighters in the 18-day operation. 
 Col. W. Blake Crowe, the senior Marine commander for the region, said the operations had reduced the flow of foreign fighters crossing from Syria to a ''trickle.'' But he said insurgents had shifted their operations to towns along the Euphrates River closer to Baghdad, including Haditha.
 With Husayba largely cleared of insurgents, ''Haditha's really the hub'' of insurgent activity in western al Anbar now, he said.
 But keeping a large presence along the border here has that meant Colonel Crowe's other forces -- two Marine battalions and a portion of an Army Stryker brigade -- are stretched thin trying to cover Haditha and other areas in western Anbar province. Even with increasing numbers of Iraqi troops, Colonel Crowe said his regiment lacked the manpower to cover the 40,000 square miles is his area. In January he ordered a 20-foot-high berm built around the desert town of Rutba, to limit access to the remote haven for smugglers and free troops for operations elsewhere.
 Rather than clearing Husayba and leaving, the Marines have left an entire battalion in the area, and the Iraqi Army has blanketed the town with troops. Three Iraqi battalions are also stationed in the area, part of a recently formed division that was deployed in Anbar last October.
 To soothe local sensibilities, the officers are largely Sunni Arabs from the Qaim area, and the unit's commander says his soldiers are 27 percent Sunni -- one of the highest percentages in the largely Shiite Iraqi Army.
 ''We have the sheiks of the area on our side, and most of the people are tired of the insurgents,'' said Colonel Ishmael, the Iraqi commander, who declined to give his full name. His Marine adviser says the colonel and his family have been threatened for cooperating with the Americans.
 Husayba itself is slowly coming back to life. Tucked between the vegetable stands and metal shops along the town's main street is a freshly painted police station, which has been refurbished with American funds after it was attacked by insurgents.
 Many stores remain closed, though. Rebuilding the bridge and opening the border, if those projects can be completed before the battalion rotates home in September, ''will be two of the most important things we do here,'' says Colonel Marano.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Strike Immigration Deal

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5 

 BODY:
A group of Senate Republicans reached agreement Wednesday night on a compromise proposal that they hope can garner bipartisan support and bring passage of a bill on the future of the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants.
 The compromise, which followed a day of negotiations, was endorsed by Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader. But it did not have the commitment of all Republicans, much less Democrats who have backed an approach that would put nearly all illegal immigrants on a path toward citizenship.
As outlined by Senate Republicans late Wednesday, the compromise would place illegal immigrants in three categories: 
 Those who have lived in the country at least five years would be put on a path toward guaranteed citizenship, provided that they remained employed, paid fines and back taxes, and learned English, a senior Republican aide said. The aide said this group accounted for about 7 million of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants believed to be living here. 
 Those who have lived here for two to five years, said to number about three million, would have to leave the country briefly before reporting to an American port of entry, where they would be classified as temporary workers. They would be allowed to apply for citizenship but would have no guarantee of obtaining it. Those who did not would have to leave after participating in the temporary worker program for six years.
 The remaining one million or so, those who have lived in the country less than two years, would be required to leave. They could apply for temporary worker status but would not be guaranteed it.
 Senators of both parties and their aides huddled in meetings throughout the day, trying to hash out a deal by week's end, the deadline set by Mr. Frist for a vote on an immigration bill. For the first time, senior Democrats, including Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, joined in the negotiations, an acknowledgment that they lacked the backing to get a vote on broader legalization.
 The Senate will decide on Friday whether the compromise should be considered for a vote. But lawmakers, who gave impassioned partisan speeches on the floor, remained deadlocked over its details late Wednesday. Senators warned that if the negotiations collapsed, Congress might fail to take action this year on an issue that has riveted the nation and pushed tens of thousands of immigrants and their supporters into the streets for rallies across the country.
 Mr. Frist placed blame for the stalemate on Democrats, who refused to allow Republicans to vote on major amendments and have used a parliamentary tactic that will force lawmakers to decide Thursday whether the bill more favorable to illegal immigrants should be considered for a floor vote. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, blamed the Republicans, saying they had continued to ''stonewall'' by seeking to pass amendments that would gut that broad legalization bill, approved by the Judiciary Committee last week with bipartisan support.
 As the party leaders pointed fingers, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, rose on the floor and pleaded with his colleagues to come together to prevent a rare opportunity from slipping away.
 ''This is one of the greatest challenges we face in our time, securing our borders, taking 11 million people out of the shadows who are exploited every day, fulfilling the job requirements we all know are necessary to ensure the economic future,'' Mr. McCain said.
 ''Americans are passionate in general,'' he said, ''but this issue has brought passion few of us have seen in this country -- in Los Angeles, New York City and around the nation. It seems we owe every American a resolution to this issue. Could we please move forward?''
 President Bush, who met with Republican Congressional leaders on Wednesday, also pressed the Senate to move ahead. ''I strongly urge them to come to a conclusion as quickly as possible and pass a comprehensive bill,'' the president said.
 Republicans said the compromise, whose prominent backers include Mr. McCain and Senators Mel Martinez of Florida and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, would attract votes from their members who are uncomfortable with broader legalization. But the compromise cannot pass without the support of Democrats, who said they were still weighing their options.
 ''Aren't we entitled to at least a chance to have a vote on a comprehensive approach?'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 There were signs, though, that some of Mr. Kennedy's allies among business and immigrant advocacy groups were throwing their support behind the compromise proposal.
 The leaders of the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, which represents hotels, restaurants and other service industries, said a limited legalization would be better than a bill that focused solely on tightening border security.

HEADLINE: Stop: Don't Test Those Cows!

 BODY:
Late last month, Creekstone Farms, a Kansas-based beef company, sued the United States Department of Agriculture. The reason? Creekstone wants to use tests for mad cow disease on all of the cattle it slaughters, and the U.S.D.A. won't let it. 
 In contrast, the U.S.D.A.'s testing program for mad cow disease tests only high-risk cattle -- those that die on the farm, can't walk or are obviously sick. In other words, the department tests about 1 percent of the 35 million cattle that are slaughtered in this country every year. It believes, based on its statistical models, that testing 1 percent is plenty. We disagree.
Why would the U.S.D.A. stop a cattle company from voluntarily meeting a higher standard than the one required by law? The very idea sounds counterintuitive. But then so does the agency's rationale. The U.S.D.A. argues that 100 percent testing would not guarantee food safety because mad cow disease can be hard to detect in younger cattle -- the very cows that a premium beef company like Creekstone is most likely to slaughter. 
 To us, this sounds like nonsense -- as if we were more likely to be safe by following a testing plan based on statistical modeling of the beef supply than by actually testing all the cattle.
 We agree that private testing is not the way to go in the long run. It wouldn't make much sense to have a national system made up of a few large producers that tested all their cattle while only 1 percent of everyone else's were tested. But there is a simple solution for that. 
 The U.S.D.A. should test every cow that goes to slaughter. The cost is not prohibitive. Fear is the problem. The current testing program for mad cow disease is intended to produce, at best, a snapshot of the likelihood of the disease. The program rests on assumptions that reflect, as assumptions tend to do, only what we know already, and we do not know nearly enough about mad cow disease.
 The fear is that broad testing may reveal a higher rate of infection and destroy consumer confidence, with a devastating impact on the cattle market. Which leaves us where we are now: relying on what we don't know to make us feel safe.

HEADLINE: Clashes Steer Kurds and Turkey Back on a Rocky Path

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, April 5 

 BODY:
Violent clashes between Kurds and security forces in Turkey over the past week have jolted memories here back to an old conflict that remains a dangerous barrier on the nation's path toward greater prosperity and democracy. 
 After a decade of calm, at least 15 people have been killed in protests in recent days, most in the guerrilla battleground of the Kurdish southeast, but some in cosmopolitan Istanbul. Among the dead were a 6-year-old boy and a 78-year-old man, Halit Sogut, whose relatives asked on Tuesday how such violence was still possible in a nation that considered its rightful place to be as a member of the European Union.
''In France, a million and seven hundred thousand people were in the streets,'' said a nephew, Devrim, 25, referring to the mass protests in France over employment contracts. ''And no one got a nosebleed.'' He predicted that the protests here would continue until Turkey finally granted full rights to its Kurdish minority. 
 A guerrilla insurgency in southern Turkey over Kurdish rights killed more than 30,000 people during the 1980's. After years of relative peace, Kurds seem conflicted over whether they should return to the use of violence if continued pressure by the European Union over the prospect of Turkey's membership might bring change more peacefully. 
 The roots of the current protests are complicated, primed slowly by low-level incidents in the past two years after the Kurdistan Workers' Party called off a unilateral cease-fire that began in 1999. Then, last week, on Tuesday, funerals here for 14 members of the party killed in combat with Turkish soldiers the previous weekend swelled into large protests, and last Wednesday they turned violent. 
 ''I neither want state terror, nor terror of any kind,'' said one of Mr. Sogut's relatives, who would not give his full name because he is a public employee, and talking politics could cause him trouble. ''More than 30,000 people died. This is enough. There should be a solution.''
 His comments seemed to reflect a quiet questioning among many Kurds of the relevance and tactics of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Some experts see the current protests as a way for the group to try to create a role for itself as political and economic changes continue in Turkey, including some concessions to Kurds.
 In recent years, and largely under European pressure, the government lifted emergency rule in the southeast, began compensating Kurds for losses when Turkish troops razed villages and granted other cultural rights to the Kurds. 
 Many Kurds here complain, however, that this has not been enough, considering the low wages, high unemployment and lack of foreign investment in the southeast. The Kurds' frustration exploded in the protests that began here last week.
 ''So many promises were made and not fulfilled,'' said Cihan Sincar, the mayor of Kiziltepe, near the Syrian border, where two protesters were killed over the weekend. 
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has at least acknowledged the problems Kurds face, something that past prime ministers have been reluctant to do. In confronting the current crisis, his government's approach has been to offer hope to Kurds not eager for a resumption of the rebel group's violence. 
 ''While they try to capitalize on hatred and enmity, we will build more roads, more hospitals, more schools and more workplaces'' in Kurdish areas, Mr. Erdogan told the Parliament on Tuesday. ''We will bring more freedoms, more democracy, more welfare, more rights and justice.''
 But a more immediate test seems to be whether the government will also engage in heavy-handed tactics against the Kurdistan Workers' Party that could endanger the nation's desire to join the European Union and return Turkey to the violence of a decade ago.
 On Tuesday, the foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, talked about ''a thin line'' in the struggle against terrorism and the need to preserve democracy, even as he pledged to show no mercy for the rebel group.
 At a minimum, there is a sense here that the gains made by Kurds in recent years may have been reversed in a few short days. ''Since 1994, we haven't seen anything like this,'' said Tacettin Bahadiroglu, 32, the owner of a jewelry store in Kiziltepe, as tense, blue-bereted Turkish soldiers in armored personnel carriers set up in front of the regional governor's office on Monday. ''It has pushed us 12 years behind.'' 
 As the protests turned violent, shopkeepers rolled down the shutters of their shops at the urging of a Kurdish satellite station, and gangs of youths began to clash with soldiers. Three people were killed, including Mr. Sogut, whose own family could not agree if he had been a bystander or had joined in the protests. 
 In the following days, the protests spread to the city of Batman to the southeast, where one person was killed, and to Kiziltepe, home to tens of thousand of Kurds displaced by the fighting a decade ago, where two others died. On Sunday, the protests ignited in Istanbul, where protesters hurled homemade firebombs at a bus, and three people were killed, apparently crushed by the bus. 
 By early this week, at least 9 people, and possibly 10, were dead in Diyarbakir. More than 500 people have been detained. 
 On Wednesday officials said five soldiers had been killed, two by a land mine while they were on patrol in the Kurdish region and three in an ambush, Agence France-Presse reported. The report said that a police officer was killed late Tuesday when rebels opened fire on a police station.
 The violence has left a wake of anger and bafflement that Kurds said would not be quickly healed. 
 ''What is going to be our future?'' asked a 27-year-old man who would give only his first name, Tolga, because he took part in the protest. He was among the mourners in Kiziltepe for Mehmet Siddik Onder, who was shot during the demonstration. 
 ''He was only 22 years old,'' Tolga said. ''He was just back from his military service. Where are we going?''
 The regional administrator, Fecri Fikret Celik, who represents the Turkish government in Kiziltepe, said the state had not done enough for Kurds but was genuinely trying, with new roads, four new schools under construction and better services at hospitals. 
 He blamed the rebel group, which he contended had organized the protests for its own reasons. ''What could have been the reason to provoke people?'' he said.
 Sezgin Tanrikulu, a human rights lawyer in Diyarbakir, said he believed that only bold action by both sides could head off more violence, though he said such steps were unlikely soon. The rebels should give up their arms, he said, and the government should develop a more aggressive plan to improve Kurds' lives. ''This is not a random or one-time event,'' he said. ''If we fail to see the graveness of the problem, we will see worse times in the future.''

PERSON: Katie Couric

HEADLINE: Coming Back to Hard News; Katherine Anne Couric

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Katie Couric, who for 15 years has chased the slumber from the minds of the biggest portion of the morning television audience, has attributed her success to being ''ridiculously normal,'' a person others see, as she once put it, ''as someone they could have gone to high school with or someone who works at the desk next to them.''
 Legions of viewers no doubt recall having rejoiced at the birth of Ms. Couric's two daughters, wept at the premature death of her husband and laughed at her early-morning interplay with a rotating cast of regulars on the ''Today'' show on NBC. 
But because her star has been so bright in that role, it has all but obscured the memories of Ms. Couric's start in television as an aggressive, award-winning reporter at local television stations in Miami and Washington, then as an NBC News Pentagon correspondent and reporter in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
 As Ms. Couric, 49, prepares to shift to the anchor post of the ''CBS Evening News,'' she will be moving into a world that for several years has emphasized softer features, something that no doubt played in the minds of the CBS executives determined to recruit Ms. Couric.
 Still, some people in the business agree that it will be her ability to direct and deliver ''hard news'' about war, famine, the ups and downs of world leaders and the economy that will determine whether she is able to move CBS from its longtime spot in last place among the three network newscasts and to attract the younger viewers advertisers covet.
 ''The evening news is quite a different sort of responsibility,'' said Lawrence K. Grossman, a former president of NBC News, whose tenure preceded Ms. Couric's arrival. ''Traditional news anchors have been generals when big news hits, able to mobilize and oversee the coverage and bring the country together somewhat. The test is going to be when we have a Katrina or a 9/11 or some other news event that requires continuing coverage.''
 Others have little doubt that she will succeed. ''The fact is that Katie has covered world news,'' said Connie Chung, who for two years shared the ''Evening News'' anchor duties with Dan Rather. ''She has covered breaking news. She has interviewed presidents, prime ministers, kings and presidential candidates. She's a superb reporter and a superb anchor.''
 Ms. Chung also asserted that the warmth that made Ms. Couric so successful in morning television could serve her best in the evenings and could even cast her more in the role of the reassuring Walter Cronkite than those who followed him as anchors at CBS and elsewhere.
 ''She will bring back what Walter had,'' Ms. Chung said. ''Uncle Walter was a warm person on the air. He expressed joy at the accomplishments of the astronauts in space. He expressed sorrow at Kennedy's death. The anchors we have had have been a bit confined to straitjackets.''
 Ms. Couric came into the ''Today'' job in 1991 under no small set of expectations. Ratings went up almost immediately after she began a two-month stint substituting as co-host for Deborah Norville, who was on maternity leave.
 Ms. Norville, 32 at the time, had been a lightning rod for criticism about younger women forcing older women out of television jobs after she replaced the popular Jane Pauley. Although NBC had previously said Ms. Norville would be back, it reversed course in April 1991 and gave Ms. Couric the job.
 Ms. Couric, 34 at the time, was first introduced to the audience as Katherine Couric, the name she had used in her 12 years as a reporter, editor and producer at ABC News, CNN, NBC and at stations in Miami and Washington. But even on that first day, she was remaking her image.
 After her co-host, Bryant Gumbel, asked her how it sounded to have her name announced at the top of the show, she grabbed her hair in mock frustration and said, ''I still can't decide whether I'm Katherine or Katie.'' 
 Katherine Anne Couric was born and brought up in Arlington, Va., where she was a high school cheerleader. She graduated with honors from the University of Virginia with a degree in American studies. 
 In 1989, she married John Paul Monahan III, a Washington lawyer known as Jay, and after being tapped for the ''Today'' post she and her husband spent considerable time commuting back and forth between Washington and New York. Eventually, he moved to New York and worked as a television legal analyst for NBC News.
 Ms. Couric demonstrated a self-deprecating humor and a penchant for the giggle-filled coffee talk so familiar to the early-morning shows. She reveled in the attention she received after the birth of her daughters, Elinor, who is now 14, and Caroline, now 10. And she expressed thanks for the 10,000 cards and letters she said she received after her husband's death.
 But she has showed that she can handle tough assignments with aplomb and has been unafraid to take certain risks. When Magic Johnson revealed his H.I.V. infection, she used a model of a penis to demonstrate how to use a condom. Two years after her husband's death in 1998 from colon cancer, she took along a camera crew as she underwent a colonoscopy, part of a weeklong ''Today'' segment on the disease. 
 And barely six months after starting in the job, she faced off with David Duke, the former Klansman who was running for governor of Louisiana, in an interview that turned volatile as she confronted him with his earlier statements about race and pressed him to reconcile those statements with his more placid campaign statements. 
 On that day, few people questioned her credentials in reporting the news.

(Mr. Williams is at right.) The winners were announced yesterday by the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia. Other winners included Comedy Central for ''South Park''; the Sci Fi Channel for ''Battlestar Galactica''; FX for ''The Shield''; the Sundance Channel for ''The Staircase,'' an eight-part documentary about a murder case in Durham, N.C.; Martin Scorsese's ''American Masters: No Direction Home -- Bob Dylan'' seen on PBS; the BBC-WGBH Boston co-production of ''Bleak House,'' and HBO's ''Classical Baby,'' ''Children of Beslan'' and ''Yesterday.'' The awards will be presented on June 5 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where Jon Stewart is to be the host.

Eminem Seeks Divorce (Again)
 
 Maybe love isn't better the second time around. Three months after his second marriage to Kimberly Mathers, his high school sweetheart, Eminem, left, filed to divorce her yesterday, The Associated Press reported. The filing by Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, was confirmed by two employees of the Macomb County, Mich., clerk's office and by his press representative, Dennis Dennehy. After two years, the couple's first marriage, in 2001, ended in a bitter legal battle that included a fight over custody of their daughter. They reconciled late in 2004 and remarried in January at a mansion in Rochester Hills, Mich., near Detroit.

Smashed Vase Arrest
 For Nick Flynn, trouble was only beginning, it seems, when he reportedly tripped over his shoelace on a visit to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, tumbled down a staircase and smashed three uninsured 17th-century Chinese porcelain vases valued at $870,000. Yesterday at his home in Fowlmere in southern England, Mr. Williams, 42, who is unemployed after suffering a back injury, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to the Qing dynasty vases, Agence France-Presse reported. A fake sheik who sold a fake Rembrandt has been sentenced to five months in federal prison and five months of home confinement, The Associated Press reported. The man, Majed A. Ihmoud, 53, of St. Charles, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit mail fraud for dressing as a sheik and posing as a member of the Saudi royal family in a scheme to sell a forgery of Rembrandt's ''Man With the Golden Helmet'' for $2.8 million. The buyer turned out to be an undercover F.B.I. agent. The real ''Man With the Golden Helmet'' hangs in the Staatliche museum in Berlin. It, too, is probably a fake. In 1986, art experts concluded that it was painted by an unknown artist in Rembrandt's studio. 

America in London
 The Royal Academy in London has announced plans for ''USA Today,'' a monthlong exhibition of more than 80 new paintings, sculptures and photographs from the Saatchi Gallery collection, opening on Oct. 4 and coinciding with the Frieze Art Fair. The display will focus on world events and America's place in global society, as depicted by more than 30 young contemporary artists, including Americans and others who have moved to the United States.

HEADLINE: Chinese on Buying Trip in U.S. Seek to Pave Way for Leader 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 5 

 BODY:
Chinese leaders, eager to improve relations with the United States ahead of the maiden visit there by President Hu Jintao this month, have dispatched a large delegation of business and economic officials to display China's buying power and to cool protectionist sentiment in Congress, Chinese officials said Wednesday.
 The buying mission, the largest by China since re-establishing diplomatic relations with the United States in 1979, reflects Beijing's view that it may be easier to try to lower economic tensions than to satisfy some other American demands, like doing more to help curtail nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and reducing human rights abuses at home. 
More than 100 business executives joined Wu Yi, China's vice prime minister and economic troubleshooter, on an American tour that began Tuesday in Hawaii and is scheduled to cover 13 states. The trip is expected to result in multibillion-dollar orders for Boeing aircraft, auto parts, computer software, telecommunications equipment, grain, cotton and other products, Chinese officials and the state news media said.
 China has practiced such checkbook diplomacy before, notably during the prolonged fight to win American support for its entry into the World Trade Organization in the late 1990's. But a senior Foreign Ministry official described the latest mission as ''very big,'' and noted that it included representatives from a wide range of state-owned and private businesses who do not typically travel with senior Chinese leaders.
 ''We do want to show the United States that trading ties are mutually beneficial, and we hope people will take notice,'' said the senior Foreign Ministry official, who said he could discuss the matter only if he were not identified by name. ''Our message is that common interests are on the increase, and the basis of the bilateral relationship is being constantly strengthened,'' he said.
 President Hu will visit the United States April 18 through 22 and will visit the White House for the first time since becoming China's Communist Party chief in 2002 and president in 2003. Chinese officials are eager to ensure a positive reception for Mr. Hu and to demonstrate that he can keep China's most delicate diplomatic relationship on an even keel.
 Last year China piled up a $200 billion trade surplus with the United States, a record trade gap for Washington with any one nation. The deficit has prompted Congressional proposals for tariffs on Chinese imports unless Beijing moves faster to raise the value of its currency, the yuan, which some critics say is kept artificially low, giving China's exports an unfair edge in world markets.
 Bush administration officials have said for months that Chinese leaders have been underestimating the surge of anti-China sentiment in Congress and among some influential interest groups. They have pressed Beijing to increase imports from the United States, allow the yuan to appreciate faster and do more to stop rampant violations of American copyrights and trademarks by Chinese companies and government entities.
 China has ruled out sudden shifts in currency policy, insisting it will move steadily, but gradually, toward a market-driven exchange rate.
 Officials here have signaled a willingness to do more to protect intellectual property rights. They have publicized fines imposed on Chinese companies that use pirated software. They have said they may also commit to purchases of American software for government computers. 
 The biggest action is on trade, with China expected to order at least 80 Boeing aircraft, state media have reported. It could also commit to unprecedented purchases of agricultural commodities and telecommunications equipment to upgrade its fixed-line and mobile phone networks.
 The trade delegation, which includes representatives of a dozen government ministries, hopes to establish long-term ties with companies in the American heartland to promote imports in the future, the Foreign Ministry official said. 
 ''We would like to emphasize that this is not a one off,'' the official said.
 The effort to ease trade tensions is being made although Chinese officials and some independent analysts contend the current economic relationship, even with the trade deficit, strongly favors the United States.
 Chinese officials point out that China is now the United States' fourth-largest export market, with United States exports to China expanding at a 21.5 percent annual pace since 2001.
 Officials have cited academic studies showing that if not for inexpensive Chinese goods, American businesses and consumers would pay as much as $100 billion more for such products made elsewhere. They say much of the profit from manufacturing in China goes to American and other foreign companies and patent holders who assemble goods and license technology in China.
 ''The general feeling here is that the trade deficit does not really come at the U.S. expense,'' said Jia Qingguo, a specialist in international relations at Beijing University. ''The U.S. makes money at every stage of Chinese production.''
 But he said China was eager to help President Bush ease protectionist pressures in the United States and improve the atmosphere for discussing more contentious matters.

HEADLINE: 80% of Budget Effectively Off Limits to Cuts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5 

 BODY:
Conservatives look at the federal budget and see out-of-control spending. Liberals look at it and see an effort to eviscerate programs like education and food stamps.
 But as House Republicans struggle this week to pass a budget blueprint, the war of words has obscured a more complicated reality.
Since President Bush took office, overall federal spending has risen 33 percent, twice as fast as under President Bill Clinton and faster than any other president since Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 But the biggest growth has come in areas that Republicans, by and large, have supported, the military, domestic security and the biggest expansion of Medicare in 40 years.
 The military and so-called entitlement programs like Medicare now account for about four-fifths of the government's $2.7 trillion budget, and they are set to keep increasing much faster than inflation or the economy. Given the political realities, they are effectively off limits for now to budget cutters.
 With tax cuts putting a squeeze on government revenues, almost all the battle to shrink the budget deficit is therefore focused on the less than one-fifth of government spending that goes to domestic ''discretionary'' programs like education, scientific research, national parks and space programs.
 Spending on domestic discretionary programs -- the ones that Congress must appropriate money for each year -- climbed 31 percent from 2001 through 2005.
 A result is a pitched battle over tiny corners of budget -- whether to shift $7 billion out of more than $500 billion in military spending into health and education programs -- rather than to attack the broader issues. 
 If House Republican leaders get their way, for example, Congress would trim about $6.8 billion over the next five years from the expected growth in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
 But those savings would be obliterated by the $385 billion in additional spending over five years for the Medicare prescription drug benefits that the Republican-led Congress passed in 2003. 
 Mr. Bush and House Republicans are now under fire over spending from two directions, fiscal conservatives who say he has allowed reckless growth in spending and Democratic lawmakers, joined by a few centrist Republicans, who say he has squeezed programs that help the poor to pay for tax cuts and the military.
 To some extent, the two sides are correct.
 The rapid growth in overall spending in the first five years of Mr. Bush's tenure was driven to a substantial degree by spending on domestic security and the military, including war costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Annual spending on those categories in 2005 was $205 billion higher than in 2001.
 But the increase in discretionary spending outside those categories was also substantial. Measured another way, domestic discretionary spending excluding the military and domestic security programs in 2005 consumed a larger share of the total economy than it did under Mr. Clinton. 
 Using that standard, Mr. Clinton can be judged to have presided over an era of shrinking government while Mr. Bush, facing very different economic circumstances and national security needs, reversed the trend.
 Total government spending, measured as a share of the gross domestic product, shrank to 18.4 percent from 21.4 percent in Mr. Clinton's eight years in office. That was the lowest level in at least 40 years, and it reflected the rapid economic growth of those years, as well as spending patterns.
 By contrast, total government spending gobbled up a growing share of the economy in each year under Mr. Bush and was back up to 20.1 percent in 2005. 
 Military spending and domestic security were just part of the reason, perhaps no more than 30 percent, according to Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy research group.
 Mr. Bush has more than doubled federal spending on education since 2001, to $83 billion a year. Annual spending on ''community development'' projects, many tied to domestic security or to hurricane reconstruction, has almost quintupled to $52 billion.
 Medicare and Medicaid benefits are expected to cost $627 billion in 2006, up from $433 billion in 2001, and now account for nearly one-quarter of all federal spending. 
 Medicare costs will grow even more rapidly as a result of the new Medicare prescription drug program, which became fully operational this year.
 The drug program is expected to cost $385 billion over the next five years and more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
 ''If I were a Republican, I would be scratching my head and saying I had just voted for a bill that would ultimately cost far more than the war,'' said Richard Kogan, a budget analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal policy research group here.
 The problem for Mr. Bush and Republican leaders in Congress is not so much the absolute level of spending as its composition.
 ''Mandatory'' government benefit programs, mainly Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, now account for 56 percent of the federal budget and are fiercely defended by groups that represent tens of millions of beneficiaries. 
 Mr. Bush, in his budget proposal, called for changes that would reduce mandatory entitlements by $65 billion out of nearly $10 trillion that would be spent over the next five years. 
 But the Senate, in a budget blueprint last month, did not require any cuts at all. And the measure that House leaders hope to pass on Thursday or Friday calls for $6.8 billion in cuts.
 ''The long-term challenge comes from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and both the House and Senate have totally ducked,'' Mr. Riedl of the Heritage Foundation said. ''It's not the best use of Congress's time to quibble over a few billion dollars in discretionary spending while allowing $100 billion increases in annual entitlement spending to go ignored.'' 
 Adding to the budgetary stress this year, Congress is set to approve more than $100 billion in ''supplemental'' funds; $67 billion of that is for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which would be on top of $50 billion approved late last year, and at least an additional $20 billion is likely to be approved for hurricane recovery efforts on the Gulf Coast.

HEADLINE: Scuttling Toward Sanity

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Bob Herbert is on vacation.

 BODY:
I had a horrifying experience in the House of Representatives last week. The House Immigration Caucus held a press conference so members could compete to see who was the biggest blithering idiot in the group. 
 ''Anybody who votes for an amnesty bill deserves to be branded with a scarlet letter, 'A for Amnesty!' '' one aspiring idiot thundered. There's ''a foul odor that's coming out of the U.S. Senate!'' bellowed Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, who then went on to win the prize by suggesting that instead of using illegal aliens to harvest crops, we force felons to do it. ''I say, Let the prisoners pick the fruits!''
 Here was a seemingly mentally competent adult recommending that we force a largely minority population to go out in the fields and pick lettuce and cotton. You wanted to hit him over the head and scream: Is this ringing any bells, Representative Rohrabacher? Are we repealing the Emancipation Proclamation, too? 
 But this week the action moved over to the Senate, where pomposity generally has a restraining influence on stupidity. And indeed the major bill in the Senate, first conceived by John McCain and Ted Kennedy and refined by Arlen Specter, was immediately more sensible than anything that had emerged from the House.
 The Specter bill acknowledged a few realities. First, a highly skilled nation like ours needs to import unskilled workers to do miserable jobs. Second, government is simply not powerful enough to hold off the global economy. You cannot build a wall around the United States that will successfully keep out the workers the U.S. economy demands. 
 The Specter bill balanced border enforcement with worker programs. It would build sluice gates regulating the flow of immigrants, not a wall.
 But the Specter bill didn't have enough Republican support to pass. So an amazing thing happened. Senators tried to find a viable center. 
 Mel Martinez and Chuck Hagel forged a compromise proposal. McCain and Kennedy latched on. So did Bill Frist (who decided he'd swung too far over toward the anti-immigrant crowd) and the White House.
 This proposal also recognized some realities, namely that the longer an immigrant is here, the more valuable to America he or she becomes. New immigrants are going through the shocks of assimilation. But veteran immigrants, even illegals, usually have excellent work records. They've put down roots. Their children are golden. These U.S.-born children go on to earn as much as children of natives, and pay taxes that compensate for the welfare costs of the first generation.
 The Martinez-Hagel compromise would allow illegals who have been in the country five years to work toward citizenship, while imposing a higher hurdle for those who haven't. The measure was sufficiently tough to win support from 15 or so Republicans who couldn't support the Specter bill. 
 The Republicans were delighted with their progress, but then ran into trouble with the Democrats. At first they blamed the Democrats' lack of response on Harry Reid's desire to deny Republicans a victory. But then it became evident that the unions and other Democrats had leapt up to oppose the compromise because it might give legal status to illegal workers already here. The unions have a semilegitimate concern that large numbers of these workers lower wages for U.S. workers. This is probably true, but the effect is so modest that after thousands of studies, reputable economists have not been able to agree upon how much wages are reduced or even if they are at all.
 Senate Democrats were also afraid that a half-baked Senate measure would be ripped apart in conference by Jim Sensenbrenner, the House negotiator who in past conferences has eaten senators for breakfast and cleaned his teeth with their bones. 
 What happened next is comprehensible only to devotees of the Senate. A trifling few differences about substance erupted into a furious disagreement about who would control the schedule on the floor. 
 As darkness settled last night, aides were boiling with frustration and ladling precriminations to me over the phone. Nobody could quite put their finger on exactly what was holding up a deal. And yet the Democrats might end up defeating a liberal immigration bill over a trifle. 
 ''This is the sweet-spot deal,'' said the immigration expert Tamar Jacoby. ''It makes moral sense. It makes practical sense. It's a little convoluted, but it's workable. If it fails, what a shame.''
 The House may be vulgar, but at least that body gets things done.

Apple to Offer Computers That Can Run Both Macintosh and Windows Systems
Two decades after the first Macintosh computer arrived, Apple said that it would offer users of its latest models a simple way to run both the Microsoft Windows operating system and its own. That means a single Apple computer will run the universe of programs written for either the Mac or Windows. Apple's stock jumped almost 10 percent on the news. [Page A1.] 


Apple's announcement helped lead the overall market higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.70 points, to 11,239.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.63 points, to finish at 1,311.56. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 14.39 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 2,359.75. [C11.]

Coca-Cola Announces Unusual Pay Plan for Directors
The Coca-Cola Company announced an unusual plan for paying outside directors: If earnings per share do not rise fast enough over a three-year period, directors will get nothing. But they will get a raise from what they used to get if earnings do perform as expected. While many companies pay directors all or part of their pay in stock or stock options, Coca-Cola appears to be the first to have adopted a plan that will pay directors nothing if the company does not perform well.

HEADLINE: Growth in Services Sector Beat Predictions in March

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Business activity in the services sector picked up in March, beating expectations and pointing to solid momentum across most of the economy, a report released yesterday showed.
 Analysts said the survey supported the case for another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting in May. 
The services index of the Institute for Supply Management rose to 60.5 in March from 60.1 in February, as new orders improved and prices paid dropped. That was above Wall Street economists' forecasts for a decline to 59.
 The services sector makes up about 80 percent of United States economic activity and includes businesses like restaurants, hotels, hair salons, banks and airlines.
 The survey's prices-paid index fell to 60.5 in March, from 64.8 in February, while the jobs component fell to 54.6 from 58.2, and new orders rose to 59.5 from 56.2.
 ''The market was looking for confirmation that there might be a broad slowing of the economy under way, but the data did not reinforce that view,'' said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at the Miller Tabak Company. ''In fact, it suggested the slowdown seen in manufacturing was isolated to that sector alone.''
 The institute's report also pointed to signs of stronger global demand, with export orders reaching the highest level in the almost 10-year history of the survey.
 While the report did show a dip in employment in March, the labor market is ''tight in specialized areas that require some type of specialized training or experience,'' said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the institute's nonmanufacturing services index.
 The Federal Reserve is closely watching the low jobless rate, among other signals, for indications that the economy is close to full capacity, which could produce inflationary pressures.
 The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting last week to 4.75 percent, and economists expect yet another rate rise at the next gathering in May; that would be the 16th straight increase in the current tightening campaign.
 Separate figures yesterday from an industry trade group showed that United States mortgage applications rose for a second consecutive week.
 With interest rates climbing to a near four-year high, another report from an industry trade group yesterday showed consumers rushed to lock in home loans.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity increased last week by 7.2 percent, to 612.8, from the previous week's 571.7.
 The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the industry benchmark, was more than 1 percentage point above its 2005 low of 5.47 percent set in June. The rate's 2005 high was 6.33 percent, reached in November.

HEADLINE: The House That Hope Built

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK. 
E-mail: purnick@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NO fair blaming them, the Bronx public officials who've decided to bank on a promise. Everybody does.
 On the eve of yesterday's City Council vote in favor of a new Yankee Stadium, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said they favored building a new Metro-North Railroad station near the stadium to reduce parking and congestion by trying to lure people from their cars.
The promised station is not the only reason the stadium plan won overwhelming Council approval yesterday -- but it was a sticking point. The project has long been widely seen as economically beneficial to the city, drawing more support citywide than opposition from residents and environmentalists concerned about the parks, congestion and crowding in the South Bronx neighborhood. 
 The Yankees, with a bad-neighbor reputation to overcome, won over most local elected officials by playing its hand with political savvy. It offered and incrementally fattened its package of goodies for the Bronx and its politicians through its ''Community Benefits Agreement.''
 These agreements, not unique to Yankee Stadium, are the cost of doing business in the city -- a package of amenities and money for what local politicians always call ''the community,'' which it sometimes is, though the community is often linked to the politicians and their good friends.
 The team has agreed to filling at least a quarter of the project's contracts and jobs with Bronx residents and companies and to provide $800,000 a year in cash grants, Yankee tickets and equipment to youth and neighborhood groups, and it agreed in the last week to donate $1 million for job training in the borough.
 The Yankees couldn't do anything about a railroad station, though. That's government's job, and the station was a problem. So on Tuesday, the mayor and governor stepped up.
 ''The Metro-North station played a major role in our decision,'' Councilwoman Maria Baez of the Bronx said yesterday after a committee vote. Was she confident that it would be built? ''We'll see on April 26,'' she said, citing the date of the next meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which is controlled by the mayor and governor.
 But even a board vote is no guarantee, history shows.
 The idea of a Second Avenue subway goes back to 1929, and the first plan was proposed in the 1960's. Today? Transportation authority officials say they expect federal permission soon to begin the final phase of engineering and designing the project's first phase.
 The Eastside Access project, which would connect Grand Central Terminal and the Long Island Rail Road's lines in Queens, was proposed more than seven years ago, but the transportation authority, just now seeking contractors, has no date for beginning tunnel excavation.
 Last year, the mayor was pursuing an ambitious plan for developing Manhattan's rezoned Far West Side, featuring a new football stadium, boulevards, a great deal of commercial and residential development, as well as a subway extension. The extension of the No. 7 line from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street was to be financed with revenue from commercial development. 
 But the stadium plan crashed and there has been little commercial development -- and while the administration expects tunnel construction to begin by the end of the year, it has not detailed its new financing plan: issuing $3 billion in Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation bonds. 
 Even excavating a tunnel can be a dead end. Excavation on the 63rd Street tunnel, which now carries the F line, was abandoned in 1980 after five years of work, because of fiscal constraints. Work resumed years later, and the tunnel was completed only in 2001.
 Projects and wish lists abound in the city, and sometimes they are realized -- eventually. Sometimes they are thwarted, delayed or changed by the realities of money and politics. Which brings us back to Metro-North, and Yankee Stadium.
 The plan has no obvious financing, no official price tag other than the $30 million to $40 million cited by the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., this week. And even rubber-stamping by the authority board, which is expected, would not necessarily end the matter.
 The State Legislature, which has changed, eliminated and added transportation projects, will play a role. People who live near the proposed station site may balk. Taxpayer dollars are tempting, and there are never enough. 
 ''You need money to build something,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign. ''If it costs $30 to $40 million to build a Metro-North station, that money will not be available for some other projects. It's the same problem faced by every real estate project in New York. Every inch is fought over.''

HEADLINE: Pieces of Bone Are Found On Building At 9/11 Site

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER; James Barron contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A crew of demolition workers discovered 74 bone fragments near the World Trade Center site over the weekend, the largest number of remains found since the end of recovery operations nearly three years ago and a sign that significant quantities of human remains may have gone unnoticed in sporadic searches over the years.
 Most of the fragments were found mixed among roof ballast -- gravel -- that had been raked to the perimeters of the roof of the condemned Deutsche Bank building, officials said. The building, at 130 Liberty Street, stands just south of where the twin towers once loomed, and intensive work began there last month to prepare for its demolition. 
The towers rose nearly 800 feet above the roof of the building, which was showered with debris and remains on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. Because of extensive damage and contamination, the structure was deemed a total loss, but its demolition has been delayed by legal wrangling and concerns about environmental hazards. 
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which has taken control of the building, began the preliminary stages of demolition two weeks ago. That brought fresh scrutiny to the site, where small quantities of remains have been found occasionally since 2001.
 Of the 2,749 people who were killed in the trade center attack, the remains of 1,151 have never been identified, despite advanced DNA testing. To date, the chief medical examiner's office has been unable to identify more than 9,000 fragments taken from the attack site.
 In the Deutsche Bank discovery, construction workers retrieved 82 samples, and 74 of them proved to be human remains, according to Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner. 
 ''This is the largest find from the Deutsche Bank, and I would not be surprised if additional quantities of remains are found there,'' Ms. Borakove said. ''They are still doing the cleanup.''
 All the remains will be subjected to DNA testing, and will be stored indefinitely if they cannot be linked to anyone, Ms. Borakove said.
 The word of the large discovery shook Diane Horning, whose son Matthew died in the north tower and who is a founder of WTC Families for Proper Burial. Mrs. Horning said she had requested a meeting with the development agency to discuss its procedures after three fragments were found last month. She was called Sunday evening and invited to a meeting on Tuesday.
 ''It disturbs me that L.M.D.C. keeps information from us and the public -- I would not have known unless I asked for this meeting,'' Mrs. Horning said. ''They're now getting into places that they weren't able to inspect before -- knocking things loose, louvers, cooling towers.''
 John Gallagher, a spokesman for the development agency, said that workers had been conducting abatement of asbestos and other contaminants on the roof. 
 ''Because of the thorough cleaning and abatement techniques that are required for this job, findings such as these are not unanticipated,'' Mr. Gallagher said.
 Mrs. Horning said she was concerned that construction workers without expertise were making decisions about what should be preserved. ''We're not asking to halt the demolition -- we're asking for it to slow down a bit, knowing that time is money,'' she said.
 She said that the contractor was amenable to getting help from police officers or firefighters. 
 But Rosaleen Tallon, whose brother, Sean, a firefighter, died in the trade center, questioned whether firefighters or police officers would be any better qualified for the task of distinguishing fragmentary human remains from debris. ''You can't dismantle that building that quickly now -- we need to make sure other interests are not coming before the preservation of human dignity,'' she said.
 Mr. Gallagher of the development corporation, whose board of directors are appointed by the governor and the mayor, said that the agency was taking great care in the demolition.
 ''Through rigorous protocols that we established in conjunction with the office of the chief medical examiner, we will continue to make certain that any remains found are treated with the utmost dignity, care and respect,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Apple Helps Push Nasdaq And S.&P. to 5-Year Highs

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, with the Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock indexes closing at five-year highs as investors bought technology stocks after Apple Computer released software that could expand the number of users of its Mac computers.
 Energy company stocks were higher as crude oil futures prices rose above $67 a barrel. 
Apple's shares rose nearly 10 percent, their biggest one-day percentage gain since November 2004. Apple's gains increased demand for the shares of other technology companies, including the chip maker Intel, which makes chips for Apple computers. Intel's stock rose about 1 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.70 points, or 0.32 percent, to 11,239.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.63 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish at 1,311.56. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 14.39 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 2,359.75.
 Wall Street got a dose of bad news after the closing bell when a jury in New Jersey found that the drug maker Merck, a Dow component, failed to warn two plaintiffs of increased cardiovascular risk with its arthritis medicine Vioxx.
 Merck's stock fell almost 3 percent, to $34.94 a share, in after-hours trading from a close at $35.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 A bright spot was provided by the home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, which reported earnings that beat expectations. Its stock rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading, to $40.51 a share, from a Nasdaq close at $38.32. During the regular session, Apple's shares surged 9.9 percent, or $6.04, to end at $67.21 on Nasdaq.
 Apple said it released software to enable Mac computers to run Microsoft's Windows operating system.
 ''Technology is taking its cue from Apple,'' said Tim Heekin, director of trading at Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment bank in San Francisco.
 Microsoft shares gained 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, to end at $27.74, while Intel shares added 18 cents, or 1 percent, to $19.48, both in Nasdaq trading.
 Providing the biggest lift to the Dow were shares of the aluminum producer Alcoa. The stock rose 2.6 percent, or 81 cents, to $31.67, after Credit Suisse raised its price target on Alcoa to $37, from $35. In the energy sector, ConocoPhillips shares rose $1.41, or 2.2 percent, to $66.56, and helped lift the S.& P. 500. Valero Energy rose $2.66, or 4.4 percent, to $62.50, and Exxon Mobil gained 41 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $62.16.
 Crude oil for May delivery rose 84 cents, to settle at $67.07 a barrel, after a report showed a big drop in gasoline supplies in the latest week.
 The health care sector was among the day's weakest. A decline in the shares of the heart-device maker St. Jude Medical came a day after the company cut its revenue and earnings forecast. The stock fell $5.05, or 12.2 percent, to $36.25, and was among the biggest losers on the S.& P. 500 index.
 Comments by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow suggesting that payroll figures on Friday will be strong revived worries about higher interest rates, limiting the stock market's gains at midday. Mr. Snow said he expected payroll data for March to reflect strength in the economy.
 Interest rates were lower with the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill at 4.84 percent, down from 4.86 percent late Tuesday, and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, up 4/32, at 9710/32.

HEADLINE: With This Ethical Ring I Thee Wed

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MANY of the shoppers who happen into Leber Jeweler's modest brick storefront in Western Springs, Ill., just outside Chicago, don't know much, if anything, about the social and environmental costs of industrial gold mining.
 Brian Leber, the president and owner of the 85-year-old company, is happy to enlighten. He can then quietly suggest a piece of jewelry that makes the concerns about mining moot: his Earthwise Jewelry line, which Leber manufactures using recycled gold.
''I try not to pontificate,'' Mr. Leber said. ''But I do try to educate people on the issues.''
 In the last few years, as the outsize environmental impact of gold mining has been exposed, jewelers -- as the retail face of the industry -- have been trying to inoculate themselves against a consumer backlash. It is not here yet, but many people say it is sure to come. 
 In February eight jewelry companies -- some small like Leber, others giant like Zale, the nation's second largest gold retailer after Wal-Mart -- signed on to a national campaign called ''No Dirty Gold.'' The campaign was created two years ago by a coalition of advocacy groups to highlight the issues surrounding gold and gold mining.
 The pledge is minimal in its requirements, essentially a promise to work toward a resolution of gold's tangled issues, rather than a solution. But many environmentalists and industry officials say that the momentum and commitment are what matters.
 ''It's like the lock has been picked, opening a door that could lead to responsibly sourced gold,'' said Stephen D'Esposito, the president and executive director of Earthworks, a mining watchdog group in Washington that helped create the campaign. The eight companies together represent $6.3 billion in retail jewelry sales, or 14 percent of sales in the United States, according to Oxfam International, a confederation of groups that work on poverty and economic justice, and a leader of the campaign.
 Along with Zale and Leber, the other signers are: the Signet Group (the parent firm of Sterling and Kay Jewelers), Helzberg Diamonds, Fortunoff, Cartier, Piaget and Van Cleef & Arpels. As recently as last year only Tiffany & Company had signed the ''No Dirty Gold'' pledge.
 Most jewelers, including Mr. Leber, say that making jewelry of recycled gold is only a tiny piece of the answer. The deeper question, they say, lies around the phrase ''responsible mining,'' and whether it is possible. About 80 percent of all the gold mined today is fabricated into jewelry.
 ''What does indeed constitute a responsible mining operation?'' asked Michael J. Kowalski, the chairman and chief executive of Tiffany. ''Who's there at the moment, and how do we get to where we need to be? The critical next step is reaching a substantive agreement on those questions.''
 Tiffany buys most of its gold from a Utah mine called Bingham Canyon that does not use cyanide, which can pollute water and lead to the release of other pollutants like mercury. Last year Tiffany began processing its gold itself at a plant in Rhode Island as part of a strategy to control the supply chain. Tiffany aims ultimately to provide customers with a ''chain of custody assurance'' stating where the gold in a ring or necklace has been, from mine to display case. 
 These changes are partly coming about, people in and out of the jewelry industry say, because gold mining's environmental and social impacts have become impossible to ignore, especially in developing countries where political protests, corruption and displacement of indigenous peoples have often accompanied mining. 
 Because most of the known gold deposits in the world are in microscopic form -- the shiny nuggets of old are as dated as the miner and his mule -- huge industrial open-pit mines, usually using cyanide to retrieve the metal from base rock, are required to make mining economically viable. And because the grades of ore are so weak, the process is hugely destructive and wasteful, with at least 30 tons of waste rock often needed to produce a single gold ring.
 A months-long investigation by The New York Times, which led to a four-part series last year called ''The Cost of Gold,'' also raised questions about how and whether communities in developing countries consent to the mines in their midst, and whether the long-term environmental impacts in places like Nevada and Indonesia are being correctly assessed.
 Then there's the Wal-Mart effect.
 Wal-Mart's strategy for everything it sells, including gold, is to eliminate the middleman, buy direct from suppliers and pass the savings on to customers. Jewelers are following suit as they try to cut costs and compete. Industry experts and executives say the trend has nothing to do with ethics, but that more control of supply makes the ethics debate over dirty gold somewhat easier, because companies are already thinking more deeply about where things come from.
 ''The overall theme is know your vendors,'' said David H. Sternblitz, a vice president and the treasurer at Zale Corporation. ''Make sure you know who you're dealing with.''
 Mining and jewelry companies are also realizing that internal codes of conduct or environmental rules are meaningless without independent verification and inspection. Insurance companies and socially conscious investment funds are also beginning to demand standards of conduct that can be assessed by outsiders.
 ''They want be able to credibly say, 'I am not with stupid,' '' said Michael Rae, the president of the Council for Responsible Jewellery Practices, a group formed last year by retailers and mining companies. ''To avoid being judged by the lowest common denominator of the industry, they need a means by which they can differentiate their practices.'' 
 Alternative voices in a deeply conservative industry are also starting to speak up. 
 Jennifer Horning, an artist and metal worker in San Francisco, is among the founders of a group called Ethical Metalsmiths. In May her group will present a show designed to foster awareness about responsible mining at the annual meeting of the Society of North American Goldsmiths in Chicago. One artist will exhibit a gold charm bracelet hung with tiny handcuffs, guns and coffins; another made a stark metal syringe with gold in the chamber ready for injection.
 Companies like greenKarat.com, a Web-based business in Texas, and Seraglia couture in London are also proselytizing the virtues of so-called ethical jewelry. 
 ''Initially it's a harder sell,'' said Lucy Wills, who founded Seraglia last year to use recycled gold. But Ms. Wills said she takes heart from the sharp growth in consciousness about food and the social and environmental conditions of its production.
 ''We won the battle with food; we're kind of getting there with clothing,'' she said. ''I think maybe in a few years time people will be thinking more about jewelry too.''
 Andrew and Johanna Heyduk are already there. The Heyduks, who live in New York City, shopped for responsibly mined gold last year for their wedding bands. They ended up not buying gold at all. When they took their vows in Vermont in October, it was with platinum rings from greenKarat. 
 But even if responsible, ethical mining is possible, verifying it will be difficult even with the best of intentions, industry experts say. Diamonds, furs and timber all look simple by comparison, because they all come in a discrete form that can be tracked by a paper trail. A specific tree produces a specific two-by-four; a diamond comes from one mine that can be found on a map.
 Gold is not like that. It must be purified and smelted, amalgamated and combined into forms that jewelry makers can then use. That means many more steps on the journey from mine to display case, and no easy trail to follow.
 Mr. Rae's appointment to the Council for Responsible Jewellery Practices in February is seen as a sign of change; he was formerly with the World Wildlife Fund in Australia, working the other side of the issue as an environmentalist. He says certified gold will require an entirely different strategy.
 ''Instead of a chain of custody, we have gone instead to a chain of confidence,'' Mr. Rae said. He said that by 2008 the council hopes to have a set of processes and standards with independent third-party verification at every step of the jewelry creation and selling process. Groups like Earthworks and Oxfam are working on a similar time frame to establish a certification process for mining operations.
 How much of the ferment is real? Environmentalists and industry insiders are divided: some hopeful, others braced for system that burnishes gold's image without changing anything on the ground.
 ''It will be proven over time,'' Ms. Horning at Ethical Metalsmiths said. ''But it's the beginning of a dialogue and that is the most important thing to us.''

HEADLINE: Welfare Rolls Falling Again, Amid Worries About Poverty

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The number of New York City residents receiving public assistance fell to 402,281 last month, the lowest number since December 1964, at the start of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, and a decline of nearly two-thirds from its peak of nearly 1.2 million in March 1995, officials announced yesterday.
 After falling sharply during the mayoralty of Rudolph W. Giuliani, when more than 600,000 people left the rolls, the city's caseload began to creep upward in September 2002, during Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's first year in office and on the tail of a national recession. The modest increases continued until October 2004, when the caseload figure again started to decline. 
The recent drop in the number of welfare recipients in the city comes months before the 10th anniversary of the federal welfare overhaul that imposed a five-year limit on assistance, established work requirements and gave states discretion in setting welfare policy. Nationally, the caseload has fallen by more than half since the federal law was signed in August 1996. 
 The decline in the caseload is occurring amid concerns about income inequality, which has risen more sharply in the city than in the nation as a whole, and new signs that poor families are having a harder time meeting housing and food costs. Last month, Mr. Bloomberg appointed a 32-member Commission for Economic Opportunity to come up with public and private solutions to poverty in the city.
 ''When I came into office, we were going into an economic slump, and most people thought that the welfare rolls would go up,'' Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday. ''The truth of the matter is, they have gone down.''
 But welfare recipients who do find work are often in low-paying jobs with limited opportunities for advancement. Of those who have left welfare for work in the city, 88 percent have kept their jobs after three months and 75 percent after six months. 
 Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, said the broad decline in welfare caseloads in the last decade could be attributed to three factors: an unusually strong economy in the late 1990's; the federal overhaul that encouraged recipients to find work and financially penalized those who did not; and policies that expanded access to food stamps, child-care subsidies and the earned-income tax credit.
 The city's caseload decline since 2004 is surprising because the national caseload decline has slowed significantly, said Gordon L. Berlin, president of MDRC, formerly the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a group in New York and Oakland, Calif., that evaluates social programs. 
 ''The economy has begun to pick up,'' Mr. Berlin said, ''and that's certainly part of the story in New York.''
 Welfare has been a less prominent issue under Mr. Bloomberg than under Mr. Giuliani, even though the city has maintained the welfare policies started in the mid-1990's. Mr. Giuliani imposed tough eligibility-verification reviews that removed many recipients from the rolls. He also converted welfare offices into job-search centers and required recipients to join the city's Work Experience Program, which placed them in jobs like raking leaves or answering phones. Welfare caseworkers are now called ''job opportunity specialists.''
 ''Giuliani gloried in opposing the activist groups and challenging the welfare culture,'' said Lawrence M. Mead III, a professor of politics at New York University. ''The Bloomberg administration continued the Giuliani policies, although without the contentious rhetoric. The change under Bloomberg has been more atmospheric than substantive.'' 
 In February 2005, the city's Human Resources Administration began WeCare, which provides medical and psychological assessment and care for recipients who have been unable to find work. 
 Verna Eggleston, the commissioner of the agency, said it had ''abandoned the 'one-size-fits-all' social service program model'' in favor of an ''individualized model.''
 WeCare has enrolled about 15,000 adults and is expected to serve 40,000 eventually, said Patricia M. Smith, who has worked for the welfare agency since 1974 and is now its first deputy commissioner.
 ''We've recognized the shift in the demographics and characteristics of the caseload since the early days of welfare reform,'' she said, adding that many current recipients have ''multiple barriers to employment.''
 The mayor acknowledged the same problem. ''I don't think it's realistic to think that everybody can go to work,'' he said, ''but we are going in the right direction.''
 Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York and a member of the mayor's commission, said the focus needed to shift to economic security from welfare reform. ''Parents are working full time and still poor,'' she said. ''There has to be a greater effort on making work pay.''
 City Councilman Bill de Blasio, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, said the decline in the caseload was ''very good news'' but added that ''people who've exhausted their benefits have not necessarily found steady income.'' In 2004, 20.3 percent of residents and 17.4 percent of families in New York City lived below the poverty line.
 Mr. de Blasio and advocates for the poor have estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of residents who are eligible for food stamps or for government earned-income tax credits but have not enrolled. Ms. Smith said the welfare agency was allowing people for the first time to apply for benefits through nonprofit groups and that enrollment in another program, Medicaid, had significantly risen.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop Again

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell for a third consecutive week, providing further evidence of a strong job market. 
 The Labor Department reported on Thursday that 299,000 laid-off workers applied for jobless benefits last week, down 5,000 from the previous week after declines of 8,000 and 7,000 in the two weeks before that.
The number of Americans receiving benefits dipped to 2.44 million, the lowest level in six years, signaling that the labor market has rebounded strongly after the losses last year from the Gulf Coast hurricanes.
 The government will report unemployment figures for March on Friday. Analysts expect the report to show that 198,000 jobs were created, down from 243,000 in February. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.8 percent.
 For the week ended last Thursday, 32 states and territories reported a drop in claim applications while 21 reported increases.

HEADLINE: Risky Forecast: This Time Is Different 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
SOME bets simply should not be made, for history indicates they are extraordinarily unlikely to pay off.
 One such bet is that American consumers will prove to be overextended, leaving those who lend to them in deep trouble. Half a century ago, credit cards were unknown to the vast majority of Americans. As their use grew, there was a lot of fretting from those who were sure that the end had to be near. They were wrong, repeatedly.
That history should make anyone hesitate to sound such an alarm. But, as Vadim Zlotnikov, the chief investment strategist of Sanford C. Bernstein, said this week, now ''is not like every other time in history.'' 
 To understand why, it helps to analyze what has been different about this housing cycle. A lot more loans have been made to people with marginal credit, the so-called subprime market, because banks now find it easy to sell such loans to others through securitization.
 In the old days, banks kept such mortgages and bore the risk of default. That made them more reluctant to lend money, and, if things turned bad, could lead to abrupt halts to such lending.
 But with securitization, the loans are typically put together and sold to investors. One security, the safest and lowest yielding, has first call on interest and principal payments. Then there is the mezzanine security, which will get paid if money is left over. Finally there is the equity part, which comes with a very high yield but is last in line for payments. 
 ''You've changed the face and the nature of the housing market,'' Mr. Zlotnikov said. ''You've massively increased the number of marginal buyers. For the first time, they could get credit.''
 That has meant that some areas that used to be primarily rental -- because few people who wanted to live there could qualify for loans -- turned into sellers' markets with soaring prices.
 In the Fresno, Calif., area, a farming region that used to be primarily rental, home prices have risen at a rate of 21 percent a year since the end of 1999. That is well above the rates in areas like San Francisco and Santa Cruz, which were much hotter in the old days.
 Add to that the increase in mortgages that allow artificially low payments in early years, only to jump after an initial period, and it is not hard to paint a picture of distress if some setbacks make the securitization market less friendly.
 That would not affect all homeowners. Those who had to strain the most to buy, and who bought most recently, would be most vulnerable.
 Will that happen? The proportion of subprime mortgages in distress rose in the final quarter of 2005, and may well keep rising. 
 The current prevalent view on Wall Street is that consumers survived the onslaught of higher oil prices last year and therefore will keep doing fine. But even before oil prices rose, there were signs of stress among some consumers.
 The Federal Reserve, whose research quality tends to be more impressive than its speed, has now released the results of its 2004 survey of consumer finances. And there are some surprising results. 
 Among families headed by people aged 35 to 44, 11.7 percent said they had been overdue by more than two months on debt payments during the previous year -- almost twice as many as during the previous survey in 2001. And the 2004 survey came when home prices were soaring and the economy booming.
 It is such younger, nonwealthy households that may be most at risk if something does go wrong -- in financial markets, interest rates or the overall economy -- during the next few years. Perhaps things really are different this time.

HEADLINE: The Last Aloha for Understated Elegance 

BYLINE: By DEBRA A. KLEIN

 BODY:
WHEN I heard the sad prognosis last spring, I knew I had to get back for a final visit -- one more chance to relive old memories before the end. So three weeks ago, my husband and I rushed to Maui to say goodbye. We spent five nights and spared no expense. 
 We were not dashing to the side of an ailing relative; the only critical decision we faced was partial or full ocean view. The reason for our trip? The Kapalua Bay Hotel is closing today, and in no small way an era of uncomplicated luxury is dying as well.
The Kapalua looked elegant, not at all in its death throes. Islanders drifted in and out of the lobby, snapping photos and absorbing the atmosphere. But other than that, there was no hint that the end was nearing -- at least not from Noel, the greeter, who draped us with leis and, eventually, sympathy. 
 ''I know, it's such a beautiful building,'' she acknowledged, but only when we mentioned the inevitable. 
 When Kapalua opened in 1978, it whispered its decade, from its low-slung ''Brady Bunch'' profile to the grandma's-spare-room furnishings. To describe Kapalua's style as understated is itself understatement. 
 Nobody hip or well known designed anything there, unless you count Mother Nature, who earned Kapalua Bay -- a crescent of teal water edged in black lava rocks -- superlatives like Maui's, and even America's, ''best beach.'' Tropically speaking, that's all the splash a place needs, and undemanding vacationers had been relaxing there, from its first incarnation as a RockResort, through years managed by Regent, Halekulani, Starwood and finally Marriott -- for nearly three decades. 
 But when the new ''Kapalua Bay'' opens in 2008, only Rockefellers and their ilk will be visiting. The hotel is being razed in June to build a time-share development, as well as private homes that are to start at $4 million. I'm no blueblood, but Kapalua allowed me to live like one every time I checked in. When it comes to resorts, I prefer low-key, patrician playgrounds to my own generation's luxury digs. I'd rather see a thousand stars in the night sky than spot one in the lobby; I require sand between my toes, not a customized hotel iPod in my ears. When Kapalua closes, it will be shutting the door on that simpler genre of elegance. 
 Actually, in the public spaces at least, there were no doors. That was part of Kapalua's appeal. When you stepped into the cavernous open-air lobby, you saw textbook Hawaii and felt its tropical winds. They blew in from the royal blue channel separating Maui from Molokai, across the broad sweep of lawn, over shaggy palms and right into the beams. Gusts fluttered emerald fronds and magenta orchids in the half-orb planters, while cheeky peach-tinted birds flitted down from the rafters, stealing crumbs off plates. At Kapalua, the outside was in. 
 We first visited in 1996 as over-our-heads newlyweds, strategizing and economizing to afford a slice of prohibitive luxury. Using an airline promotion, we stayed two nights for the price of one, practically criminal. I distinctly remember packing our own chips and sandwiches to eat on the beach. Still, we were in. 
 An elderly bellman trundled our cart through broad, open breezeways alive with bougainvillea tumbleweeds. Heavy double doors made us each feel like J. P. Morgan returning from a hard day acquiring things. The bellman flung them open to reveal a secret world of calm; then he disappeared. 
 Inside the high-ceilinged guest room, oversize mirrors reflected palms, lawns and bird of paradise; it was like checking into a botanical garden with air-conditioning. The his and hers dressing area was spacious, but the oddly dark fabrics and yellowing furnishings missed the boat aesthetically. We found neither Italian names nor high thread counts on the wimpy poly-blend sheets. Yet there was something intensely luxurious about stepping onto a fully furnished lanai with a freshly brewed cup of Kona coffee and listening to the right-over-there gentle waves, or returning to the room at night to find the floor-to-ceiling heavy wood shutters drawn across the wall, the lights dimmed and gentle Hawaiian music wafting to the ceiling fan. 
 I spent mornings luring colorful birds with crumbs like a little old lady; afternoons first watching humpback whales breach in the channel and then snorkeling among rainbow-sherbet-colored fish. I threaded my own lei using the in-room sewing kit. 
 OUR daily fruit arrived on porcelain with weighty flatware. We relied on it for sustenance, counting the hours to afternoon tea. We spent nights listening to local combos: geckos and toads, not ukuleles. We intended to see the island but never budged, discovering relaxation instead. 
 Next trip, we ignored our instincts and chose the glitzy Grand Wailea on the South Coast to explore a new side of the island and a forgotten side of ourselves in the hotel's childlike theme-park pools. But it felt like a college campus during the Big Game. The second morning we called an audible and decamped for Kapalua, grateful that it had room -- but then Kapalua always had room. 
 From the quiet, empty pool where plumeria blooms committed gentle suicide, to the great grassy lawn strewn with cushiony lounges on a point above the beach, Kapalua had, as its trademark features, personal space and solitude. With only about 200 guest rooms, Kapalua could feel like a semiprivate estate. We settled into blissful dullness among the silent, silver-haired snorkelers and families with ultrapolite children. 
 As more experienced global travelers, we appreciated the subtleties: stealthy housekeepers operated on perfect instinct, sensing that guests needed to keep fragrant fallen blossoms in their rooms. They would never toss out a shriveled orchid lei or a browned gardenia. When they repaired a loose hook on my skirt before dinner -- that trip, we could afford to eat -- they fixed the drooping hem, too. 
 At sunset, when the sky melted the water pink and then violet and we watched crow's-footed second-time brides wed barefoot in the sand, we made our own vows: we would never stay anywhere else on Maui again. 
 In March, on our third and final visit, the rooms seemed even larger and brighter, the bellman younger, the birds chattier in the cool dawn air. One evening, a guest in his 40's ran up from the beach barefoot, shirtless and wet, his snorkel set still on his head, calling: ''Honey! A turtle! I saw a turtle!'' as though he were 8. 
 At dusk, the bartender mixed mango martinis, and a lone hula dancer swayed; a gust caught the white cloths in the open dining room where crossed tiki torches huffed fire into the breeze. Staff members in cream-colored muumuus rustled across the lobby lounge to bid one another teary goodbyes, while sentimental vacationers rose to attention, as though the sky's final orange and pink glow was a visual anthem. 
 Since our first stay, I have, as a travel writer, visited many remote and highly touted resorts. Yet I always longed for the Hawaiian luxury that could truly transport me. With a gracious staff and casual simplicity, the Kapalua Bay Hotel was an anachronistic oasis, taking me back to a simpler era I never knew first hand. 
 There are places we can escape to by booking a flight or driving; then there are those journeys we take without going anywhere, returning to special memories anytime we wish. The Kapalua Bay Hotel is gone, but I can still go there. I can close my eyes and see the palm views off ''my'' lanai. The Kapalua Bay Hotel will always exist in my mind, its crashing waves forever in my head.

HEADLINE: Where the Finest Antiques Can't Be Bought

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
IT'S easy to understand why people drive past Troy without thinking to stop. From the Interstate they see broken-down factories, ugly brick housing projects from the 1950's and, most egregiously, a concrete garage that hugs the Hudson River where there ought to be a park.
 Whizzing by, you can't tell that Troy has a downtown -- much less one of the most perfectly preserved 19th-century downtowns in the United States. Has there ever been a case of less effective civic advertising?
Drive into the city, and you'll find block after block of town houses, churches and commercial buildings that look almost exactly as they did 100 years ago. A 1,200-seat concert hall has stunning frescoes and astonishing acoustics. A row of antiques stores inhabits buildings at least as precious as the merchandise inside. And a remarkable Tiffany window forms the backdrop for the circulation desk at the beaux-arts public library; Troy, with only 48,000 people, has more than a dozen Tiffany windows. 
 In the 19th century, Troy, at the junction of the Hudson River, the Erie Canal and several important railroad lines, was an industrial powerhouse, After World War II, its economy declined so quickly that downtown buildings emptied out and stayed empty for decades, undisturbed by renovators. And so, 15 years ago, when Martin Scorsese needed to recreate the Manhattan of the 1870's for ''The Age of Innocence,'' he went to Troy. It offered not just the perfect backdrop, but also precious little commercial activity to impede shooting. Now the city has begun a comeback, with new businesses opening and visitors discovering its charms. Kathy Sheehan, a lifelong resident who works for the Rensselaer County Historical Society, said, ''I'm as excited about what's happening now as I was bummed about what happened 30 years ago.'' 
 The best day to tour Troy is Saturday, because the library is closed on Sundays and because Saturday is when a farmers' market comes to town. The market makes Troy's relative shortage of restaurants irrelevant: offerings include not only the makings of a perfect picnic (local artisanal cheeses, breads and wines) but also the Asian cooking of Thunder Mountain Curry, whose chef, Mike Gordon, may be one of the few graduates of the Culinary Institute of America selling food from a pushcart. 
 A perfect day in Troy might begin with coffee at Illium, a cafe in an 1830's commercial building on Broadway; a 1920's wraparound mural of the Hudson River Valley is visible from every seat. From there, it's about 100 yards to the antiques shops on two quaint blocks of River Street. One standout is Retropolitan (169 River Street; 518-428-2211) with mid-20th-century pieces at a fraction of their New York City prices.
 But the best antiques in town aren't for sale. Plan to tour the old city center on foot. Ms. Sheehan leads walks on most Saturdays at 11 a.m. If you can't make one, the historical society can provide a free guide to walking Troy. 
 Either way, you'll want to stroll by Washington Park, between Second and Third Streets and Washington Place and Washington Street. It's a gated green comparable to Gramercy Park in Manhattan, with surrounding houses at least as appealing. From there, walk north on Second Street, where the Troy Public Library is at No. 100. After checking out the Tiffany window, head upstairs to see the Hudson River School paintings hanging in the main reading room. 
 Next to the library are the imposing buildings of the Rensselaer County Court; directly across the street is the tidy campus of Russell Sage College, incorporating a sterling 1835 Greek Revival church now used as a lecture and performance site. 
 Along the way, historic plaques offer local lore: how a Troy resident named Samuel Wilson became America's iconic ''Uncle Sam''; how Clement Clarke Moore's ''A Visit From St. Nicholas'' ('' 'Twas the Night Before Christmas'') came to be published, for the first time, in Troy in 1823. Ms. Sheehan will drop every name from the Marquis de Lafayette, who visited Troy in 1825, to Washington Roebling, chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, who lived in Troy while his son attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. (R.P.I. still towers over the city from a hill just east of downtown.) And she'll explain why Troy became known as the Collar City: in the days when laundering dress shirts was an ordeal, detachable collars were common, and Troy is where many of them were manufactured.
 FARTHER north on Second Street, No. 57 is the headquarters of the historical society, incorporating a museum and the marble-fronted Hart-Cluett House, built in 1827 and retaining most of its original detailing. The upstairs, closed since the early 1990's for restoration (which continues), will have a grand reopening in May.
 Also on Second Street is the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, the bank's gift to the city in 1875. The magnificent building is rarely open except during concerts, so you may want to attend one. If you're tall or wide, try to get an aisle seat; the original wood chairs, upholstered in leather over horsehair, are beautiful but closely spaced. 
 Across the street from the music hall is Daisy Baker's, serving American fare in what was a residence for young women in the 19th century; period details remain to prove its pedigree. On a recent night, the shrimp cocktail was delicious and the filet mignon perfectly cooked.
 But there is more to explore before dinner. Continuing north on Second Street, you'll pass the modern City Hall (built, foolishly, in the 1970's, when entire buildings like the massive, mansard-roofed Quackenbush department store stood unused) and the beautiful McCarthy Building, with a carved stone entrance that resembles a proscenium arch. A bit farther north is the city's Uncle Sam statue, marking the unofficial northern edge of the historic district. 
 It's time to head back south. This time, you may want to wander without any particular destination in mind. The pleasure of Troy isn't discovering a single old building, but finding yourself lost among dozens of them. You may feel as if it were 1880, and you were strolling home to Washington Park, perhaps just for a change of collar.

IF YOU GO
 TROY is three hours north of New York City and eight miles north of Albany. Signs on Interstate 787 clearly mark the route to Troy. Free parking is abundant. 
 Amtrak stops near Albany at the Rensselaer train station, a 15-minute drive south of Troy. Cabs are available at the station. 
 The Saturday farmers' market (www.troymarket.org) is held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Uncle Sam Atrium (Third Street and Broadway) until the end of April. From May through November, it moves outdoors to the Troy Town Dock and Marina on River Street near the Green Island Bridge, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
 The Illium Cafe (9 Broadway, 518-629-0004) serves coffee and light meals. 
 Daisy Baker's (33 Second Street, 518-266-9200) is open for dinner Monday thru Saturday, and for lunch Monday thru Friday. The River Street Cafe (429 River Street, 518-273-2740) and Lo Porto (85 Fourth Street, 518-273-8546) serve dinner only.
 The Rensselaer County Historical Society, 57 Second Street (www.rchsonline.org), is open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday from February to late December. The suggested donation for viewing the galleries is $4. For walking-tour information, Kathy Sheehan, the society's registrar and historian, can be reached at 518-272-7232, extension 15. A special tour on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. will focus on Troy's involvement in the abolition movement before the Civil War. A map of Troy's Tiffany windows is at www.troyvisitorcenter.org/tours/tiffany.html.
 The schedule of events at the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall (30 Second Street, 518-273-0038) is online at www.troymusichall.org.

Previews and Openings

'FESTEN' Opens Sunday. Based on the film ''The Celebration,'' this London transfer, starring Julianna Margulies, Larry Bryggman and Michael Hayden, is about a Danish man who confronts some old secrets at a family reunion (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

'GUARDIANS' Opens Tuesday.

Jason Moore directs (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.

'PEER GYNT' Opens Tuesday. Following their hit revival of ''Hedda Gabler,'' the Brooklyn Academy of Music presents another Henrik Ibsen play to honor the centennial of the playwright's death.

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.

'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 27. Redemption is a major theme of this musical fantasy adapted from a Peter S.

'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' Opens April 16.

'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.

'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 16. C. J.

'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' Opens April 19.

Paul Rudd also stars (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Opens April 20. If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which will be host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.

'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's. John Rando (''Urinetown'') directs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Broadway

'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'RING OF FIRE' The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed by with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)

'GREY GARDENS' As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Closing Sunday. Moving to Broadway. Previews begin April 19; opens May 3 at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER' A soccer game in Belfast is a catalyst for personal transformation in Marie Jones's tour de force two-act monologue. Marty Maguire throws himself into the revival of this well-written, funny piece with an abandon that verges on hysteria. (1:30). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

'PEN' David Marshall Grant's sometimes preachy new three-character play is about an unhappy Long Island family in 1969. J. Smith-Cameron is fascinating to watch as she exposes the anguish behind the tough, angry exterior of the wheelchair-bound mother; Dan McCabe is uneven but believable as the troubled teenage son who wants to get away from her; and Reed Birney is less persuasive as the ex-husband who has already left. The title object is a gift from the author to himself: it allows something impossible to happen. (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condi Rice, is casual to the point of offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)

* 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)

Off Off Broadway

'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)

'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. (Jason Zinoman)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton,(212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'TRIAL BY WATER' Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. ( Stevens)

* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; closing Sunday. (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by cliches and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)

'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)

* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)

'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)

'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliche that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Dana Stevens)

* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who co-stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)

* 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)

'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)

* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)

'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)

'MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) John Goodman plays a dying crash victim on his way to a 40-year-old appointment, and Robert Carlyle is the widowed baker entrusted with keeping it. Instead he meets Marisa Tomei, who teaches him to dance and, more important, throw away his wife's ashes. Toggling back and forth between past and present, ''Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School'' is a soggy, endless wallow in nostalgia and the healing power of very bad dancing. (Catsoulis)

* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)

'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Nathan Lee)

* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)

'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)

'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)

* 'YANG BAN XI: THE 8 MODEL WORKS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mandarin) In her documentary about Chinese propaganda of the campiest kind (think rosy-cheeked, chubby-kneed dancers leaping across the stage, guns clutched in one hand, Little Red Books in the other), the director Yan-Ting Yuen revisits the Cultural Revolution to explore the history and legacy of one of the strangest byproducts of totalitarian madness: the revolutionary spectacular. (Dargis)

* 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)

Film Series

AGAINST THE TIDE: REBELS & MAVERICKS IN CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE FILM (Through April 16) Japan Society's spring film series, which began yesterday, continues this weekend with films including ''Wild Berries'' (2003), Miwa Nishikawa's satire of Japanese family values; and ''Kaza-hana'' (2001), the director Shinji Somai's last work, a drama about a bureaucrat and a young widow trying to redefine their damaged lives. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $10.

Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work concludes with a weeklong run of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971), his biggest hit. This is Clint Eastwood's first and best interpretation of Harry Callahan, a tough San Francisco cop who has been known to ask deserving punks whether they're feeling lucky. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and rhythm-and-blues, Yolanda Adams has a powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144; $65. (Laura Sinagra)

EVA AYLLON (Tomorrow) Eva Ayllon is a stadium-filling star in Peru who, for more than 30 years, has placed her own stamp on the Afro-Peruvian folk heritage: songs with crisp syncopations played on instruments as basic as the box drum called the cajon. She adds a husky voice that never shies away from drama. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $45. (Jon Pareles)

ANTI-FLAG (Thursday) You can't accuse this politically minded punk band of flip-flopping on the issues. Sure, it moved to the center on the subject of corporate record labels, but it still has lots of leftist bile to spew about topics like the lazy news media (''The Press Corpse''), big trade (''The W.T.O. Kills Farmers'') and plain old greed (''1 Trillion Dollar$''). 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15.75 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) Ms. Bhosle is famous as a vocalist for Indian film. Here she performs reinterpreted Bollywood classics accompanied by the Kronos Quartet, with Zakir Hussaino on the tabla, and Wu Man on pipa. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $21 to $72. (Sinagra)

NEKO CASE (Tonight) The clarion voice that's best known as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to this alt-country chanteuse, who performs her own songs here. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)

KEYSHIA COLE (Tomorrow)The R&B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than on righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171. Sold out. (Sinagra)

DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 6:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Pareles)

FRANZ FERDINAND, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Thursday) At the vanguard of the post-post-punk trend, the poker-faced group Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound took on some added alternative-rock heft on its most recent album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 485-1534; $40 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sinagra)

GOGOL BORDELLO (Wednesday) Led by a gruff and extravagantly mustached Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oompah that's the makings of a rowdy party. 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $22. (Pareles)

HEARTLESS BASTARDS, THE SOLEDAD BROTHERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Because of her primal yowl, the singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The members switch off headlining slots with the Soledad Brothers. 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)

THE HOLD STEADY, P.O.S. (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The indie-rapper P.O.S. also performs. 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16.50. (Sinagra)

THE iO'S (Tuesday) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iO's remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iO's have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This brainy rapper's agile attack still lacks Jigga's precision, 50 Cent's swagger and Nas's anguish. But his rapping can be beautiful when he laments things like Lauryn Hill's exit from the music scene. 8 p.m., Pratt Institute Student Union, 200 Willoughby Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 636-3422; free for Pratt students, $4 for nonstudents. (Sinagra)

KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist and guitarist in the spacy local band TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture on San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)

McCULLOUGH SONGS OF THUNDER, THE BIRMINGHAM SUNLIGHTS (Tomorrow) The 16-piece ''shout'' gospel brass band, McCullough Songs of Thunder, from the United House of Prayer for All People in Harlem, aims to blare its devotion so loudly and joyously that the angels have to sing along. They are joined here by the Birmingham Sunlights, a traditional a cappella gospel group. 8 p.m., Harlem Center for the Performing Arts, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100; Free. (Sinagra)

SUSAN McKEOWN (Tonight) Susan McKeown interprets Irish traditionals with a distinctive intensity. Accompanying her here are some musicians who play on her most recent recording: the fiddler Dana Lyn and the guitarist Eamon O'Leary. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15. (Sinagra)

BETH ORTON (Tuesday) Though her voice, which recalls the best of the English folk tradition, should be enough to put her songs across, the quality of Ms. Orton's work has often depended on her adept collaborations. Her most recent is with the post-rock gadfly Jim O'Rourke. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out. (Sinagra)

QUASI (Monday and Tuesday) Sam Coomes and his ex-wife, the Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss, make tempestuous indie-rock that veers toward apocalypse blues. Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12 in advance , $14 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE RACONTEURS (Tonight) Jack White of the White Stripes and the power-pop talent Brendan Benson team up with members of the Greenhorns in this assertive side project. They play garage-rock cut with incisive pop hooks. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Sold out. (Sinagra)

RJD2, BEANS (Tonight) Representing an offshoot of the record-store scavenging D.J. tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. The rapper Beans, formerly of Antipop Consortium, has made a solo career out of meshing his surreal lyrics with the work of electronic-rock artists and culture-hopping D.J.'s. 9, Guggenheim Auditorium, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500; $20 (cash at door only, free for members).(Sinagra)

JOSH ROUSE (Tonight) This confessional singer-songwriter gives contemplative navel-gazing a Nashville twist. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $22.50 to $26.50. (Sinagra)

SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722;$17 to $50. (Pareles)

THE SOUNDS, MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) The Sounds are a Swedish band that plays sugar-sharp arena pop with a pinch of bad-girl sass. Morningwood is more punky, though somehow less authentic. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) The Russian-born singer and pianist Regina Spektor brings punk immediacy into a cabaret setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sinagra)

KREMENA STANCHEVA (Tomorrow) Ms. Stancheva is a member of Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian vocal group that created one of world music's first minibooms in the late 1980's.

(Sinagra)

THE SWORD (Tonight and Sunday) The Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with thrash bravura. Tonight at 8:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J.,(201) 653-1703; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Sunday at 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village; (212) 982-4052; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)

TINARIWEN (Tonight) This guitar band from the deserts of Mali turns Tuareg culture's acoustic music into a chant-based kind of distended electric blues, addressing the issues of exile, displacement and poverty. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)

WOLFMOTHER (Tuesday) Part of a wave of what's been dubbed ''heritage metal,'' the Australian trio Wolfmother strives to sound like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Sold out. (Sinagra)

WOLF PARADE (Sunday and Monday) Part of Montreal's wave of ''It'' art-pop bands that includes Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out.(Sinagra)

Cabaret

BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)

ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)

Jazz

ALPHABET LOUNGE BIG BAND (Sunday) Led by the pianist Deidre Rodman, this large ensemble expands on the mischievous eclecticism of the Jazz Passengers, with a lineup that includes Kate McGarry on vocals; Roy Nathanson, Ohad Talmor and Jay Rodriguez on saxophones; Sam Bardfeld on violin; and Curtis Fowlkes on trombone. 6 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)

MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Tonight) Pulse and texture shift perpetually in this trio, thanks to the earthy rhythm team of Ben Allison and Jeff Ballard, on bass and drums; but the group's capricious tone is set by Mr. Blake, on tenor and soprano saxophones. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

GARY BURTON'S GENERATIONS (Wednesday through April 15) Mr. Burton, the extravagantly proficient vibraphonist, educator and composer, features younger talent exclusively in this ensemble, reserving a central role for the teenage guitar prodigy Julian Lage. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BILLY CHILDS CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Wednesday through April 16) The pianist and composer Billy Childs favors a billowy sound that often drifts perilously close to New Age. But behind a genteel front line of piano, saxophone, harp and guitar lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Antonio Sanchez on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with 11:30 sets Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 Fridays and Saturdays. (Chinen)

LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for the veteran alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who receives strong support here from Dr. Lonnie Smith on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

SHANE ENDSLEY GROUP (Monday) An ethereal sense of groove guides this chamber ensemble, which enfolds Mr. Endsley's trumpet in a dark cocoon of Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone, guitar, bass and drums. Sharing the bill is Common Thread, a flintier band featuring Mr. Endsley but led by another trumpeter, Jonathan Finlayson. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)

GOOD FOR COWS (Tonight and tomorrow) The bassist Devin Hoff and the drummer Ches Smith constitute this Bay Area duo, which interrogates jazz and punk with equal rigor. Tonight they share the bill with another duo, Sonar, from Brooklyn; tomorrow their second set will feature a special guest, the pianist Vijay Iyer.

JON GORDON QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Gordon, an accomplished alto and soprano saxophonist, projects standards through a slightly warped lens, with the help of Mike Moreno on guitar, Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Chinen)

* BARRY HARRIS AND REGINA CARTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Harris, one of bebop's stalwart pianists, and Ms. Carter, a violinist of sleek composure, both hail from Detroit, a fact that has some bearing on this concert of newly commissioned music, featuring each artist with a separate ensemble. 8, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)

BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday through April 16) Mr. Hart, a loose but focused drummer with a sterling resume, fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

WILL HOLSHOUSER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Holshouser is an accordionist in tune with his instrument's folk legacy, but hardly constricted by it; his longstanding trio, with the trumpeter Ron Horton and the bassist David Phillips, manages a playful sort of melancholy. 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

STANLEY JORDAN TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Jordan applies a distinctive tapping technique to the fretboard of his guitar, producing a harmonic range more suggestive of pianism. His rhythm section consists of Zirque Bonner on bass and Ed Barattini on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)

STEVE LEHMAN GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Lehman, an intense young saxophonist, features his own sharp-cornered compositions in this ensemble, which derives much of its heft from the drumming of Tyshawn Sorey. Wednesday at 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. Thursday at 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JIMMY McGRIFF GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) A powerfully bluesy presence on the Hammond B-3 organ since the early 1960's, Mr. McGriff marked his 70th birthday earlier this week and continues the celebration here. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)

CHARNETT MOFFETT (Monday) Mr. Moffett may be a few years late with his new album, ''Internet'' (Piadrum), but his bass playing is characteristically solid, and he surrounds himself with good musicians -- in this case, the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric McPherson. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $10 at tables with a $5 minimum or $5 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

GRACHAN MONCUR III BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Moncur was one of the first trombonists to make sense of free improvisation, compellingly, in the 1960's; this modern ensemble includes such kindred adventurers as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Michael Blake and the pianist John Hicks. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Through Sunday) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and Odean Pope's signature ensemble (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

SAXOPHONE SUMMIT (Tuesday through April 16) The alto saxophonist Charles McPherson has always nursed a fondness for Charlie Parker's blistering bebop, so his role in this Parker tribute makes perfect sense. So does the supporting cast: Tom Harrell on trumpet, Ronnie Mathews on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC & Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Chinen)

SKIRL RECORDS LAUNCH PARTY (Tuesday) Skirl is an independent label with the stated objective of documenting new music by a Brooklyn-centered cadre of musicians.

Also on hand is a pair of bands with Skirl releases in the foreseeable future: Tyft (Hilmar Jensson on guitar, Andrew D'Angelo on reeds and Jim Black on drums) and Mr. Noriega's trio (with Trevor Dunn on bass and Tom Rainey on drums). 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10.

* HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Through Sunday) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre; in this superb ensemble, his flute and alto saxophone are flanked by cello, oud, acoustic guitar, tuba, trombone and drums. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $20 (Chinen)

ERNIE WATTS-LEW SOLOFF QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Watts, a Los Angeles-based saxophonist, and Mr. Soloff, a New York trumpeter, present a formidable partnership, especially in the presence of Mulgrew Miller on piano, Francois Moutin on bass, and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 8, 10and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

 Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Tomorrow) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. A mostly new cast has taken over, with Yunah Lee as Mimi, Gerard Powers as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black as Musetta, and Philip Torre as Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $45 and $79. (Jeremy Eichler)

'CARMEN' (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) City Opera seems to be finishing its season with a new emphasis on voice. This ''Carmen'' looks as if it is worth hearing, with the strong mezzo Kate Aldrich in the title role, and the soprano Laquita Mitchell making her company debut as Micaela. Robert Breault has already shown he has a strong if unvaried voice as Alfredo in ''La Traviata;'' let's see what he offers in a heavier part, Don Jose. George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 tickets remaining tonight; $45 on Sunday; and $65 to $120 on Tuesday and Thursday. (Anne Midgette)

'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow) A largely decent cast helps bring across Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Elizabeth Caballero, new to the company, is a feisty Donna Elvira who utters little squeaks of indignation when she's not pouring out her heart in melisma; Yeghishe Manucharyan shows his white-toned tenor to advantage as Don Ottavio. Alas, Christopher Schaldenbrand, a talented singer, has not quite grown into the demanding title role. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $25. (Midgette)

'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)

* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he has accomplished this vividly. He taps into the emotions -- jealousy, yearning, fear of death -- that swirl below the surface of this farcical tale about a crusty and miserly bachelor who foolishly decides to take a young wife and disinherit his shiftless nephew. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko; the robust, dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien; and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Maurizio Benini conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $70 to $205 tickets remaining tonight; $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Jurgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production, which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Erika Sunnegardh, who recently made her Met debut as Leonore when Ms. Mattila was ill, sings in the last performance on Thursday. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)

'MANON' (Tomorrow) The news is Renee Fleming, who closes out the run of a signature role in this venerable but appealing Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesus Lopez-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returns may be available. (Midgette)

'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The Met has assembled a strong cast that includes Andrea Rost as Susanna, John Relyea as Figaro, Alice Coote as Cherubino, Soile Isokoski as the Countess, and Peter Mattei as the Count. Mark Wigglesworth conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Allan Kozinn)

'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) The Met's first-rate revival is back again with Hei-Kyung Hong, Frank Lopardo and Dwayne Croft in the major roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $175. (Bernard Holland)

Tomorrow and Sunday, Mark Peskanov and colleagues team up for Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet along with Beethoven and Mozart.

Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler)

ELIOT FISK AND PACO PENA (Monday) Eliot Fisk, the great, high-energy classical guitarist, and Paco Pena, the fine flamenco player, join forces for a recital that includes music by Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Granados, Paganini, Scarlatti, Mendelssohn and Bach, as well as Mr. Pena's own works. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Kozinn)

VADIM GLUZMAN (Tonight) This violinist's program goes all the way from Mozart to Castelnuovo-Tedesco. 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25. (Holland)

GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri is soldiering through another season as the de facto quartet in residence at the Met Museum. Each of the group's concerts features a Mozart chamber composition, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Clarinet Quintet (with David Shifrin), as well as Arriaga's Quartet No. 2 and Dohnanyi's Quartet in A minor. 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)

JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Gerard Schwarz, a hometown conductor heard less in New York these days, conducts the Juilliard's young professional-quality players in Mahler, David Diamond and Behzad Ranjbaran, with the violinist William Harvey. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)

* KRONOS QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) This ensemble's wide-ranging ''Live Mix'' series continues with two concerts in which the boundaries between classical, pop and world music are exceedingly porous. Tonight the quartet plays works by Glenn Branca, best known for his huge electric guitar symphonies, as well as ones by Terry Riley, a founder of Minimalism; the eclectic rock composer J. G. Thirlwell; and the pipa virtuoso Wu Man. Tomorrow the quartet, with the Indian singer Asha Bhosle and the tabla player Zakir Hussain, plays music by the Icelandic band Sigur Ros and the composers Derek Charke, Ram Narayan and Rahul Dev Burman. Tonight at 7:30 at Zankel Hall, tomorrow at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35 tonight, $21 to $72 tomorrow. (Kozinn)

MIAMI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) This excellent group, in residence at the Hartt School in Connecticut, has been admirably committed to contemporary music. But this time, in the essential (and affordable) Peoples' Symphony Concerts series, the quartet is playing works by Haydn, Schumann and Sibelius. ''Intimate Voices,'' the Sibelius quartet, is a deeply personal and hauntingly eclectic work, and may strike some as a bolder score than many works of more recent decades. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Tommasini)

NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leonard Slatkin made a superb recording of John Corigliano's powerful Symphony No. 1 during his years with the St. Louis Symphony, and he is taking it up again with the National Symphony.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today) The orchestra spotlights talent from among its own ranks, with the concertmaster Glenn Dicterow performing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3, and the principal trumpet player Philip Smith as the soloist in Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''American Concerto.'' Bramwell Tovey conducts, adding a Mozart overture and Franck's Symphony. 11 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76. (Eichler)

PEABODY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) The prestigious Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore regularly sends its impressive student ensemble on tour to make music and spread the word about the institution. With its music director, Hajime Teri Murai, the orchestra plays an adventurous program with New York premieres of works by Christopher Theofanidis and Michael Hersch; Paquito D'Rivera's ''Gran Danzon'' (a flute concerto); and Mahler's mighty ''Das Lied von der Erde.'' 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $18. (Tommasini)

* ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The first installments of Valery Gergiev's cycle of Shostakovich's symphonies, with the Kirov Orchestra last month, were both invigorating and revelatory. Mr. Gergiev takes up the project with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with contributions on Sunday from the Riverside Choral Society and the Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir. The programs include the Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 on Sunday, and Nos. 5 and 15 on Monday. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)

* 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's humble, eloquent staging strips Bach's masterpiece to its humane core. No sets, no costumes -- just casually dressed musicians sitting in a circle, and soloists singing in English. Paul Goodwin conducts Rufus Muller, Curtis Streetman, Krisztina Szabo, Suzie LeBlanc, Daniel Taylor, Nils Brown and Stephen Varcoe. Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $30 to $90. (Eichler)

ANDREAS SCHOLL (Tuesday) Countertenors are on the rise, and Mr. Scholl is one of the fastest-rising of the bunch, with a rounded, fluty instrument and a definite flair in how he sings with it. His program is a potpourri, ranging from the late Middle Ages to Haydn and Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Midgette)

TRIBECA NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) ''Music of the Avant-Pop'' is the title for this disparate festival of four concerts extending through May, presented by the avowedly eclectic New York Art Ensemble. This first concert focuses on ''Generation Y,'' with five so-called emerging composers exploring various permutations of acoustic and electronic instruments. 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; $15; $10 for students and 65+.

CHRIS & JUSTIN (Tonight through Sunday) Chris Yon and Justin Jones get this week's best-title award for ''Pear Cowboy Planet,'' which they describe, unfortunately, as a tragicomic triptych about the mysterious properties of addition and subtraction.

JOHN PASSAFIUME DANCERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) A protege of Paul Sanasardo and a former dancer with Anna Sokolow, Mr. Passafiume's new ''Fissures,'' inspired by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, examines the way everyday events can cause fault lines in our perceptions of ourselves.

(Dunning)

SUGAR SALON LAUNCH (Monday) Five panelists, including the choreographer Susan Marshall and Wendy Perron, editor in chief of Dance Magazine, will participate in ''What Does the Future Hold for Women in Modern Dance?''

(Dunning)

 Museums

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)

* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)

* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)

NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through April 24. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally-savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot . 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

* FRANCIS PICABIA: 'WORKS ON PAPER, 1901-1951' Consistent with the predominantly linear, sometimes kitschy imagery of the artist's proto-postmodern transparency paintings, the 100 works on paper here reveal a lifelong involvement with drawing, marked by an indifference to notions of style, taste, consistency, skill or progress. It is both a challenge and a treat. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through April 15. (Smith)

'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab he was working in. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)

RECENT PAINTINGS BY QIN FENG Working in ink and tea on silk-cotton paper, this 45-year-old Chinese artist continues the long tradition of Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, with assists from Japanese sumi-ink painting and Abstract Expressionists like Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. Goedhius Contemporary, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 535-6934, through April 17. (Smith).

Galleries: 57th Street

Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)

'REFLECTIONS OF GODS' Ensconced in a small, chapel-like gallery, this exhibition of nine sacred objects and one hanging screen includes a beautiful 16th-century mask and a 12th-century carved wood sculpture of a Shinto deity holding a Buddhist wish-granting jewel. Mika Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3900, through April 15. (Smith)

* 'SPRING MIST FROM SNOW' This veritable wonder cabinet of furniture, objects and artworks conjures up the rarefied realm of the Chinese scholar's study but also represents other Asian cultures. One stand-out is a Qing wish-granting scepter in carved boxwood that must be among the fountainheads of Art Nouveau; its provenance is listed as ''an old French collection.'' William Lipton Ltd., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 751-8131, through April 15. (Smith)

Galleries: Chelsea

Tara Donovan Known for creating improbable accumulations of ordinary things, Ms. Donovan here has arranged three million plastic cups in stacks from ankle-high to five feet. They make a 50-by-60-foot rectangle on the floor, resembling a lumpy field of snow. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, through April 22. (Johnson)

* Dan Fischer Velvety graphite drawings copied from Xerox copies of book and magazine images of well-known artists like Robert Smithson and Sol LeWitt and artworks like Jeff Koons's iconic ''Rabbit'' evoke and possibly satirize the reverence that some people feel for modern and contemporary art. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, through April 15. (Johnson)

'Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography' This group show updates the careers of artists who gained notice in the 1990's and gives some exposure to others who are still unfamiliar here. The real find is work by two women, Yin Xiuzhen and the formidable young performance artist Chen Qiulin. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through April 15. (Cotter)

Anthony James Call it Industrial Surrealist Chic. Mr. James's works include old heavy-duty power tools displayed in gleaming, mirrored cases; a glass case of white birch tree trunks that seems to extend infinitely by virtue of two-way mirrors; and a life-size, digitally copied female nude of laser-cut aluminum. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through April 15. (Johnson)

Daniel Johnston: 'The Story of an Artist' The nearly 70 ballpoint and felt-tip drawings by this semi-outsider artist and rock musician and 2006 Whitney Biennial pick don't live up to the hype, but they are fun to look at. In a distracted but versatile, faux-adolescent style, the Texas-based Mr. Johnston creates sweet and sometimes hair-raising cartoon improvisations on themes of love, sex, hope, despair and death. Clementine, 632 West 27th Street, (212) 243-5937, through April 15. (Johnson)

Eve K. Tremblay: 'Tales Without Grounds' A rising young Canadian photographer presents glossy staged photographs of people doing enigmatic things in and around a large facility for hydroponic lettuce cultivation. With their cinematically intense colors, Ms. Tremblay's pictures are like stills from a Tarkovskian science fiction movie. Buia, 541 West 23rd Street, (212) 366-9915, through April 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

TIM BARBER A fresh, even touching reprise of the overused convention of walls papered with unframed photographs and small cartoonish drawings, this show has been culled from Mr. Barber's Web site, tinyvices.com. With 250 people represented, it blurs the line between professional and amateur and introduces a savvy curatorial eye. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through April 15. (Smith)

Marcel Broodthaers This reverential exhibition of just three works by a Belgian Conceptualist regarded as a Duchampian saint in some sectors of the art world includes a hat painted white and attached to a canvas painted black and white; a work called ''L'Erreur,'' consisting of 45 eggshells attached to a canvas labeled ''moules,'' the French word for mussels; and a set of canvases neatly inscribed with words relating to the composition and sale of paintings. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through April 15. (Johnson)

Rico Gatson: 'African Fractals' Mr. Gatson's suave geometric paintings and sculptures of symbolically charged vernacular objects -- a whipping post in the form of a Christian cross with wrist-holes, for example -- feature African-style stripe patterns, creating a dialogue between utopian Modernism and tragic social history. A video installation produces hypnotic patterns out of films of the pageantry surrounding the great boxing match between Muhammed Ali and George Foreman that took place in Zaire in 1974. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through April 22. (Johnson)

Joelle Tuerlinckx: 'Drawing Inventory' A prominent Belgian conceptualist presents a dry and oblique installation consisting of a large quantity of ordinary materials more or less related to the art of drawing. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through April 22. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* 'ARTS OF ANCIENT CHINA' A museum-quality selection that begins with an elegant Neolithic red pottery bowl includes rare examples of early lacquer and is especially notable for its profusion of bronze vessels and objects. J. J. Lally, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380; closes Wednesday. (Smith)

THIERRY DE CORDIER AND PIERRE HUYGHE Mr. de Cordier's ''Female Drawings'' evoke blurred, semi-abstract Madonnas and also the recherche style of postwar European figuration. Mr. Huyghe's puppet video, ''This is Not a Time for Dreaming,'' which ruminates on, and was commissioned for, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard -- suffers from obscurity, but is still one of the most beautiful videos made in recent years. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 581-5187; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* REALM OF THE GODS: ART FROM INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA A lavish display of sculptures of Hindu deities and Buddhist monks offers excellent examples of several of India's dynastic and regional styles in bronze, sandstone and terra cotta, along with works from Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia and, especially, Tibet. Carlton Rochell, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7600; closes today. (Smith)

Charlotta Westergren: 'Ahus Sommaren 1974' Preoccupied by her family and ancestry, Ms. Westergren presents a James Turrell-like room with artificial aroma added, designed to simulate the light and smell of a summer home in Sweden. She also presents Swedish wildflowers made of sugar by a professional confectioner and her own reprisals of old paintings by a beloved sister who once aspired to become an artist. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

CORRECTION-DATE: April 12, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A classical music entry in the Listings pages of Weekend on Friday about the National Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, conducted that night by Leonard Slatkin, misidentified the orchestra with which he recorded John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1, which was on the program. It was the National Symphony, not the St. Louis.

HEADLINE: Why Tell the I.R.S. What It Already Knows?

BYLINE: By Austan Goolsbee. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
THE Internal Revenue Service filing deadline is almost upon us, forcing us once again to fill out exasperating tax forms. Spurred on by the grumbling, Congress will most likely make noises about introducing tax reforms that never come about. Experts will again bemoan the deductions and loopholes of the system and the complexity of the alternative minimum tax. 
 Rather than rehash the same old debates, though, we would do better to aim at the middle and ask why most Americans have to do their taxes at all. 
You see, many people do not have a complex tax situation. They don't itemize. They get income only from simple places -- like wages from their job and interest from their bank. And here's the kicker: this information is already sent directly to the Internal Revenue Service by taxpayers' employers and banks. 
 Indeed, for many Americans, literally every line they fill out on their tax return is information the I.R.S. already has. (If you don't believe it, try not filling out the ''wages'' line on your tax return next year and see what happens. You'll receive a notice that states your wages -- and assesses a penalty for not reporting them.) 
 And yet these same people are forced to spend hundreds of millions of hours and several billion dollars each year preparing and filing their taxes. 
 That expense in time and money is as much a part of the tax burden on Americans as the check that goes to the federal government. And unlike the tax payment, this part of the tax burden doesn't generate any revenue for the government, though part of it goes into H&R Block's pocket. It is, in the words of the economists, pure deadweight loss. 
 Which is why the I.R.S. should eliminate it. With a small adjustment in processing procedures, the revenue service could send you a tax form already filled out with the information it has for you -- a Simple Return -- rather than a blank tax form. You would simply check the numbers against your W-2 and 1099 and then sign it. That would be it. If you didn't want to participate, you could just throw the Simple Return away and do your own taxes the old-fashioned way. 
 A system like this is already used in Denmark and Sweden. Last year, California tried a version for its state income tax. According to the California Franchise Tax Board, the system reduced the time people spent doing their state taxes as much as tenfold; around 95 percent of the people who participated in the pilot project said they would use it again. 
 Even without fundamentally changing the tax code, plenty of Americans -- as many as 40 percent of taxpayers -- would be able to qualify for a Simple Return. According to research I did for the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, this could save middle-class Americans up to $2 billion per year in tax preparation fees and 250 million hours of time. At the very least, the program would represent a triumph of common sense over bureaucracy for millions of people.
 Here's another way to think about it: A Simple Return would be the equivalent of giving a tax cut to the middle class but at little cost. Indeed, when the Government Accountability Office analyzed this type of tax system in 1996, it claimed that it would save the I.R.S. money because it would reduce the error rate on the tax returns that people file. (California found this to be true in its pilot project.) For the cost of modernizing the computer matching system within the I.R.S. and the Social Security Administration, we could eliminate the compliance burden for more than one-third of American taxpayers. 
 Many experts say we should tackle complexity where it is most obvious -- the top income brackets. After all, they argue, nearly 40 percent of taxpayers use the easier forms like the 1040EZ.
 But the instruction manual for even the 1040EZ form is 36 pages long. Is it any wonder that almost half of the people filling out the simpler forms still pay a tax preparer to do it for them? Our system is driving people to tax preparers who then get paid for filling out information that the I.R.S. already has. 
 As we contemplate tax reform in the coming year and beyond, many will ponder grand changes to the tax system like moving us from an income to a consumption tax or eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. But tax revolutions are a tough sell these days. And we could do a lot worse than relieving Americans of the burden of doing busywork for the I.R.S.

HEADLINE: Growth's Caprice Angers Some Peruvians 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: ICA, Peru, April 1 

 BODY:
Business has been good for Jose Chlimper, owner of a vast farm carved into the desert here, where workers churn out 50 tons of asparagus a day for markets in the United States and Europe. Production is expected to double by 2009, and the seasonal work force tripled in just five years.
 But even he understands why, with elections on Sunday, voters are in a punishing mood. 
Successive governments, he said, have mismanaged services to the poor, leaving Peru with shoddy schools and poor health services. ''Government has done a very poor job distributing wealth,'' he said, ''therefore growth has not percolated in the way it should have.'' 
 Businesses like his are the motor of an economy that, on paper at least, is considered Latin America's most vibrant, growing by 6.7 percent last year. It is an expansion that should have made President Alejandro Toledo's government more popular and opened the door to another market-friendly administration.
 Instead, polls show that more than half of Peruvians are ready to forget Mr. Toledo, the most unpopular leader in the region, and look past the pro-globalization candidate, Lourdes Flores. 
 Many have tired of the American-inspired free-market model and appear ready to bet on Ollanta Humala, a fierce nationalist who favors scrapping a new trade deal with the United States, or Alan Garcia, a former president whose mismanagement of the economy in the 1980's devastated Peru.
 With exports more than doubling in three years and poverty dipping, the question of why Peru seems set to join the tide of countries that have tilted toward populist leaders goes to the heart of the region's recent political transformation. 
 The new leaders are all quite different when it comes to policies; President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, for instance, has opposed market-driven policies, while Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has embraced them. But they have one thing in common: previously disenfranchised voters put them in power.
 After a generation of erratic fiscal performance, with the economy spiking one year and nearly collapsing the next, Peru has averaged 5 percent growth rate the last four years. Foreign investment last year was twice as high as when Mr. Toledo took office.
 But Peru is a young country, and while its growth has been impressive, Peru needs to register 7 percent growth a year consistently to make any real headway against poverty.
 ''You'd never think that a vote of protest would be justified right now,'' said Fritz Du Bois, director of the Peruvian Economic Institute, a free-market policy analysis group. 
 ''But the big lesson of the appearance of this anti-system vote is that the Peruvian economy has to be much more ambitious. In a young population like we have here, if you grow 4 percent or so a year, you're just stagnant.''
 That fact is not lost on business owners like Mr. Chlimper, 50, the son of Eastern European immigrants. The country is clearly generating jobs, he said, including his business, called Agrokasa, and he believes that still more will come once free trade kicks in. 
 ''But the job deficit is so big that we're not persevering,'' he said. ''We had one year of 6.7 percent growth. But we need 20 years of persevering.''
 Many Peruvians simply cannot wait, and this is reflected in the backing given Mr. Humala, whose talk of increasing state control over the economy had helped give him a slight edge over Ms. Flores in a recent poll by Apoyo Opinion. Another poll, by CPI, shows Ms. Flores with a razor-thin lead. 
 Either way, Ms. Flores may still win the election in the second round, polls show, but Mr. Humala is hoping disillusioned voters put him over the top in the first.
 ''The poor have been forgotten, discriminated against, and what Humala offers is work and change,'' said Justo Paco, 55, a baker who lives in one of Peru's richest regions, Tacna, near the bustling border with Chile. ''The economic model we have now is very bad.''
 In an interview, Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the architect of the economy, acknowledged shortcomings. But he said Peru had built a good base for future growth by putting in place other, little-noticed measures, like collecting more taxes and lowering military spending. The taxes paid by companies have risen to $2.6 billion last year from $877 million in 2001.
 He cautioned, however, that growth would be moderate and stable, far from fast-paced. ''In order to run, you have to learn to walk,'' Mr. Kuczynski said, explaining that extricating Peru from poverty could take a generation.
 With Peruvians clamoring for change, though, the candidates have offered quick fixes. Even Ms. Flores, who is known as a fiscally prudent manager, has promised growth of 7 percent a year and 650,000 new jobs annually, which economists say is unlikely to happen.
 In this coastal region of southern Peru, normally covered by sand as far as the eye can see, asparagus sprouts along row after row of neatly tilled and irrigated plots. Under a broiling sun, workers carefully cut the asparagus.
 Nine hundred employees, all wearing white lab coats, hairnets and plastic rubber boots, then clean the asparagus in special tanks, select the best stalks off a conveyer belt and pack them. The work is tough and repetitive. 
 But for Magdalena Oviedo, 40, who has been employed here five years, it has given her new opportunities. She recently bought a house, she said. Other workers talk of how the region, benefiting from new taxes, has built roads and improved infrastructure.
 ''People are pleased because there used to be no work,'' Ms. Oviedo said. ''People now have a way of making a life.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Wonders if the Goldman Sachs Chief Will Go to Washington 

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Each day as Henry M. Paulson Jr. walks down the lushly carpeted hall to his 30th-floor executive suite at the Goldman Sachs headquarters in Lower Manhattan, he is reminded of the firm's tradition of sending its best and brightest to Washington. 
 On the walls are oil portraits of his predecessors: John C. Whitehead, Robert E. Rubin and Stephen Friedman, all of whom left the firm for careers in government. (His most recent predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, now governor of New Jersey, has yet to sit for his painting.)
For several decades, senior partners at Goldman Sachs have pursued second careers in politics. Now, Mr. Paulson, the firm's chief executive, must decide if he will continue what has become a Wall Street tradition. As speculation builds in Washington that President Bush will move to replace his Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, Mr. Paulson's name has cropped up as a possible choice. 
 Ever true to Goldman's self-negating way, Mr. Paulson, who is 60, has steered studiously clear of expressing any such ambition. At the firm's annual meeting last week, he said that he had not been asked about the job. And, at a management committee meeting late last year, he informed his colleagues that he was committed to remaining at the helm of his firm, according to a person briefed on the meeting. 
 Still, with Goldman's stock trading at historic highs and with his chosen successor, Lloyd C. Blankfein, more than ready for the top job at Goldman, there are those on Wall Street who say that the timing for a move into government could not be better. 
 ''It's like being brought up in a family where public service is highly regarded,'' said Lisa Endlich, the author of ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success'' (Touchstone, 2000), a history of the firm. ''Culture is too weak a word. From the moment he went to work there he was told that this is the higher calling.''
 As of this June, Mr. Paulson will have run the firm for eight years, a period of time that exceeds Mr. Rubin's, Mr. Friedman's and Mr. Corzine's and matches Mr. Whitehead's stint as co-chairman, which ended in 1984. 
 But, even if Mr. Paulson forgoes a trip to Washington, his long tenure as chief executive, as well as the increased time, energy and capital he has devoted to his deep interest in environmental issues, has led to talk that, like his predecessors, he may have his eye on more public pursuits. 
 Last week, he made a gift of $100 million in Goldman stock to a family foundation dedicated to conservation and environmental education. Even after the gift, Mr. Paulson has a net worth of more than $500 million and has said privately that he plans to give his fortune away. 
 The donation was further proof of Mr. Paulson's unflagging devotion to a cause that generally does not rank high among Wall Street chief executives. Mr. Paulson, who shuns golf for bird-watching walks in Central Park, is the chairman of the Nature Conservancy and the chairman emeritus of the Peregrine Fund.
 And he has not shied away from mixing the business of Goldman with his environmental activism. Goldman Sachs is one of the few Wall Street firms that has a detailed environmental policy. Last year, the firm, at Mr. Paulson's request, donated 680,000 acres in Chile to the Wildlife Conservation Society. The move elicited a shareholder resolution from an activist group that broadly accused Mr. Paulson of putting his own personal environmental passions ahead of shareholder interests. The resolution was voted down.
 Driving much of the talk about Mr. Paulson and the Treasury post has been the recent appointment of Joshua B. Bolten, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to be the president's chief of staff. Mr. Bolten recruited Mr. Friedman, now a board member of Goldman, to a top job as the president's economic adviser and he has a relationship with Mr. Paulson as well. 
 Republicans have been pushing the White House to find a more forceful public advocate to promote what they see to be the underappreciated strengths of the American economy: low unemployment, robust economic growth and a resilient stock market. And while Mr. Snow has done his best, the feeling is that a Wall Street executive with better communication skills might be in a better position to make the case that the economy and the financial markets can continue to thrive despite growing federal budget and trade deficits.
 While Mr. Paulson's status as the dean of Wall Street chief executives makes him an obvious candidate, White House officials are also interested in attracting a black chief executive, according to a person who has been briefed on the administration's plans. This person said that Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner, has already been approached, unsuccessfully, and that other prominent executives like E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, are also high on the administration's wish list. Mr. O'Neal was approached for the job in 2004, but has made clear his intent to remain with Merrill Lynch. 
 Mr. Paulson, who is recognized for his relentless courting of corporate clients, has an infectious ardor and a web of influential ties in important areas like China, India and Europe that could make him an effective salesman for the administration's trade policies. A committed Republican and prominent fund-raiser for the president during the 2004 campaign, Mr. Paulson has a love of the outdoors that recalls Theodore Roosevelt, although in his case one would substitute binoculars for an elephant gun. 
 But in an administration that largely sets economic policy within the White House and then expects cabinet members to toe the line, Mr. Paulson's independence might remind some of Paul H. O'Neill, the president's first Treasury secretary, who frequently clashed with the administration. A Christian Scientist who does not drink or smoke, Mr. Paulson is also known to have a streak of rectitude that sometimes bemuses his peers on Wall Street.
 In 2002, at the peak of the wave of corporate scandals, Mr. Paulson gave a speech calling for governance and accounting reforms as well as fresh attention to avoiding conflicts of interest.
 More than anything though, Mr. Paulson may be reluctant to take on a Treasury Department job that in comparison to the stature it commanded during Mr. Rubin's time under President Clinton, carries much less punch in the present administration. He would also be leaving what many consider to be the best job on Wall Street.
 Goldman's stock closed yesterday at $162.04, just pennies off its record high. The firm's model of offering blue-chip advice while also making aggressive bets with its own capital has become the envy of the financial industry.

HEADLINE: The Indian Nuclear Deal

 BODY:
With the exception of a few die-hard protectionists, most Americans -- this page included -- applaud President Bush's desire to build a stronger relationship with India. The world's largest democracy, with one billion people, a fast-growing economy and a lively political system, is central to America's strategic interests. 
 But the notion of advice and consent must include the ability for lawmakers to balk when the price for something becomes too high. Such is the case now, as the Bush administration tries to get Congress to approve the very bad nuclear deal it has struck with India.
The pact would allow India to make an end run around the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty's basic bargain -- that countries renounce nuclear weapons in exchange for the right to import sensitive nuclear technology to produce energy. 
 America has imposed nuclear export restrictions on India because India refuses to sign the treaty and has tested a nuclear device that uses materials and technology diverted from its civilian nuclear program.
 In trying to give India a special exemption, Mr. Bush is threatening a carrot-and-stick approach that has been effective for more than 35 years. It is the legal basis on which Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is trying to build a coalition against Iran's nuclear program. The treaty has persuaded countries like South Korea, Japan and Brazil to forgo nuclear weapons. 
 Senator Richard Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, asked Secretary Rice all the right questions during her testimony before the committee on Wednesday. Unfortunately he, along with Senator Joseph Biden, the panel's ranking Democrat, appear likely to support the deal. The central question, Mr. Lugar says, is, ''How important is India?''
 We beg to differ. The central question is not the importance of India, but rather the importance of deterring a global nuclear arms race.

HEADLINE: In Russia, a Warning of 'Irrational Exuberance'

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 6 

 BODY:
Russian stocks, buoyed by high oil prices and a surge of foreign investment, have been soaring. After an 83 percent gain in the RTS stock index last year -- the best stock market performance outside the Middle East in 2005 -- the index is up nearly 33 percent so far this year. 
 That market boom has multiplied the already apparent signs of wealth in the Russian capital. A Lamborghini dealership has opened. Airline travel has picked up. A trade fair for companies aimed at millionaire customers came to Moscow. 
Amid the optimism and enthusiasm, one man is striking a discordant note. 
 Oleg V. Vyugin, Russia's top market regulator, has repeatedly taken to issuing dour warnings.
 Recently he has cautioned that the Russian market is showing some ''alarming signs'' of become too expensive compared with other emerging markets that have been the darlings of global investors for the last year. 
 ''Russia was considered a desirable object for investment,'' he said. ''This drove the market up. But that flow will not last forever.''
 Institutional investors, he noted, have already snapped up most of the bargains in oil, telecommunications and consumer companies. Future growth will come slower, he cautioned.
 Mr. Vyugin, the head of the Federal Financial Markets Service, emphasized that he did not believe that the stock market was overheated or overvalued relative to the profitability of the companies listed. Rather, he said, the potential problem lies in the volatility of the huge flows of money from Western emerging-market funds.
 Foreign money, he said, ''flows in and it will flow out.'' 
 Emerging markets from Asia to South America have done very well for institutional investors in the last year, and Russia has been a particular favorite. In the first three months of this year, through March 29, investors put more than $3.4 billion into Russia out of a total flow to emerging markets of $24.2 billion, according to Brad P. Durham, managing director of Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, a company based in Cambridge, Mass. 
 Russia's weighting in global emerging market funds, known as GEM funds, rose from 4 percent at the beginning of 2005 to 6.6 percent at the end of the year, he said, indicating growing interest compared with other markets. 
 Mr. Vyugin, 53, a lanky, bespectacled man who wears drab charcoal suits and has a shock of unruly gray hair, seems to relish the role of reclusive naysayer in a garish boomtown. 
 Analysts praise his grasp of economics and staid mannerisms, and take his past as a Soviet-trained mathematician as a sign of intellectual rigor. In a city of scandals, intrigue and overnight fortunes, where businesses are sometimes raided by masked gunmen, Russia may need a market regulator who by his own admission rarely leaves his apartment except to go to work, they say.
 ''He has a scientific background, and people appreciate that,'' said Anton A. Strochenovsky, an economist at Troika Dialog bank, where Mr. Vyugin worked as a banker in the 1990's. ''He's quite reasonable. His views are solid.''
 Russia passed an obscure but important barrier this year, Mr. Vyugin and analysts say. For six years after the economic crisis of 1998, Russian companies traded at a price-to-earnings ratio that was lower than those for most other emerging markets. 
 Now, Russia is projected to trade at a ratio of 13.3 in 2006, compared with an average of 12.3 in emerging markets, according to calculations by Mr. Durham's company. 
 This winter, Gazprom began trading at a higher price-to-earnings ratio than Exxon Mobil, according to a report by Hermitage Capital, a Moscow fund with investments in Gazprom. 
 ''Russia has been a market like Brazil that traded below the average,'' Mr. Durham said. ''That has changed.'' Russia is no longer cheap.
 Chris Weafer, the chief analyst at Alfa Bank, said, ''Certainly, there's an element of foreign money chasing the BRIC scene,'' referring to the emerging market category of Brazil, Russia, India and China. ''It is the type of money that would reverse out if Russia was getting too expensive or there was a problem.''
 Still, Peter Westin, an economist at MDM Bank in Moscow, said Russian companies do not look overpriced compared with Indian and Chinese companies. ''We might be getting into that period, but we're not there yet,'' he said.
 Back in the office of Mr. Vyugin, the regulator, he said that for now oil prices and United States interest rates were working in Russia's favor. His warnings, he said, were meant only for new private investors in Russia who risk buying in at the top of the market. He switched into English briefly to recall Alan Greenspan's caution against ''irrational exuberance.''
 Then he glumly admitted he did not think his warning would have much effect. ''I can't teach brokers whether the market is overheated,'' he said. ''They know better than us, I hope.''

HEADLINE: Pollution Pact Gets Maryland As 8th Member

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Maryland is joining a regional consortium of Northeast states committed to reducing smokestack emissions that cause pollution and contribute to global climate change. 
 Legislation signed into law yesterday by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. calls for severely reducing pollution from Maryland power plants that produces smog, acid rain and harmful ozone, while also capping those plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas. 
 Under the new law, Maryland next year will join seven other states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that agreed in 2005 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 10 percent by 2019 while establishing the nation's first market system for trading greenhouse gas credits.
 The multistate effort, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, has been widely seen as an effort to establish a national model that could be followed by other states in the absence of significant action by the federal government to create a national greenhouse gas program. 
 Maryland is more reliant on coal-fired power plants than are the other states in the regional pact, and the enactment of such tough pollution control legislation there is considered a major environmental victory. 
 Utilities and big businesses have expressed fears that caps imposed by the program will increase the cost of electricity and weaken the reliability of the system. But economic forecasts and extensive modeling done by the states have found that there should be no effect on the supply of electricity and that prices will rise only slightly, if at all. 
 Still, having negotiated with the other states for two years, Massachusetts and Rhode Island withdrew from the group in December, citing fears about prices and supplies. When Governor Ehrlich, a first-term Republican, and Maryland utility companies expressed similar concerns about prices, the legislation was amended to require a comprehensive study of reliability and cost issues. If the issues are not resolved, the new law allows the state to withdraw from the regional consortium after Jan. 1, 2009.
 Besides linking Maryland to the regional group's caps on carbon dioxide, the law also sets some of the toughest in-state limits for three other serious pollutants from generating plants. Nitrogen oxide will be capped at 20,216 tons a year by 2009. Sulfur dioxide levels will be limited to 48,618 tons a year by 2010. And mercury emissions are to be reduced 80 percent by 2010.

HEADLINE: Ports Debacle Leads to Fears of Bad Case, Bad Law 

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

 BODY:
CONGRESS has begun to overhaul the obscure legal process by which the White House reviews mergers and acquisitions by foreigners of American companies -- from rocket manufacturers to software makers -- that are vital to the national security.
 That effort has provoked a powerfully unified lobbying response in Congress by domestic and foreign business interests, as well as some major Wall Street firms. Those interests are deeply concerned that the lawmakers have embarked on a course that could both chill foreign investment in the United States and provoke retaliatory restrictions in foreign countries. Last week, the Senate Banking Committee unanimously adopted one measure that would make the process more rigorous and transparent. After the April recess, the House is expected to consider a similar bill. 
 The legislation is a response to the furor over the failed effort two months ago by a Dubai-owned company to buy a group of port terminals in the United States. That deal was blessed by the administration's legal review team but was unwound after being criticized Republicans and Democrats who said that it was not carefully scrutinized and that members of the administration and of Congress were never notified about it. 
 ''The Dubai deal showed that nobody knew anything,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Banking Committee. Mr. Shelby sponsored what has emerged as the central Senate bill on the subject. ''The president didn't know about the deal, the Treasury secretary didn't know about it,'' he said. ''The process is flawed and it needs to be fixed.''
 Administration officials and their political allies say that the review process worked fine and that the only problem was a political miscalculation and a failure to notify important lawmakers adequately.
 Indeed, the White House was so confident in its handling of the Dubai deal before it collapsed that an administration official told at least one trade lawyer that it had become the model for efficiently handling foreign transactions.
 The administration has argued strenuously against major changes to the review process, which is undertaken largely in secret by an interagency organization known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. 
 That committee, led by the Treasury secretary, includes representatives from 12 agencies and departments from the White House as well as a variety of economic, law enforcement and national security offices. In theory, it is supposed to make recommendations about deals to the president. 
 Under the review process, the committee performs a 30-day review of any deal that could pose a threat to national security. In rare instances, the committee can open an additional 45-day investigation that is more rigorous. As a practical matter, the committee has approved the vast majority of deals. Since the process was created, the president has ordered divestiture in only one case: in 1990, the first President Bush ordered a Chinese aerospace company to end its ownership of an American aircraft parts maker. In a handful of other instances, companies have withdrawn proposed acquisitions after hearing objections from law enforcement or national security agencies. 
 The deals the committee is now reviewing include Toshiba's $5.4 billion purchase of Westinghouse Electric. The committee is also expected to study the proposed $13.4 billion merger of Lucent Technologies with Alcatel of France. 
 Trade lawyers have expressed concern that many of the changes proposed by Congress would lengthen reviews and that making the process more transparent would make it easier for rival and losing bidders in corporate takeovers to manipulate the system and marshal opposition to deals that would have received little public scrutiny under the old rules. 
 Lawmakers are also facing other political concerns that have made the fight difficult for big business: national security, terrorism and a growing sentiment toward protectionism. As a result, the debate has not broken along partisan lines.
 Stuart E. Eizenstat, a trade lawyer at Covington & Burling, said the current effort to change the rules reminded him of the maxim about bad cases making bad law. 
 ''Red flags were raised about having an Arab country owning a port terminal -- never mind that it is an ally and that the acquisition had little to do with security,'' said Mr. Eizenstat, who played a central role in Cfius reviews as a senior official in the Clinton administration.. ''That was combined with the backlash against globalization and the devil's brew of an election cycle where everyone is preoccupied by national security and terrorism issues. It was the perfect storm.''
 John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives of major American corporations, said that the latest effort to extend the review and make it more transparent could threaten foreign investment and incite retaliatory action by other countries.
 ''Ultimately what we may be seeing, and this is only heightened by being an election year, is a return to economic isolationism,'' he said. 
 Senator Shelby dismissed concerns that his bill could result in too much transparency and create a chilling climate for foreign investment. 
 ''That's a bogus complaint,'' he said. ''We're not talking about releasing proprietary information. Any business that is trying to buy another one needs to have information protected.''
 He said the legislation was carefully written to encourage foreign investment while making the administration more vigorous in approaching national security issues.
 Among the dozen or so bills introduced in the House, the most troublesome to business and Wall Street was introduced by Representative Duncan L. Hunter, the California Republican who heads the House Armed Services Committee. It would prohibit foreign investment in about a quarter of the United States economy unless the foreign investor put the assets in a trust under control of American citizens. 
 A more moderate bill is expected to be introduced by three senior Republicans: Roy D. Blunt, the House majority whip from Missouri; Michael G. Oxley, the Financial Services Committee chairman from Ohio, and Deborah D. Pryce, also of Ohio, who is chairwoman of the Financial Services subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy.
 Corporate groups and trade lawyers hope Congress addresses the process sooner rather than later; the two groups fear that as Election Day draws closer, lawmakers will be more sensitive to national security and terrorism issues than economic concerns.
 ''There are people running for re-election who are concerned that whatever advantage they have on national security issues will be eroded,'' Mr. Castellani said. ''It is a challenging dynamic.''

HEADLINE: House Republicans Abandon Budget Effort

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
House Republican leaders on Thursday abandoned their efforts to win approval of a budget for the coming year after they were unable to bridge widening differences on fiscal policy in their party. 
 The decision to halt the budget debate hours after it had begun and send lawmakers home for a two-week spring recess was the latest and clearest illustration of the Republicans' difficulties in holding lawmakers together with a crucial election approaching.
After struggling all week to round up votes for the budget, House leaders abruptly threw in the towel when they could not find a compromise to appease conservatives who want new budget rules and members of the Appropriations Committee who see those rules as cutting into their power. 
 ''We're hung up on the process right now,'' said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
 The decision also dashed Republican hopes of giving final approval to a $70 billion package of tax cuts before the recess, although reaching that deal quickly was always viewed as a long shot. Republican leaders said they would try again to reach a consensus on the budget when lawmakers return in late April. 
 ''We're going to stay at it,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the majority leader.
 But with the Congressional calendar advancing, the push for a budget blueprint is likely to diminish as the House and the Senate turn to trying to write the detailed spending bills. 
 Mr. Boehner acknowledged this week that if the budget could not be completed quickly, the House might have to proceed without one. 
 Democrats said the budget failure was a vivid sign of Republican disarray. ''They are out of ideas, they are out of energy, and they are out of time,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
 Winning approval of the annual budget is always difficult, and the troubles have been accentuated this year by election anxiety. 
 Conservatives, arguing that Republican voters want to see signs of renewed fiscal discipline, have insisted on holding the line on spending and putting new budget rules in place. Moderates, worried about Republican lawmakers in swing districts, have pushed for added spending on health and education programs. 
 A significant new obstacle emerged Thursday when Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, urged panel members to oppose the budget if it included a provision limiting the committee's control over emergency spending used to pay for military operations and disaster relief.
 ''I cannot and will not support a resolution that greatly diminishes Congress's ability to respond to national disasters and makes it more difficult for us to get our budget work done on time,'' said Mr. Lewis, who placed blame for the budget failure on the ''whims of a few'' who were insisting on new rules.
 Conservatives said they had reached a general agreement with the leadership on budget rules and a pledge to vote on a line-item veto and were willing to allow the budget to move forward. 
 ''Our members were deeply committed to achieving meaningful budget reform,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana and head of the House conservative caucus.
 The budget had been looming as an important moment for Mr. Boehner, who was elected earlier this year to replace Representative Tom DeLay of Texas as majority leader. 
 Mr. Boehner interceded to try to find a compromise acceptable to the feuding branches of his party, to demonstrate his ability to deliver a victory on a tough issue. 
 Like the Senate, the House budget rejected some recommendations by President Bush for new cuts in Medicare and other politically sensitive programs. But the House held to Mr. Bush's overall cap of $873 billion on spending controlled by Congress, while the Senate broke that limit and added $7 billion for health and education programs.
 Democrats assailed the Republican plan, saying it was stingy with social spending and cleared the way for tax cuts for the affluent that would increase the deficit. 
 ''The Republican budget was red ink as far as the eye could see, and betrayed our national security by slashing funding for crucial initiatives to keep our country safe,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader.
 Republican authors of the budget agreed that it would add to the deficit, but blamed the Sept. 11 attacks, the war in Iraq, new domestic security needs and Hurricane Katrina.
 ''It is never easy to write a budget, and is particularly challenging to do when those kind of things hit you, not just one at a time, but at one time,'' said Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Budget Committee.

HEADLINE: The Rural Digital Divide

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Blacks Turn to Internet Highway, and Digital Divide Starts to Close'' (front page, March 31) offers great news about the rapidly closing ''digital divide'' between white and black Americans. But a different digital divide continues to persist today between rural and urban Americans. 
A recent study found that fewer than one in four rural Americans have access to broadband. Those of us who live in rural America know that's an inflated estimate. And those of us with access know we can expect to pay as much as $100 a month for the luxury.
 In the end, much of rural America faces a self-fulfilling spiral of circumstances: lack of broadband leads to a lack of access to information, which leads to fewer economic opportunities, which lead to lower incomes, which lead to fewer broadband options.
 If equal access and opportunity are what our society seeks to provide, perhaps it's time we work to close the real digital divide before it swallows a large section of our country.

HEADLINE: Handshake Across Hudson Is Forged at Ground Zero

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It is a relationship that has always played out like a messy divorce: New York mayors and New Jersey governors hurling grenades across the Hudson, squabbling over everything from development rights and sports franchises to state boundaries and jobs.
 But in recent weeks, that tension has been replaced by an intriguing alliance, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has teamed up with his fellow magnate-turned-politician, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, to pressure Gov. George E. Pataki and revive the stalled agenda for redeveloping ground zero. 
Behind the men's approach is a businesslike concern with the bottom line, with both leaders convinced that Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease to the World Trade Center site, does not have the financial resources to construct the Freedom Tower and several other buildings and could default on the project before it is completed.
 ''There is a common perspective on where things are headed absent intervention,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. ''To the extent that the Port Authority's resources are threatened, the mayor sees it as a negative thing for New York, and clearly Governor Corzine sees the Port Authority in the same way. I think in this case there's a very natural symmetry of interest.''
 For years, Mr. Pataki, who wants the Freedom Tower built first, has taken the lead in dealing with Mr. Silverstein, who leased the World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey six weeks before it was destroyed.
 But last week, as Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silverstein appeared to close in on an agreement to turn over control of the Freedom Tower to the Port Authority, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Bloomberg raised questions about the financing, and the talks fell apart. Now, with Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Corzine working in tandem, they are negotiating with Mr. Pataki on a deal that they can present to Mr. Silverstein.
 On Wednesday, the three met for hours and yesterday Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki said that some progress had been made.
 Aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Corzine declined to divulge any details of their discussions for fear of jeopardizing the delicate negotiations. But the unusual alliance between the two men, both self-financed politicians who made their fortunes on Wall Street, may say as much about their similar backgrounds and relationship as it does about their mutual interests.
 The evolving relationship differs markedly from the rancor that characterized ties between previous mayors and New Jersey governors.
 Mayor Edward I. Koch, for instance, once symbolically boarded up the entrance to the Holland Tunnel over the loss of jobs to New Jersey. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman offered this response when she learned of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to send garbage to New Jersey: ''Drop dead.''
 But Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Corzine have a relationship and shared history that is allowing them to see ground zero in similar terms. 
 ''They seem to be of the same mind because they are looking at the deal as businessmen, and not from the parochial interests of New York or New Jersey,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's chief of staff, adding that they were instead trying to ensure that the ''tollpayers'' on both sides of the river reap the most benefit.
 It also cannot hurt matters that New Jersey will want to hold onto New York's support for a key Port Authority plan: to build a $6 billion rail tunnel beneath the Hudson to Midtown Manhattan, although Mr. Shea said that was not part of the ground zero discussions.
 Aides said that although the men are not close friends, they have known each other for years as members of the same Wall Street moneyed elite involved in philanthropic, public-minded causes. In addition, Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Corzine was co-chairman, is an important client of Mr. Bloomberg's company, Mr. Doctoroff said.
 Mr. Shea said that when Mr. Corzine would stop by the Bloomberg offices for radio interviews during his 2000 Senate campaign, he would always make time to chat with Mr. Bloomberg.
 ''They come from the same world and the fact that they can communicate helps,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonpartisan planning group. ''Neither of them have come to politics through the usual channels and they are both obviously very public spirited, but they are also people who understand how the economy works. This time there's a lot of common ground.''
 Aides to both the mayor and Mr. Corzine said that the two men independently reached the same conclusions, also shared by some Port Authority officials, about Mr. Silverstein's financial outlook. Mr. Doctoroff said that City Hall had been in discussions with the Port Authority about the fate of ground zero for a few months and with Mr. Corzine's office for a few weeks.
 Describing the mayor's involvement in bistate relations, Mr. Doctoroff said, ''The mayor has a recognition of the importance of the Port Authority to the regional economy and the economy of New York in a way that maybe previous mayors haven't had.''

HEADLINE: Pace Slowed, But Borrowing Rose 1.8% 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing in the United States increased at a slower pace in February, a Federal Reserve report showed yesterday. Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, rose $3.3 billion, or 1.8 percent at an annual rate, to $2.164 trillion, the Fed said. The gain followed a revised January increase of $6.1 billion. 
 Credit growth has dropped from last year's peak of $11.1 billion in August as rising incomes allowed Americans to curb borrowing and more consumers tapped the equity in their homes.
''Consumers have continued to drive consumption more out of total income growth than out of credit expansion,'' said John Herrmann, director of economic commentary at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ''Consumers are well aware that they have to rein in credit relative to personal disposable income.''
 Consumer credit was forecast to rise $3 billion in February, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists, after an originally reported increase of $3.9 billion in January. Forecasts ranged from a decline of $1 billion to an increase of $5.9 billion. Nonrevolving credit, which includes car and personal loans, rose $2.5 billion in February after gaining $3.9 billion a month earlier, according to the Fed's report.
 Revolving debt like credit cards rose $803 million in February after increasing $2.2 billion in January. Growth in nonmortgage credit has slowed as consumers exploited the five-year housing boom to take out home-equity loans, which are a cheaper source of financing than credit cards.

HEADLINE: Now in the Rearview Mirror: Low Gasoline Prices 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
This weekend, Maria Bland says she will be driving around in a pristine Ford F-150 truck, picking up her dryer and dishwasher from the repair store and enjoying a smooth ride in Miami's sunny weather. 
 She will also be saving on her gasoline bill: Ms. Bland, a secretarial assistant at a technical high school, is renting the truck for the weekend rather than drive her 13-year old GMC pickup, which gets much poorer mileage. Ms. Bland, who has been renting regularly as gasoline prices have risen, said, ''Sometimes, nothing will do like a rental.''
Across the country, Alex Patel, a real estate investor who lives near San Francisco, recently bought a hybrid Lexus to improve his fuel mileage. He regularly checks the Web for the cheapest service stations in his neighborhood. Still, he spends $50 each week to fill up his tank, a lot considering that he drives 30,000 to 40,000 miles a year. 
 ''I never used to give gasoline a second thought,'' said Mr. Patel, 31. ''Now, I am more likely to drive a few extra blocks to save a few pennies here and there.'' 
 Drivers are once again feeling pain at the pump. Prices have soared in recent weeks, reaching a national average of $2.61 a gallon for regular gasoline, 36 cents more than at this time last year, according to AAA. In California, drivers have paid $3 a gallon and more. 
 Analysts warn that gasoline prices could jump further when the driving season begins. Yet there have been no shortages or hurricanes to blame for the high cost of fuel this year. Now, strong demand, limited growth in supplies and instability in some of the leading oil-producing nations are all contributing to more volatile oil markets, therefore higher gasoline prices.
 Americans are increasingly facing the fact that inexpensive gasoline, like airline meals, has become a thing of the past. ''Motorists need to prepare themselves for the possibility that gasoline will continue to go up each year,'' said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the national office of AAA in Heathrow, Fla. ''There will be peaks and valleys, but prices will keep going up.''
 A. J. Teixeira, who works as an information technology specialist for the World Bank in Washington, says that since Hurricane Katrina drove up gas prices, he cut down on his family's twice-a-month weekends at their Ocean City, Md., beach house, and now does the 300-mile round trips only once a month. If gasoline prices rise more -- as he expects they will -- Mr. Teixeira might make minor adjustments to his routine, including carpooling when taking his two children to school or cutting down on trips to the mall.
 ''I struggle to adjust to the reality of higher prices,'' Mr. Teixeira said. ''Our lifestyle is designed around the car and cheap gasoline. There's very little we can do about it to reduce our dependency on our automobiles -- between the schools, the children's activities, the soccer practice, and the rest, nothing is within walking distance anymore.''
 Unsurprisingly, the volatility of crude oil, which has doubled in price over the last two years, is the primary driver of gasoline prices. Oil accounts for about 60 percent of the price of gasoline -- the rest is broken down among taxes, 20 percent, and then refining and marketing costs, which remain fairly constant. Yesterday, oil futures in New York traded at $67.39 a barrel. 
 After Hurricane Katrina, gasoline prices briefly increased above an average $3 a gallon nationally when refineries along the Gulf Coast were shut down. That brought prices, once adjusted for inflation, above records reached during the oil shocks of the late 1970's and early 1980's. There were even short-lived gasoline lines as supplies failed to reach consumers.
 To be sure, producers are starting to make the huge investments that will eventually increase the world's production, but that process will take years to complete. Meanwhile, there is very little extra oil to put on the market to damp prices.
 With such a tenuous -- and unstable -- system, there is not much margin for error, said Jan Stuart, an economist at UBS in New York.
 ''The big wild card this year is that there's little to no room for anything to go wrong,'' Mr. Stuart said, ''and certainly nothing like a refinery blowing up or a hurricane hitting the coast.'' 
 Still, the biggest surprise so far is that high prices seem to have had little impact on driving habits. Gasoline demand, which averaged 9.1 million barrels a day last month, remains very strong; in fact, it is up by 2 percent since January 2004 when oil prices began to rise. Analysts are puzzled. 
 ''The real question is, What will consumers do?'' said John Felmy, the chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group. ''That's a key part of the equation.'' 
 In Washington, the prospect of high energy prices during an election year has spurred Congress into action. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced a bill aimed at increasing competition in the oil and gas industry and strengthening antitrust regulations. 
 While demand remains robust, there have also been mounting concerns about gasoline supplies, especially this summer. 
 Indeed, refiners have been hard pressed to catch up with rising demand. While refining capacity has increased in recent years, it has been outpaced by the growth in consumption. The domestic capacity is around 17 million barrels of oil a day, but the country consumes some 20.5 million barrels of oil products a day, nearly half of that as gasoline. 
 To make up the difference, the nation has grown increasingly dependent on imports of a wide range of petroleum products, chief among them gasoline. For example, gasoline imports reached one million barrels a day last year, or nearly 11 percent of the country's daily needs. 
 Faced with strong public and political pressure, refiners announced in recent months plans to increase the country's total capacity by about 1.4 million barrels by 2010, according to Bob Slaughter, the head of the refiners' trade group.
 ''This year presents the refining industry with several significant challenges,'' Mr. Slaughter said. ''But we are experts at trying to make the whole supply system work.'' 
 Still, he added, ''In any scenario, the imports are going to continue going up.''
 The problem is that some imports from European or Caribbean refiners might not be available much longer as the United States tightens it environmental regulations. This year for example, refiners must start producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel that meets standards much more stringent than those in Europe. 
 ''Will foreign refiners step up and meet this increased demand from the United States? That's really uncertain now,'' said Mr. Felmy of the petroleum institute. 
 Also, many analysts have voiced concerns about the industry's move to abandon a popular but highly controversial additive to gasoline, called methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, and replace it with ethanol by May. The Energy Department issued a stark report in February that warned of a possible shortfall of 130,000 barrels a day, which ethanol producers might not be able to fill. The Senate also held hearings late last month to warn refiners about potential shortages this summer. 
 Consumers seemed somewhat resigned to paying more for gasoline.
 ''I understand it's a matter of supply and demand and there is now more competition for energy resources around the world,'' said Roger Smith, a 40-year-old senior software engineer with Apple Computer in Cupertino, Calif. ''Whoever's willing to pay the higher price is going to gain access. But there is always that straw that will break the camel's back and cause people to change their driving habit.''
 ''If gasoline reached $4,'' Mr. Smith said, ''I'd think twice about driving to the supermarket to buy milk.''

HEADLINE: Finding Happiness In the Pursuit

BYLINE: By M. P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
ONE of the great puzzles of human nature is why humans strive for more material things -- money, jobs, homes, cars, flat-screen televisions -- when they do not seem to make them any happier in the long run.
 Philosophers have pondered this conundrum for centuries, and modern economists have been examining it over several decades in a multitude of cultures. Not only does greater wealth not guarantee happiness -- even when you get what you want -- research indicates that you will not find it as satisfying as you had hoped, and you will want something else. 
Richard A. Easterlin, professor of economics at the University of Southern California, is a seminal researcher in this area. In effect, his work shows that if you think buying a three-bedroom condo and a Honda Element will make you happy, you had better think twice. In a few years, a) you're not likely to report being any happier, and b) you're likely to say that, now, finding a good private school for your children and buying a vacation home will really make you happy.
 In Dr. Easterlin's view, this cycle of desire and dissatisfaction tends to keep people on an endless treadmill. This may sound self-defeating, but that is Dr. Easterlin's point. Why not get off the treadmill and pursue a life with fewer material ambitions? You would probably be happier.
 Or would you? If material achievements tend to leave people only momentarily fulfilled, why do so many keep reaching for that next goal?
 Claudia Senik, professor of economics at the Sorbonne, believes that the struggle for a certain achievement may offer a peculiar reward all its own. Although many people seem quite goal-oriented -- especially when it comes to money, homes, cars, new kitchens and other goods that have become stand-ins for status -- maybe it's not so much having the stuff that people really enjoy, but the struggle to obtain it.
 In an unpublished paper called ''Is Man Doomed to Progress?'' which she presented at a symposium, ''Economics and Happiness,'' last month at U.S.C., Dr. Senik examined the impact of anticipating future gains on a person's current level of well-being.
 Researchers have noted that, for example, given the opportunity to schedule a fancy meal, many people tend to postpone the feast -- to savor the anticipation of it. In fact, Dr. Senik found that when people aspire to a better quality of life within the next 12 months, the attempt to reach that goal alone -- the anticipation independent of the outcome -- seems to bestow happiness in the present. 
 ''For the basic person there is pleasure in progress,'' Dr. Senik said. ''We are proud to aim at something -- to earn a degree, buy a house. So when I work to reach a higher position or earn a higher income, I'm already happy today.''
 Dr. Senik compares it somewhat humorously to being invited to a fabulous party. ''Once you get there, maybe you enjoy the party or maybe you don't -- but that doesn't matter because you've already spent the last few days looking forward to it.''
 Of course, that is not how most people view the quest for a better job, nicer car or bigger home. The glory is in getting what you want. Yet we have all experienced the phenomenon -- behavioral economists call it adaptation -- whereby once you attain whatever you most covet, it quickly loses its luster. Dr. Senik's research suggests that it's fine to crave the condo and the car as long as you realize there may be more pleasure in striving for those goals than in actually achieving them.
 I find this oddly comforting, because like many people I am well acquainted with materialistic treadmills, and they are exhausting. You can feel like Sisyphus, pushing a boulder uphill over and over again to get the things you want.
 It may seem that people are all hapless consumers, at the mercy of greed and needs (or cursed by Zeus). But Dr. Senik offers a more positive view. You can let go of the rather iffy rewards of getting and spending, and look for everyday pleasure while struggling to advance, improve, progress, achieve and attain. 
 As Dr. Easterlin said, ''If you recognize that the striving can be of value in itself, then instead of taking a job that pays you the most, you may be better off taking work you'll enjoy.'' In other words, choose your treadmills carefully. Like Sisyphus, they're where most of us will spend our time.

HEADLINE: Solid Jobs Report Renews Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Solid employment data renewed Wall Street's inflation worries and sent shares skidding yesterday, with a bond sell-off overshadowing a drop in oil prices. The major indexes ended the week little changed.
 Although investors were encouraged by job growth in March that was modestly better than expected -- signaling a healthy but not overheating economy -- an uptick in hourly earnings again stoked concerns about a tight labor market lifting wages and driving inflation, said Michael Gregory, a senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns.
 ''The fact that we've had some decent growth, as long as it isn't associated with inflation risk, is generally good for equity markets,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''But we did see that wage pressure remains elevated.'' 
 Fears that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates to mitigate inflationary pressures prompted a second day of steep losses for the bond market, which contributed to the decline of stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 96.46 points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,120.04.
 Broader stock indicators also fell after reaching five-year highs in the prior session. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 13.54 points, or 1 percent, to 1,295.50, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 22.15 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,339.02.
 Bonds slumped also, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumping to 4.98 percent from 4.90 percent Thursday. Scott Merritt, United States equity strategist for J. P. Morgan Asset Management, noted that the 10-year Treasury yield crossing 5 percent would be a negative factor for the market.
 The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, declined 18/32, to 96 10/32.
 ''Really what you're seeing is a reaction of the equity market to bond yields,'' Mr. Merritt said. ''Higher interest rates mean future earnings are worth less, which means stocks are worth less.''
 Crude oil futures cooled after hitting the $68 level a day earlier, and as oil officials said some production in Nigeria could be restarted soon. The May contract for a barrel of light crude declined 55 cents, to settle at $67.39, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In economic news, the Labor Department said employers added 211,000 jobs in March, above estimates for a gain of 190,000 jobs. Hourly earnings grew 0.2 percent, behind forecasts of 0.3 percent; the nation's unemployment rate slipped to 4.7 percent.
 Yesterday's retreat left the major indexes barely changed this week, with the Dow industrials up 10.72 points, or 0.1 percent; the S.& P. 500 ahead 0.05 percent, or 0.67 point; and the Nasdaq off 0.03 percent, or 0.77 point. 
 Along with a taste of first-quarter earnings -- Alcoa and General Electric are scheduled to release their results -- next week brings a fresh round of reports on prices for imported goods, retail sales and consumer confidence. 
 Analysts are waiting to see if consumers have weathered higher energy costs and interest rates, but Mr. Merritt said more erratic trading could be in store for a data-sensitive market.
 ''I think it's a trendless market,'' he said. Any data that comes out ''will be overinterpreted, overread and overreacted to.''
 Shares of Research in Motion, the company that sells the BlackBerry hand-held device, slid $4.60, to $79.78, after the company turned a small quarterly profit, which would have been more than six times greater if not for a $612.5 million settlement in its patent dispute with NTP. Its first-quarter forecast also came in below Wall Street estimates.
 Shares of Ford Motor fell 5 cents, to $7.60, after the company said James J. Padilla, its president and chief operating officer, was retiring after 40 years. The chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., will assume his responsibilities.
 Allstate said about a thousand employees accepted a voluntary buyout offer, which was 300 more than the company expected. Allstate lost 58 cents, to $51.22.
 Late Thursday, Starbucks posted a 10 percent jump in March sales at stores open for more than a year, lifted by seasonal promotions. Starbucks gained 41 cents, to $37.86.

HEADLINE: The Win-Win Exit Interview

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
COUNTLESS magazines have run hand-wringing articles about the potential labor shortage that will be caused by the economy's expanding while baby boomers start retiring in droves, but Inc. has a different take.
 It reports that a little-noticed practice can help wise employers retain more of the workers they want to keep.
''Nearly all companies conduct some kind of exit interview with employees who leave the fold,'' Scott Westcott reports. ''But many treat it more as a perfunctory rite of passage than a strategic management tool. That's a mistake.'' 
 Exit interviews, Mr. Westcott writes, allow an employer to truly understand what is going on inside the organization, since there is little reason for a departing employee not to be candid. And those who are leaving often have good ideas about what it will take to keep the best workers. 
 To find out, he suggests that employers ask during the exit interview: 
 If one person leaving the firm would cause you to think twice about leaving, who would that person be?
 Who do you think is next to leave and why?
 What could have been changed six months ago that would have kept you from leaving?''
 Why didn't you leave before now?
 If you were put in charge of the company today, what is the first thing you would change?

CALIFORNIA DREAMING -- If you fantasize about chucking it all and opening a winery in California, you might want to read the current issue of Food & Wine before you do anything rash.
 In ''The Millionaire's Guide to Buying the Napa Dream,'' Paul Franson outlines the cost of everything you'll need -- and it is a tidy sum.
 ''A one-bedroom cottage with a small yard can cost half a million. The most interesting houses start at around $3 million, while good estates can go for over $20 million. The price depends on many factors, of course, including whether or not the property contains or can support a vineyard.''
 Napa County requires a minimum of 10 acres for a winery permit, and then you need the winemaking operation itself. So figure another $4 million to $5 million for ''a nice winery that can handle 3,000 cases annually.''
 Then there are the winemaking consultants who charge $3,000 to $10,000 a month. You may also need a vineyard manager; figure $20,000 to $35,000 an acre to replant a vineyard, $40,000 an acre for new vineyards.
 In comparison, buying your grapes from someone else seems downright cheap: a half-ton of Cabernet grapes, enough to produce a 55-gallon barrel of wine, goes for $2,000.

RELAX! It's hard to believe, but we really have more free time.
 So says Erik Hurst, associate professor of economics at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago. ''Since 1965, there's been a six- to eight-hour weekly increase in leisure for the average worker age 21 to 65,'' Mr. Hurst told Kiplinger's. 
 Mr. Hurst explains where all that free time is coming from: men are working less, with part of the increase attributable to stay-at-home dads.
 ''For women, all of the increase is from a decline in housework -- less cooking, cleaning, laundry and grocery shopping than 40 years ago,'' he says.
 And what are we doing with all our additional free time? ''Roughly two-thirds of the increase in leisure is spent watching television. That's been consistent across population groups since 1965. More recently, we've spent more time on the Internet, less time reading and a little bit more time exercising. We're going to church about a half-hour a week less.''

FINAL TAKE -- Parenting asked its readers: ''If moms got paid, what would be a fair salary?'' Readers were given five answers to choose from.
 The results:
 $22,000 -- 6 percent
 $50,000 -- 20 percent
 $75,000 -- 18 percent
 $100,000 -- 20 percent
 What does Bill Gates make? -- 36 percent.

HEADLINE: Relieving the Power Grid, Dirtying the Air

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
It is supposed to be a win-win deal for New York, saving the city energy and money. By agreeing to switch on a number of backup generators at its sewage treatment plants on hot summer days when power use is at its peak, the city gets a break on electricity rates from the New York Power Authority.
 But this routine use of backup generators during nonemergency conditions may have contributed to the spill of 231 million gallons of raw sewage into the Hudson River during the 2003 blackout.
The generator at the North River plant in Harlem had been switched on for several hours before the blackout as part of the power reduction program. By the time of the blackout -- when it was most needed -- the machine had overheated and shut down, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors in New York. In February, a federal judge ordered the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the plant and another in Brooklyn that also malfunctioned, to submit to at least three years of federal oversight for violating clean water laws. 
 The generator failure spotlights what some see as a serious flaw in the state's policy to reduce demand on the power grid and prevent brownouts. 
 To cut peak demand, the policy allows the state's utilities to encourage the nonemergency use of extremely dirty, diesel-powered generators during the hottest, smoggiest days, creating a health risk for people with respiratory diseases. 
 The debate over this trade-off -- reliable power at the cost of dirtier air -- has become heated in Albany as regulators consider tighter controls on diesel generators. 
 A survey released in 2003 by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an association of eight state air quality management offices, found 2,236 emergency generators in New York City, with a combined generating capacity of 1,320 megawatts, although not all are used in the load-reduction programs. In an average year, those machines produce an estimated 8,850 tons of nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog, and 295 tons of the small particulate matter that causes respiratory problems. 
 These largely unfiltered diesel engines can be run in nonemergencies for no more than 15 days a year, but the author of the report, Praveen Amar, the air use management association's director of science and policy, said in an interview that they were up to 200 times as dirty as conventional power plants. Running just 10 one-megawatt diesel generators for an hour on a hot summer day produces the same amount of harmful emissions as a 1,000-megawatt power plant, which is large enough to supply electricity to one million people.
 Deciding what to do about these generators has stymied Gov. George E. Pataki's administration for several years. Health care advocates and environmentalists oppose a state policy that ends up increasing air pollution, even if it decreases the chance of a power system failure. 
 They have urged the administration to restrict the use of backup generators to the most extreme situations unless they have been outfitted with expensive filters or replaced by newer, cleaner models.
 The state Department of Environmental Conservation is now working on a draft regulation that would limit the number of generators that could participate in the program to a total capacity of just over 270 megawatts for New York City. It would also apply tougher emissions standards for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. 
 A department spokesman said the new standards would reduce harmful emissions from the generators by 50 percent or more. 
 Businesses, however, worry that the cost of retrofitting the machines with filters could exceed $100,000 on a large generator, and few want to foot that expense when new regulations could limit their use. State regulations now limit the operation of most generators to 500 hours a year. 
 Michael B. Gordon, president of Consumer Powerline, a privately operated company that manages the electricity consumption of dozens of New York City's largest businesses, said load regulating programs, if managed properly, can bolster the system's reliability without harming the environment. Starting the generators regularly ensures that they are working properly, he said. 
 But Ashok Gupta, director of the air and energy program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the new rules being considered by the state ought to be as restrictive as possible. ''The position of the environmental community has always been, 'No, you can't run these emergency generators for economic purposes,' '' Mr. Gupta said. 
 Across New York State, more than 2,300 big electricity customers have signed contracts to curtail their use of energy from the power grid on demand, with many relying on diesel generators when ordered to disconnect from the grid. They also apply more straightforward methods, like turning out lights. 
 The customers are paid for every kilowatt of electricity they save. Besides the power authority, other electricity suppliers in the state offer incentives to customers who reduce power consumption and switch to generators on peak days. 
 As demand for electricity has grown and the grid system has become less reliable, these load-reducing programs have expanded. A New York City energy task force has recommended that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration substantially increase the use of emergency generators and lobby the state to exempt emergency generators from air emissions limits. 
 Power companies say that reducing demand on peak days obviates the need to build more power plants. And they contend that expanding generator use to nonemergencies would create further energy savings. 
 Every summer for the last five years, the city has participated in the Peak Load Management program, or P.L.M., enlisting some of its biggest energy users, including the City University of New York and the Metropolitan Transit Authority, to help meet energy reduction orders. In return, the city has received $40 for each kilowatt saved. 
 A major part of the city's strategy has been to switch on emergency backup generators at 9 of the city's 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants. As the largest municipal participant, the city's Department of Environmental Protection was contracted to reduce, on demand, 17 megawatts of electricity. It managed to exceed that target by 7 megawatts, earning $1 million in price reductions. 
 Early on Aug. 14, 2003, the power authority asked the city to cut its power use because of high temperatures, without suspecting that there would be multistate blackout later that day. 
 The city responded by unplugging the North River plant from the grid and gearing up its lone functioning backup generator. By the time the blackout started in New York City just after 4 p.m., the generator had already been running for several hours. (A second generator, a backup for the backup, had been inoperable for nearly a year.)
 An investigation found that the working generator, which had not been hooked up to the air-conditioning, got so hot it shut itself down. The sewage backed up, creating a fetid pool 40 feet deep inside the plant. Eventually a diver had to jump into the muck and manually operate a valve. Meanwhile, the wastewater poured, untreated, into the river.
 ''Some witnesses have voiced the opinion that the generator would not have overheated and failed had it not been in use for the P.L.M. program -- and already heated up --when utility power failed,'' the United States attorney's office said in a legal document filed in federal court in January. City officials do not deny the prosecutors' contention that running the generator contributed to its failure, which led to the violation of clean water laws. 
 The city's use of the polluting generators also violated clean air laws, according to the United States attorney's office, because the operating permit issued by state environmental officials did not allow the generators to be used in the absence of an emergency. 
 The state power authority, however, defends its peak load program, saying that it is an effective way to protect the overburdened grid. Michael Saltzman, a spokesman for the authority, said the city was responsible for making sure that its backup generators have the proper permits and are operating effectively. 
 Mr. Saltzman said the authority recognized that the use of the generators adds to air pollution in New York City. The agency, he said, tries to offset that effect by helping to pay for a cleaner type of diesel fuel that is used in the city's school buses.

HEADLINE: British Rethinking Test Rules After Drug Trial Nearly Kills 6

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

 BODY:
In February, when Rob O. saw the text message from Parexel International pop up on his cellphone in London -- ''healthy males needed for a drug trial'' for $:2,000, about $3,500 -- it seemed like a harmless opportunity to make some much-needed cash. Parexel, based in Waltham, Mass., contracts with drug makers to test new medicines.
 Just weeks later, the previously healthy 31-year-old was in intensive care at London's Northwick Park Hospital -- wires running directly into his heart and arteries, on dialysis, his immune system, liver, kidneys and lungs all failing -- the victim of a drug trial gone disastrously bad.
 One of six healthy young men to receive TGN1412, a novel type of immune stimulant that had never before been tried in humans, Rob O. took part in a study that is sending shock waves through the research world and causing regulators to rethink procedures for testing certain powerful new drugs. 
 Although tests of TGN1412 in monkeys showed no significant trouble, all six human subjects nearly died. One is still hospitalized and the others, though discharged, still have impaired immune systems, their future health uncertain. 
 On Wednesday, after releasing its interim report on the trial as well as previously confidential scientific documents that were part of the application for a trial permit, the British government announced it was convening an international panel of experts to ''consider what necessary changes to clinical trials may be required'' for such novel compounds.
 The outcome ''could potentially affect clinical trials regulation worldwide,'' the announcement said.
 In statements this week, both Parexel and the drug's manufacturer, TeGenero, emphasized that they had complied with all regulatory requirements and conducted the trial according to the approved protocol. But they declined to answer questions e-mailed to them about the specifics of the science involved. 
 ''The companies have worked according to strict standards applicable for such type of studies,'' said Kristin Kaufmann, a spokeswoman for TeGenero.
 Within an hour of receiving the milky white drug in a Parexel research ward in the hospital on March 13, the volunteers were racked with chills, pain and nausea, said Rob O., who asked that his last name not be used, for fear that he might be hurt professionally. A doctor informed him he was ''seriously ill.''
 ''But no one's going to die?'' Rob O. recalled saying, believing he was participating in a fairly standard trial of a painkiller for arthritis.
 The chilling response: ''Two of you might. Who's your next of kin?''
 In fact, TGN1412 is anything but standard. The first product of TeGenero, a tiny German company with just 15 employees, TGN1412 belongs to a completely novel class of manufactured antibodies that researchers thought could revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis.
 Now, TGN1412 seems poised to go down in medical history as a pharmaceutical lemon, its disastrous trial raising serious questions about whether patient safety is adequately protected in the lucrative race to get products to market.
 The British Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which approved the trial at Northwick Park, announced Wednesday that ''the way the trial was run'' had not contributed to patient injuries, according to its preliminary investigation. The men experienced cytokine release syndrome, which involves an outpouring of toxic molecules when the immune system's T cells are activated, the report said; it could not have been predicted from previous animal studies using the drug, the association, TeGenero and Parexel agree. 
 But British regulators took the highly unusual additional step of appointing an expert panel to explore whether more stringent safeguards should be required for testing new biological drugs like TGN1412 that manipulate the immune system.
 Many experts say that because TGN1412's unique property is to turn on potent, immune system T cells, overriding normal regulatory mechanisms, the clinical trials were extraordinarily risky. ''There was strong reason to be very cautious,'' said Dr. Michael Ehrenstein, of University College London, who studies the molecules that TGN1412 affects. ''Many people would say this was a very high-risk strategy. I'd have to agree with that.''
 Michael Goodyear, a Canadian oncologist and medical ethicist, said that even if the trial was not illegal or unethical, the research protocol and conduct on the day of the trial raise ''a number of big red flags.''
 The concerns Dr. Goodyear and lawyers for the subjects raised include these:
 Rob O. began receiving the drug intravenously long after the first volunteer was already experiencing symptoms possibly serious enough to halt the trial. Standard practice for such trials is to use just one patient or to separate tests by many days. 
 The information submitted by TeGenero to British regulators mentioned that a cytokine burst ''could occur'' after TGN1412 infusion. But in their application, researchers deemed the reaction ''not expected'' on the basis of trials with a single animal species, and did not mention this risk to the recruits, Rob O. said. 
 On its Web site, Parexel says, ''The only services that matter are the ones that speed your product through clinical development.'' The subjects point out that approvals for drug trials in Britain are quicker than in the United States and the liability for injuries is less. 
 Rob O. said the novelty of TGN1412 never came up in upbeat pretrial briefings, adding, ''I had no idea it altered the immune system.'' 
 The first human trials are risky and ethically complicated. They are designed to determine whether a compound is safe, not to provide a benefit to the subject. Such human trials must be approved by national regulators as well as medical ethics boards, though standards vary somewhat among countries and even among different panels. 
 ''Research is a social good -- we need better treatments for leukemia and arthritis -- but there are risks,'' said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, chief of bioethics at the United States National Institutes of Health. ''Being a construction worker is very risky, and we pay people to do that. So why not this?''
 Noting that the TGN1412 trial had been approved by two separate British regulatory bodies and that the medicine had been tested in animals, he said, ''This is a terrible, tragic event but so far I don't see any clear ethical problems.'' 
 The trial subjects, who were to spend three days as hospital inpatients, were mostly immigrants, some of them students or unemployed. 
 ''These were not people who were well off,'' said Martyn Day, of the London law firm Leigh Day & Company, which is representing four of the men. ''They thought this was relatively risk free.'' 
 At the orientation meeting there was little time to read the 11-page consent form, Rob O. said, although they had a chance to take it home. Headaches and bruising were listed as potential side effects, as well as a severe allergy. But eating nuts or using new cosmetics could create similar reactions, the form said.
 In fact, so-called monoclonal antibodies frequently produce severe generalized symptoms like aches and chills, though their use is justified by the enormous potential benefit. ''At my hospital, we almost killed people the first few times we used Herceptin,'' said Dr. Goodyear, referring to the popular breast cancer drug, adding that he now pretreats patients with medicines to counter possible reactions. 
 Parexel applied to test TGN1412 in both England and Germany in December, receiving permission in England first, on Jan. 27. Many countries are streamlining review processes to attract biomedical research, a strategy that may have backfired here, Dr. Goodyear said.
 It is not clear if independent immunologists reviewed the trial design, and neither Parexel nor TeGenero answered this question.
 The trial began Monday, March 13, at 8 a.m., when the men began receiving TGN1412, each 10 minutes after the last. Within half an hour, the first patient had a headache and chills, said Ann Alexander, a London lawyer who is representing him. Nevertheless, doctors continued injecting new patients. About the time Rob O.'s infusion started, at 9:10 a.m., the first patient had passed out in an adjacent room, according to Ms. Alexander. 
 Before long, Rob O. said, he began to ache and shiver, feeling as if he had been ''submerged in arctic ice.'' For the rest of the day, six previously healthy men moaned in uncontrollable pain, vomited and struggled for breath, Rob O. and other participants said. Though a dose of steroids temporarily blunted the symptoms, their vital signs steadily deteriorated, and they were transferred to the intensive care unit.
 Two of them were placed on ventilators. Uniformed men wheeled in blood filtering machines, Rob O. recalled, to cleanse the blood of acid. Doctors told him that his immune cells were attacking his organs. 
 The patients' families were summoned to the hospital at 3 a.m. 
 In statements, Parexel and TeGenero called the reactions ''unforeseen and unexpected,'' noting that doses hundreds of times more powerful had proved safe in animals. 
 The experimental application filed with British authorities -- released this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request -- showed that the companies at least realized the possibility of a devastating immune-system reaction, and that animal studies showed some signs of immune overdrive.
 Those worries were set aside when monkeys infused with TGN1412 had no problems. Although Parexel technicians continued to draw blood in the intensive care unit, the companies have not been willing to share the medical data or even meet with the participants and their lawyers, Mr. Day, the lawyer, said. 
 With his immune system now essentially disabled, Rob O. says he cannot work, or even take the subway, for fear of infection. His liver and kidney tests are still abnormal. Britain's National Health Service covers his doctor's bills, but he has to pay the $87 cab fare. 
 Under British law, Rob O. may be eligible only for $50,000 to $70,000 in compensation, said Mr. Day, unless he can demonstrate permanent harm. Anyway, tiny TeGenero took out only a $3.5 million insurance policy to cover the trial.
 Lawyers for the subjects are hoping to arrange for financial compensation and full disclosure of medical information on the drug without having to go to court. 
 ''I can't believe that nobody will pay and nobody will be punished,'' Rob O. said. ''If I've lost 20 years of life because my liver packs in at 60 rather than 80, who will cover that?''

HEADLINE: FEMA Shifts Some Gulf Coast Housing Contracts From Big Businesses to Small Ones

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and RON NIXON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has followed through on its promise to offer up to $3.6 billion worth of temporary-housing maintenance contracts to small and minority-owned businesses across the South.
 The 36 contracts, each worth up to $100 million, shift the work in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from giant engineering firms like Bechtel, based in California, to small companies, many with little experience in the field. FEMA officials said Friday that unlike the first round of deals reached soon after the storm, the new contracts were competitively bid. The change will help the regional economy, they said.
''FEMA is dedicated to the recovery of the Gulf Coast region and its economy,'' said Aaron T. Walker, the agency's press secretary. ''What better way to stimulate the economy than to encourage small businesses to grow and flourish?'' 
 The winning bidders include DSC Enterprises of San Antonio, which cleans buildings and does remodeling, according to a company profile filed with the Small Business Administration, and the Smith Research Corporation of Baton Rouge, La., a minority-owned consulting firm. Each company, financial records indicate, has about 20 employees. Another winning bidder, LSI Research of Huntsville, Ala., got its start repairing laser printers before moving into the computer sales business, according to its Web site. 
 The contracts call for the companies to maintain the 106,000 travel trailers and mobile homes that FEMA has installed along the Gulf Coast as temporary housing for victims of the hurricanes. The work is expected to continue for five years and will ultimately include removing the trailers. 
 The giant engineering companies that will be phased out of the work -- Shaw, Bechtel, CH2M Hill, and Fluor -- have made a considerable amount from hurricane-related work performed to date, ranging from $237 million for CH2M Hill to $875 million, for Fluor.
 Some of the companies appear to have experience in related fields. They include MLU Services of Athens, Ga., which does disaster cleanup work, and Crown Roofing of Kenner, La.. Both companies have already done government work related to last year's hurricanes. LEC-CMS of Plano, Tex., another bid winner, is an engineering and project management firm.
 ''It is a big job, but not that big of a job,'' said Ray Palmer, an executives at Crown Roofing, which has about 150 employees.
 MLU Services is run by executives who have contributed to Republicans that include President Bush. The president of that company, which has about 100 employees and does disaster cleanup work, Marcia L. Ulm, and her relatives have donated a total of $165,371 to Republican committees and candidates across the country, campaign finance records show.
 Mr. Walker said that before each new contract was awarded, FEMA examined the finances and past work of each applicant. Of the 36 winning bidders, 28 are based in Gulf Coast states, the agency said. 
 The companies will be given work in increments, allowing FEMA, if necessary, to terminate an agreement if a company cannot honor its commitments. What is clear for most of the winning bidders is that this is by far the biggest contract they have ever received, and in some cases, the first work they have ever landed with the federal government.
 In many cases, as with Davis Professional Accounting Services of New Orleans, a small financial services company, the winning bidders will hire subcontractors or work with partners to allow them to increase their staff quickly. Davis Professional, like several of the winning bidders, is run by a black woman. Others are run by Hispanics or American Indians, among other minorities.
 Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who criticized FEMA's reliance on large out-of-state corporations for most of the initial work, praised the changes.
 ''FEMA is finally doing the right thing, or is at least on the right track to doing the right thing,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Cleaning up and rebuilding the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will take several more years and billions more dollars. It requires the vested interest and passion found in area businesses with an interest in recovery.''

HEADLINE: Give Rebuilding Lower Priority in Future Wars, State Dept. Says, Spurning Iraq Strategy

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
As factions in the Bush administration continue their bitter infighting over the reconstruction program in Iraq, the State Department has produced a draft planning document saying that after any future conflicts, the United States should not immediately begin a major rebuilding program.
 Instead, it says, the first priorities should be to establish a secure, stable environment and begin political reconciliation. Otherwise, officials said, Washington and any local government that is formed are likely to suffer major political repercussions by making promises that cannot be kept.
 In Iraq, ''We set it up to fail,'' said Andrew S. Natsios, who was director of the United States Agency for International Development until January. He and some White House and State Department officials say they argued early on that a large-scale reconstruction program could never succeed in a hostile environment.
 ''We certainly have not done as much as we originally had hoped for,'' acknowledged James Jeffrey, who is the State Department's senior coordinator for Iraq. Some senior officials say they fear that the failures of the reconstruction program will pose a serious threat for officials of the new Iraqi government, once it is formed. ''They will be vulnerable to complaints and hostility for their inability to provide electricity or clean water,'' one senior official said. 
 Carlos Pascual, who until recently headed the Office for Reconstruction and Stabilization at the State Department, which prepared the draft plan, said this problem ''was in part self-generated -- we came in and said we would restore the country, make it whole.'' 
 Under the new plan, the United States would first establish public security and order, and then encourage small-scale economic activity while promoting political reconciliation. ''If that is not done, then the society will unravel at some point,'' Mr. Pascual said.
 After that, banks, political parties and other institutions would be established, followed by news media, private aid organizations and civilian advocacy groups. Physical reconstruction would begin ''only when it seems to fit into the other priorities,'' said Mr. Pascual, who is now a vice president of the Brookings Institution. ''But the ability to build large-scale infrastructure before you have established order and stability is nil because it will be blown up.'' 
 The draft plan reads like a refutation of almost everything the United States has done in Iraq. It also reads like another chapter in the prolonged and bitter debate between the State Department and Pentagon that began during the months before the invasion of Iraq more than three years ago.
 The Iraq Working Group at the State Department spent more than a year preparing a detailed study on how to manage the country once Saddam Hussein was driven from power. It anticipated many of the problems that developed, including the widespread violence and looting that American forces faced after the invasion and the badly deteriorated state of the country's electrical and water systems.
 But the Pentagon won control of reconstruction, over the objections of the State Department and the Agency for International Development, and Pentagon officials refused to use the study, saying it was too superficial. The Pentagon also blocked the appointment of Tom Warrick, the State Department official in charge of the study, to a position in the military's reconstruction office.
 State Department officials say the Pentagon was consulted in the drafting of the new plan. But the document has a clear diplomatic stamp, and seems like a pre-emptive move by the State Department to reassert its authority in any future reconstruction efforts.
 Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said that no one would argue with the notion that reconstruction was easier in a stable environment, but that ''we can't look at this too simplistically. It is hard to establish a robust political environment if the people do not have electricity or clean drinking water. These are parallel lines of operation that complement each other.''
 Marcia Wong, deputy director of the reconstruction and stabilization office, said the draft plan should not be viewed as an immutable template because ''a lot of it will be driven by events on the ground.'' Officials will have to go in with ''Plan B, Plan C and Plan D'' as well, she added. 
 No project since the Marshall Plan after World War II even approached the scope and ambition of the American reconstruction effort in Iraq. Over three years the United States spent more than $20 billion in taxpayer money and roughly $40 billion in Iraqi money to rebuild electrical power plants, water and sewer systems and energy infrastructure. Scores of smaller projects were intended to improve education, health care, agriculture, governance and criminal justice. Many of those did produce important and positive results.
 But stymied by a vicious insurgency and surprised by the Iraqis' inability to operate the sophisticated new equipment, the United States has scrapped scores of projects and now intends to reduce the program's budget drastically. A withering assessment by government auditors last month found that by almost every measure, Iraqi utility services, the central focus of the reconstruction aid, are now worse than before the United States invaded.
 Late last year, as the administration was devising its 2007 budget, officials said they initially planned to request money to finish some of the projects that were not completed or ever begun. But by then, the administration had given up on the large-scale construction projects and intended instead to spend money on agriculture, education and good-governance projects, among others, several officials said. 
 ''We decided to draw the line and start focusing on traditional forms of aid,'' Mr. Jeffrey said. Asked in an interview what lesson he had learned from the reconstruction effort, Mr. Jeffrey said, ''Certainly, that doing massive reconstruction in the midst of an insurgency drives up costs and diverts funds.''
 Mr. Natsios, who was still in office throughout the budget debate, said, ''They realized they made a mistake.''
 Mr. Pascual and others noted that Congress made it clear that it would not support additional large-scale financing for reconstruction or rehabilitation programs in Iraq. As a result, starting with the proposed 2007 budget, which is to take effect on Oct. 1, the administration is asking for only about $771 million, and has reduced its new construction aspirations to little more than refurbishing fruit stands and shoe stores.
 Mr. Natsios and others said they argued at the start against the large-scale building projects, in part because their experience in other countries over 50 years had shown that it was not the most useful way to spend money. Officials still in the government confirmed that he had made that case.
 James R. Kunder, an assistant administrator at the Agency for International Development, said in an interview that the most important priority was ''to build Iraq's capacity to run its own affairs.'' An important example, Mr. Natsios said, was strong support for farming and agriculture, which was Iraq's second-largest employment sector. 
 ''If the rural economy collapses, the young men will be the first to leave for the city and join the insurgency, and that's what happened,'' Mr. Natsios said. The American aid package provided some money for agricultural assistance, but when money was taken from the budget for otherpurposes, primarily security, that was one of the first programs cut.

HEADLINE: Trading Up in China

 BODY:
Whoever thought it could happen? The world's most populous country, with what seemed like a bottomless pool of low-skilled workers, is experiencing a labor shortage in its big manufacturing regions. David Barboza of The Times reports a shortage of workers at hundreds of Chinese factories, particularly in Guangdong and Fujian, the two provinces at the heart of China's export-driven economy. 
 At first glance, the result looks like a union leader's dream come true: wages are going up, and workers are demanding -- and getting -- better working conditions and benefits. Minimum wages, which averaged $58 to $74 a month, excluding benefits, in 2004, have climbed about 25 percent over the last three years in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai. Wages at larger factories operated by multinationals, which are typically $100 to $200 a month, are also rising. 
But it is a far more complicated story than that, a textbook case of how the global economy has developed. During the last 100 years of industrialization, low-paying manufacturing jobs, primarily in the textile and apparel industries, have been the first rung on the ladder to development. America, Britain and other rich countries all went through an inevitable -- but painful -- process as their economies grew. When wages in the lower-rung factories increased, manufacturing companies looked for cheaper labor. In America, that meant moving from the Northeast to Southern states like the Carolinas. 
 Then along came China, which jumped into the textile market with a bang: a seemingly endless supply of workers ready, willing and able to make T-shirts, bras and other underwear for much less money than workers in South Carolina. Simply put, South Carolina was no longer poor enough. 
 China's move up the textile ladder will produce the same difficult changes that other countries have experienced -- among them the persistent problem of what do with the workers whose jobs leave. But workers in China are seeing their wages and benefits increase, and China's progress bodes well for workers in poorer places like Cambodia, Bangladesh and Madagascar. Factory owners may be complaining that they can't find workers in China, but that means they will do what they have always done in such cases: look for cheap labor elsewhere. 
 These jobs are no picnic. The women and men put in 10 hours a day, six days a week, churning out one garment after another. Much of the time, they have to move far from their families to get work. To make ends meet, most live with five or six others in rooms that have no electricity or running water. Sometimes it's a fight just to get paid. Factory owners and managers in poor countries sometimes delay salaries through incompetence. Such delays are particularly painful because the workers are often paid only once a month. 
 But the alternative is far worse. In the developing world, there is too often little work to be found. In Cambodia, young men spend their days leaning against their rickety moped taxis, hoping for passengers. In Ghana, young girls run up to cars at Accra's few stoplights, selling oranges for nearly nothing. For all the toiling and monotony, factory jobs in these countries can mean survival for a family of six, supported by the monthly paycheck from one sister who sews shirts for the Gap.
 All this speaks to how woefully misguided it is for members of Congress to respond to these pressures by trying to stop the flow of goods from China. The better off China is, the better off the rest of the world is -- poor countries because they will get a shot at the jobs that leave China; rich countries because many more people over in China may finally be able to afford the expensive goods that are made in America.

HEADLINE: A Yankee Victory, A Loss for the Fans

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As an urban planner and lifelong Yankee fan, I believe the stadium proposal is problematic.
Extensive research has found uniformly that new sports facilities create no positive local economic impacts. The Yankees, who have record-breaking attendance, should not receive any public subsidies.
 The highways around the stadium are severely congested, and local development projects will generate more traffic. The transportation component adds parking and lacks committed public transportation improvements. 
 The removal of large parks would be damaging to the community. The stadium should be constructed on the current stadium site, while the Yankees play home games elsewhere for one season.

HEADLINE: SPECIAL PROJECTS BY CONGRESSMAN DRAW COMPLAINTS

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; David Johnston and Aron Pilhofer contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As lawmakers have increasingly slipped pet projects into federal spending bills over the past decade, one lawmaker has used his powerful perch on the House Appropriations Committee to funnel $250 million into five nonprofit organizations that he set up. 
 Those actions have prompted a complaint to federal prosecutors that questions whether any of that taxpayer money helped fuel a parallel growth in his personal fortune.
The most ambitious effort by the congressman, Alan B. Mollohan, is a glistening glass-and-steel structure with a swimming pool, sauna and spa rising in a former cow pasture in Fairmont, W.Va., thanks to $103 million of taxpayer money he garnered through special spending allocations known as earmarks. 
 The headquarters building is likely to sit largely empty upon completion this summer, because the Mollohan-created organization that it was built for, the Institute for Scientific Research, is in disarray, its chief executive having resigned under a cloud of criticism over his $500,000 annual compensation, also paid by earmarked federal money. 
 The five organizations have diverse missions but form a cozy, cross-pollinated network in the forlorn former coal capitals of north-central West Virginia. Mr. Mollohan has recruited many of their top employees and board members, including longtime friends or former aides, who in turn provide him with steady campaign contributions and positive publicity in their newsletters. 
 The conservative National Legal and Policy Center in Falls Church, Va., filed a 500-page complaint with the United States attorney for the District of Columbia on Feb. 28 challenging the accuracy of Mr. Mollohan's financial disclosure forms. The forms show a sharp spike in assets and income from rental properties from 2000 to 2004.
 Federal authorities said yesterday that they were reviewing the complaint, which was reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
 The case has led several Republican leaders to call for Mr. Mollohan's removal from the House ethics committee, where he is the senior Democrat.
 In a statement yesterday, he said, ''These groups were not created to benefit me in any way, and they never have.'' 
 Mr. Mollohan noted that the National Legal and Policy Center had attacked other Democrats and their union supporters and that it began its inquiry last May after he had voted against Republican efforts to water down House ethics rules. 
 ''Obviously, I am in the crosshairs of the National Republican Party and like-minded entities,'' said Mr. Mollohan, who faces a serious electoral challenge in November. Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to headline a fund-raiser on April 21 for the Republican whom the White House recruited to run against Mr. Mollohan.
 ''They are angry at me, and I fully expect that from now until November they will continue to make baseless charges against me, my record and my family,'' the statement said. ''I will vigorously defend my service and not be intimidated by their heavy-handed tactics.'' 
 In previous interviews, Mr. Mollohan acknowledged that he had failed to pay 2004 taxes on income from rental properties in Washington and North Carolina, resulting in a state lien of $8,948.28 being filed on Dec. 1. He said the case was resolved by final payments of all taxes, interest and penalties by January.
 ''Obviously it's totally my fault,'' he said. ''I just neglected this, and it was paid late, and I regret that.''
 In the last three years, Mr. Mollohan, a Democrat first elected in 1982 to a seat long held by his father, has bought $2 million worth of property on Bald Head Island, N.C., with Laura Kurtz Kuhns, a former employee who now runs one of the organizations and is on the boards of two others.
 He was unapologetic about his earmarks, saying that local lawmakers knew their constituents' needs best, and that he was hardly alone in mainlining money back home. ''The amount of money in the transportation bill spent in Illinois in earmarked projects is astronomical,'' he said. ''It puts $100 million on the I.S.R. building in real perspective.''
 The earmarking occurred as an abundance of local projects was added to spending bills outside the normal budget review, from $32.9 billion in 2000 to $64 billion in 2006, the Congressional Research Service said. Although it is impossible to trace individual earmarks for certain, an analysis by Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington watchdog, found $480 million added in the House or in conference committees, most likely by Mr. Mollohan, for his district since 1995. That sum helped West Virginia rank fourth on the watchdog list -- $131.58 for each of the 1.8 million West Virginians this year.
 Although Mr. Mollohan's mentor, Senator Robert C. Byrd, has long blanketed the state in bacon in the form of large public works projects and federal complexes, Mr. Mollohan has directed more than half his earmarks to his five organizations of his design. 
 Several people involved in the appropriations process said no other lawmaker employed that strategy to the same extent.
 The first and largest is the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation, which is absorbing the troubled Institute for Scientific Research. Another, the Canaan Valley Institute, works on stream restoration and wastewater treatment. The Vandalia Heritage Foundation redevelops dilapidated buildings, and the MountainMade Foundation helps artisans market wares.
 ''He's basically judge, jury and executioner for all this money,'' said Keith Ashdown, vice president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington. 
 Of the empty building in Mr. Mollohan's hometown, Fairmont, Mr. Ashdown added, ''This is sort of Mollohan's field of dreams, but in his case, he's building it, and it doesn't look like they're going to come.''
 Kenneth F. Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, said the bulk of his complaint to the federal prosecutors was made up of public documents that showed 260 instances of omitted or undervalued assets on the financial disclosure forms that Mr. Mollohan filed with the ethics committee from 1996 to 2004. 
 Those forms show a jump in Mr. Mollohan's portfolio from less than $500,000 in assets generating less than $80,000 in income in 2000 to at least $6.3 million in assets earning $200,000 to $1.2 million in 2004, along with large mortgage debts. 
 Among the concerns in the complaint, Mr. Boehm said, are commissions that Ms. Kuhns's husband, Donald, received as a real estate broker on deals for the organization that she controls. The couple have donated at least $10,000 to Mr. Mollohan's political committees since 1998.
 The complaint also looks at whether Mr. Mollohan properly reported 27 condominiums in the Remington, near Foggy Bottom in Washington. He and his wife own the building with a cousin, Joseph L. Jarvis, whose business once received money from a federal contract in Mr. Mollohan's district.
 ''The $64,000 question that's all over this thing is during the period of time all these earmarks went to very closely associated nonprofits run by people who were very close to him, did any of the money go from Point A to Point B?'' Mr. Boehm asked in an interview. ''Did any of his newfound wealth result from, in any way, shape or form, individuals who had benefited from his official actions?''

Lifeblood for a Weak Economy
 About 75 miles southeast of Fairmont along windy roads in Thomas (pop. 473) sits the Buxton & Landstreet Building, whose lifeblood is Mr. Mollohan's largess. The Vandalia Heritage Foundation used $1.2 million in earmarks from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help transform the yellow-brick behemoth, built in 1901 as the coal company store, from broken down to bustling. 
 The first floor is a vibrant gallery where the MountainMade Foundation, relying on its own earmarks from the Small Business Administration to pay Vandalia its $5,166.67 in monthly rent, sells items like Mr. Byrd's thick autobiography for $35 and a maple desk for $5,250.
 Upstairs, 41 people work on stream restoration and wastewater treatment in the Canaan Valley office, whose $5,100 rent to Vandalia is covered by earmarks from the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.
 ''What else are you going to do to reinvent this economy?'' asked Ms. Kuhns, Mr. Mollohan's former aide who runs Vandalia and is the co-owner of the North Carolina beach property with the congressman. ''A lot of what we do would not get done otherwise.''
 Created in 2000 to help artisans market their creations over the Internet -- Mr. Mollohan favors the earthenware pottery -- MountainMade also runs glassblowing, spinning and felt-making workshops in another downtown building that Vandalia renovated. 
 The Canaan Valley Institute, which grew out of an effort to create a wildlife refuge near property that Mr. Mollohan owns, is building a $33 million headquarters with classrooms and laboratories on 3,208 acres that it bought with earmarks he secured.
 Vandalia owns more than a score of properties throughout Mr. Mollohan's district like the Baltimore & Ohio station in Grafton that it is turning into a museum and office space and lots in Fairmont, where it plans to build houses. Earmarks from HUD bought the mothballed Waldo Hotel in Clarksburg ($230,000 in 2000) and 1,129 acres in Canaan Valley ($2.4 million in 2004). 
 Mr. Mollohan and the organizations' managers said their goal was to wean from earmarks and be self-sustaining. But Canaan Valley, the oldest, continues to rely on earmarks for 97 percent of its money. Last year, MountainMade received $1,085,308 from the S.B.A., nearly twice its $553,000 in sales. MountainMade also had a $124,000 state grant. 
 As for Vandalia, 92 percent of its $31.5 million in grants since 1999 arrived through federal earmarks. Separately, the 2004 tax return for the organization shows that 96 percent of its $8.5 million revenue was from government grants.
 None of the three groups have dues-paying members, like many such organizations, or run regular fund-raisers. They worry about the crackdown on earmarks. The Vandalia pipeline has begun to dry up since Mr. Mollohan left the subcommittee that appropriates HUD money. The organizations said success in finding other sources had been sporadic.

The Quid Pro Quos
 ''The congressman gave us money'' for this or that is how the groups' leaders frequently explain their programs. And they generally return the favor at fund-raisers.
 A review of campaign finance records by The New York Times shows that from 1997 through February 2006, top-paid employees, board members and contractors of the five organizations gave at least $397,122 to Mr. Mollohan's campaign and political action committees. 
 Thirty-eight individuals with leadership roles, including all five chief executives -- all but one of whose 2004 salaries outpaced the $98,456 national average among nonprofit leaders -- contributed, often giving the maximum allowed. 
 At the same time, workers at companies that do business with the federally financed groups were among Mr. Mollohan's leading contributors. Employees of TMC Technologies, which had a $50,000 contract with Vandalia in 2003, have given $63,450 since 1998. Workers at Electronic Warfare Associates and Man Tech International, military contractors that rent space from the technology consortium and whose chief executives are on the board of the Institute for Scientific Research, combined to give $86,750. 
 For Kate McComas, a weaver who is the executive director of MountainMade, the $1,000 check that she wrote in March 2004 at a Mollohan fund-raiser was a first. ''I bought a pair of high heels to wear,'' Ms. McComas recalled. ''I thank him every occasion I see him for the opportunity we have here.''
 Asked whether contributions were required or expected, Kevin Niewoehner, the departed chief executive of the Institute for Scientific Research, said: '' 'Required' is such a strong term. The political environment and the access that goes along with it has a number of expectations that involves what is appropriate and what isn't appropriate.'' He added that the first hint that he was falling out of favor occurred in October, when a $250 check he wrote to the campaign was returned uncashed. 
 ''I received invitations to those events on a regular basis,'' he said. ''I was invited to participate, and I participated.''

'Teaming to Win'
 Mr. Mollohan scoffed at the suggestion that the overlap among the groups that he supports and his supporters meant anything more than a meeting of the minds.
 ''I like to think I'm supported because I work hard,'' he said. ''Because I bring a collaborative, a 'teaming to win,' if you will, approach to solving the really difficult challenges facing West Virginia.''
 The team includes overlapping rosters among the five organizations. In addition to Ms. Kuhns's multiple roles, Jack Carpenter, an old friend of the congressman, is vice president of the consortium and chairman of the MountainMade board. The board once included Mr. Mollohan's wife, Barbara. 
 Raymond A. Oliverio, executive vice president of the consortium, is also treasurer of the Robert H. Mollohan Foundation, named for the congressman's late father. Gina Fantasia, Vandalia's legal counsel, moved over last year from the Institute for Scientific Research. Her brother Nick, mayor of Fairmont, is chairman of the Vandalia Redevelopment Corporation, a heritage foundation sister.
 ''He effectively referred to it as a family,'' said a person involved in the Mollohan network, likening the operation to keiretsu, the Japanese concept of intermeshed corporate boards. 
 Down the hill from the steel structure here is the more pedestrian $14 million Alan B. Mollohan Innovation Center, built with $3.5 million in earmarks. It is the home of the high-tech consortium, which began in 1990 as six small companies hoping to seed a new economic area. The center has 200 affiliates throughout the state. Earmarks are its engine, underwriting high-tech projects like AmberView, which seeks to create a national database of three-dimensional school photographs to help find missing children. 
 The consortium has had better luck following earmarks with competitive grants. Its Information Research Corporation was spun off as a for-profit subsidiary after obtaining a $10 million Navy contract to build 2,500 BomBots, robotlike tractors that remotely deliver explosives .
 ''The congressman has enabled programs and entities to get started,'' said Tom Witt, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research. ''But at some point, they're going to have to make the transition or they'll die.''
 The big test will be the $134 million Institute for Scientific Research building, three-quarters paid by NASA and HUD earmarks. The 57-member staff is barely large enough to fill a corner of the 600-plus capacity of the building.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Said to Try to Woo Golisano Away From Fight 

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and MICHAEL COOPER; David Staba contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for governor, met last week with a Republican nemesis, Thomas Golisano, in what Democrats described as a Spitzer attempt to woo Mr. Golisano after a disastrous meeting between the two men last summer.
 New York Democrats who were told about the meeting said that it was constructive and civil, unlike the earlier get-together, but that it was unclear whether Mr. Golisano had been deterred from using his political and financial clout to harm Mr. Spitzer's candidacy or otherwise influencing the race. 
Mr. Golisano, a Rochester billionaire who ran for governor in 1994, 1998 and 2002, came close to undertaking a fourth campaign this year. Golisano aides said he was especially fired up to run after the earlier meeting with Mr. Spitzer, where, both sides agree, the two men boasted of beating the other and Mr. Golisano assailed Mr. Spitzer as a Democratic insider who would not overhaul government in Albany.
 In January, however, Mr. Golisano announced that he would instead focus on supporting reform-minded candidates. He has recently attended Sabres games with two candidates for governor, William F. Weld, a Republican, and Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat. He has also met with Kenneth Langone, a billionaire businessman who has been sued by Mr. Spitzer's office and is working to defeat him in the governor's race. And he is considering supporting candidates for the State Senate. 
 Amid rumors of a Golisano-Langone financial effort to derail Mr. Spitzer with television commercials or other means, a detente between Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Golisano would carry political significance.
 The meeting took place last Friday at Mr. Golisano's suite at the Waldorf Towers in New York City and lasted for about an hour. According to Democrats told about the meeting, the two men talked about state politics and the governor's race, as well as the upstate economy and hockey.
 These Democrats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because both men wanted to keep the meeting private, said there were no eruptions like the conflict at the last meeting, which took place over breakfast at the Waldorf.
 One of the Democrats said that Mr. Golisano had come to believe that it would be very difficult to beat Mr. Spitzer, who holds big leads in fund-raising and in public opinion polls over Mr. Suozzi and the Republicans running for governor. This view could not be independently confirmed yesterday.
 Political advisers to Mr. Golisano declined to comment on the meeting, as did campaign aides to Mr. Spitzer. 
 In separate developments in the Republican race yesterday, Mr. Weld's stewardship of Decker College -- the bankrupt Kentucky trade school that he led for 10 months last year -- was thrust back into the campaign by several new claims that were filed in the school's bankruptcy proceedings.
 The United States Department of Education filed a new claim saying that the school owed it more than $32 million because it had given out federal financial aid improperly -- far more than federal officials previously said. And Mr. Weld filed his own claim on Wednesday, seeking protection for some loans to the school that he had personally guaranteed. The new claims were first reported in The Louisville Courier-Journal.
 Dominick Ianno, a spokesman for Mr. Weld, declined to comment yesterday.
 Meanwhile, another Republican candidate for governor, John Faso, charged yesterday that his own party chairman was trying to deny him a spot on the Sept. 12 primary ballot to help Mr. Weld.
 Mr. Faso said in an interview that the chairman, Stephen J. Minarik III, who has backed Mr. Weld, ''should have a neutral stance in this process and not attempt to rig it for one candidate who has never run before in New York State.'' Mr. Weld, a Long Island native, lived in Massachusetts for decades and was governor there from 1991 to 1997 before moving back to New York in 2000.
 Mr. Minarik said in a statement that he and Mr. Faso had their differences, but added that it was Democrats, not Republicans, who had publicly said that they might block a candidate from their ballot, Mr. Suozzi, to help another candidate, Mr. Spitzer.

HEADLINE: First, a Leak; Now, a Jam 

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE; Thom Shanker contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
That President Bush authorized an aide to disclose classified intelligence on Iraqi weapons, as asserted in court papers, comes as no shock to official Washington. The leaking of secrets has long been a favored tool of policy debate, political combat and diplomatic one-upmanship.
 ''We've had leaking of this kind since the administration of George Washington,'' said Rick Shenkman, a presidential historian at George Mason University. 
But the accusation that Mr. Bush, through Vice President Dick Cheney, authorized the aide, I. Lewis Libby Jr., to fight back against critics of the war by discussing a classified prewar intelligence estimate comes at a particularly awkward time for the administration. 
 And Mr. Libby's account, describing Mr. Bush's approving Mr. Cheney's request in 2003 that Mr. Libby, then the vice president's chief of staff, share reports on Iraqi weapons with a reporter for The New York Times, bares behind-the-scenes details that usually do not emerge until long after an administration has left office.
 For months, Mr. Bush and his top aides have campaigned against leaks of classified information as a danger to the nation and as criminal acts. A Washington Post report on secret overseas jails run by the C.I.A. and a New York Times report on domestic eavesdropping by the National Security Agency have led to criminal investigations, and scores of intelligence officers have been ordered to take polygraph tests.
 In that context, the report that the president was himself approving a leak may do serious political damage, said Mr. Shenkman, who has a blog on presidential politics. ''It does give the public such a powerful example of hypocrisy that I think it might linger for a while,'' he said.
 Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman, disputed the charge of a double standard on leaks. ''There is a difference between declassifying information in the national interest and the unauthorized disclosure'' of national security information, Mr. McClellan said Friday. Of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, part of which Mr. Libby shared with Judith Miller, then a Times reporter, Mr. McClellan said, ''There was nothing in there that would compromise national security.''
 Mr. McClellan's tone contrasted sharply with that of administration officials after the N.S.A. story broke in December. Mr. Bush told a news conference at the time: ''My personal opinion is it was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in a time of war. The fact that we're discussing this program is helping the enemy.''
 Others picked up the theme, including Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and Porter J. Goss, the C.I.A. director. On Feb. 2, Mr. Goss told a Senate committee, ''It is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information.'' 
 Republicans in Congress, led by Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, have also pressed the issue. By coincidence, the committee's report on the annual intelligence authorization bill was made public on Friday. It features a vehement attack, describing leakers as ''a small few who have taken it upon themselves to, for political or other motives, recklessly and illegally disclose America's necessary secrets and national security information.''
 Leaking intelligence information to the news media, the committee reports, ''costs untold millions of dollars in lost intelligence collection capabilities funded by U.S. taxpayers, literally puts lives in jeopardy, and makes the work by the honorable people of our intelligence community far more difficult.''
 In the case of Mr. Libby's disclosures to Ms. Miller, the consequences were hardly so dire. But neither was the political result evidently sought by the White House achieved. 
 Ms. Miller wrote no newspaper article about the leaked weapons information, and 10 days later the administration formally declassified a summary of the intelligence document in question.
 Some earlier authorized disclosures by the Bush administration, to the reporter and author Bob Woodward, had far more impact. Mr. Woodward's 2002 book, ''Bush at War,'' based on extensive interviews with Mr. Bush and other officials, as well as access to internal White House documents, was a generally positive portrait. Mr. Woodward's 2004 book, ''Plan of Attack,'' was less warmly received at the White House.
 The Bush administration, like its predecessors, has also used formal, public declassification of secret intelligence for policy purposes. The prewar presentation to the United Nations by Colin L. Powell, then secretary of state, used N.S.A. intercepts of Iraqi military officers and satellite photos of Saddam Hussein's suspected weapons sites to make the case. In 1983, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, President Ronald Reagan's United Nations ambassador, used dramatic N.S.A. recordings to denounce the Soviet Union for shooting down a South Korean civilian airliner.
 There have also been cases in which presidents, in the heat of the moment, have spontaneously revealed secrets. During the 1964 presidential campaign, under attack by Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee, as soft on defense, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose to reveal the existence of a highly classified, experimental reconnaissance aircraft, the SR-71 Blackbird.
 In the Pentagon Papers case of 1971, the Nixon administration went to court to halt publication of a secret government history of the Vietnam War, which had been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg. Max Frankel, then the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, filed an 18-page affidavit that gave a colorful insider's account of the role of leaked secrets as the lifeblood of Washington.
 Mr. Frankel, who had spent a decade as a journalist in the capital, recalled President John F. Kennedy's staff members trying to prove his ''toughness'' by passing on quotations from an argument he had had with the Soviet foreign minister. Mr. Frankel told of standing beside President Johnson, ''knee-deep in his Texas swimming pool,'' as Mr. Johnson recounted for more than an hour his conversation of the day before with the Soviet prime minister.
 Without the use of secrets, Mr. Frankel argued at the time, ''there could be no adequate diplomatic, military and political reporting of the kind our people take for granted.''

HEADLINE: Blame and Uncertainty as Immigration Deal Fails

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and RACHEL L. SWARNS; Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The Senate's effort to pass immigration legislation collapsed on Friday, and lawmakers went home for a two-week recess to face voters who are as deeply and passionately divided on the issue as Congress has proven to be.
 Less than 24 hours after senators celebrated a bipartisan agreement that would have given most illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens, created a temporary guest worker program to meet the needs of business and tightened border security, the deal was derailed by a feud that erupted largely along partisan lines. 
Creators of the proposal said they had the support of as many as 70 senators. But they were unable or unwilling to resolve secondary disputes over amendments and other technical issues, and the measure was yanked from the floor.
 It is not clear when or whether the Senate may try again. 
 The politics of the issue are in flux, reflecting the crosscurrents created by conservatives who want to see the border sealed off to illegal immigration, employers who say they need workers, and the growing assertiveness of Hispanic immigrants and their supporters. Both parties seem uncertain as to whether they are better off agreeing to a compromise or blocking one, and they seem still to be gauging public opinion.
 Immigrants are planning marches and rallies around the country on Monday in favor of granting legal status to illegal workers already in the United States. Business groups will be lobbying lawmakers in coming weeks to keep seeking an agreement, while conservatives will be sending letters, faxes and e-mail to urge Congress not to agree to anything that smacks of amnesty.
 ''I think politics got in front of policy on this issue,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of those who helped broker the bipartisan plan.
 The failure to achieve an agreement that had appeared so close led to recriminations over who was at fault. Senior Democrats blamed Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, as striking a deal and then being unable to bring along key Republicans.
 But Republicans accused Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, of erecting procedural obstacles to deny Senate Republicans a victory on the politically charged subject in an election year.
 ''There has been one huge problem, and that problem has been created by the Democratic leadership,'' said Mr. Frist, referring to the fight over how many amendments could be considered.
 Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, who supports the compromise, said the issue was so complex that it would take awhile for the nation and for lawmakers to come to terms with it.
 ''It encompasses societal, economic, security issues that are all woven into one fabric,'' Mr. Hagel said of the immigration issue. ''And when you have that much at stake for a nation, it's going to take some time to work through it.''
 After unsuccessful efforts to shut off debate on competing immigration proposals, the legislation was sent back to the Judiciary Committee. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the panel, said he would immediately return to work on border policy when senators get back after the two-week break.
 But advocates for immigrants worried that time might actually hurt the coalition as lawmakers weighed their constituents' reaction to the details of the deal.
 ''I'm a little worried that the political momentum that we witnessed this week may dissipate somewhat,'' said Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.
 With other business like annual spending bills starting to pile up and the election drawing closer, some lawmakers said the best opportunity to approve legislation and start negotiations with the House might have been lost.
 ''You would have to say it is going to be a tough uphill battle now with the limited time we have remaining in the session,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.
 A senior House Republican engaged on immigration issues, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, also suggested that Congress might want to slow down.
 ''My sense is we would do better waiting until after the election,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It is a sensitive, emotional, complex issue that should not be rushed through when we don't understand the consequences and implications.''
 But Mr. Sharry said that the rallies around the country, depending upon their size, might also help galvanize support for the agreement. And Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he hoped that the marchers and supporters of immigrant rights would put pressure on the Democratic leadership, which he accused of blocking the deal.
 Members of a core group of lawmakers who raced over the past two weeks to find a compromise that could pass before Congress broke for recess said they were troubled by the outcome, which Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, attributed to trivial issues and partisan backbiting.
 ''It is very disappointing, but I share the determination of my colleague to go forward,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, an author of the bipartisan proposal, said the issue ''will not go away.'' He said he held Mr. Reid responsible for the legislative breakdown because of his refusal to allow conservative opponents of the legislation an opportunity to offer amendments. 
 Mr. McCain and Mr. Kennedy said they had the votes to defeat those proposals and protect the underlying bill.
 Republicans also criticized the Democratic leadership as insisting on assurances that members of the Judiciary Committee would serve as negotiators with the House over a final bill before the Senate even gave initial approval to the measure.
 Mr. Reid and his allies said they objected to the amendments because they saw them as an effort to derail the compromise with a back-door filibuster. And they said they wanted guarantees on negotiations with the House because the Senate had been bullied by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin and the Judiciary Committee chairman, in recent talks and they wanted to avoid a repeat occurrence.
 Mr. Reid said the major problem, however, was that Mr. Frist had shaken hands on the bipartisan compromise and then was unable to quiet Republican critics who were trying to gum up the works.
 ''I reached out to Bill Frist, but his position on this matter simply defies logic,'' said Mr. Reid, who denied he was trying to kill the measure for political gain. ''He needed the courage to move forward.''
 Angry over the Democratic refusal to consider amendments, Republicans easily defeated an effort to end debate on the bipartisan proposal, 60 to 38, 22 votes short of the 60 required. Democrats then blocked the effort to end debate on a Republican measure that focused on border controls and law enforcement on a 62-to-36 vote.

HEADLINE: Committee Acts to Doom New England Wind Farm 

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
A Senate-House conference committee has approved a measure that would effectively kill a proposal for the first large offshore wind farm in the United States, in Nantucket Sound south of Cape Cod, Mass. 
 The measure, an amendment to a Coast Guard budget bill, gives the governor of ''the adjacent state,'' Massachusetts, veto power over any wind farm in the sound. Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, opposes the wind farm, and most of the candidates running to replace him in the election for governor this fall have also come out against it, as have most of the state's prominent politicians.
 The budget bill now goes to the full Congress, and members are expected to consider it after their recess.
 Jim Gordon, president of Cape Wind Associates, the private company that proposed the wind farm, said the language that would kill it was inserted into the measure, without hearings or other public discussion, in an ''egregious abuse'' of the legislative process.
 ''By arbitrarily legislating a new barrier on a single project, solely because of local opposition, this provision will impede the development of offshore renewable energy throughout the country,'' Mr. Gordon said in a statement.
 But Charles Vinick, president of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization formed to fight the project, said that the part of the sound chosen for the installation was unique in that it is federal water surrounded by state waters. 
 The language inserted in the bill may look ''political,'' Mr. Vinick said, but ''people were paying attention to the fact that Nantucket Sound has some unique features.''
 The installation would comprise 130 turbines in a grid that would occupy 24 square miles of the sound. Each tower, with its turbines and blades, would rise 420 feet above the water. Cape Wind said the project would produce three-quarters of the electricity now used on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. 
 The proposal won the support of many environmental groups and lawmakers.
 But many Massachusetts politicians of both parties have long objected to the proposal, saying Nantucket Sound, a major attraction for the region's tourism-based economy, is a poor site for so large an industrial installation. Others argued that nothing so elaborate should be built in federal waters until the government had established a way to regulate them.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Halt Aid to Palestinian Government

BYLINE: BY STEVEN R. WEISMAN and CRAIG S. SMITH; Steven R. Weisman reported from Washington for this article, and Craig S. Smith from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The United States and the European Union announced Friday that they would halt payments to the Hamas-led Palestinian government but that aid would flow to Palestinians through the United Nations and other independent organizations.
 ''The new Palestinian government must take responsibility for the consequences of its policies,'' said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, citing the failure of the Hamas-led government to meet donors' demands that it recognize Israel, renounce violence and respect previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
The United States cutoff would affect $400 million of aid that has not yet been expended. Of that sum, however, about $100 million would be redirected to the United Nations and other non-Palestinian groups to spend for basic human needs like food, health and schools. 
 The total for these ''humanitarian'' programs would rise to $245 million because of the redirected funds. But that left $300 million in aid owed to the Palestinians suspended pending further review.
 State Department officials said they were suspending $300 million partly because there were not enough organizations in the West Bank and Gaza to carry out programs. Officials said no American money would be given to the executive branch of government led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who has criticized the Hamas leadership for failing to reach out to Israel. 
 The decision on Mr. Abbas was a surprise, because American officials had earlier said that they were looking for ways to circumvent Hamas and support him directly. While the American officials gave no reason for the decision, they indicated that he had not established control over security forces and border crossings to justify giving him aid. Supporters of Israel in Congress told the administration they would object to money going to Mr. Abbas. 
 Asked if Mr. Abbas might eventually receive American aid for these purposes, C. David Welch, the assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, said: ''Not now. But I don't rule it out, and I don't rule it in.''
 Mr. Welch said that, mirroring the American actions, the ''broad trend'' of European governments had been ''supportive of the direction that we are going in'' of cutting off aid to day-to-day Palestinian operations but letting money flow for ''humanitarian'' purposes.
 The European Union's foreign ministers were to meet Monday in Luxembourg to discuss how to carry out their cutoff, but a spokeswoman said Friday that the outlines of what it would do were already clear.
 ''We are not authorizing any payments that go to the Palestinian Authority or through the Palestinian Authority,'' said Emma Udwin, the spokeswoman for the European Union's executive branch. The foreign ministers may try to funnel payments to individual ministries not under Hamas control, however.
 The European Union has been the Palestinian Authority's largest donor since the government was created under the 1993 Oslo peace accords. It has been warning since Hamas won Palestinian elections earlier this year that the Palestinian Authority would lose that aid unless the Hamas-led government renounced violence, recognized Israel and accept past peace agreements.
 Hamas advocates the violent destruction of the Jewish state, but that briefly came into question after the Palestinian foreign minister, Mahmoud Zahar, discussed the issue in general in an interview published Friday in The Times of London. ''Let us speak about what is the meaning of the two-state solution,'' he said. ''We will ask them what is their concept concerning the two-state solution.''
 Later Friday, the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, insisted that Hamas had not changed its position. ''That is not correct,'' he said in the town of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported. ''Where did you hear that?''
 He criticized the Europeans' cutoff of aid, saying they were ''punishing the Palestinian people'' for their democratic choice. 
 Explaining the European decision, officials in Brussels said the European Union had stopped all direct aid to the Palestinian government and payment of public employees' salaries with European Union funds through the World Bank. Aid is to continue to flow through international and nongovernmental organizations. 
 The European Union began providing direct budgetary assistance to the Palestinian Authority in 2000 after Israel, trying to isolate Yasir Arafat, froze monthly transfers of tax and customs receipts collected on behalf of the Palestinians under an economic protocol signed in 1994.
 Europe's direct payments, which totaled more than $200 million from 2000 to 2002, led to the establishment of a World Bank-monitored trust fund, which is now used by most international donors to disburse money to the fledgling Palestinian government in return for its willingness to meet certain standards of improved fiscal governance.
 European Union members provided about $600 million in aid to the Palestinians last year. More than half came from the European Union's budget and the remainder from individual member states.
 Israel is withholding about $50 million in monthly tax and customs receipts to the Palestinian Authority. 
 The Palestinian Authority has said that it needs at least $150 million a month to cover salaries and operations. Last month's salaries for 140,000 Palestinian Authority employees have not yet been paid.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Was Solid Last Month 

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's work force grew by a healthy 211,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.7 percent, the government reported yesterday, suggesting that the economy has picked up speed and is likely to keep growing in the months ahead despite the prospect of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve.
 Claiming credit, President Bush cited the latest increase in hiring as evidence of an economic resurgence fueled by his tax cuts, which he is pressing Congress to extend, particularly the lower tax rates on capital gains and stock dividends. 
With the March report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the work force has expanded for 31 consecutive months. Since November, the economy has added an average of 218,000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate has fallen consistently under 5 percent, from more than 6 percent three years ago. It was 4.8 percent in February. 
 ''The momentum in the labor market is now driving economic growth,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, ''and that helps to offset some of the worries we all have about a potential downturn in housing.''
 On Wall Street, the jobs report suggested to many traders that the Federal Reserve might respond by continuing to raise the crucial interest rates that it controls, not only at the May meeting of the Fed's policy makers but also at subsequent meetings. 
 Stock prices plunged, as they often do when rates seem likely to rise and bonds and other interest-bearing securities become more appealing as an investment.
 ''Today's jobs report adds a little more pressure on the Fed to go to 5.25 percent,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, ''but we still think the Fed will stop at 5 percent in May.'' 
 President Bush argued that the good job numbers and the strength of the current recovery were a result of the tax cuts he pushed through Congress. ''Tax relief has done exactly what it was designed to do,'' he said in a statement, adding: ''Yet some are now proposing that we raise taxes, either by repealing the tax cuts or letting them expire.''
 Democrats were quick to attack the president's claim. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, noted that job growth, despite its recent strength, is much weaker in this recovery than in previous ones.
 Bruce Bartlett, a conservative Republican economist who favors tax cuts as a source of economic growth but has turned against the White House because he views its economic policies as reckless, also argued that Mr. Bush's statement was misleading.
 ''Tax cuts do lift the trend rate of growth over the long run,'' said Mr. Bartlett, who served in the Treasury Department under President Bush's father, George H. W. Bush. But ''tax policy doesn't affect business cycles; I don't see any evidence they are working.''
 By at least one standard, they are not. March was the fifth anniversary of the current business cycle, which started with a recession just after President Bush took office and then a painfully slow recovery in which the overall number of jobs continued to shrink until September 2003. 
 By comparison with the four other business cycles since World War II that lasted at least five years, job growth has been considerably weaker in this upturn than in the past. 
 In the weakest of those earlier cycles -- which began in the early 1990's -- the work force had grown 6.8 percent on the fifth birthday, compared with 1.9 percent today.
 ''Our expectations have been pretty diminished,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute. ''A good month used to be 300,000 more jobs and now it is 200,000.''
 The work force has grown by 590,000 jobs so far this year, including a downward adjustment of 34,000 jobs in earlier estimates for January and February. 
 The additions in March were across many industries, with the notable exception of manufacturing, which lost 5,000 jobs, continuing a decline resulting in part from the inroads that imported merchandise has made on the production of goods in this country.
 The biggest gains last month were in restaurant and hotel employment, in retailing, in health care and in government, mainly at the state and municipal level, with education accounting for most of the growth. The construction industry, on the other hand, added only 7,000 jobs in March, well below its usual pace.
 If there was anything puzzling to economists in the recent news from the job market, it is the combination of a jobless rate under 5 percent -- suggesting a shortage of workers available to hire -- with only mild wage increases. The average hourly pay of nonmanagement workers, about 80 percent of the nation's 135 million workers, rose by only 3 cents last month, to $16.49, the smallest increase this year.
 Over the last 12 months, hourly wages are up just 3.4 percent, a bit less than the increase in the inflation rate and well in line with productivity gains, undercutting concerns on Wall Street that a tight labor market is giving workers leverage to extract sharply higher pay.
 ''There is some angst in the markets about potential inflation,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation, ''but I don't think the Fed is overly concerned.''
 The job growth and rising incomes, particularly among those at the top of the income ladder, have emerged as a fresh source of support for consumer spending just as borrowing against the rising value of homes is slowing.
 ''Job growth is a strong point in the economy,'' Mr. Harris of Lehman Brothers said, ''and it helps to offset some of the worries of a slowdown in consumer spending because of a potential downturn in housing.''

 BODY:
THE END OF POVERTY: Economic Possibilities for Our Time, by Jeffrey D. Sachs. (Penguin, $16.) Sachs makes a bold declaration: If wealthy countries increased their combined foreign aid budgets to between $135 billion and $195 billion for the next decade, that money could eliminate extreme global poverty by 2025. Too many countries, he argues, are caught in a ''poverty trap,'' a combination of poor geography, poor infrastructure and poor health care. Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and a special adviser on global poverty to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, also recounts his experiences as an adviser to distressed and developing nations, including Bolivia, Poland and Russia.
WINDOWS ON THE WORLD, by Frederic Beigbeder. Translated by Frank Wynne. (Miramax/Hyperion, $13.95.) This strangely moving novel alternates between the diarylike ruminations of ''Beigbeder'' -- a shiftless, self-impressed intellectual who feels impelled to write about 9/11 -- and an account of the death of a father and his two boys who were breakfasting at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center's north tower. 
 IN THE COMPANY OF CHEERFUL LADIES, by Alexander McCall Smith. (Anchor, $12.95.) In the sixth novel of the beguiling No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Precious Ramotswe's sociopathic first husband returns to Botswana and threatens to destroy her successful career and happy second marriage. 
 ASSASSINATION VACATION, by Sarah Vowell. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) Mixing history, travelogue and social criticism, these darkly comic essays survey the landscape of presidential assassinations. Vowell, a journalist and contributor to ''This American Life'' on public radio, focuses on the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield and William McKinley, visiting virtually every historical site associated with them. There are small revelations throughout the book -- Garfield's spine, removed during autopsy, was passed around to jurors during his assassin's trial -- as well as an examination of how these deaths have been used. In the Book Review, Bruce Handy called ''Assassination Vacation'' a ''learned, engagingly discursive, funny, sometimes even jolly ramble.''
 A PERFECT STRANGER: And Other Stories, by Roxana Robinson. (Random House, $13.95.) Robinson's third story collection explores relationships and misunderstandings between people, usually family members, trying to overcome a creeping disenchantment with their lives. In the title story, a husband and wife privately feud while playing host to an opera scholar for the weekend. Our reviewer, Bliss Broyard, said Robinson ''is particularly good at charting the ebb and flow of affection and fury within relationships.''
 CHARLOTTE: Being a True Account of an Actress's Flamboyant Adventures in Eighteenth-Century London's Wild and Wicked Theatrical World, by Kathryn Shevelow. (Picador, $16.) This is a vivid biography of Charlotte Charke (1713-60), wayward daughter of the comic actor and poet laureate Colley Cibber. Shevelow recreates Charlotte's prodigious theatrical rise and precipitous fall, and her enigmatic life offstage as a cross-dressing single mother and memoirist.
 THE CHRYSANTHEMUM PALACE, by Bruce Wagner. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) In Wagner's latest piercing Hollywood satire, a 38-year-old struggling actor named Bertie Krohn lives in the shadow of his father, the creator of TV's longest-running science fiction series, ''Starwatch.'' Bertie has a recurring role on the show, but a complicated love triangle develops when he is joined on the set by his childhood sweetheart and her on-again-off-again lover. ''Wagner marries his dagger-sharp, lapidary wit to an emotionally arresting narrative whose phaser is set on scorch,'' Henry Alford wrote here.
 PLAN B: Further Thoughts on Faith, by Anne Lamott. (Riverhead, $14.) In a series of smart, quirky essays, Lamott, the author of ''Operating Instructions'' and ''Traveling Mercies,'' meditates on personal and political matters, from her frustration over the war in Iraq to her evolving relationship with her teenage son. '' 'Plan B' is vintage Lamott -- the dry humor, the disarming self-loathing, the irreverence, the unshakable love of Jesus Christ,'' our reviewer, Lauren F. Winner, wrote. In DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR? An Unreligious Writer Investigates Religious Calling (Penguin, $15), Minna Proctor, a self-described secular Jew, discusses coming to terms with her father, a nonobservant Catholic who applies to become an Episcopal priest.

Big Lots
 Is the marketplace perfectly efficient? If producer supply and shopper demand always synched up just right, then perhaps there would be no reason for a chain like Big Lots to exist. Big Lots has about 1,400 locations around the United States and revenue of $4.4 billion in its most recently concluded fiscal year. The chain specializes in ''closeouts.'' There are many kinds of closeout merchandise, but what this often means in practice is that unlike a store that tries to figure out where the demand is and get the proper supply in stock to meet it, Big Lots starts with supply and seeks demand. 
Late last year, for example, Big Lots offered 20-inch Huffy Chopper bicycles for about $60 (or even $50, during holiday-season sales). When Huffy manufactured the bikes, the idea was that they would be sold at retailers like Wal-Mart and Kmart for a price closer to $100. But Huffy has had a very rough ride in recent years. (It re-emerged from bankruptcy in 2005.) ''They had large quantities of this product on hand,'' says John Martin, Big Lots' executive vice president for merchandising, ''but it was being discontinued by the retailers who had stocked it.'' Big Lots had never offered bicycles in large quantities before but bought half the 35,000 bikes to see what would happen. They ''blew out'' the doors, Martin says. So the chain bought the rest of the bikes and put them on sale in March. 
 About half of the typical Big Lots selling floor is given over to closeouts like those Huffy bikes, each one offering a particular narrative on the imperfections of the marketplace. Sometimes the chain cuts a deal with a middleman who has acquired, say, production overruns of Lee jeans. Or it buys up ''reconditioned'' products, like Dyson vacuum cleaners that have been returned to the manufacturer (''usually just buyer's remorse,'' Martin maintains). Sometimes merchandise has to be liquidated simply because of a packaging alteration (either a new design, or even, as when Procter & Gamble bought Gillette not long ago, changes to the Universal Product Code numbers). Another recent example involved a few hundred thousand lampshades, made by a firm called Alsy Lighting, and intended for sale at places like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, at retail prices in the $9 to $20 range; those stores were shifting their mix of product styles, so the shades ended up at Big Lots, priced between $3 and $7. 
 While this makes for an adventurous business model, it would seem to create a frustrating shopping experience. The chain advertises specific deals, but of course those deals are always short-term: the closeout offerings change constantly, and if you show up looking for a bike or a pair of jeans, you're unlikely to be satisfied with a lampshade, no matter what the price. But according to Martin, about 80 percent of Big Lots shoppers show up with no shopping list at all; they are just browsing for bargains. Many, he adds, consider themselves ''treasure hunters.''
 It makes sense, then, that Big Lots does not play down the notion that it specializes in merchandise that basically needs to be discarded for one reason or another. Signs in the store suggest that a ''closeout'' is an exciting thing to have access to. And a television ad for the chain shows a pair of ''bargain shoppers'' browsing, and one marvels: ''You know what? These are only 18 bucks, they're usually 32.'' You can't see what ''these'' are, but it doesn't really matter. Big Lots doesn't sell products; it sells bargains.
 While the specific products coming into the stores vary, Martin says, Big Lots doesn't worry too much about always having something to sell -- whether the economy is booming or flailing. ''There are always misses,'' he observes. And presumably, there are always shoppers willing to believe that those misses might actually be treasures. If supply and demand are mismatched on the first try, it's inevitable that there will be another try, and then another, until a match is made. This is how the marketplace converts, say, a lampshade from a must-liquidate style in one context to a must-have bargain in another. All of which, of course, means that the existence of Big Lots is not evidence of the marketplace's failures but of its efficiency.

HEADLINE: A Century Later, The Stoop Persists In a New Form

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE decay and housing abandonment of Harlem beginning in the 1960's left broken-tooth gaps all over, like a London neighborhood hit by scattered bombs in a Luftwaffe raid. But most of the area has rebounded with new construction, including 128th Street between Fifth and Lenox Avenues. 
 Here, a handful of empty lots have been filled with what look like new high-stoop row houses. But they're different from the brownstones of the 19th century -- and it's not just the stone. 
Construction on West 128th Street took off in the 1880's and 1890's, including the row of brick and brownstone houses built around 1891 at Nos. 25 through 35. Of these, Nos. 31, 33 and 35 remain. 
 The high-stoop solution for the row house achieved dominance in the 1850's, to accommodate an entrance to the kitchen and service areas a little below grade and another entrance to the entertaining rooms, well above street level. Deliveries and servants had the most direct path inside, whereas owners and guests had to climb a flight of stairs outside, but this counterintuitive architectural solution was not seriously questioned.
 The persistence of the stoop in the 19th century is something of a mystery to historians. By the turn of the century, row-house builders had shifted to grade-level entrances, so why didn't householders demand that solution decades earlier?
 The early residents of this block of West 128th were people like Joseph A. Britton, who lived at No. 6, an investigator who infiltrated gambling dens for Anthony Comstock's Society for the Suppression of Vice. At one point, he supervised a force of 14 undercover agents. 
 The houses on West 128th were not crowded: Mr. Britton lived there with only his wife. 
 The black migration that swept through Harlem after the turn of the century repopulated the houses with working-class families, and the 1930 census yields a revealing economic picture of the changes overtaking the street. One white family remained on the block, at No. 8, in a house valued at $10,000. The house at No. 35 was occupied by Alphonse Black, 35, an African-American auto mechanic, and his family of five -- they rented it for $80 a month.
 Next door, No. 33 was divided among four black families -- 15 people in all, paying a total of $127 a month. More tenants meant more rent for the landlord.
 As Harlem went into a downward slide, many buildings were demolished, wore out into empty shells or, worse, became havens for drug dealers and other criminals. 
 Although spring grass now sprouts where houses once stood at Nos. 25 through 29, there are few vacant lots left on West 128th Street. Eight have been filled with handsome new row houses, with high stoops, trim cornices, attractive variegated orange brick and projecting oriel windows on the main floor. 
 But actually there is no main floor -- each building is three apartments; those on the upper two floors are reached by an old-style exterior stoop. In fact, it's not even a row, at least in the old sense. Although the eight new buildings are essentially identical, they are sprinkled along both sides of the street, at Nos. 28, 28A, 30, 34, 58, 79, 81 and 83 West 128th. Call it a row for a deconstructed age.
 David Danois, an architect, filed plans for the buildings in 1999 as part of a program sponsored by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Partnership, a civic group. Vacant lots were turned over to a single developer for construction of owner-occupied buildings that would help stabilize what were then iffy neighborhoods. 
 Mr. Danois says that each of the new row houses has an owner's duplex on the first two floors, plus two rental apartments on the upper floors, reached by the stoop. 
 Mr. Danois said he included stoops on all the buildings so that they would blend in with the rest of the neighborhood. But there are important differences between the 1890's and the 1990's: on the traditional row house, the ground-floor entrance was concealed right under the stoop. 
 But on the contemporary model, the ground-floor doorway is in the open, to one side of the stoop. This permits access by people with disabilities.
 The stoop itself makes a 90-degree turn and fits completely within the building line -- the stoops on older row houses were permitted to project beyond the lot, a privilege since withdrawn. 
 The old row houses were 60 feet from front to back (or even deeper), leading to dark interiors, a particular hardship when gas was used for illumination. But in Mr. Danois's design the apartments are no more than 50 feet deep, with correspondingly more light. 
 Michael Cummings, a police officer, has owned 28A West 128th Street for four years. ''I originally wanted a big yard and looked at the standard places where police officers go -- upstate, Long Island -- but I'd be traveling an hour or more to commute,'' he said. Living on West 128th, he said, ''I can grab a cab after work, take my kids down to the natural history museum and be home by dinner.''
 Across the street, the owner of the 1890's house at 33 West 128th, who declined to be identified, said she thinks the new buildings enhance the block, although she misses the berry bushes that grew on the vacant land they now occupy. She said she doesn't really notice going up and down her stoop, although ''it does give you exercise.'' 
 Across the street, a woman coming down the stoop at the new building at No. 28 West 128th said she also usually didn't notice the climb: ''If I had to take my laundry out, it would be a real problem, and with groceries it is a bother,'' she said, asking to be identified only as Pam. 
 She said that she and her sisters have the apartments on the upper floors of the new building. She wound up on the top floor and has to climb three flights, one flight up the stoop and two inside. ''After all,'' she said, ''I'm the youngest.''

HEADLINE: Setting a Sale Price in a Slow Market 

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
AS the busy spring shopping season gets under way, listings throughout Connecticut are cluttered with winter leftovers. The inventory of available houses is up almost everywhere, suggesting that sellers who want their properties to move quickly have to come to terms with a cooling market and falling consumer confidence. 
 Buyers are beginning to emerge in the usual numbers, but compared with the heady spring markets of recent years, they are fussier and less pressured to act quickly, said Mary Ellen Vicino, senior vice president for the Greater Hartford area offices of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.
Pricing a house realistically is crucial in this more-competitive market, especially for properties with obvious negatives. 
 ''You've got to be right on the button now with prices,'' said Rick Higgins, chairman and founder of the Higgins Group, a real estate brokerage based in Fairfield. ''People aren't going to overpay -- they're afraid to overpay. Before, people felt, 'Well, if we overpay, we'll be O.K. in six months.' They're used to 12, 15 percent gains. Now, it's 5 percent, 6 percent.'' 
 If buyers have the jitters, however, many sellers are still hoping to be the last on their street to sell at boom-market prices. Given the relentless competition, however, entering the market at too high a price may condemn a property to weeks, or even months, of market time, its value declining as buyer interest wanes.
 ''There's a backlog of people waiting to buy -- they're the experts, they've seen what's out there,'' Mr. Higgins said. ''Once they pass on a house, it's obviously not worth as much.'' 
 The inventory of available houses in Fairfield County is up roughly 30 percent over last year, he said, though the amounts vary markedly from town to town. For example, Darien's inventory is up about 40 percent over a year ago, while Ridgefield's is up just 8 percent.
 In some towns, the swollen inventory is partly explained by a glut of higher-end homes. In Westport, for example, 115 of the roughly 300 homes on the market earlier this month were in the $2-million-and-up range. 
 ''That's huge -- that's like a year's worth of inventory,'' said Darcy Sledge, an agent with the Westport office of Prudential Connecticut Realty. ''There's a lot of new construction sitting. Buyers in that range are being very choosy, and those houses not on an ideal site are sitting a little bit longer.'' 
 At the same time, sales have slowed considerably relative to last year, although many agents said properties have begun to move more briskly in the past few weeks.
 A sampling of town statistics compiled by Ms. Sledge showed that as of March 30, sales of single-family homes were down about 40 percent for the year in Easton and Weston, 15 percent in Norwalk, 10 percent in Westport and Wilton, and 7 percent in Fairfield. 
 The Greater Hartford Association of Realtors reported a 15 percent rise in inventory as of the end of February, with sales down about 17 percent for the year to date. New Haven County real estate agents are seeing similar numbers, according to Frank D'Ostilio, regional vice president for Coldwell Banker. 
 Prices are still up over last year, however, and multiple offers are common on well-sited houses in excellent condition.
 Such properties are moving ''just as fast and just as pricey as they have in the past,'' said Carole Cousins, an agent with Century 21 Landmark Properties in Ridgefield. Just recently, a ''bread-and-butter colonial'' -- Ms. Cousin's term for a traditional center-hall colonial -- in an established subdivision in Ridgefield sold for the asking price after multiple offers because, she said, ''the house was pristine.'' 
 ''The baths were done, the kitchen was renovated,'' she said. ''The house was immaculate.'' 
 Patty Hutchinson, an agent with Kelly Associates in Darien, tells a similar story about a fairly new colonial in ''perfect condition'' that listed at $3.5 million last month. The owners listed the house on a Thursday, received three offers during the weekend open house and sold it by Sunday.
 Several other Darien properties listed in the $3 million to $4 million range are languishing, she noted, because they are overpriced relative to the competition. 
 Robert Grant, an agent with the Higgins Group, has had to lower his expectations since putting his own home in Easton on the market a little more than a month ago. ''I thought I would hit the spring market hard and there would be tons of buyers out there,'' he said. After an initial flurry of calls, however, interest has tapered off to barely a phone call a week. 
 When Mr. Grant first listed his house -- a 4,000-square-foot colonial built in 1996 on three acres -- only two comparable properties were available in Easton. He set the price at $998,900. Since then, five more properties have been listed in that range, some of them larger or newer. Mr. Grant has lowered his price to $984,000, a level at which he believes there is a window in the market without competition. 
 Listing a house at the high end of its price range is not necessarily the way to go right now, agents said, especially if the house does not show as well as others in the same range. 
 Ms. Cousins recommends pricing a house at the point where it becomes the best house on the market at that price.
 Sellers are often blind to their own house's shortcomings, however, as was the case with the couple who recently asked Ms. Cousins to perform a market analysis of their home in Brookfield. 
 As Ms. Cousins pulled in, she noted that the house was built down low at the base of a steep driveway. High-tension wires loomed behind the property. 
 ''Inside, they had totally redone the kitchen, and they were very proud of that,'' Ms. Cousins said. But in the living room, the view of the backyard was dominated by railroad tracks at the back of the property. 
 When she later presented her analysis to the owners, she suggested that the house ought to be priced lower than other homes with the same number of bedrooms and square footage to make up for the low site, wires and railroad tracks. The owners ultimately rejected her analysis in favor of the higher price recommended by another agent. 
 ''If that house sits on the market for a year, people will say, 'Oh, it's a bad market,''' Ms. Cousins said. ''But no, the real problem is bad pricing.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Auctions: Bidder Beware

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
A WOMAN bought a house with a swimming pool in the village of Southampton for $151,000. The transaction, which occurred after a foreclosure auction 10 years ago, took about five minutes. Today, she estimates her Hamptons summer home is worth $1.6 million. 
 In 1997, a man bought a 157-unit apartment building in Brooklyn at auction for $2.4 million. He has since been offered $25 million for it, but he thinks it is worth even more.
It is one of 10 buildings he has bought at foreclosure auctions in the last 15 years. 
 Buying real estate at foreclosure auctions is an alluring idea, particularly in New York where nearly everyone is scrambling for a deal. Nationwide interest has spawned an industry of foreclosure mavens as well as countless Web sites, infomercials, how-to books and seminars. 
 Foreclosure auctions, which occur after a lender or government agency forecloses on a parcel, building or apartment, are a judicial process in New York, meaning that they are run by the court system.
 Such auctions may have piqued the interest of novice investors anticipating a rise in interest rates and the inability of some owners to meet their financial obligations. 
 Yet while there is a tantalizing possibility of getting a deal, people who are intimately familiar with foreclosure auctions in New York -- lawyers, mortgage bankers, brokers and former auction regulars -- advise steering clear of them.
 Success is not impossible, but to even set foot in the ring you must put in hours of due diligence and overcome myriad obstacles, including competing against auctiongoers who have mastered the art of the bid.
 ''You really have sharks at these sales,'' said Bruce Bronster, a partner in the Manhattan office of Dreier L.L.P. -- his litigation group has handled more than 3,000 foreclosures. ''You're a guppy. And you're going up against very seasoned and sophisticated guys.'' 
 Auction regulars tend to be investors who pool their money and have ties to the construction business. They know the market, they do their research, and they have the capital and the ability to renovate properties sold ''as is.''
 That is a significant advantage because foreclosed properties are frequently in disrepair and the interiors can rarely be inspected before bidding. There may be lead paint, asbestos and bug or rodent infestations. Even worse, there can be title disputes.
 Some auctions become so frenzied that prices are driven above market value. Others are simply canceled.
 Winning can mean inheriting environmental liabilities and squatters. You will also have to pay 10 percent of the purchase price on the spot (with a certified check or cash) and the balance usually within 30 days, so you must secure financing in advance or you could lose your down payment. 
 ''You don't know exactly what you're getting,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''That's the biggest risk.''
 For example, one of Ms. Cohn's clients bought a property at auction only to discover later that the owner had removed everything, from the doorknobs to the garage doors to the appliances. 
 Or consider the predicament of a man who Mr. Bronster said spent thousands of dollars to get out of a sale after buying his daughter a property that was advertised as a dwelling unit but turned out to be a basement space with no windows, kitchen or bathroom. 
 Then there was the investor who bought a condo at auction that he thought was one apartment but was actually two joined together. ''They had only bought half the space,'' said Marc Broxmeyer, a founder of Bellmarc Realty. The investor was shrewd and threatened to tie up the deal in litigation, so he eventually got the full space. (He had to pay for it, of course.) 
 ''It just goes to show you the craziness that can happen,'' Mr. Broxmeyer said. 
 Yet despite the pitfalls of foreclosure auctions, people do make money from them. 
 When a house Dorothy Somekh liked in Southampton turned out to be in contract, the broker told her about a foreclosed property that was up for auction by sealed bid. Ms. Somekh put in a bid without viewing the property because she was working and could not drive out to Long Island to see it.
 The next day she went out and fell in love with the house (even though it was boarded up) and asked her broker to tell the owner that she would make a higher offer than the winning bid. But her broker told her it was too late -- someone else had outbid her. 
 Ms. Somekh, a broker herself for Halstead Property, insisted. She offered $151,000 -- and, in a rare turn of events, got the house. Since then she has spent $150,000 to $200,000 renovating the property and thinks it could sell today for $1.6 million. 
 ''It was a really good deal,'' Ms. Somekh said. ''That's why you always have to take a chance. Don't take no for an answer.'' 
 Like Ms. Somekh, many people attempt to play by their own rules. Some try to buy not only at auction but also during the pre-foreclosure period, before a property goes to auction, by calling the owner directly.
 Isaac Hager, a developer, has bought several buildings at foreclosure auctions. He has his own renovation and construction teams and does so much research that he has managed to buy mortgages from banks before properties went to auction. 
 ''It's not easy at all,'' Mr. Hager said. 
 But the fact that some people have benefited from buying foreclosures is enough to inspire others to make a beeline for the county courthouse. 
 Marc Lawrence, a broker at the Corcoran Group, has run title searches and tipped doormen to find out about properties he is interested in. It is time-consuming, and he has yet to purchase anything. A few months ago, he bid on a property but it went above the price he and his fellow investors thought it was worth. Still, he perseveres. 
 ''In the competitive New York City marketplace, anytime you think you can get a bargain, you're going to grab it,'' he said. ''Or you're going to try.''
 Susan M. Darrow, a broker at Bellmarc, has been attending auctions in New York for two decades but has never bought anything because prices frequently rise above what she considers to be market value. About a month ago, a client of hers was interested in buying an apartment in a building in the East 60's, and one came up for auction. But it went for more than another apartment in the building that was already on the market for about $500,000. 
 ''It went for about $70,000 more than the one on the market,'' Ms. Darrow said, ''but the condition was really not good.'' 
 Before any foreclosure auction in New York, the terms of sale and the address of the property must be published once a week for four weeks in local periodicals, according to Jon B. Felice, the owner of Jon B. Felice & Associates P.C., a real estate law firm in Manhattan. So while you cannot usually get inside, you can get the address and view the exterior. There are also Web sites that publish foreclosure auction information for all five boroughs for a fee: PropertyShark.com ($129.95 a year), for example, and NYForeclosures.com ($999 a year). Both also offer helpful free tips to nonsubscribers. 
 Auctions generally take place at New York City's county courthouses. Some 70 percent of the city's foreclosure auctions occur in Brooklyn and Queens, according to PropertyShark. So if you have your heart set on buying in Manhattan, you will have even less to choose from. 
 Likewise if you want a co-op. While co-ops can be auctioned, they do not go through the courts because they are not considered ''real property'' (you own shares in the apartment corporation, not the unit itself). 
 Some experts recommend bringing certified checks in various amounts ($10,000, $5,000, $1,000) to meet the 10 percent down payment because you do not know exactly how much you will end up paying. Others prefer to bring one certified check -- at an amount they have decided on well before the auction -- because it prevents them from overbidding. 
 But all agree that due diligence is essential, though Mr. Bronster, the lawyer, pointed out that the condition of a property can change between the time you buy it and the time you close, especially if there is a disgruntled owner who destroys the place.
 It is also important to do a financial projection to make sure that the discount you are getting by buying at auction is substantial enough to make the risk worthwhile. 
 ''You have to know what liens are on the property so you know how much you're going to have to spend,'' Mr. Felice said. ''My gut tells me that you're buying at a discount in most instances of 30 to 40 percent.'' 
 That is enough to keep some investors coming back. The advantage for those who want to buy a home instead of an investment property, though, is that if you are satisfied with buying at only 10 percent below the market rate, you may be in luck because investors are looking for bigger returns, Ryan Slack, the chief executive of PropertyShark, said in an e-mail message. 
 Still, many foreclosures end up being bought at auction by the bank that holds the mortgage. These properties are known as real-estate-owned, and banks put them on the market for more than they paid at auction. 
 Jessica Davis, president of Profiles Publications, which owns NYForeclosures.com, recommends that amateurs observe at least three auctions before bidding. ''There is no reason anyone should have an unhappy auction story if they have done their homework,'' she said. 
 But plenty of people do their homework and are stymied nonetheless. 
 In 2004, a year after leaving her Wall Street job, Julia Hoagland decided to make her living by investing in real estate, some of which she wanted to buy at foreclosure auctions. She attended auctions in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, and read through property files in the cramped basements of courthouses. 
 Still, she watched shells of apartments in Harlem go for $900,000, places that would require many thousands more to renovate. In another instance, the owner of an apartment in Brooklyn refused to let her in with an inspector and an electrician -- even though a day earlier his wife said they would be welcome. 
 ''Needless to say, I decided being a landlord isn't for me,'' said Ms. Hoagland, who became a broker with the Corcoran Group instead. ''You basically have to close your eyes and jump off and hope there's water in the pool.''

Two Words To the Wise: Due Diligence
 EXPERTS in foreclosure auctions suggest that prospective bidders do their homework before participating in their first auction.
 Pay to have a title report run on the property to learn about its history and about any outstanding liens. 
 Visit the property, and glean information from neighbors, doormen and the owner, if possible. 
 Go to the county clerk's office, and check any claims involving the property. 
 Call the foreclosing lawyers, who must adhere to confidentiality rules but may be able to tell you if a property will actually be auctioned off or if the owner has suddenly filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: There Is No Wrong Side of the Tracks

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
THE seemingly jet-fueled pace at which homes have sold and values have appreciated has slowed, market experts say. But there has been no easing off in demand for housing with good access to mass transit, they add.
 Statewide, buying activity is running 14 percent behind last year, while the inventory of unsold homes on the market is 61 percent higher than a year ago, according to a market report recently issued to brokers.
In Randolph, Morris County, according to the report from the Otteau Appraisal Group, based in East Brunswick, the market cooled to the point where a six-month supply of available houses has built up. Randolph is an attractive and well-to-do community, noted Jeffrey Otteau, president of the company that analyzes market statistics for brokers, but it lacks a train station. 
 Meanwhile, in towns with direct train service to Manhattan like Montclair, Summit and Westfield, the inventory of homes on the market remains tight. Montclair has a two-month supply or less, according to the report. That level is the same as was reported two years ago.
 Anecdotal evidence from brokers also indicates that housing near train stations in redeveloped urban centers is among the hottest type of property available right now. That would include developments at sites designated under the New Jersey Transit Village initiative -- downtown South Orange, for example -- and others where developers are simply offering proximity to mass transit as an amenity. Hoboken is a prime instance of the latter. 
 ''People want that short commute,'' said Ronnie Laiken, president and chief operating officer of Coldwell Banker in New Jersey and Rockland County, N.Y. ''It's a point of value,'' she said, ''highly desired by many, many people.
 ''So many families have both spouses working,'' she continued, ''and they want to cut down on their time away from home, getting to and from work. A lot of the buildings in Jersey City, Weehawken, the Union area, people are looking at the homes, and saying 'Wow! This is really close to the train!' -- and places are selling out right away.''
 The average commute in the state is 30 minutes long, according to New Jersey Future, an environmental group that keeps a watch on congestion and auto pollution. That is longer than in every state but New York and Maryland.
 Commuter frustrations have fueled a turnaround in public attitudes, Mr. Otteau said. Living near a train station, which used to be considered a drawback, is now considered a very attractive feature. 
 Over the past five years, the state has established 16 sites within a mile radius of local train stations as Transit Villages in connection with its ''smart growth'' initiative. The most recent announcement added Jersey City and New Brunswick to the program.
 Aimed at helping to curb sprawl, and at encouraging growth in core cities where infrastructure already exists, the Transit Village program provides grants and planning assistance to projects that show promise of creating walkable self-contained neighborhoods.
 The projects are required to be ''pedestrian friendly'' and to employ features like extra-wide sidewalks, off-street parking and small ''pocket'' parks to foster foot traffic, according to the state's guidelines. 
 Brokers and sales agents say that condominiums situated where people can walk from home to shops and the train -- including those in the Transit Village in downtown Morristown, now under construction, and on Hoboken's west side in the vicinity of the light rail station -- are extremely popular, with people putting their names on waiting lists to buy and paying the asking price without the kind of haggling that has resurfaced recently in suburban negotiations.
 Developers leapt on the trend early, and transit-oriented development continues to proliferate all over the state.
 Right now, opposite the station at Pine and Bay Streets in Montclair, which has eight train stations, a developer, the Lincoln Property Company, is proposing to build a 165-unit building with two courtyards, a swimming pool, a day-care center, covered parking and a commuter waiting area.
 The Montclair project was designed by DMR Architects of Hasbrouck Heights, which also recently worked on plans for the ambitious redevelopment of a 31-acre former airplane factory site in Wood-Ridge into a new neighborhood centered around a new train station.
 In New Brunswick, the developer Edgewood Properties recently began construction of Fulton Square, a gated community of 209 town homes and single-floor apartments on a 13-acre site about a mile from the downtown train station. A ''trolley jitney'' will transport commuters back and forth from the station, which offers both Amtrak service and New Jersey Transit service to Newark with PATH train connections to Manhattan. The plan is that the trolley would ultimately be run by the homeowners association.
 ''We're attracting a lot of commuters who work in the city,'' said a sales representative, Madeleine Jabloner. ''They want to take advantage of the trolley. They know what a headache it is to park.'' She said Fulton Square units are nearly half sold, although construction just began last month, and the first homes will not be available until late fall.
 The same developer is working on a new town center development with 265 housing units that will go up next to the train station in Somerville, and it is a partner on a condominium development in Cherry Hill that will offer trolley service to the local station.
 In addition, Edgewood is pursuing a plan to develop a Transit Village in Piscataway, where the company is based.
 Jack Morris, president of Edgewood, said he has become a big believer in such projects. ''If a project is planned with 700 residents, and 50 percent of them use mass transit, that's 350 cars off the road,'' he said. ''That improves traffic congestion and air quality. It contributes to the quality of life.''
 A nonprofit developer, Hands Inc., based in Orange, is at work on revitalizing the area around the Highland Avenue train station on Orange's border with West Orange into an arts district.
 Hundreds of condos are under construction in former hat factory buildings near the station, and Hands recently introduced a plan to develop arts studio space, shopping and artists' live-work space in what is known as the Valley neighborhood around the station.

A Somber Account of Iraq
An internal staff report by the American Embassy and military command in Baghdad provides a sobering snapshot of Iraq's political, economic and security situation, rating the overall stability of 6 provinces ''serious'' and one ''critical,'' a counterpoint to some recent upbeat statements by American officials. 1

A car bomb tore through a street crowded with pedestrians and vendors in the predominantly Shiite town of Musayyib, killing at least 6 people, wounding 21. 14 


Palestinian Leader Is Defiant
The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, called a cutoff in foreign aid ''blackmail'' and said that his government would not bow to international pressure and recognize Israel. Both the United States and the European Union announced they were suspending all financial aid to the new Hamas-led government. 11

Nepali Protester Killed
The Royal Nepalese Army shot dead a pro-democracy protester and injured another in the Himalayan resort town of Pokhara, as thousands of Nepalis poured out into the streets defying a curfew and ban on political rallies. By the end of the day more than 500 people had been detained, according to monitors. 12

The Roots of French Ire
The protests in France over a new youth labor law reflect that while most of the world struggles to cope with the realities of an increasingly global economy, much of Europe, and France in particular, remains devoted to a quasi-socialist ideal. 10

China Welcomes Rolling Stones
After nearly 30 years of trying, the Rolling Stones finally played a concert in China. The concert, a late addition to the band's Biggest Bang world tour, was the product of lengthy negotiations and numerous compromises ranging from the choice of venue to the songs allowed by Chinese censors. 12

SCIENCE/HEALTH

A Disease's Hidden Agony
Lymphatic filariasis, a disease in which clusters of parasitic worms nest in the lymph nodes and cause fluid buildup in the limbs, is one of a handful of diseases world health experts hope to eliminate within a generation. But the task is daunting because of the stigma of the affliction. 1

NATIONAL 25-35

Iraq Intelligence Was Disputed
When President Bush authorized Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide to reveal previously classified intelligence about Saddam Hussein's efforts to obtain uranium, as the aide has testified, the same intelligence was already widely discredited, interviews show. 1

Lobby Inquiry Broadens
A consulting company is under scrutiny by the Justice Department and Congressional investigators because its founder is the brother of Jack Abramoff, the former Republican lobbyist at the center of a Washington influence-peddling scandal involving several members of Congress. To a surprising degree, the spouses and other family members of the investigation's central targets are being dragged into the inquiry. 26

Energy Policy Rift Widens
A Bush administration proposal to open an energy-rich tract of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling has touched off a tough fight in Congress, the latest demonstration of the political barriers to providing new energy supplies even at a time of high demand and record prices. 25

McCain Woos Larger Base
Senator John McCain began a campaign-style trip seeking to appeal to a diverse audience and cement his early standing in the emerging Republican presidential field. 33

NEW YORK/REGION 37-41

Municipal Workers Priced Out
High-priced communities are trying to take measures to shore up municipal workforces that can no longer afford to live within their borders, particularly when it comes to public and volunteer jobs like firefighting for which proximity matters. 37

Columnist's Claims on Tape
A heavily edited version of a secretly recorded video shows several minutes of meetings between Jared Paul Stern, a contributor to The New York Post's Page Six gossip column, and Ronald W. Burkle, a California billionaire who claims he was being extorted by Mr. Stern, as Mr. Stern gives Mr. Burkle an awkward primer on how to manage the gossip column that has bedeviled him. 40

HEADLINE: To Dig and Plant, but Not in a Hurry

BYLINE: By BRENDAN I. KOERNER

 BODY:
AGRICULTURE is an increasingly dicey career choice for the Amish of northeastern Ohio. ''You can't make a living on the farming anymore,'' said Eli Miller, an Amish resident of Kidron, Ohio. ''There's more money in the furniture shops.''
 There's also more money in Mr. Miller's chosen profession, assembling nonelectric gadgets for Lehman's, a company in Kidron that calls itself ''the world's largest purveyor of historical technology.'' 
Among Mr. Miller's contributions to Lehman's extensive catalog, few are more popular than the Old-Fashioned Corn Planter, a favorite among consumers who romanticize Amish simplicity.
 The corn planter resembles a divining rod, except that there is a metal box, called the hopper, bolted to one prong. A user presses the planter's trowel-like tip into the soil, then squeezes the handles together. This action forces back a slide mechanism at the base of the hopper, uncovering a small hole; at this point, gravity takes over, and a few seeds (which don't have to be corn) plop to earth. 
 Emptying the hopper of its one-and-a-half-pound payload is laborious and time-consuming -- but, of course, the minimalism is exactly the point. 
 Lehman's has offered the corn planters ''on and off as long as I remember,'' said Galen Lehman, the company's president; its catalog also includes products like kerosene-powered refrigerators and one-legged milking stools. Until six years ago, the corn planters were made by a local artisan who, like Mr. Miller, had realized that the community's economic future lay in crafts, not cream. When he retired, however, his son did the math and concluded that the profit margin on the corn planter was too measly to justify continued production.
 Rather than drop the corn planter from Lehman's lineup, Mr. Lehman asked Mr. Miller, the head of the company's shop, to take over the product's assembly. Mr. Miller learned from the retiring artisan the secrets of corn-planter construction, like how to rivet the steel spade onto the bottom. 
 A few changes were also made to the original design, to maximize the product's rustic charm -- the prongs, for example, are now painted ''gardener green'' instead of bright orange.
 ''I usually build 50 at a time,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I'd basically say, with waiting for the paint to dry and everything, it's two and a half days at least before I can get them in boxes ready to ship.'' He doesn't test every planter, though he will select a few at random and check to make sure the hopper's slide pulls back in a fluid motion.
 Mr. Lehman said he had no concern that he would be ''slaughtered by Wal-Mart'' in the manual corn-planter market, contending that the relatively low demand was unlikely to spur the retailing Goliath to offer a version. He estimated that his company last year sold about 200 of the planters, priced at $49.95, exclusively through its Web site (lehmans.com), catalog and store in Kidron. 
 That sales figure qualifies the product as a solid performer by Lehman's standards. Mr. Lehman says the planter has found favor among gardeners who idealize the Amish, and among elderly people who can no longer bend down to sow seeds. The planter has not, however, sold well among the dwindling population of Amish farmers.
 ''A farmer,'' Mr. Lehman said, ''is going to have a horse-drawn implement.'' Far more popular among this demographic are products like Lehman's kerosene-powered egg incubator. 
 No matter how much they admire Amish ways, consumers from the world of television and automobiles are unlikely to start raising their own chickens.

HEADLINE: First, Tame That Envy. Then Give Thanks.

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I RECENTLY received an e-mail message from someone who has been a close friend for almost 45 years. He works selling exotic cars to very wealthy people in a large Northeastern city. He told me that he feels a certain envy toward his clients, many of whom are billionaires. 
 ''I don't really begrudge the guys who made it themselves,'' he said, ''but I go crazy about the ones who just inherited it, who were from the lucky sperm club.''
It set my little brain racing. In today's America, so many stories are about fantastically rich young men and women, or even middle-aged men and women, who put on their pants one leg at a time just like me, but who are rich enough to own a professional sports team. And then there are those who dropped out of college but now own hotels and casinos and private jets. It's enough to make you wonder what went so wrong in your own life that you have to worry about your MasterCard bill. 
 Now, I can and will offer investment counsel and complaints about executive behavior for a good long time. But I think I can offer the greatest possible value to readers right now by saying a few words about envy and how to get past it and move on to success.
 Years ago, I went to a 12-step program on Point Dume, a lovely area in Malibu, Calif. At the time, I was making a modest living and was petrified about money many nights. I would walk my magnificent German short-haired pointer, Trixie, near the homes of fabulously wealthy stars and moguls and then return to my shabby rented cottage. 
 At the meeting, I complained about the maddening truth that so many people near me on Point Dume had so much more money than I did, and a smart woman named Jennie said: ''Instead of thinking about what you don't have, think about what you have. You have the handsomest son on the planet. You have the perfect dog. Concentrate on those. When you are tempted to feel envy, remember that envy is as bad as strychnine for you. Make a list of what you do have that is good in your life, and then the envy will lift.''
 I have been doing that for about 18 years now, and it has worked well. So to stave off envy as I read about three young financial whizzes who control a professional sports team, I made a list of what I have that I feel truly grateful for:
 My wife, the world's most kind-hearted and forgiving human, the absolute model of what a human being should be.
 Excellent health -- well beyond what I deserve, considering how unhealthy much of my life has been.
 The most varied and interesting career of anyone I know, that I would not trade for anyone else's career, not even George Clooney's or that of any billionaire hedge fund trader. (I loathe uncertainty.)
 Devoted friends, a wise and considerate sister and a stupendously capable agent.
 Devoted parents, now in eternity, who would do anything for me.
 Total strangers in our military who offer up their lives for me in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 These are all great parts of my life. But as the Bible says, ''A feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry, but money answereth all things.'' And it's true. I am happier if I have a few coins jingling in my pockets than when I don't. So I offered some thanks about money, too:
 For the people at Dimensional Funds Advisors in Santa Monica, Calif., who run the most amazingly successful, low-cost, unmanaged but somehow deep-value index funds I have ever found. They may yet save me from my spendthrift folly and give me security in my old age.
 For Phil DeMuth, my co-author and financial adviser, who put me into these funds. 
 For TIAA-CREF, the financial services group that sold my parents low-cost variable annuities that paid off like the Powerball grand prize for them and for my sister and me. 
 For my man at Merrill Lynch, Kevin Hanley, who takes it well when I call to yell at him for tiny mistakes and who put me into Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs, a large jewel in my portfolio. 
 For William Danoff, who guided my savings at the Contrafund at Fidelity Investments, and has surprised me for years with his prowess at making my money grow.
 For Warren Buffett, who did so well for me from about 1978 to about 1997, though his stock, Berkshire Hathaway, has basically treaded water ever since. (I am sure he'll someday give us back the $40 billion in cash that the company has accumulated over the years.) 
 For the family of Frank and Charles Hathaway, no relation at all to Berkshire Hathaway except in their investment genius and integrity, which has done so beautifully at managing Laaco Ltd., a microcap real estate, leisure and personal storage company that has redeemed some of the multitude of terrible investment decisions I have made. 
 For Peter Morton, one of the founders of the Hard Rock Cafe, who let me invest in that company long ago and allowed me to do well with them to the point of unbelievability.
 But above all, to the whole Wall Street, ''people's capitalism'' model. 
 Because we little people are allowed to invest in the nation's growth, we can become big people. We no longer have to save under a mattress or in a bank. We no longer have to manage our money actively by buying and running a farm or an apartment building. Instead, we can flick a few buttons on a computer or make a call, and all the resources of the nation's best and brightest are at our command to let us hitch our wagons to the capitalist star. 
 IN the last 70 years or so, for the first time in history, the little guy has been able to invest with some assurance that he is not being ripped off, that he is being told the full story and that if his investment does well, he will reap the rewards, or at least a lot of them. (Don't let the hedge-fund hoopla fool you. By and large, they are not outperforming funds open to the little guy at vastly lower cost.)
 Yes, there will be some rip-offs. There is too much money floating around and too much temptation for the system to be anything like tamperproof. But in general, that much-maligned Wall Street makes it possible for anyone with some savings, some sense and some discipline to have the engine of capitalism anywhere in the world roar for him like my Cadillac STS-V. Wall Street, for all its faults, makes it possible for any of us, like the fictional television character George Jefferson, to finally get a piece of the pie.
 Anyway, this was my gratitude list, or at least a small part of it. You can have a list, too, though yours may well be totally different from mine. Viewed this way, we're all in the lucky sperm club, and it's a great day. It may change tomorrow, but as someone a lot better looking than I am said in the best movie ever made, ''Tomorrow is another day.''

HEADLINE: A Portfolio Is True To Its Convictions

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
HOW much is the courage of one's convictions worth? In the case of the Gartmore International Growth fund, the answer seems to be about 15 percentage points.
 That's the amount by which the fund beat its peer group in the 12 months through March. Its total return of 41.44 percent placed it first among 585 diversified funds tracked by Morningstar that specialize in shares of large foreign companies; the average return in the group was 26.18 percent.
Gartmore International Growth has not always had remarkable returns. After its introduction in 2000, the fund fared a bit better than average one year, a bit worse the next. But almost two years ago, Gartmore, a British subsidiary of the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company in Columbus, Ohio, overhauled the fund. First the manager was replaced, then the philosophy.
 The biggest change was to drastically reduce the size of the portfolio to a handful of select stocks. If you ever wondered how the manager of a 400-stock fund decides to include stock No. 393, so did Brian O'Neill and Ben Walker, the team selected in the summer of 2004 to run the Gartmore fund. 
 Their strategy is to hold 50 to 60 stocks -- down from roughly 100 -- that fit a handful of investment themes distilled from their reading of economies, industries and markets.
 ''A lot of portfolios are too diversified,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''There is no conviction in them.''
 When funds have few holdings, however, some analysts warn investors to expect more volatility, since the performance of individual stocks has a greater impact on such portfolios. But the managers of the Gartmore fund say they are satisfied that the benefits of a concentrated portfolio outweigh the risks of increased volatility. 
 ''You're making life a lot easier for yourself once you start thinking with that mind-set,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''If you run a higher-conviction portfolio, you'll be rewarded.''
 The managers decided not to be slaves to a benchmark. Managers of many funds are forbidden from straying too far from the composition of the index against which their performance is measured. Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Walker, however, are encouraged to generate maximum absolute returns. 
 ''We've got risk parameters,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''We have to have a benchmark, but we don't pay much attention to it.'' The benchmark they all but ignore is the Morgan Stanley Capital International World ex-U.S. Index. 
 The fund's investment process sounds simple, the way Mr. O'Neill describes it. ''We search for ideas, then find the best place in the world, except the United States, to implement those ideas,'' he said.
 That is done by consulting Gartmore's analysts and fund managers who specialize in various countries and industries. ''We may start off with an idea in one country,'' he said, ''and by the time we discuss it we may decide we shouldn't be playing it there but we should be in another country.''
 For example, he said that he and his colleagues were especially interested in one idea: steel tubes. The oil industry consumes these voraciously, and with the world's appetite for oil so strong, the managers surmised that there was good money to be made in supplying the tubes.
 They found three companies in this niche worthy of consideration: Tenaris in Argentina, its French counterpart Vallourec and Sumitomo Metal in Japan.
 ''At any point we may be playing one or more of those stocks,'' Mr. O'Neill said. Right now, the fund owns Tenaris, which the managers decided was trading at the right price after a dip in valuations in emerging markets, but neither of the other two.
 But that could change at a moment's notice. One hallmark of the fund is its high turnover. According to Morningstar, the average turnover for funds of this type is 75 percent a year. At Gartmore, turnover is 250 percent a year. 
 There are no core holdings as such. Each stock in the portfolio has to earn its keep continually, and no weak performer is permitted to stay. ''If you're only running a 60-stock portfolio, the ideas that don't work have to be jettisoned quickly,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
 The fund's approach draws mixed opinions from analysts. Gregg Wolper, a senior fund analyst at Morningstar, admires the concentration in the portfolio and even invoked Mr. O'Neill's favorite expression.
 ''You like to see conviction in the managers,'' Mr. Wolper said. It is all for the better, he added, ''if they like stocks and are willing to take big positions.'' 
 ''You don't want it to be too risky, putting too much money in a few names,'' he said, but he pointed out that the Gartmore fund limits risk by owning stocks in fairly equal dollar amounts. No holding accounts for more than 3 percent of the fund's $21 million in assets and Mr. Wolper said that this showed that ''they're trying to limit the potential risk inherent in a more compact portfolio.''
 But Jeff Tjornehoj, a research analyst who follows international funds for Lipper, is not so sure that the risk is worth the ride. ''I would consider this to be a relatively volatile performer,'' he said.
 ''You really have to understand what kind of fund this is before you go chasing those returns,'' he warned. ''It's the kind of fund that can make you feel brilliant or regretful depending on when you get in.''
 He likened its performance to that of ''a basketball player who likes to take three-point shots.'' Yet he conceded that it is a player who is hitting a high percentage of those shots. Though the fund tends to have more risk, compared with others in its class, ''it tends also to pay off over the longer term,'' he said. 
 The analysts also differ in their view of the fund's costs. Mr. Wolper finds the annual expenses, at 1.65 percent of assets, ''not cheap, but not too high for such a small fund.'' The average for this type of fund is 1.59 percent, according to Morningstar. 
 For Mr. Tjornehoj, however, the expense level is ''a little steep'' And he is not thrilled about the 5.75 percent front-end load, or sales charge, either, and he questioned why an investor who chooses the fund for himself should have to pay it. 
 ''If you're paying a load, what you should be paying for is financial advice,'' he said. ''It should not be an admission ticket into a portfolio.'' 
 Those who buy the fund's shares will be investing in several companies that, like the fund itself not long ago, are undergoing an overhaul. These include Rolls-Royce, the British maker of jet engines; Commerzbank of Germany; and Hynix Semiconductor, a South Korean chip maker.
 Rolls-Royce ''over the last two years is suddenly getting its act together,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''It's making the money that G.E. has been making for the last 20 years,'' he added, comparing Rolls-Royce to one of its main rivals, General Electric. Commerzbank has similarly ''resuscitated itself'' and represents a bet on the German real estate market, he said.
 Mr. O'Neill described Hynix as ''a recovery stock that has been very kind to us.'' The company avoided bankruptcy four years ago after receiving cash infusions from government-owned companies. 
 Other holdings include Corus, a British-Dutch steelmaker; CSL, an Australian pharmaceutical company that produces a vaccine that may be used to combat avian flu; the German utility RWE; and the Japanese property developer Mitsui Fudosan.
 With so few holdings in a world of so many stocks, what is not in the fund counts for almost as much as what is, Mr. O'Neill said.
 ''There are awhole lot of things we don't want to own,'' he said. If consumers are not opening their wallets, for instance, the fund drops the stocks of companies that rely on consumer spending, despite the sheer size of that segment. 
 That way, not only do areas of interest receive focused attention, but no effort is wasted. ''If we're not interested, we forget it,'' Mr. O'Neill said.

HEADLINE: An Extraordinary Quarter, but Why?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
IN the first quarter of 2006, nearly every stock fund category worked out well for investors -- though nothing worked out quite the way the markets had expected.
 Small-company stocks, for instance, did not cede leadership to the blue chips, as many strategists had predicted. And speculation wasn't wrung out of the market. Instead, investors poured money into risky emerging-market stock funds, many of which had double-digit gains in the quarter.
Still, most investors weren't complaining. How could they? The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 4.2 percent in the quarter, nearly matching its total return for all of 2005. Not only was this the best first quarter for domestic equities since 1999, but it also showed the growing ranks of skeptics that this aging bull can still run. 
 The average general domestic equity fund returned 6.2 percent in the quarter, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund tracker. If you count all domestic stock portfolios, including sector funds, the average was 6.4 percent. That compares with a 2.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
 ''Funny, there was all this talk about being in a period of generally low returns,'' said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash. ''In reality, this was about as good as it's going to get.''
 Actually, it was even better for foreign stock portfolios, which soared 10.3 percent, on average, in the quarter, thanks to another huge rally in emerging-market stocks. The average diversified emerging-market fund rose 12.3 percent, while the average Latin American fund soared 17.4 percent. Over the last 12 months, Latin American portfolios climbed by a staggering 77.5 percent.
 Not everyone profited in the quarter. Those who bet on a drop in stock prices, for instance, by investing in so-called bear-market funds, saw them fall 1.8 percent in value, on average. 
 To be sure, this was a tiny group. But many bond fund investors were also disappointed, as long-term interest rates finally began to tick up on inflation fears.
 As the yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to 4.85 percent on March 31, from 4.39 percent at the start of the quarter, the value of older bonds in fixed-income portfolios fell. That led to average losses of 3.5 percent in long-term government bond funds. Intermediate-term government bond funds also fell, by 0.6 percent, as did inflation-protected bond funds, down 2.2 percent.
 Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar, said, ''The rise in the long end of the curve presents bond investors with a difficult choice'' for the remainder of the year. 
 If long-term bond yields are rising because of real concerns about the health of the economy, it could mean that now is a decent time to lock in rates by sticking with long-term Treasuries, he said.
 On the other hand, if the economy is just fine, it makes no sense to invest in long-term bonds when shorter-term debt is paying roughly the same yield.
 Of course, predicting the direction of interest rates is a futile endeavor -- much like forecasting short-term moves in the stock market. Heading into the year, many strategists -- in fact, a vast majority -- predicted that shares of large, blue-chip companies would at long last outperform small-company stocks. 
 After more than five years of leading the market, small stocks slowed down a bit last year. The S.& P. 500 actually beat the Russell 2000 index of small shares by a hair in 2005: 4.9 percent versus 4.6 percent. 
 But in the first quarter of this year, small-cap funds regained their momentum and went on a tear. The average value-oriented small-company stock fund posted a gain of 10.9 percent, while the average small-cap growth fund jumped 12.7 percent. By comparison, the average large-cap growth fund gained only 3.8 percent.
 A recent survey of investment managers by the Russell Investment Group found that most were again forecasting a large-cap rally. In fact, 70 percent of those surveyed said they were bullish on large-cap growth stocks, while only 9 percent said they were bearish on them. ''I don't know how long I'll have to say this,'' Mr. Ankrim said, ''but large caps look attractive relative to small caps, even though small caps keep winning.'' 
 There are a couple of possible explanations for the resilience of small stocks. For starters, corporate earnings have continued to grow faster than expected, and small-company earnings have been growing faster lately than large-cap profits.
 Moreover, in January, there was a growing sense in the market that the Federal Reserve might be done or almost done raising short-term interest rates -- a climb that began in June 2004.
 Because conventional wisdom says stocks should do well once the Fed stops raising rates, equities -- especially speculative ones -- took off. This would explain the 9 percent jump in the Russell 2000 in the first month of the year.
 Of course, conventional wisdom has changed somewhat, and many on Wall Street now think that the Fed, under its new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, may raise rates at least two more times. Two quarter-point increases would mean that the federal funds rate, which the Fed raised to 4.75 percent in March, would be at 5.25 percent by the summer. If the Fed goes further than that, ''the market will probably throw up on itself,'' said Jonathan Golub, a domestic equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.
 MARKET strategists are already a bit concerned about the sustainability of the first-quarter gains, partly because the nation has entered the second quarter of the second year of President Bush's term. Historically, the second and third quarters of Year 2 of a presidential term are the worst periods for stock market performance.
 According to Standard & Poor's, the S.& P. 500 has registered losses of 2 percent, on average, in second quarters of second years of presidential terms, going back to 1945. Third quarters are slightly worse, with average losses of 2.2 percent.
 A number of market watchers are predicting a slowdown -- if not a correction -- in the coming months this year. ''It's been four years since we've had a 10 percent correction in stock prices,'' said Robert Doll, president and chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers. ''The market is looking tired.'' 
 Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, agreed that ''we're overdue for a more-than-typical correction.'' She added that if the market ''is going to break out of its trading range, it's more likely to break out on the downside than on the upside.''
 That is why Ms. Sonders still prefers the foreign markets to domestic stocks, as do many of her peers. She currently recommends that investors' portfolios be overweight in foreign shares, particularly emerging-market stocks. She suggests that investors play it simple by sticking with diversified emerging-market stock funds rather than individual securities.
 Yet the flood of money that has already poured into emerging-market funds this year is beginning to worry some people. 
 This year through April 5, emerging-market stock mutual funds pulled in around $9.7 billion in net new money. That is a greater sum than these portfolios attracted in all of 2003, 2004 and 2005 combined. 
 ''This is a worrisome sign to us,'' said Kevin M. Cronin, head of investments at Putnam Investments in Boston. 
 Because much of this could be considered speculative money, investors could rush out of these funds the minute their performance retreats. 
 At the very least, the trendiness of the funds is likely to add a component of uncertainty and volatility to the market, which is already confused about the direction of interest rates, oil prices and inflation.
 ''If you put a gun to my head, I'd say we still could be headed for a year of high single-digit or low double-digit returns,'' Ms. Sonders said. ''But the path between now and then isn't going to be smooth.''

HEADLINE: Here's a New Idea: A Fund Cuts Its Fees

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
INVESTORS in the Clipper Fund got a rare treat this year. A new management team took charge of the fund on Jan. 1, after promising to do something that is rather uncommon: to cut the fund's management fee.
 The managers, Christopher C. Davis and Kenneth C. Feinberg, have worked together since 1998 on two other funds -- the Selected American Shares fund and Davis New York Venture fund. Both of those funds are managed by Davis Advisors, an investment firm that was founded by Mr. Davis's father in 1969 and is based in Tucson, Ariz. The firm is known for its activist bent, and for keeping a lid on fund ownership costs to its investors. At Clipper, it has cut the fund's old 1 percent fee by more than 40 percent.
As soon as Davis Advisors took over Clipper, the firm's employees, directors and the Davis family immediately moved $50 million of their own money into the fund. This is a tradition at Davis, where they already had $2 billion of their personal money invested in the funds under their watch.
 ''Being large investors in the funds we manage orients us to think about stewardship rather than salesmanship,'' Mr. Davis said. Besides keeping fees low, he said, they consider the tax consequences and turnover costs of every trade. 
 This penny-pinching instinct is a chief reason that Morningstar named Mr. Davis and Mr. Feinberg as domestic stock fund managers of the year in 2005. (Mr. Davis's father, Shelby M. C. Davis, who is semiretired and serves as a senior investment adviser to the firm, won the award in 1996.)
 Morningstar also praised the performance of the two funds that Christopher Davis and Mr. Feinberg already managed: They handily beat the market over the last five years, despite swimming against some powerful tides. The managers favored large and megacap stocks, at a time when small and midcap stocks were in vogue. And they left a hefty dose of financial stocks in both funds, despite a common belief that such shares do not perform well during a period of rising interest rates. 
 Their investing style has minimized portfolio turnover, which can add costs for investors in the form of transaction fees and tax inefficiency; turnover at Selected American Shares and Davis New York Venture has been only in the single digits recently. Even when market volatility was much higher earlier in this decade, the turnover rate was 15 to 20 percent a year. That is relatively low for domestic stock funds, many of which have a turnover rate of 100 percent or more.
 ''We tend to buy things if we think they have a good outlook for the next five years,'' Mr. Davis said.
 This long-term horizon gives them more incentive to take a hard look at a company's corporate governance, Mr. Davis said. Davis Advisors has two research analysts whose primary responsibility is to help the firm decide on its proxy votes. 
 Even before they invest in a new stock, the team will ask the company's management to explain the minimum results below which bonus compensation for performance will not be paid to executives. The bar might be different for different industries, Mr. Davis said, but they very often find that there is no minimum requirement at all. In that case, they may still invest in a company, but Mr. Davis said they would first look at it more carefully. 
 ''There's no problem with pay for performance; what we hate is payment for mediocrity,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Usually the problem with payment isn't in the top-performing companies, the best 5 percent. The real crisis is at the 50th to the 75th percentile.''
 The two managers are also skeptical of huge stock option grants that executives receive after a stock has fallen. Mr. Feinberg cited the example of a company whose stock declines to $10 from $20 and then climbs back to $20. ''The shareholder has gotten zero return,'' Mr. Feinberg said, ''but the managers might have made tens of millions each on stock options.'' Mr. Feinberg and Mr. Davis analyze the timing of past option grants to ferret out whether management has a history of taking advantage of shareholders.
 The team's approach has paid off for shareholders in recent years. During the five years through March 31, Selected American Shares had an average annual return of 6.2 percent, compared with 6.8 percent for Davis New York Venture. During the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 4 percent a year, on average.
 The managers weren't chasing fads. They owned shares of Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase in both funds when many investors worried that those two financial behemoths would be hurt by rising interest rates. Mr. Feinberg said he saw opportunity for James Dimon, J. P. Morgan's new chief executive, to improve the bank's return on equity by cutting costs and redeploying capital. J. P. Morgan has a return on equity of around 10 percent, much lower than the 19 percent at Citigroup, he said.
 ''J. P. Morgan doesn't have to get to 19 percent,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''If they get to 15 percent that should help the stock.'' 
 Although both Citigroup and J. P. Morgan are large diversified financial services companies, Mr. Davis and Mr. Feinberg said they also saw some great values in midsize businesses in the sector. ''Financials are lobbed into a single category,'' Mr. Davis said. ''But it's absurd to lump a California savings and loan with a global insurance company and a Midwest auto finance company.''
 For instance, they both say they like Golden West Financial, which is based in Oakland, Calif., and is the holding company for World Savings Bank, a large savings and loan. Golden West specializes in adjustable-rate mortgages. Although the company has been public for 37 years, it is still run by the same husband-and-wife team, Herbert and Marion Sandler.
 ''They're best in class for a whole host of reasons,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''They watch every penny, because they know they're in a commodity business.'' He also said that Golden West used only its own appraisers, and that it kept loans on its own books, rather than selling them to larger financial institutions, which is a common practice in the mortgage industry.
 But by and large, the two managers have turned to the large-stock universe for their portfolios in recent years, because they say that's where they have often found the best bargains. For instance, they added Wal-Mart and increased their position in Microsoft in both funds last year.
 MR. DAVIS said he thought that large stocks were ripe for a comeback, because they underperformed the market for the last six years. He said that five years ago, the top 50 companies in the S.& P. 500, in terms of market capitalization, traded at a 168 percent premium to the next 450 companies, but that today the top 50 companies trade at a 5 percent discount to the rest of the index. 
 ''Of course, they aren't the same 50 companies,'' he said, adding that part of the reason the premium was so high five years ago was that some Internet companies were grossly overvalued. He said he still thought that leading global companies warranted a premium, rather than a slight discount, to second-tier companies.
 ''It's a matter of which pond you want to fish in,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The small to midcap stocks have had a great five years, so after that, I want to fish in another pond.''

HEADLINE: For a Few Tech Stars, Time for a Second Act

BYLINE: By JAMES PETHOKOUKIS

 BODY:
DURING the late 1990's technology bubble, plenty of mutual fund managers put up monster numbers, but those of Ryan Jacob, Malcolm R. Fobes III and Robert Zuccaro were amazing even by the stratospheric standards of the time. 
 Their funds gained more than 100 percent in both 1998 and 1999, according to Morningstar Inc.; they were the only actively managed domestic funds in that wild era to accomplish this back-to-back feat.
Their individual returns were staggering. The Kinetics Internet fund, managed by Mr. Jacob, gained 196 percent in 1998 and 216 percent in 1999. Berkshire Focus, run by Mr. Fobes, gained 104 percent and 143 percent. And Grand Prix A, managed by Mr. Zuccaro, was up 112 percent and 148 percent.
 When the bubble burst, the funds flamed out. ''Despite those amazing returns, by and large all those funds really did was lose money for a lot of people,'' Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's director of mutual fund research, said. ''One of the main points of owning a mutual fund is to be able to access high-quality professional management. But you are throwing that away when you buy funds like these with some manager who just happened to get lucky.'' 
 Were they just lucky, though? Seven years later -- with the stock market having rebounded -- how are those once-highflying managers faring? 
 Of the three, Mr. Jacob, 36, has come closest to proving that he wasn't a one-note tech fan, capable of high performance figures only during the greatest tech bull market ever. Or, as Mr. Kinnel put it, ''a manager with an ability to suspend disbelief in those Internet stocks more than anyone else.'' 
 Halfway though 1999, Mr. Jacob left Kinetics Internet to start the Jacob Internet fund. That fund began operations in 2000, and during each of its first five quarters lost anywhere from 7 percent to 55 percent. Over all, in that period, the fund fell 96 percent from its peak. But Mr. Jacob later managed the century feat again, gaining 101 percent in 2003. He has posted an average annual return of 47 percent during the last three years, putting the fund in the top 1 percent of all tech funds. 
 The performance ''gives me some degree of satisfaction,'' said Mr. Jacob, who recently moved to Redondo Beach, Calif., from New York City. ''When things fell apart, no one gave us a chance. It's pretty frustrating when everybody is constantly writing about your demise.'' 
 Frustrating it may have been, but it was hardly surprising that the media spotlight was fixed on Mr. Jacob. Thanks to his startling gains, he was often associated with the perceived speculative excess of the era. To try to avoid a repeat of such huge investment declines, Mr. Jacob has made some changes in his management style, such as adding some value stocks to his high-octane tech fund; he hopes that the move will decrease some of the fund's risk without sacrificing much on the upside. Mr. Jacob has also increased the fund's turnover rate. 
 ''That may seem controversial, but in a volatile sector like this, low turnover breeds complacency,'' he said. And despite his recent success, becoming complacent is not on Mr. Jacob's agenda. ''I know I have a ways to go until I can get the fund back to where it was when the Nasdaq was at 5,000,'' he said. 
 How far, exactly? More than 350 percent. 
 For Mr. Fobes, a former ''rookie of the year'' in Mutual Fund magazine, the decline was just as steep. His fund, Berkshire Focus, also fell 96 percent from its peak -- which it reached in August 2000. And if Mr. Jacob was the subject of some snide commentary among tech bears on Wall Street and in the news media, Mr. Fobes, to a lesser extent, received similar treatment. 
 Then again, when your fund's name is similar to that of one of the most successful investment vehicles ever -- and your own name is similar to one of the most famous on Wall Street -- your fund's performance is going to attract attention. But Mr. Fobes says the fund, based in San Jose, Calif., was named after the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts, not Berkshire Hathaway, the entity controlled by Warren E. Buffett.
 ''The only questions I ever get about the name come from reporters,'' Mr. Fobes said. ''Clearly, I am not trying to emulate Buffett or Berkshire. We're probably the polar opposite of Berkshire.''
 The differences are certainly more obvious than the similarities. Long-term investors have benefited from sticking with Mr. Buffett's Berkshire. Not so with Mr. Fobes's mutual fund. 
 ''Anyone who stuck with him deserves some sort of an award for that near-death experience,'' said Roy Weitz, publisher of FundAlarm, the mutual fund watchdog.
 During the last three years through March, the fund bounced back somewhat. Although its average annual return of 29 percent over that time is in the top fifth of tech funds as ranked by Morningstar, the five-year figure is much different: down 9 percent, annualized, putting it in the bottom tenth of such funds. Its assets are down to about $18 million, from $450 million at the fund's peak.
 Mr. Fobes, 41, is unfazed. ''I could survive with assets as low as $5 million, if I had to,'' he said. ''Maybe even lower.'' 
 Mr. Fobes, a former tech support worker at Adobe Systems with a degree in finance and economics from San Jose State, is the ultimate do-it-yourself investor. He started the fund in 1997 with some seed money from friends and family. And while he said he had learned some lessons from the fund's troubles -- such as not stubbornly sticking with stocks like Cisco Systems as they lose 90 percent of their value -- he still pursues the high-risk strategy of concentrating his tech fund on a couple dozen stocks, now including Google and Yahoo.
 But the great ride appears over for Mr. Zuccaro of Grand Prix. After the fund's big two years, it had losses in 2000 (33 percent ), 2001 (56 percent), 2002 (47 percent), 2004 (16 percent) and 2005 (4 percent), though it gained ground in 2003 (up 38 percent). Mr. Zuccaro, who started as an analyst for Value Line in 1967, shut down Grand Prix at the end of last year. Reached at his new home at Seabrook Island, S.C., he declined to comment on the fund's performance. 
 Mr. Zuccaro was outspoken, however, while he was running the fund. In 2001, he wrote the ill-timed ''Dow 30,000 by 2008: Why It's Different This Time.'' The book made the case for a ''new and powerful bull market unfolding over the years ahead.'' 
 IT'S a cheery view that Mr. Zuccaro continued to promote into 2005, when he predicted in his fund commentary for January that the current economic expansion would power the Dow Jones industrials to 30,000 by 2009, if not sooner. That call was hardly out of character. Mr. Zuccaro had a reputation for making short-term market forecasts, a practice eschewed by most fund managers.
 ''He was a creature of the moment, and that moment was the late 1990's,'' said Mr. Weitz of FundAlarm. ''It was like he was having a good time and letting everybody know it. For an older guy, you would have thought that he would have had a little more common sense.''
 Then there is the story of one of the hottest managers of a slightly earlier time, Heiko Thieme of the American Heritage Fund.
 Through good and bad years, Mr. Thieme, 62, doggedly stuck to a high-stakes strategy of investing in just a handful of stocks, like the British biotech, Senetek P.L.C. He had a fantastic run in the early 1990's: the fund soared 97 percent in 1991, 19 percent in 1992 and 41 percent in 1993. In the 12 years since, American Heritage has managed only three positive years. 
 In 1998 and 1999, the peak years of the bull market, the fund fell 61 percent and 32 percent. And at last check, the fund had a paltry $640,000 left. But the manager is still plugging away. ''We may be small in money, but we are bigger than life in ideas,'' said the ever-optimistic Mr. Thieme, currently coming up with new trading strategies for a possible hedge fund. ''If I ever write a book, it will be called 'Vision of an Optimist.' '' 
 His advice for managers like Mr. Jacob and Mr. Fobes is a Churchillian ''never give up.''

HEADLINE: Same Portfolio, Higher Cost. So Why Choose It?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MANY index funds track the Standard & Poor's 500, but they differ from one another in one major respect: their fees. You'd think that it would be obvious to investors to pick the fund that charges the least. But you'd be wrong.
 In fact, this truth was anything but obvious to a group of elite students. In an elaborate simulation created by several researchers, many students at Harvard and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania failed to select the lowest-cost index fund for their portfolios, even when they were all but spoon-fed the right answer. 
These findings are contained in a study entitled ''Why Does the Law of One Price Fail? An Experiment on Index Mutual Funds,'' which has been circulating in academic circles since last fall. Its authors are James J. Choi, an assistant professor of finance at the Yale School of Management; David Laibson, an economics professor at Harvard; and Brigitte C. Madrian, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School. A copy is at http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/jjc83/fees.pdf.
 The researchers wanted to find out whether the students would be able to assess how returns are affected by funds' fees. 
 In the first simulation, the professors asked 30 undergraduates at Harvard and Wharton, as well as 83 M.B.A. students at Wharton, to allocate a hypothetical $10,000 among four S.& P. 500 index funds that would be held for one year. All four funds invested in the same 500 companies, and matched the index's allocation for each stock, so the only significant difference in the funds' returns would come from their fees -- their front-end loads, or sales charges, and their management expenses. And because of the way the professors designed the experiment, these four funds had relatively high fees, ranging from 3.09 percent to 5.89 percent. 
 Each student received copies of the four index funds' prospectuses, which varied from 26 to 116 pages long. The prospectuses provided detailed descriptions of the funds' loads and expenses, along with a great deal of other information. To encourage the students to take the exercise seriously, each was paid a small amount -- $5 for undergraduates, $20 for M.B.A. students -- and was told that one student at each school, picked at random, would receive any profit that the $10,000 portfolio produced over the 12 months.
 The rational response, the professors argue, would have been to allocate all the money to the fund with the lowest fees. Yet fewer than 20 percent of either group of students did so. As a result, the hypothetical portfolios built by most of the students paid much higher fees than were necessary: 1.22 percentage points more, on average, among the undergraduates and 1.12 points higher among the M.B.A. students.
 What could account for the students' choices? One possibility is that the students were diverted by extraneous material in the prospectuses, and couldn't focus on the relevant information on fees.
 This is a disturbing prospect. After all, if a sampling of elite students can't separate the wheat from the chaff in assessing mutual fund reports, most investors probably can't do so, either. (All the study participants were high academic achievers who had scored above average on a financial literacy test administered by the professors.) 
 To test whether the students were being distracted, the professors designed two additional simulations. In one of them, another group of 112 students was given, in addition to the prospectus, a one-page sheet listing the date of inception for each of the four index funds, as well as its performance since then. Because the funds had different inception dates, comparing funds on this basis of their lifetime performance would shed no light on which one should be chosen. To make matters worse, the funds that had the higher returns since their inception also had higher fees. So if the students chose these funds, they would be giving more weight to irrelevant data than they were to the fees. 
 But that is precisely what they did. On average, both the undergraduates and the M.B.A. students in the second experiment made significantly higher portfolio allocations to the higher-cost funds than did the students who didn't receive the additional page of information.
 In the other additional test, another group of 114 students was given a one-page sheet that, instead of reporting returns since inception, specifically compared the funds' fees. Students in this final group did, on average, construct portfolios with lower fees. Nevertheless, even this group came nowhere close to allocating its entire portfolio to the low-cost fund. More than half of these students, in fact, continued to allocate some money to the higher-cost index funds.
 WHAT conclusions emerge from all these tests? Over all, the study said, the results do ''not inspire optimism about the financial choices made by most households.'' 
 The professors also concluded that the presentation of data could have a big effect on investors' decisions. And they argued that this offered a particularly important lesson for policy makers who are thinking about establishing personal investment accounts for workers in the Social Security system. Without careful guidance, the study said, most people won't be able to invest their money intelligently.

HEADLINE: Different Routes To Small-Cap Gains

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
A DIVERSE group of smaller companies in industries ranging from telecommunications to alternative energy drove the returns of some top-performing stock mutual funds in the first quarter. Managers of three winning funds discussed their stocks and what they saw ahead for the market.

Reaping What You Sow
 Warren J. Isabelle, 54, who runs the $100 million ICM/Isabelle Small Cap Value fund, says he analyzes a stock as if he were going to buy a company's business. Specifically, he focuses on a company's operating cash flow and its balance sheet. 
 In the first quarter, the fund benefited from a portfolio that included companies in commodities and basic industries as well as biotechnology and telecommunications concerns. Some gains, he said, came from ''seeds that we planted quite a while ago.'' The fund's shares rose 19.6 percent in the quarter. 
 One winner was ICO, a Houston-based maker and distributor of resins used in a variety of products and packaging. ICO's shares rose 54.8 percent in the quarter. 
 The fund also profited from its holdings in Broadwing, a communications company in Austin, Tex., that provides data, voice and other transmission services. Its shares rose 143.6 percent. Several years ago, the company acquired a significant amount of telecommunications assets at steeply discounted prices, Mr. Isabelle said. Today, he said, ''the telecommunications industry has begun to pick up quite nicely.''
 Another winner was Novavax, a biopharmaceutical company based in Malvern, Pa. Novavax is developing a technology that could speed up the creation of vaccines to prevent influenza and other infectious diseases, according to the company. 
 That technology, coupled with the avian flu scare, propelled the stock's price in the first quarter, Mr. Isabelle said. It rose 107.3 percent.
 Surveying the overall market, Mr. Isabelle says he thinks that interest rates will continue to rise and that inflation may begin creeping up.
 In such an environment, he said, ''commodities and basic materials companies will be winners.''

Focusing on the Green
 The $83 million New Alternatives fund focuses on companies that develop and distribute alternative sources of energy. Its co-managers are David J. Schoenwald, 56, and his father, Maurice L. Schoenwald, 86. Shares of the fund rose 20.6 percent in the quarter, buoyed by rising energy prices and the growing interest in fuels like ethanol and in energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power. But the fund's long-term record is not as strong; it rose just 3.7 percent a year, on average, in the last five years.
 Shareholders agreed in September 2005 to eliminate restrictions on the extent of the fund's holdings overseas, the younger Mr. Schoenwald said. Overseas investments, which had been capped at 35 percent of total assets before the change, now account for nearly 50 percent of assets.
 ''We've increased our foreign stock holdings because we're finding more profitable companies overseas, where government policy has been more supportive and more consistent than it has been in the U.S.,'' David Schoenwald said.
 The fund made money in two Spanish companies. One is Abengoa, which produces ethanol and biofuels and operates several facilities in the United States; its shares rose 63 percent in the first quarter. The other, Acciona, which was up 36.1 percent, operates a renewable-energy division with wind power projects and another that produces diesel fuel.
 Another winner was Ormat Technologies, a company in Sparks, Nev., that is a unit of Ormat Industries of Israel. Ormat Technologies builds and operates geothermal power plants; its shares rose 45.7 percent in the quarter.
 Mr. Schoenwald says he is concerned that alternative energy stocks are richly priced after their recent rally. And he says that he is ''very cautious'' about the overall stock market because of rising interest rates and the big federal budget deficit. 

A Bet on Telecoms
 Telecommunications stocks rebounded strongly in the quarter, and so did the $50 million Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund, after years of poor returns. It rose 22.2 percent in the first quarter, but despite this recent gain, it ranked at the bottom of the general domestic funds tracked by Morningstar for the five years ended March 31, with an annualized loss of more than 16 percent.
 The fund was hammered when the technology bubble burst in 2000, declining 20.9 percent that year, and dropping 59.7 percent in 2001 and 64.6 percent in 2002. While it gained 47.2 percent in 2003, it lost 16 percent in 2004 and 22.3 percent last year. Garrett Van Wagoner, 50, the fund's manager, explains its record this way: ''I was early in the telecommunications sector, and in our business, being early is being wrong,'' he said. Telecom stocks account for about 18 percent of the fund's assets. 
 The sector's rebound, he said, has been fueled by renewed spending by telephone and cable companies to provide broadband and wireless services to their customers.
 One winning stock was the Avanex Corporation, a company in Fremont, Calif., that makes fiber-optic-based products. Its shares rose 137.2 percent in the quarter. 
 The fund also held shares in two companies based in San Jose, Calif. One is Stratex Networks, up 71.8 percent, which produces wireless transmission systems for data, voice, and video communication. The other, Brocade Communications Systems, up 64.1 percent, produces switches used in data storage networking.
 In August 2004, Mr. Van Wagoner and his firm, Van Wagoner Capital Management, agreed to pay $800,000 to settle Security and Exchange Commission accusations that they had defrauded shareholders and mispriced securities. While not admitting wrongdoing, he agreed to step down as president of the company and be barred from serving as an officer or director of any mutual fund company for seven years.
 As for the year ahead, Mr. Van Wagoner said: ''I spend zero time trying to predict the market. I focus on individual companies and their strategies.''

HEADLINE: Seizing Intangibles For the G.D.P.

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE plain fact is that when it comes to measuring how much the American economy produces and who gets what share of the pie, the federal government's most celebrated statistic -- the gross domestic product -- leaves something to be desired.
 The G.D.P. is useful, as far as it goes. It tells us how much value -- often called national income -- is generated each year from the production of goods and services in the United States. The G.D.P. also breaks out how much of that income goes into profits and how much into wages and salaries. 
This is where the trouble is. The numbers show that the profit portion of the gross domestic product has risen mildly in recent years, while the wage-and-salary share has shrunk slightly. There is evidence, however, that because of the way the G.D.P. is calculated, the actual shift is much more pronounced. 
 ''We know that income inequality is quite substantial,'' said Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University, ''and this new evidence suggests that it is worse than we thought.''
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues the G.D.P. reports each quarter, is on the case. So are two prominent economists at the Federal Reserve. They all seem to be finding that the current methods for calculating G.D.P. undercount the dollar returns from research and development. What's more, this payoff is not showing up in workers' paychecks.
 The approximately $300 billion spent each year on R & D is a big concern of the bureau's economists. Until now, it has been counted as an expense, reducing the profit total within the G.D.P. Starting in September, however, the bureau will publish an experimental G.D.P. account that parallels the standard quarterly report, except for one change: R & D will be counted as capital investment rather than as an expense. 
 There is logic in this change. Consider the process of making and selling a dress. The cloth and thread -- the raw materials -- that go into the dress are an expense that must be subtracted from the sales price of the dress, once it is sold, to arrive at a profit. The automated sewing machine that makes the dress, on the other hand, is counted in the G.D.P. accounts as a capital investment because, once installed, it makes dress after dress, generating a stream of revenue. It is an investment drawn from retained earnings to generate more earnings.
 Similarly, the research and development that made Prozac possible generates revenue for years, just as the sewing machine does for the dressmaker. Successful research and development yields long-term returns, and the bureau's experimental G.D.P. acknowledges as much, by classifying R & D as capital investment in the satellite account. Capital investment, in turn, counts as a contribution to profit in the G.D.P. 
 This reclassification leaves no doubt that workers are being left behind as the G.D.P. expands. When R & D is counted as profit, the employee compensation share of national income drops by more than one percentage point. In a $12.5 trillion economy, that's big money. 
 Measured in dollars, wages aren't actually falling, but workers are losing ground. ''If capital income is going up and wages stay the same, then the share of total national income that goes to labor goes down,'' said Sumiye Okubo, an associate director of the bureau, who is directing the experimental project. 
 The two Fed economists -- Carol A. Corrado and Daniel E. Sichel -- along with an outside collaborator, Charles R. Hulten, a University of Maryland economist, go much further than Ms. Okubo and her team in arguing that the G.D.P. data should be revised. They would do more than just reclassify R & D. 
 In a recent research paper, ''Intangible Capital and Economic Growth,'' they agree with Ms. Okubo's team that formal, scientific research and development should be categorized as capital investment rather than as ordinary expenses. But they say that this treatment should be extended to a host of other investments that generate revenue streams over a period of years.
 They would include various intangibles, like advertising when it is used to establish a brand name that permanently lifts sales, and a retail chain's outlays to adapt existing technology to the chain's needs, as Wal-Mart did in designing a superefficient inventory control system.
 SUCH intangibles now approach $250 billion a year, up from only $11 billion in the 1970's, the three economists calculate. If these intangibles, along with R & D, were incorporated into G.D.P. on the profit side as capital investment, labor's share of national income would decline from a fairly steady 65 percent in the 1950's, 60's and 70's to less than 60 percent today. 
 The long decline doesn't show up in the standard G.D.P. accounts, which ascribe nearly 65 percent of national income to labor. ''The hidden earnings from these knowledge investments have not been shared equally with workers,'' Mr. Hulten said. 
 Two reasons seem likely. Some of the profit is probably going to the wealthiest Americans -- the upper 1 percent whose incomes have risen sharply, in part from dividends and other forms of corporate earnings. 
 Then, too, most of the nation's workers are bereft of bargaining power. Unless that returns, labor's share of national income seems likely to continue its decline.
