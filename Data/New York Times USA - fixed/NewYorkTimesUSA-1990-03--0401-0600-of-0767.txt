Connecticut Bank Bill Advances

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Connecticut House and Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that allows out-of-state banks to buy Connecticut banks.
The bill, which amends a law that had limited out-of-state bank ownership to institutions from other New England states, is expected to be signed by Gov. William A. O'Neill.
The law would remove an obstacle to the long-planned acquisition of Northeast Bancorp in Shelton, Conn., by the Bank of New York Corporation. But it may not be the catalyst for immediate moves into the state by other New York banks, analysts said, even though New York banks have for years expressed a desire to expand into Connecticut, especially into the wealthier towns close to New York City. 
 
Massachusetts Is Interested
Legislators in Massachusetts have also recently considered allowing acquisitions by banks outside the region, but they have not yet changed the law. As banking problems have mounted in the area, officials at some leading Massachusetts banks, including the troubled Bank of New England Corporation, have supported measures to allow acquisitions by out-of-state banks.
''Given the economic climate right now in the Northeast, I don't expect you will see quick acquisitions in Connecticut,'' said Richard Barrett, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. The new Connecticut law would allow out of state banks to open new Connecticut banks on Feb. 1, 1992.
 
Deal Was Made in 1983
The Bank of New York agreed in 1983 to acquire Northeast Bancorp, if the deal could be completed by Aug. 15, 1990. But after the once highly profitable Connecticut banking company announced large losses from its real estate lending in the fourth quarter of 1989, executives at the Bank of New York indicated they wanted to lower the price.
In January, J. Carter Bacot, the chairman of the Bank of New York, said a ''preliminary'' examination of Northeast's books ''showed that loan- loss reserves will have to be increased by significant amounts.'' Those increases could cause losses at the bank, which would reduce its capital, and thus lower the price that Bank of New York would pay under terms of its purchase agreement.
When the agreement to acquire Northeast was amended in 1986, the Bank of New York agreed to pay 2.5 times the Connecticut banking company's book value, or $635 million based on its current capital.
According to Bank Mergers and Acquisitions, a trade publication in Hoboken, N.J., a $635 million price, if paid in Bank of New York shares, would give Northeast shareholders about 20 percent of Bank of New York's stock, even though Northeast would contribute only about 7 percent of the combined companies' profits.

HEADLINE: OPEC in Strong Position at Meeting

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 15

 BODY:
OPEC oil ministers will start a meeting on Friday in which they will wrestle with how to play a strong hand: essentially whether to settle for oil prices at about $18 a barrel or to try to raise them.
This situation represents a sharp contrast with OPEC's problem in the last decade. Prices collapsed to as low as $10 a barrel in 1986, and OPEC's production, which now stands at 24 million barrels a day, sank to around 14 million.
The change in the fortunes of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began a few years ago. It is tied, experts say, to the fact that demand for oil has been steadily rising around the world, and there is no end in sight as long as prices stay low and supplies outside OPEC continue to shrink. 
 
Demand Up at About 3% a Year
Over the last three years, demand has steadily increased by about 3 percent a year, while production of oil in countries outside OPEC, including large producers like the United States and the Soviet Union, has dropped by at least a million barrels a day, giving OPEC an opportunity to fill the void rapidly, pump more of its oil and raise prices.
Libya's oil minister, Fawzi al-Shakshuki, opened the OPEC bidding contest on his arrival in Vienna today by declaring that he will push OPEC to raise prices. ''Libya will ask OPEC to raise the price to at least $20 to compensate for world inflation, which has put the real price below $14,'' Mr. Shakshuki told reporters.
But Kuwait, a prime advocate of lower oil prices, said it wants prices closer to $18 for some time, to encourage consumers to buy more oil. Kuwait's stand matters most since it has the ability to lift production far above the current level of two million barrels a day, thus drowning the market and preventing prices from rising.
 
Support for Kuwait
More important, oil experts point out, Kuwait has the tacit support of other conservative Arab producers, like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which also have considerable excess capacity to produce more oil above their current levels of 2 million and 5.5 million barrels a day, respectively.
''Oil prices are fluctuating between $18 and $20 a barrel,'' Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, said this week. ''That is ideal.'' His country has been openly flouting all OPEC production discipline for more than three years, producing twice its official quota.
The oil ministers' meeting in the Austrian capital comes at a time when oil prices have been at or above the ''minimum reference price'' of $18 for 13 months despite OPEC's overproduction, suggesting that demand has been so strong as to leave the group immune to the customary cheating on quotas by several of its members.
 
Current Production Estimate
Oil experts estimate current production for all of the group's 13 countries at close to 24 million barrels a day, or far above the official ceiling of 22.1 million in effect since January.
So the big question facing OPEC now is not so much a return to discipline, they say, as it is an agreement on a ''price philosophy'' to set price levels for the rest of this decade. Indeed, virtually all OPEC experts agree that the group is slowly getting back in the driver's seat when it comes to regulating the price that consumers must pay for energy.
In that respect, OPEC officials have argued for months about two strategies.
Some like Kuwait, have openly called for the freedom of countries that have large reserves to produce more oil. The guiding wisdom behind this view is that only three or four countries in OPEC can produce more - namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. In addition, Kuwait says, such a policy is necessary to keep prices low, which is the key to the rise in demand for oil.
 
End of Quotas Sought
Last month Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, declared in an interview that the whole quota system should be scrapped.
''From a practical standpoint the quotas are already irrelevant,'' he said.
He argued that OPEC should revert to quotas only if oil prices fell below $18 a barrel. The Kuwaiti official went on to say that OPEC's objective from now on must be ''the maintenance of price'' at a moderate level that encourages further consumption.
Iraq, which does have the capacity to produce more, has gone on record saying that it prefers to produce less and have a higher price because it needs the money to rebuild its damaged economy, run down from eight years of the war with Iran that ended in 1988.

HEADLINE: Agency Votes to Sell Houses Owned by Savings Units

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
The Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency managing the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry, today approved its first program to sell the housing stock of failed savings institutions to low- and medium-income families.
The board approved a joint financing program between the trust corporation and the State of Texas under which the Texas Housing Authority would issue $140 million in tax-exempt bonds to provide financing for low-rate mortgages for the low- and moderate-income families.
The trust corporation will select the private lenders and the mortgages will be used exclusively to buy half of the 5,200 housing properties for sale by the agency in Texas. 
 
No Borrower Fees
The agency will be allowed to spend up to $6 million in commitment fees for the new mortgages. Under the plan, low-income borrowers will not have to repay the fees. The program will be put into effect within 30 to 60 days pending the final approval of the Texas agency, which originally proposed the plan.
In addition to managing the bailout, the Resolution Trust Corporation has a separate mandate to sell affordable housing. The program was inserted in the bailout legislation by Congressional Democrats.
''We hope that R.T.C. will actively negotiate with other states and local housing agencies to form affordable housing partnerships to provide low-interest-rate loans to buyers of R.T.C.'s housing properties,'' said Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a member of the Oversight Board.
Officials of the Oversight Board said there are an estimated 10,000 properties held by savings institutions in conservatorship across the country that will ultimately be eligible for the affordable housing program.
The board urged the agency to negotiate similar agreements with other states. Florida has expressed interest in a similar program.
 
Nomination Made
In a separate development today, President Bush nominated Robert C. Larson, the chief executive officer of the Taubman Company, a national real estate developer based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., to a three-year term on the Oversight Board. He would fill one of two remaining vacancies on the board if he is confirmed by the Senate.
In addition to Mr. Kemp, the other members of the Oversight Board are Nicholas F. Brady, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Noting that the Oversight Board had been criticized for moving slowly to fill vacancies, Mr. Brady, chairman of the board, said that the delay was caused because of Mr. Larson's long experience in the real estate business.
''We had a choice to approach people who really knew something about the business and therefore would have a long period of examination because of the possibility of conflict, or we could have taken somebody with no knowledge and move it quite quickly,'' Mr. Brady said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Ease in Slow Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds eased in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers took some profits after Wednesday's strong rally and awaited the release of new economic statistics.
This morning, reports on housing activity, industrial production and producer prices for February will be released. The producer price figure, in particular, is of interest in the credit markets.
''Inflation is what this market has been focusing on for some time, and with some of the recent economic numbers showing some strength, the market would sell off sharply if we got a bad producer price number,'' one Government bond trader said. 
An increase in producer prices would be expected to lead to an increase in consumer prices later on, and that could lead to tighter credit and higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve tried to fight inflation.
 
Effects of Energy and Food
Most analysts expected that the index would be unchanged to down slightly from January levels because of declines in food and energy prices. Excluding those sectors, they saw a rise of about two-tenths of a percentage point.
''Anything greater than a three-tenths of a percentage point increase in the Producer Price Index excluding food and energy will spell further trouble for the market,'' analysts at MMS International, an economic information company, noted in their daily commentary yesterday.
With so much data expected today, traders were reluctant to take positions in the secondary market for Treasury securities yesterday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 25/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.61 percent, up from 8.60 percent on Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered in late trading at 99 7/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.67 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 22/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 8.67 percent.
Treasury bill rates were little changed. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.92 percent, unchanged on the day. And six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, or hundredth of a point, to a late offered rate of 8.67 percent.
 
'Junk' Prices Steady
Uncertainty continued in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market about the disposition of the $3.5 billion portfolio of securities owned by the Columbia Savings and Loan Association. However, traders said that prices of most issues were largely unchanged.
One exception was the bonds issued by the Charter Medical Corporation, a hospital owner and manager based in Macon, Ga. Those bonds were quoted down sharply after the company announced it had discovered inaccuracies in its reporting of contractual allowances, bad debts and expense accruals. The correction reduced the company's operating income by $28 million.
Analysts said they were surprised by the company's brief announcement. As a result, prices of some of the company's bonds dropped almost 10 points, to 67, although dealers said that little actual trading took place.
A number of new debt issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a $155 million debenture issue for the General American Transportation Corporation.
The 10 1/8 percent securities, which mature March 15, 2002, were priced at $99.80 to yield 10.155 percent, 1.5 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The debentures, which are noncallable for life, are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the transaction.
 
Notes of Morgan Bank
Morgan Bank Delaware offered $200 million of floating-rate deposit notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
The notes, which have a final maturity of Sept. 22, 1992, were priced at 100. The interest rate will be reset weekly at 62.50 basis points over the prevailing bond equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills.
The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Market participants said that prices of most actively traded issues in the secondary market for corporate bonds dipped by about 1/8 of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most issues were unchanged on the day, dealers said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended March 5. The report had little impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Amid Concern Over Falling Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against most leading currencies except the Japanese yen amid selling spurred by speculation about lower American interest rates.
Currency dealers said a comment by President Bush suggesting that he would welcome a drop in rates sapped positive sentiment toward the dollar out of the foreign exchange market.
A rumor that Japan might raise its discount rate by one and a half percentage points also hurt the dollar. Higher Japanese rates would enhance returns on yen-denominated investments and tend to bolster demand for the yen. 
Robert Morrissey, a senior currency trader at the Bank of Boston, said the President's comments to the National Association of Manufacturers renewed speculation that the White House and the Federal Reserve might be at odds over interest-rate policy.
Mr. Bush told the manufacturers that lower rates remained a priority of his Administration, saying, ''We need to keep interest rates down.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Morrissey said the Japanese discount-rate rumor reinforced selling pressure on the dollar. But the dollar still closed in New York at a higher rate against the yen than on Wednesday.
The dollar was also under pressure from profit taking before United States economic reports are released today on inflation, industrial production and housing starts.
The dollar closed in New York at 1.6990 West German marks, down from 1.7110 marks late Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.47 yen, up from 152.20. In London late yesterday, the dollar closed at 152.55 yen. In New York, the dollar bought 152.285 yen, up from 152.18 late on Wednesday.
In London, the pound regained some of the ground lost recently against the dollar. It closed at $1.6177 in London, up from $1.6090 late on Wednesday. Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.6215, compared with $1.6103 on Wednesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those late on Wednesday, included: 1.5180 Swiss francs, down from 1.5245; 5.7415 French francs, down from 5.7805; 1,255.00 Italian lire, down from 1,263.00, and 1.18085 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1733.
Gold prices edged slightly higher in New York after falling overseas.
The Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at $398.20 late yesterday, up 20 cents from Wednesday's late bid. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $398.10 an ounce, up 10 cents.
An ounce of gold was quoted at $398.50 late yesterday in London, down from $399.05 late Wednesday.
In New York, silver for current delivery closed at $5.079 an ounce on the Comex, down from $5.081 on Wednesday. Silver traded late in London at $5.10 an ounce, up from $5.09.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Soybean and Sugar Prices Rise on Rumor About Brazil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Soybean and sugar futures prices rose sharply yesterday, partly reflecting fears that Brazil's new President will seek higher taxes and restrictions on exports of some of the country's principal commodities.
On other commodity markets, grain futures advanced, petroleum futures rose and copper surged, while precious metals were mixed, cattle futures retreated and pork futures were mixed.
Soybean futures settled 9 to 13 1/2 cents higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the contract for delivery in March at $5.86 a bushel. 
Analysts linked some of the buying to rumors that President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, who took office yesterday, planned to seek an export tax on soybeans and soy products as one of many measures aimed at stabilizing the country's foundering economy.
Such a tax would put the cost of Brazilian soybeans closer to that of United States soybeans on the world market and could discourage Brazilian growers from marketing their crops quickly.
The late rally in the soybean pit erased much of the losses registered earlier in the week and prompted speculation that prices may have to move even higher to persuade American farmers to market their soybean stocks.
 
New Export Business Indicated
Indications of new export business also supported the grain and soybean markets. The Soviet Union was believed to be in the market for American corn, while China was said to have bid for 300,000 metric tons of United States wheat at subsidized prices.
Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 3 1/2 cents higher, with March at $3.84 1/2 a bushel; corn was 3/4 cent to 3 1/4 cents higher, with March at $2.47 a bushel, and oats were 1/2 cent lower to 3/4 cent higher, with March at $1.44 a bushel.
Sugar futures made new eight-and-a-half-year highs on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on rumors that Brazil may eliminate or reduce exports to divert more sugar to the country's fuel alcohol program.
Sugar futures settled 0.23 to 0.39 cent higher, with May at 15.93 cents a pound, after trading as high as 16.02 cents during the session for the first time since mid-1981.
Copper futures prices rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange on fears that the four-day-old strike at the Southern Peru Copper Corporation could force cancellation of copper shipments.
Copper ended 0.05 cent to 3.05 cents higher, with March at $1.2805 a pound.
Futures prices of refined oil products climbed sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, leading crude oil higher, on news of minor problems at two Exxon refineries and an ARCO oil pipeline shutdown in Texas caused by flooding.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 to 36 cents higher, with April at $20.38 a barrel; heating oil was 0.63 to 0.98 cent higher, with April at 54.98 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 2.09 cents higher, with April at 57.94 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Business Stakes East Bloc Claims And a 'Gold Rush' Hits Hungary

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
With some of the biggest companies in the United States leading the way, Hungary has become corporate America's main port of entry into Eastern Europe. In recent months, General Electric, General Motors, Levi Strauss, McDonald's and others have set up businesses in Hungary, and the stream of American concerns seeking joint ventures here is accelerating daily.
''It's a stampede - it's like the gold rush,'' said Michael J. Shade, president of the four-month-old American Chamber of Commerce in Budapest, which already has 75 members. Mr. Shade estimates that 100 American companies have established joint ventures in Hungary, and another 50 have set up representative offices.
There are several reasons why Hungary has proved particularly attractive. It is the most open of the Eastern European nations to foreign investors, offering liberal joint-venture laws and generous tax incentives. Another lure is that the Government makes it comparatively easy for job-creating foreign companies to transfer home the profits they make in Hungary. 
 
2 Decades of Reforms
American executives also say Hungary's two decades of step-by-step economic reforms mean that among Eastern European nations it has the closest thing to a market economy. Hungarian workers are also low paid.
For some American executives, there is a personal incentive as well. When the Communists took control of Hungary after the 1956 revolution, many of the best and brightest immigrated to the United States and succeeded in American business.
George Varga, for example, is returning to his native country after 34 years to run the General Electric Company's joint venture. ''I want to be part of this process,'' Mr. Varga said. ''I want to do something good for this country.''
David A. Hughes, commercial attache at the American Embassy here, says more than 200 American companies have visited him so far this year to inquire about Hungary. ''And we get so many faxes about people planning to visit that we can't read them all,'' he said.
Last month, the Ralston Purina Company agreed to an animal-feed joint venture, and the Digital Equipment Corporation recently decided to set up a sales and service venture for its computers. The Ford Motor Company, the Eastman Kodak Company, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company and the Proctor & Gamble Company have all sent executives in to prospect for joint-venture partners.
Though a small market, with just 10.6 million people, Hungary is increasingly viewed as a model that other Eastern European nations will need to follow to encourage foreign investment, which is expected to bring in management skills and capital to revitalize stagnant economies.
 
'Leading the Way'
''All Eastern European countries are trying to have more foreign direct investment, and Hungary is leading the way,'' said Jan Stankowski, an economist with the Institute for Comparative Economic Studies in Vienna.
To be sure, Austrian and West German companies have set up more joint ventures here than the Americans. But United States companies have weighed in with the biggest ventures by far.
G.E. agreed in November to pay $150 million for a 50.1 percent stake in Tungsram, Eastern Europe's leading light bulb manufacturer. In January, General Motors said it would invest more than $100 million in a joint venture with Raba, a state-owned truck and engine manufacturer, to build engines and assemble some 30,000 cars a year. And Guardian Industries of Northville, Mich., owns 80 percent of a joint venture that is building a $120 million glass factory.
''The G.E. investment had a symbolic effect,'' said Theodore S. Boone, a lawyer in the Budapest office of Baker & McKenzie. ''When G.E. moves, people take notice. Now it seems that no one wants to be last.''
Five American accounting firms and two United States law firms have set up offices in Budapest to assist in the fast-growing corporate presence. DHL Worldwide Express has started overnight air-freight service to the United States. The investment craze is so fierce that bidding wars among Westerners have caused rents for some Budapest apartments to soar to $2,000 a month, while prices for some houses, especially mansions overlooking the Danube, have jumped to more than $1 million.
Finding office space is also a problem. The operations of Price Waterhouse have been scattered among several apartments until the accounting firm's new office building is completed. The telephone system is a constant source of irritation: long-distance calling can be nightmarish, and it took Levi Strauss a year to have a phone installed at its jeans factory.
 
Shipping to the West
''Some Americans are coming to Hungary because they see it as a market to sell products they already have,'' said Mr. Shade, the Chamber of Commerce president. ''That's the case of McDonald's. Some have come to Hungary looking for a low-cost site to manufacture products that they will ship back to the West. That's the case of General Motors and Schwinn.''
Fourteen months ago, the Schwinn Bicycle Company, based in Chicago, began a joint venture with Csepel, Hungary's largest bike maker, and pumped in several million dollars to upgrade the old Csepel factory in western Budapest. Now Steven M. Bina, director of Schwinn's European operations, is boasting that the joint venture has improved the quality of the bikes so much that they are ready to be exported to the West.
 
Low-Cost Base for Sales
Many Western executives at first viewed Hungary as a springboard to sell thoughout the East bloc. But given the disarray in Comecon, the Soviet-led trading system, many now see the country more as a low-cost base to sell to the West.
''A lot of people think that if you have a place here, all of the Eastern market will open up for you,'' said Mr. Varga, the G.E. executive who was sent to run Tungsram. ''The way the trend is going, that doesn't happen to be the case.''
Mr. Varga said G.E. was interested in Tungsram because it gave the American company about 12 percent of Europe's light bulb market. He said his most pressing need was to improve Tungsram's internal information system - he wants monthly profit statements done by computer, to replace statements that Tungsram used to do every six months by hand.
Mr. Varga is confident that Hungarians can compete internationally. ''After 40 years of Communism, they seem very open to change,'' he said.
 
Quickening Tempo
Hungary became the first country in Eastern Europe to allow joint ventures, in 1972. But by the end of 1988, only 280 ventures had been formed. The tempo picked up dramatically last year, however, thanks to the far-reaching foreign investment law and the collapse of Communism here and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
As a result, more than 750 foreign joint ventures were set up last year alone. These included a McCann-Erickson advertising joint venture, a Rupert Murdoch investment in two Hungarian newspapers, and a U S West venture to set up a mobile telephone network.
Another eye-catching deal involved Ronald S. Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and former New York mayoral candidate, and R. Mark Palmer, a former Ambassador to Hungary. They helped to form an American-Canadian consortium that bought half of the venerable General Banking and Trust Company.
In February, Digital signed a deal with two Hungarian software companies, KFKI and Szamark, to sell computers and provide software. Yves Sarrazin, director of Digital's country development group, said he had decided to invest in Hungary partly because it had so many computer experts, some of them so skilled that they were already producing ''clones'' of Digital computers. Digital owns 51 percent of the joint venture.
Mr. Sarrazin predicted that Digital's annual sales here could soon exceed $10 million, because the banking, railroad and air-traffic systems in the country badly need computers, as do many of its enterprises. 5-Year Tax Holiday Hungary's departing reform-minded Communist Government has created many incentives to attract foreign investors. The new joint-venture law offers a five-year tax holiday to many investors and pledges to compensate foreigners for any nationalizations of their operations in the future. One of the law's biggest attractions is that it gives foreign investors complete freedom to repatriate profits. This means that whatever investors earn in Hungarian forints can be freely converted to dollars and sent home as dividends.
''I'm not sure if we would have invested here if the investment law hadn't changed,'' said Harrison Givens, director of the Ralston Purina joint venture. The St. Louis-based company is investing several million dollars in a 50-50 joint venture with a union of farm cooperatives to produce animal-feed concentrate.
Because Hungary's huge foreign debt makes it hard for the nation to borrow, Hungarian officials and executives say joint ventures are essential to bring in money to modernize the manufacturing base.
Speaking about the joint venture with G.M., Ferenc Romvari, acting general manager of Raba, said his company could not possibly build an auto assembly plant without help from a foreign partner. ''Raba simply couldn't afford to build it,'' he said. ''What is more, making automobiles requires such a vast background in industry that we just don't have all the expertise to do it ourselves.''
 
Profits Exceed Investment
Not only are American investors doing good, some are doing very well. Andras Pinter, manager of the Levi Strauss joint venture, said his factory's annual profits exceeded the initial $1 million investment by the company in its 200-employee factory. Fotex, a joint venture backed by private American investors, earned more than $1 million in its first year of selling and developing film - far more than its original $200,000 investment.
The profits do not always come so easily. Many foreign executives complain that Hungarians do not work hard enough. To make ends meet, many juggle two or three jobs, generating complaints that they do not concentrate enough on any single one.
But Mr. Pinter has made his Levi Strauss plant as efficient as any in Europe. ''We get good work from our people by paying them twice as much as the average Hungarian makes and prohibiting them from taking a second job,'' he said.News Corporationd Interpublic Groupd (McCann-Erickson)

HEADLINE: Families of Hostages Tell of Living A Seesaw Life of Hope and Despair

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Thomas Cicippio feels like a hostage, too.
It is his brother, Joseph, who is the actual captive, one of eight Americans held somewhere in the Middle East, presumably in Lebanon, by pro-Iranian terrorists.
''But most of the time I feel like I'm being held,'' Mr. Cicippio said today as he arrived in Washington from Norristown, Pa., for ceremonies to mark the beginning of the sixth year in captivity for Terry A. Anderson, the hostage who has been held longest.
''Until all the hostages are freed,'' Mr. Cicippio added, ''no hostage family is going to be free. We live on a roller coaster of emotions, up and down, up and down. We can't get off, not as long as Joe or Terry Anderson or any of the others are still being held.'' 
Terry Anderson was the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, based in Beirut, when he was kidnapped at gunpoint on March 16, 1985. He was the first United States citizen to be taken.
 
They Hurt, Too, They Say
Joseph Cicippio was acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut when he was kidnapped on Sept. 12, 1986, and was the fourth American taken.
Thomas Cicippio and the relatives of other hostages say their loved ones' ordeal has traumatized them as well, and the latest high-intensity round of rumors that the hostages might be freed was especially wrenching.
The hostages' relatives are the first to admit that nothing they have been through could compare to what has happened to those in chains behind locked doors in the Middle East. But they hurt, too, they say.
They tell of waking in the night, sometimes in a rage, sometimes feeling drained, sometimes flush with expectation that, come the sun, their loved one will be coming home.
 
The Births, the Deaths
They tell of struggling to explain to a child, again and again, why a father has been absent for two, three, five years.
They tell of family births - Mr. Anderson has never seen his 4-year-old daughter, Sulome - and of family deaths that the captives are presumed not to know about.
They tell of keeping scrapbooks for absent sons, fathers and brothers -Mr. Cicippio has six - some now filled with clippings that have yellowed.
 
'That Glimmer of Hope'
They tell of weekly phone calls from State Department officials to discuss the latest reports and rumors or to compare notes on the latest hostage letter or photograph to be released. The letters and photos can be roller coaster rides in themselves, depending upon what can be read between the lines or perceived in the grainy, fuzzy prints.
They tell of becoming addicts to hourly news broadcasts, of always, absolutely always, turning on the set with some hope, however faint, that this time the announcement will finally come. ''You just always have that glimmer of hope - you have to,'' Mr. Ciccipio said. ''In a way, we're even hostage to the radio.''
Kit Sutherland of Fort Collins, Colo., daughter of the hostage Thomas M. Sutherland, puts it another way. She says hostage families eventually learn that the only way to survive is to keep hopes high and expectations low.
''You learn not to talk about 'if' the hostages are released but 'when' they're released,'' said Ms. Sutherland, whose father, dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut, was kidnapped on June 9, 1985. He was the second American to be taken.
 
The Families as Hostages
In a letter sent to a Beirut newspaper, Sulome's mother, Madeleine Bassil, made the point that the relatives of the hostages are themselves hostages. The newspaper, she hopes, will eventually make its way to the cell, the room or the dungeon where Mr. Anderson is being held.
''We are in as much capitivity, Terry, only our living space is bigger and it's shared by the millions,'' she wrote.
Mr. Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, has been particularly active in the effort to win freedom for him and the seven other hostages, organizing many ceremonies and making many trips abroad, on behalf of all the hostage families.
''They are an incredible group of people and they just humble me,'' she said of the families at today's ceremony, attended by several dozen relatives of hostages and representatives of Congress, the State Department, the armed services and the media.
 
Prayers and Yellow Ribbons
The ceremony was held at noon in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, in sunny spring-like weather. There were prayers and hymns, some tears were shed, and a whole sea of bright yellow ''Free the Hostages'' ribbons fluttered.
Shortly before the ceremony, Mrs. Say met privately with President Bush to discuss the latest round of rumors about whether the hostages might soon be freed. She said that the President was doing everything possible to speed freedom for the captives, but that he could offer little more at this point than ''faith'' that he would achieve his goal.
The families clappled loudly when Ms. Say finished her report, apparently satisfied that all was being done that could be done.
In recent weeks the hopes of the families have been again and again boosted, then undercut. ''It just seems to drag on and on and on,'' said Brian Polhill of Queens, the son of Robert Polhill, an assistant professor of business at Beirut University College who was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987.
 
Once More, a Photo
''Will it ever end?'' Thomas Cicippio asked. ''This has been a really rough one.''
First came reports that President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran had declared that the hostage issue should be settled, apparently so that Iran could get on with rebuilding its war-damaged economy.
Then came rumors that talks were under way on freeing the hostages, perhaps with third parties mediating. Mr. Cicippio's hopes took flight. Then the hostage takers released a picture of Joseph Ciccippio in which he seemed in ''reasonable'' physical condition, to use Thomas Cicippio's word. The whole family took heart: earlier photos had been less encouraging.
But then came reports that the hostage takers had said no release was imminent, followed Thursday by a statement from President Bush that nothing was happening on the hostage front that promised an immediate ''payoff.''
And, as if to deflate Mr. Cicippio and the other hostage families totally, one group of hostage takers threatened Thursday to kill three captives unless some captured Arabs were freed by Israel.
 
It's Not the First Time
The threat was taken seriously by the hostages' relatives, but Virginia Steen, the wife of one of the threatened captives, Alann Steen, said she would not despair.
''We have been through this before,'' she said. ''I will not give up hope. I saw a picture they released of my husband and I looked at that photograph and I could see he was fighting back. I could just see it. I will fight with him.''
Mr. Steen was a professor of journalism at Beirut University College who was kidnapped. He was taken with Mr. Polhill, on Jan. 24, 1987, along with a third professor, Jesse Turner, a member of the mathematics department at the college.
Completing the list of American hostages held in the Middle East are Frank Reed, director of the Lebanon International School in Beirut, kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986, and Edward Tracy, an author of children's books, kidnapped on Oct. 21, 1986.
While the hostage ceremony here today marked the beginning of Terry Anderson's sixth year in captivity, Thomas Cicippio prefers to think of hostage captivity in terms of days. On his lawn in Norristown are large white signs on which he has painted the names of each of the living hostages. Next to the names is the number of days each has been held.
Each evening, just after watching the late news, Thomas Cicippio goes out into the darkness and changes the numbers to reflect the correct total when the sun comes up. He has worn a path in the grass that leads from his front door to the signs.
Tonight he will change Joseph Cicippio's number to 1,283.

HEADLINE: The Instincts of Parenthood Become Part of Crack's Toll

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 16

 BODY:
Crack can overwhelm one of the strongest forces in nature, the parental instinct, specialists in drug addiction say. As a result, some of them say, the United States is giving birth to a new underclass of disadvantaged youth like none seen before.
''The maternal instinct gets blocked out because the only thing that matters is the addiction,'' said Kate Vandegrift, director of New Image, a residential rehabilitation program here for women and their children. The program, for homeless addicts, tries to reverse personal priorities, providing therapy, lessons on being a parent and time for 18 women and their 24 children to renew or create a loving bond.
Sharon Hoyle, a resident, wept for joy the other night at her daughter Janine's 10th birthday party - a tangle of balloons, flashing cameras, wriggling children and proud mothers. 
Only months ago, because of crack addiction, these same women were letting their children wither and in one case die from neglect. On this night a year ago Mrs. Hoyle got high on crack instead of giving Janine a party or even a birthday cake.
''I am proud of myself,'' Mrs. Hoyle said. ''I love you,'' Janine told her mother. Rise in Cases of Children Children's advocates blame the crack epidemic for more and more of the 2.2 million cases of child abuse and neglect that are reported to child-protective services each year. A surge in the number of children reported to have died of abuse and neglect is also linked to crack.
The deaths rose by 36 percent, from 899 in 1985 to 1,223 in 1988, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse. Social service workers say many cases of child abuse never make it into official reports.
Leslie B. Mitchel, the committee's senior research analyst, said: ''In the early 1980's, when we talked to child-protective agencies we used to hear that 30 to 40 percent of the reported child abuse and neglect cases involved substance abuse, and much of that was alcohol abuse. Now we are hearing anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the cases involve substance abuse and much of that is crack cocaine.''
Some authorities on child abuse say that crack, like any addictive drug including alcohol, is just one symptom of a bigger social problem. ''There is no place for children in the crack world,'' said Dr. Marsha Rosenbaum, a sociologist, ''but it's not crack so much as the other circumstances of poverty that lead to neglect and sometimes abuse.''
Dr. Rosenbaum and an associate, Sheigla Murphy, has begun interviews with 125 women who use crack in San Francisco.
Other specialists in treating addiction say crack threatens families more than other drugs do because it is widely available and has a stronger appeal to women than other drugs like heroin. It does not have to be injected, and a single dose is inexpensive.
 
Crack Accelerating Abuse
Dr. Elizabeth Rahdert, a research psychologist in the division of clinical research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: ''We know that it chemically impairs people's functioning so they can't make decisions, can't take responsibility for paying the rent or seeing that there is food on the table for their children.
''We know that the drug is a powerful stimulant that creates high volatility, makes people lose control, become very tense and jumpy. All of these things can lead to not thinking before you act, striking out, more rapid abuse.''
Addicted mothers are often single parents, and this can add to the stress of the family situation. Nine out of 10 men leave women addicted to drugs, said Ms. Vandegrift, New Image's director. Conversely, only one out of 10 women leave addicted men, she said.
An estimated 1.9 million men and 1 million women, almost all of childbearing age, use cocaine, according to the 1988 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse. Those figures, based on interviews with 8,814 people over 12 years of age by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, include 282,000 men and 203,000 women who use crack.
 
Stereotypes Are Dashed
And crack use among women seems to be cutting across economic lines and in some cases dashing stereotypes. Surveys in Pinellas County, Fla., by Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, president of the National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education in Chicago, indicate that slightly more pregnant white women in private clinics than pregnant black women in public clinics test positive for cocaine in urine samples.
Nationwide, Dr. Chasnoff estimated, as many as one baby in 10, or up to 375,000 a year, are born with some illicit drug in the blood. And particularly because of what crack does to these children and their parents, experts say, there is greater risk of abuse and neglect.
''Crack addicts are more susceptible to all stresses in the environment, and children become stressors,'' said Dr. Rahdert of the drug abuse institute. ''When you have infants and children fetally exposed to crack, they may be easily excitable, hyper-arousable and do more crying. So if the child is impaired and the mother or care giver is impaired, the situation is even more explosive and dangerous.''
As for the scope of the problem, researchers are just beginning to study families damaged by crack use and to follow the development of hundreds of thousands of babies neurologically impaired by the drug in the womb who are now growing up in dysfunctional families with addicted parents.
But few researchers doubt that most of these children will have mental, emotional and social deficits that will harden their lives and threaten society. ''What it boils down to is that some kids will make it and some won't,'' said Nancy C. McDaniel, a spokeswoman for the American Humane Association, a 114-year-old nonprofit organization in Denver concerned with child abuse.
 
Families That Don't Bother
If social service agencies do not intervene, families with addiction simply slip out of sight, said Dr. Judy Howard, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California at Los Angeles. She said that when courts do not order drug-addicted parents to bring in their children for free medical care, the families do not bother. ''Mandatory intervention is needed to keep these kids visible, so we know they are not being abused or neglected,'' she said.
But Dr. Howard acknowledged that family courts and social agencies are overwhelmed. And drug treatment programs are few, even though the Federal Government is spending $1.3 billion this year to support new state programs.
New Image is one of only about 21 such residential programs for women and children. Many of them started just in the last two years, and they can help only 500 to 1,000 families a year. The cost to public agencies, in the case of New Image, is $75 a day per family.
Mrs. Hoyle, among the first group of women to complete New Image's rehabilitation program, speaks of her past addiction with detached horror.
The 31-year-old mother, who is separated from her husband, wound up in a city shelter in April 1989 with her three children after being evicted from a house in North Philadelphia for not paying rent. For two years she used the family's entire public assistance grant, about $600 a month, to buy crack.
''I sold the food out of my refrigerator to get high,'' Mrs. Hoyle said. ''I sold my clothes, the TV, the washing machine and all our furniture to get high. The house was a mess, and after a while the only thing that worked was the bathtub.''
''The kids hardly ate,'' she continued. ''They didn't clean their rooms or go to school much. Their mom didn't care about them, and they just started not caring about nothing and fighting with each other a lot. I saw what I was doing to my kids, but getting high was more important than taking care of my family.''
Crack has the same effect on all people, said Dr. Lorraine E. Hale, president of Hale House in Harlem, which cares for addicts' babies and tries to find homes for them. ''We see all racial groups, including 8 to 10 percent who come from nice middle-class homes,'' she said. ''Of course, everybody's become poor by the time we see them.''
The one thing crack addicts have in common, she said, is utter disregard for their children: ''I've been working with female drug addicts and their children for 21 years, and I've never seen anything like it.''

HEADLINE: Governor Florio's Budget Bombshell

 BODY:
It took Jim Florio only a few months to admit something he wasn't prepared to concede last fall when he was running for governor: New Jersey needs new taxes. The time has come, Mr. Florio said this week, to confront ''harsh realities and hard decisions.'' He then unveiled a budget with $1.4 billion in tax increases. 
Setting aside the merit of his specific proposals, Governor Florio's bombshell was a refreshing display of candor. It was all the more welcome for its sharp contrast with the behavior of New York's Governor, Mario Cuomo, who has been silent as the Sphinx in the face of mounting deficit projections for his state.
It's hard to believe a politician as experienced and savvy as Jim Florio didn't have an inkling of New Jersey's revenue problems. But when his Republican opponent, Representative Jim Courter, promised not to raise taxes under any circumstances, Mr. Florio countered with his own formula: ''I see no need for new taxes.''
However, as governors throughout the Northeast have discovered, economics has made a mess of revenue projections.
Mr. Florio's plan consists of more than tax increases. He would close a $600 million gap in the current fiscal year by an assortment of spending reductions, ranging from hiring freezes to refinancing of the state's pension system to delaying certain payments to local governments. For the fiscal year starting in July, he proposes reducing spending by an average 15 percent across the board; only prisons and social services would be shielded. At the same time he would raise the state sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and eliminate exemptions for certain products; substantially raise ''sin'' taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and impose a new tax on petroleum products.
The biggest and most explosive change would come next year. Mr. Florio would raise income taxes on people who make more than $55,000, enough to produce $1.25 billion. The money would be used to lighten property taxes for those with incomes under $65,000, to boost aid to poorer school districts and relieve local governments of welfare and social service responsibilities that appropriately belong to the state.
New Jersey has long had punishingly high property tax rates. Mr. Florio's proposed substitution of income taxes is a wise response to persistent demands for relief. And it has the added virtue of being progressive. The proposed sales tax increase is another matter. That will hit hardest at the poorest New Jerseyans - at a time when income supports are to be frozen.
The Legislature will need to chew hard on these proposals before deciding how to dispose of them. But however it ultimately disposes, Mr. Florio deserves praise for having the guts to do what governors are supposed to: lead.

HEADLINE: No Low-Income Catch In Social Security Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I appreciate your acknowledgment in ''Why End Social Security to Save It?'' (editorial, Feb. 22) that my proposal for a system of individual Social Security retirement accounts would end Congressional manipulation of the Social Security Trust Fund and create savings and economic growth, your major objection - that such a system would devastate the retirement benefits of low-income workers - is wrong.
My plan would contain the same skew of payments for low-income retirees as now under Social Security. Minimum benefit funding and the disability program would also continue under the trust fund as now.
Members of minorities, who statistically do not survive to retirement age in the same numbers as whites (and thus collect nothing under the present system), would have in the retirement accounts substantial funds for families and heirs if they die young. Even the lowest-income Americans - those who have never been able to save for retirement - would for the first time have a growing nest egg and a stake in the nation's economy.
I do not dismiss the difficulties involved. But low-income retirees would not suffer, and their benefits are likely to improve.

HEADLINE: Perestroika on the Prairie

BYLINE: By Dick Armey; Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, is on the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The idea of a central committee putting together a five-year plan for agricultural production seems archaic in the age of perestroika. But that's exactly what we are about to see in Congress.
In committee rooms, farm-state Congressmen will soon meet to do some old-fashioned logrolling on the 1990 farm bill. Americans will pay doubly over the next five years for the subsidies, price supports and import barriers traded on the floors of the House and Senate. They'll pay first in taxes and again every time they go to the grocery store. 
In the 1985 farm law, the Government invited farmers to raid a richly stocked pantry. It paid dairy farmers to kill 1.6 million cows and take five-year vacations from farming. It provided incentives to crop farmers to idle 61 million acres of farmland (an area equal to all of Ohio and Indiana plus half of Illinois). Through ''marketing orders'' designed to maintain artificially high prices, it forced fruit growers to destroy three billion oranges, two billion lemons and millions of pounds of raisins. Total cost: about $20 billion a year in taxes and $10 billion a year in higher prices.
Farm programs, unrivaled for their sheer economic absurdity, are fertile ground for serious spending reductions this year. We don't pay truckers not to truck, we don't pay miners not to mine and we shouldn't pay farmers not to farm. Farm policies represent an unparalleled Government war against productivity. They function precisely as if the Government were to pay Detroit to shut down half its auto factories to drive up the price of cars. It's not only enormously costly to taxpayers and consumers, but often to farmers as well.
Farmers who get Federal subsidies gain a competitive advantage over those who don't. To compete, even farmers who detest the idea of going on the dole are forced to scramble for Government handouts. Inept farmers are encouraged to go even further into debt than they would have in the absence of Government assistance. When the Government forecloses, it has to swallow more debt.
Since our agricultural programs encourage farmers to maximize yields rather than minimize costs, they favor corporate farms over family farms. Wealthy farmers can afford the huge combines that allow them to outproduce small farmers. Crop subsidies also raise the value of farmland, which is good for the landowners but bad for the nearly half of American farmers who rent their land. When the Government raises the value of the land, their rents rise.
Programs that pay farmers not to farm often devastate rural areas. The reductions hurt everyone from fertilizer companies to tractor salesmen. According to the Agriculture Department, policies to reduce acreage cost the rural economy 300,000 jobs, and cost the ''farm input'' industry $4 billion in lost sales, in 1987 alone.
If our goal is to help needy farmers, we should do so directly with welfare payments. A leading agricultural economist, Clifton B. Luttrell, estimates that a welfare policy would cost no more than $4 billion a year, less than one-third of what we now spend. Shifting to a direct welfare system would also lower food prices, giving a break to consumers and a much-needed lift to the poor.
Current programs do not distinguish between the needy and the greedy. Eliminating direct payments to farmers with annual adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or more, or gross receipts of $500,000 or more, would target aid to smaller, needier farmers while saving taxpayers around $1 billion a year. No one can justify subsidizing farmers whose incomes are three times the average of the American family of four.
''To destroy a standing crop goes against the soundest instincts of human nature,'' said Henry Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture under Franklin Roosevelt, who instituted many of today's farm programs as ''temporary emergency measures'' 50 years ago. We cannot afford to spend billions of tax dollars and billions more in higher food prices to perpetuate an outdated, inefficient series of five-year plans.
When it takes up this year's farm bill, Congress should keep in mind the interests of taxpayers, consumers and small farmers. We should repeal marketing orders, we should target subsidies to needy farmers and stop paying farmers not to farm.

HEADLINE: Cheney Calls 50% Cut a Risk to Status

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the United States would fall from superpower status if military spending were cut in half over the next decade, as proposed by some military experts.
Mr. Cheney's assessment, which came in a speech to the National Newspaper Association, appeared to be aimed, in part, at William W. Kaufmann, a former Pentagon consultant whose proposals for sharp cuts in the military budget have figured prominently in public debate. One of Mr. Kaufmann's proposals is that the Navy reduce the number of its aircraft carriers by more than half, to 6 from 14. In his speech, Mr. Cheney said: ''When serious people propose cutting the defense budget by half over the next 10 years, leaving us, for example, with a mere six aircraft carriers at sea, they are not talking about simple budget shifts. What they are suggesting is a radical change in our global status.'' 
 
'A Second-Class Power'
''They would give us the defense budget for a second-class power, the budget of an America in decline,'' the Secretary added.
Congressional critics like Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, have charged that Mr. Cheney has been too timid in proposing spending cuts in the wake of the political changes sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
And a recent study in which Mr. Kaufmann, a consultant to several Defense Secretaries in Republican and Democratic administrations, called for a 50 percent reduction in military spending over 10 years has been cited by critics who believe that such cuts should go to domestic programs.
But Mr. Cheney, who has appeared to be on the defensive in the military spending debate, struck back at his critics today, portraying proposals for such far-reaching spending cuts as irresponsible and complaining that the Congressional budget deliberations are being driven by petty politics.
 
Concern for National Strategy
''In Congress, we face the possibility of radical cuts based on nothing save grand compromises over what parochial interests need to be satisfied,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''This willy-nilly approach to defense makes tatters of our national strategy.''
He reaffirmed his position on the future of the Soviet military threat, a position that had put him at odds with William Webster, the director of Central Intelligence, who said recently that the Soviet nonnuclear military threat is fast receding and seems unlikely to reappear in the decade ahead.
''It is too soon to say that the Soviet Union will never again pose a threat to ourselves or our allies,'' said Mr. Cheney. He repeated arguments that the United States can not assume that changes begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will endure.
Since the debate between Mr. Cheney and Mr. Webster over the future Soviet military threat became public two weeks ago, the two men's agencies have sought to discourage reports of major differences between them.
But the thrust of Mr. Cheney's comments ran counter to Mr. Webster's thesis that economic and political pressures will force a decline in the Soviet nonnuclear military threat even if Mr. Gorbachev is deposed and succeeded by hard-line leaders.
 
Two Views on What Is Needed
Mr. Kaufmann, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consultant to the Brookings Institution, did not hesitate to underscore his differences with Mr. Cheney.
''We have differing definitions of what is necessary to our standing as a great power,'' said Mr. Kaufmann, who argued that substantial sums should be diverted to domestic programs to restore the country's economic standing in the world.

HEADLINE: Japan's Latest American Foray

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Japanese financiers are making a strong push to expand their role in financing new office buildings in the United States just as American banks, dismayed by shrinking profit margins and loan losses from a glut of unoccupied buildings, are becoming more cautious and cutting back.
The expansion by Japanese and other foreign banks into real estate lending led Citibank yesterday to announce a revamping of its real estate business to cut back on lending for large projects and concentrate on related fee-producting services. Bankers say they can often earn more from specialized transactions such as interest rate swaps than from direct loans.
As the largest bank in the country, with the largest portfolio of real estate loans, Citibank has not avoided the losses from bad real estate loans that have hit many American banks over the last 18 months. In its annual report, Citibank said it expects the level of bad loans that are not currently paying interest to continue rising in 1990. 
 
Opportunity to Expand
 Already well known in real estate circles as buyers of prestigious office buildings, from Rockefeller Center in New York to the Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, Japanese bankers say they see an opportunity to expand their business and are busy hiring American experts in construction lending.
Included among the new projects they are financing are buildings in Jersey City for Merrill Lynch & Company; an office tower next to Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, and the Park Hyatt Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif.
''There is a real war going on for market share of first-class construction projects between foreign and domestic banks,'' said David Schulman, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''The domestic banks have to decide if they want to fight for the large, high-visibility projects.''
Japanese bank executives recognize that real estate markets are slumping in many parts of the country. But looking ahead to better times, they want to become better established in real estate lending, particularly for new construction, because it can be much more profitable than other areas of bank lending.
And to earn the greatest profits in the few good projects available, Japanese bankers want to take roles as lead banks, rather than continuing to be junior partners of American and other foreign banks. Executives at American and European banks and real estate developers say Japanese bankers will probably succeed.
American bankers facing the stiffer competition from Japanese and other foreign banks say they are handicapped by fear of criticism from Federal bank regulators. Tougher standards by Federal bank examiners on real estate loans forced the Bank of New England Corporation to announce a $1.1 billion loss for 1989.
And other banks around the country have pulled back from real estate lending until they know more about the new standards and there are more signs of stability in real estate prices. These new standards do not apply to branches of Japanese and other foreign banks, greatly improving their ability to attract developers' business.
 
'Alternative Sources'
 Robert F. Upton, a vice president at the New York branch of the Mitsui Bank, said that the contraction of the savings and loan industry was also favoring expansion by Japanese bankers.
''Developers who once worked with savings and loans who are no longer in business will now have to look for alternative sources of credit,'' said Mr. Upton, who joined the bank last October. Japanese banks are already active in making mortgage loans, he said, and are now hiring technical experts who can handle construction lending as well.
Haruhiko Watanabe, vice president in the New York branch of the Fuji Bank, said that the Japanese bank could remain active in real estate financing during the slump because it was a conservative lender during the building boom of the 1980's and avoided the losses now hurting many American banks. ''Even though the market is bad, we think there can be good projects,'' he said.
As Japanese banks gained experience, Mr. Watanabe said, they have received many loan requests from developers who were attracted by the lower interest rates available from Japanese banks.
Henry Elghanayan, owner of the Rockrose Development Corporation, developer of a 60-story office building next to Carnegie Hall on 57th Street in mid-Manhattan, said that Fuji Bank's interest rate on a $125 million construction loan was a percentage point lower than that offered by American banks. ''And Fuji took the entire loan without it being conditioned on their being able to find other participants,'' he added. ''That's something U.S. banks don't do.''
For many years, American banks have welcomed the Japanese as junior members of the lending groups needed to finance large office buildings. Such sharing is likely to continue, bankers said, even though Japanese banks are now competing for the more profitable role of lead bank.
 
Lower Rates for Juniors
 All junior members of lending groups for construction loans, not just Japanese banks, normally find themselves ''scalped,'' collecting a lower interest rate on their loan than the full rate charged to the borrower. The difference, typically five-hundredths to 25-hundredths of a percentage point, is pocketed by the lead bank. In addition, the lead banker usually keeps half or more of the loan commitment fee, which can equal about 1 percent of the total loan.
Although the lead bank has more responsibilities and expenses, such as studying the feasibility of the project and monitoring construction so that money is not paid out faster than needed, the extra payments make the role of lead banker more profitable and very desirable.
''As long as we were going to be involved and exposed to the risk of loss, we decided to do the business as a lead bank, in a way that gives us control over our destiny,'' said Yasuhisa Fujita, deputy general manager at the New York branch of the Tokai Bank Ltd. ''Japanese banks have been regarded as merely funds providers,'' Mr. Fujita said, ''but with the proper people, we can establish ourselves as professionals who can handle all aspects of the business.''
Mr. Fujita said Tokai planned to increase its American commercial real estate lending, including construction loans, by three or four times this year, but he declined to identify a dollar goal.
 
Americans Hired
 To guide the expansion, the Japanese bank last year hired Kevin J. Mulvaney and Bruce F. Evans, two Americans with construction-lending experience at other banks. Among Tokai's early construction-lending efforts was co-managing with the Bank of Montreal a $180 million loan for an office building at 101 Hudson Street in Jersey City, where Merrill Lynch will move much of its back-office operations.
Stephen W. Laver, a principal at the Trammel Crow Group, a real estate development firm, said Japanese lenders were involved to some degree in almost every Trammel Crow project. Rather than merely joining lending groups managed by others, he said, ''the Japanese banks are increasingly developing a direct-lending ability.''
One aspect where Japanese banks can be especially effective, he said, is in attracting money from other Japanese investors who want to own or make long-term investments in American buildings. Japanese regional banks, about three dozen of which have American offices, have money to invest but do not have the personnel to originate their own loans. They are prime candidates to participate in loans managed by larger banks like Tokai, Mr. Fujita said.
 
Reputation for Price-Cutting
 In an effort to improve profitablity - an area where Japanese banks lag far behind competitors from other parts of the world - some Japanese bankers are trying to shed the image as price-cutters.
''Profits in construction lending are already shrinking due to price competition, and we do not aim to aggravate that situation by competing for new deals on price,'' said Mr. Mulvaney of the Tokai Bank. ''Our pricing plan is to be the equal of American banks. We would rather do half as many deals if it meant the profit margins would be twice as high.''
As Japanese bankers push for more business, real estate experts are wondering if the Japanese can avoid the losses incurred by some savings and loan associations that reached for the profits of construction lending but ended up making too many bad loans.
Japanese bankers vow that they will be cautious. But the real estate market has been treacherous, even for the most experienced American banks.
''The near-term outlook for real estate is not positive,'' the Real Estate Research Corporation said in the 1990 edition of Emerging Trends in Real Estate. With domestic banks and insurance companies awash in bad loans, it said, ''increasingly active foreign banks might look at the carcasses before they try to pick up the slack.''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Unchanged in February

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
After posting the biggest increase in more than 15 years in January, producer prices were unchanged last month, the Labor Department said today.
Analysts attributed the 1.8 percent surge in January almost entirely to the effect of the harsh December weather on food and fuel. The flat figure in February stemmed from the milder weather early this year, they said.
''This confirms the fact that January was an aberration,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members pay the prices used in calculating the Producer Price Indexes. 
With other statistics released today, the producer price figures indicated that inflationary pressures had abated. A Federal Reserve report said industrial production was up six-tenths of a percent in February, less than had been expected, and the Commerce Department reported that housing starts were down 7 percent last month. [Page 34.] ''If good news is low inflation, then the February numbers are good news,'' Mr. Van Dongen said.
The financial markets had little reaction to the report, which was generally in line with expectations. But in the credit markets, Treasury securities advanced sharply in response to the industrial-production report, which was weaker than expected and indicates that the Federal Reserve will be less inclined to try to contain inflation by making borrowing more difficult.
Economists cautioned against drawing conclusions from one month's figures. The so-called core prices, which exclude the widely fluctuating energy and food prices, rose by four-tenths of 1 percent last month, close to the average monthly increase over the last year.
Thus, few economists expect the Federal Open Market Committee to raise or lower interest rates when the Federal Reserve policy makers meet the week after next.
''It's too hard to get a firm reading on the economy right now,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at the First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia. He also said the lack of change in prices charged by producers last month was a further indication that a slowdown in economic activity late last year would be reflected in lower inflation this year.
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said he read the figures as showing that the underlying inflation rate was still between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, where it has been for the last several years. Still, he said of the producer price numbers, ''This wasn't bad news.''
The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, the most widely watched of today's statistics, was unchanged in February. The prices of intermediate goods fell by seven-tenths of a percent, and the price of crude goods rose by four-tenths of a percent.
Finished goods are those ready for sale to retailers; intermediate goods are partly finished items that require further processing or completed items that are parts of other products. Crude goods are those entering the production chain for the first time. For example, raw cotton is a crude good, a bolt of cloth is an intermediate good and a suit of clothes is a finished good.
 
Influence of the Weather
 Energy prices fell by 5 percent last month after a 13.6 percent increase in January. The change in weather was mostly responsible for the fluctuation. For example, fuel oil prices rose 25.3 percent in January and fell 30.2 percent in February. Gasoline prices rose 3.2 percent in January and fell 2.3 percent last month.
Food prices rose by nine-tenths of a percent, much less than the 2.1 percent rise in January, which was the largest monthly increase in six years. But the effect of the December freeze was still being felt. The index for fresh and dried vegetables soared 23.3 percent, following a 58 percent surge in January.
The index for finished goods now stands at 117.4, with 1982 equaling 100. That means a basket of goods that cost $100 wholesale in 1982 now costs $117.40.

HEADLINE: A 'Witching' Lift Pushes Dow Up 45.50

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks rallied strongly in spirited trading yesterday for the week's best gain by far, with the much-anticipated ''triple witching hour'' playing a significant role.
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 45.50 points for the day and 57.89 for the week to close at 2,741.22. It was the strongest gain since Jan. 31, when the industrials rose 47.30, to 2,590.54.
After four straight days of exceptionally slow trading, volume rose sharply to 222.5 million shares, from 144.4 million the day before, with a solid 884 stocks advancing and only 591 declining. 
 
Big Takeover Move
 And in an added attraction to an already busy day, Wall Street got a taste of its first big unsolicited takeover move in a long time.
BTR P.L.C., the British industrial giant, offered to pay $75 a share, or $1.6 billion, for Norton, the American abrasives company. In what appeared to be a sign that traders liked the deal, Norton rose to the No. 2 spot on the New York Stock Exchange most active list, surging 16 5/8, to 74 7/8, or just under the offering price, with 5.2 million shares changing hands. Norton said it would consider the bid.
Still, traders were not yet willing to believe that the heavy buying on the Big Board, particularly in blue chips, came from the big financial institutions and other ''real buyers.'' Many felt that much of the activity, particularly toward the end of the day, represented professional traders transferring into stocks and out of investment positions that expired yesterday at what has come to be known as the triple witching hour.
In the last 10 minutes before the closing bell at 4 P.M., the heavy rush to buy pushed the Dow up its final 10 points.
Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''It's very encouraging that the market held its gain, but traders are skeptical that it'll carry over to next week because it happened on a triple witching day.''
 
Blue-Chip Best Sellers
 Orders from traders looking for blue chips catapulted several companies onto the most-active list, with General Electric up 3/4, to 64, on volume of 2.9 million shares; A.T.&T. up 3/4, to 41 7/8, on 2.7 million; I.B.M. up 1 5/8, to 108 5/8, on 2.6 million; General Motors off 1/8, to 47 1/2, on 2.5 million; Exxon up 5/8, to 47 1/2, on 2.4 million, and American Express, the last of the 10 most active, up 3/8, to 28 3/8, with 2.1 million shares changing hands. Buying in just the 10 most active accounted for 30 million shares.
Trading in the key 30-stock industrials pushed the Dow up right from the start, and except for a couple of dips early in the day, it continued up.
Along with the pep that the witching hour pumped into the market, traders accepted new economic indicators on producer prices, industrial output and housing starts as further evidence that the economy is mending slowly - but not enough to drive investors out of the stock market and into bonds in search of better returns.
Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, said: ''The stock market interpreted the economic numbers positively, that the economy is still moving ahead slowly. But the preponderance of advisers and money managers are still cautious to negative on stocks for the year and feel that bonds are better values.''
Among the best and broadest gainers yesterday were computer and other high-technology stocks, particular in the Nasdaq market, where strong buying lifted volume to 176.04 million shares, the highest this year and up from 128.68 million on Thursday.
Cobe Laboratories, a medical services company, jumped 15, to 36 1/4, with 3.1 million shares changing hands in the Nasdaq market. Gambro A.B. of Sweden, a designer of blood systems, offered to buy it for $37 a share, or $240 million.
The common stock of Intel, the maker of semiconductor memory circuits, rose 2 1/8, to 42 1/2, on 6.5 million shares, pushing it to the top of the Nasdaq most-active list. Intel warrants jumped 3 5/8, to 23 3/4, on 1.1 million shares. Craig Barrett, executive vice president, said at a technical conference that plans were well under way to raise output of a new chip.
Highly favorable comments on earnings by Intel, Compaq Computer and Apple Computer helped lift almost the entire computer list, with I.B.M. up 1 5/8, to 108 5/8; Digital Equipment 1 1/4, to 77 1/2; Compaq 2, to 98 7/8; Apple 3 1/2, to 40 1/4; Hewlett-Packard 1 1/8, to 45 1/8; Tandem Computers 1, to 29; Automatic Data Processing 1 1/2, to 53 3/8; Microsoft 3, to 114, and Sun Microsystems 1, to 25. Cray Research fell 1 1/4, to 46 1/2.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Housing starts fell 7 percent in February but remained well above the level of the last 11 months of 1989, the Government reported today. Analysts said the building pace could not be sustained.
''The pace of activity in January and February is higher than we can expect over the course of the year,'' said Thomas Holloway, senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''We're probably borrowing a few starts from later in the year because of the warmer weather.'' 
New single-family houses and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.48 million units in February, the Commerce Department said. That followed a 24.7 percent jump in the warmest January on record, the biggest increase since a 29.3 percent gain in July 1982. The January figure was revised downward from the 29.6 percent advance reported last month.
 
Warm Weather
 Temperatures remained above normal in February, and although housing starts fell from January's 1.59-million-unit level, they remained higher than those of any month last year except for the 1.66 million units started in January 1989.
The increase in new construction was entirely in the single-family sector, which rose 5.1 percent, to an annual rate of 1.17 million units. It was the highest level since a 1.19-million-unit rate in January 1989.
''The fact that single-family starts were up in February bodes well for activity in the coming months,'' with mortgage rates expected to go lower, said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.
Multifamily starts plummeted 35 percent, to an annual rate of 266,000, after rising 40 percent the previous month.
Analysts said the January pace resulted both from the weather and from builders' desire to get construction under way before new regulations go into effect to make apartments more accessible to the handicapped.
The new rules could add $3,000 to the cost of multifamily units, said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said a high vacancy rate also contributed to the multifamily weakness.
The Northeast posted the biggest gain in overall starts, up 24.4 percent, to an annual rate of 219,000 units. It was followed by a 14.8 percent jump in the South, to 604,000 units.
Starts in the Midwest declined 29 percent, to an annual rate of 271,000 units, and fell 24 percent in the West, to 383,000 units.
Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing activity, fell 25 percent after a 26.8 percent gain in January. The decline was the largest on record.

HEADLINE: Output Rises On Strength In Vehicles

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The nation's industrial output rose six-tenths of a percent in February, the Government reported today, but the increase reflected a resumption of automobile production and practically no strengthening elsewhere.
''Growth in industrial production has flattened out,'' said Kevin Logan, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. ''It's not a recession; it's not a decline; it's just very sluggish.'' 
Thousands of auto workers who were laid off in January as manufacturers trimmed bloated inventories returned to production lines in February and contributed nearly all of the increase in industrial output, the Federal Reserve reported.
''Excluding motor vehicles and related industries, production was little changed,'' it said.
The Fed also reported that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities, which usually moves in tandem with industrial production, rose three-tenths of a percentage point, to 82.3 percent, in February. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels.
 
Bland Numbers
 ''These numbers are basically bland,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Fugi Securities Inc. in Chicago. ''Without the returning automobile workers, there wasn't any growth.''
Output had fallen 1 percent in January, a revision from the 1.2 percent originally reported. That followed slim gains of one-tenth of a percent and three-tenths of a percent in December and November.
''I think that January was the low point,'' Michael P. Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said. But he added that he expected no growth soon.
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rebounded seven-tenths of a percent in February from a decline of seven-tenths of a percent in January.
Output in durable manufacturing also rebounded 1.4 percent after a 1.5 percent drop the previous month. But nondurable manufacturing dipped two-tenths of a percent after rising four-tenths of a percent in January.
Mining output fell five-tenths of a percent in February, reflecting a drop in coal production, the Fed said. It had gained 2.5 percent in January. Utility output was down eight-tenths of a percent after a 10.6 percent drop in January.
The Fed said its industrial production index in February stood at 141.8 percent of its 1977 base, up from 141 percent in January.
In its report on capacity utilization, the nation's central bank said the three-tenths of a percentage point gain resulted from the auto sector.
''Utilization rates in most other manufacturing industries, as well as mining and utilities, declined in February,'' the report said.
The operating rate at manufacturing plants rose to 82.4 percent in February from 82 percent the previous month.
The rate at factories producing durable goods - items expected to last more than three years - was up to 80.5 percent, from 79.6 percent in January. But the rate at factories producing nondurable goods was down from 85.5 percent in January to 85 percent last month.
The operating rate at mines slipped to 84.4 percent, from 84.8 percent in January, while it fell seven-tenths of a percentage point, to 77.3 percent, at utilities.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Gain on Economic News

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury securities market advanced sharply yesterday on further signs of weakness in the economy's manufacturing sector, which would give the Federal Reserve little incentive to tighten credit.
The Government reported a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in industrial production in February, and initially that caused a brief spate of selling after the opening, but further examination of the report, which showed a lower-than-expected rise, touched off a rebound in prices.
Dealers said the advance gathered strength on heavy buying of Treasury bond futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. The Chicago buyers were mostly speculators who had sold the futures short in the hope of profiting from a drop in bond prices when they bought them back. But bond prices were strong all day. 
 
Long Bond Up 28/32
 Late in the session, the benchmark Treasury long bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, were being offered at 99 21/32, up 28/32 on the day. The long bond's yield dropped to 8.53 percent, from 8.61 percent the day before and 8.62 percent a week ago.
In Chicago, where bond futures trading ends at 3 P.M., Eastern standard time, the spot March Treasury bond futures contract, which expires next Wednesday, settled at 93 2/32, up 21/32 on the day.
''Despite the price rise, there was little cheering in the market,'' one dealer said, ''mainly because institutional and other retail buyers were absent from the market. While we did not expect the retail buyers to chase after the market, their absence tells us they expect prices to come back down quickly. Also troubling is that the Street has shifted heavily from being short the market to the buy side. So we can't count on further buying by the shorts to support prices.''
 
Yields Even More Inverted
 Meanwhile, yields on Treasury notes became even more inverted relative to bonds. The 8.5 percent notes of 1992, for example, rose 4/32, to 99 26/32, for a yield of 8.60 percent; the 8.5's of 1995 climbed 12/32, to 99 19/32, for a yield of 8.58 percent.
Francis A. Scotland, managing editor of the International Bank Credit Analyst, Montreal, said: ''We can expect United States short-term rates to rise further as they continue to reflect rising overseas interest rates, particularly in West Germany, where the economy, spurred by the rapid moves toward unification with East Germany, is booming. Consequently, the demand for credit there is tremendous, a factor that is also driving up rates elsewhere in Europe.''
Mr. Scotland said he expected Japanese monetary authorities to raise interest rates as soon as their unsettled stock and bond markets stabilized.
''One reason United States interest rates are becoming more and more influenced by overseas interest rates is that as a debtor nation it has to respond to the money market conditions of its creditors,'' he added.
 
German and Japanese Bonds
 At the close yesterday, the yield on Japan's 10-year bonds, the longest maturity, had risen to 7.21 percent, from 7.17 percent a week ago. The yield on West Germany's comparable 10-year bonds dropped to 8.66 percent, from 8.92 percent in the previous week, but that was still above the yield on the Treasury's long notes. The yield on the Treasury's 8.5's of the year 2000 fell to 8.56 percent, from 8.63 percent a week ago. The price of the long notes soared 16/32, or a half-point, to 99 18/32. A point is equivalent to $10 for each $1,000 of face value.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on 90-day bills fell 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.91 percent; the six-month bills slipped 3 basis points, to 7.85 percent, and the one-year bills dipped 3 basis points, to 7.75 percent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from intervening in the money market for the fourth consecutive day this week, perhaps because the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans slipped to 8 3/16 percent, from the Fed's perceived target of 8.25 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Brazil's Economic Changes Depress the Price of Coffee

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of coffee futures fell sharply yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after the new President of Brazil announced sweeping economic changes. Traders said the plan was likely to increase the sale of Brazilian coffee.
The economic package was also linked to a decline in the price of soybean futures and to a sharp rise in sugar futures, although analysts conceded that the effects of the measures were difficult to interpret. 
Coffee futures settled 5 cents to 6 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in March at 89.50 cents a pound.
The changes outlined yesterday by President Fernando Collor de Mello included abolition of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, introduction of a new currency with free-floating foreign exchange rates and limits on bank withdrawals, all of which were seen as encouraging producers and exporters to sell more coffee.
Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, has been withholding supplies from the market. This has helped to lift coffee futures prices to eight-month highs.
Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the selloff in coffee futures also reflected disappointment about what Mr. Collor did not say.
''The market was perhaps looking for a very constructive statement from the new Brazilian Government, and that statement was not forthcoming,'' Mr. Stevenson said.
Concerns about the new Brazilian currency also prompted selling of soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. Brazil is the largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans settled 4 1/2 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with March delivery at $5.81 3/4 a bushel.
Sugar futures surged in New York, settling 0.19 cent to 0.39 cent higher, with the May contract at 16.13 cents a pound. Traders expect Brazil to curtail exports and divert more of its sugar cane to its extensive fuel-alcohol program.
Petroleum futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders took their profits.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens as Traders Await East German Voting

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined yesterday against most foreign currencies, with buyers focusing on the Swiss franc and West German mark.
Currency dealers said a pessimistic attitude toward the dollar prevailed in the foreign exchange markets. Interest in trading dollars slackened in the afternoon in New York, which is typical before a weekend. 
Traders are usually reluctant to establish significant new positions on Fridays, fearing that developments over the weekend could affect currency values. This was especially true yesterday because of the parliamentary elections set for Sunday in East Germany.
There has been speculation that the West German mark will strengthen next week if the East German elections signal a quickening pace toward German reunification.
As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6980 West German marks, down from 1.6990 marks late Thursday.
A batch of statistics about the performance of the United States economy in February furnished fresh evidence of weakness. But analysts said the reports did not suggest any imminent change in the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates. A shift could influence the dollar's value against other currencies.
Marc Chandler, a currency market analyst at MMS International in Chicago, said stronger demand for Swiss francs also caused dollar selling. The dollar fell to 1.5095 Swiss francs in late New York trading, from 1.5180 late Thursday.
Mr. Chandler said the Japanese yen remained the weakest of the leading currencies, because interest rates in that country have remained stable. Many currency traders had expected Japanese rates to rise.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar traded at 152.65 Japanese yen, compared with 152.29 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.50 yen, up from 152.47. In London late yesterday, the dollar closed higher, at 152.30 yen.
Also in London, a British pound cost $1.6235 late yesterday, more expensive for buyers than $1.6177 late Thursday. Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.6190, down from $1.6215 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Thursday quotes, included: 5.736 French francs, down from 5.7415; 1,253.00 Italian lire, down from 1,255.00, and 1.18285 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18085.
As the dollar declined, both gold and silver prices rose.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery settled at $399.60 an ounce, up $1.50 from Thursday. In New York, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid for an ounce of gold at $400 as of 4 P.M., up $1.80 from the late bid Thursday.
In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.093 an ounce, up from $5.079 Thursday.

HEADLINE: BUSH IS REPORTED READY TO RETREAT ON MILITARY MONEY

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Faced with widespread pressure from Congress and elsewhere, the Bush Administration has decided to retreat on the 1991 military budget and accept cuts almost as large as those that lawmakers are urging, senior Government officials say.
With no changes in programs, inflation would push next year's budget to $306 billion. In January the Administration proposed cutting $3.2 billion from that baseline. Now the officials say the Administration has decided to accept a reduction about triple that. Such a cut, $10 billion or $11 billion, would mean that the Pentagon would have to absorb the costs of inflation, since the dollar level of spending would be about the same as this year's.
 
Goals for a New Era
The decision comes as a critical development in an unfolding debate about the strategic goals and proper spending levels for the armed forces in the new era inaugurated by the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact as a military entity. As such, the debate, though still unfocused, has provided a first opportunity to see how changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe may affect the shape of American military and budget policy. 
For the coming year, sentiment among Congressional Democrats, as well as some Republicans, appears to be coalescing around a reduction of $12 billion or possibly $13 billion from the baseline figure of $306 billion - 1990 military outlays of $296 billion plus about $10 billion in inflation and previously committed projects. All the savings would go toward meeting the deficit-reduction target set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
 
Present and Potential Threats
Senior officials said in recent interviews that the Administration was ready to acquiesce in a reduction of nearly the size the lawmakers are proposing, realizing that it would have to give considerable ground to win Congressional approval.
There is no such consensus on how much the nation should spend in the longer term for the armed forces and on what. But William W. Kaufmann of Harvard University, a consultant to Defense Secretaries in Republican and Democratic administrations, has said military spending could safely be halved by the year 2000, and while a few politicians, generals and theorists have expressed alarm about that figure, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the centrist Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, said, ''I don't dispute it.''
There is also impassioned argument, of course, about what to do with the ''peace dividend'' that may well be created in the next four to five years.
But in the rush to slash military spending, attention is only now turning to the overarching question of how the armed forces should be organized in the future to address present and potential threats like nuclear terrorism originating in smaller countries, the drug trade, Soviet strategic weapons and limited wars.
President Bush had proposed a cut of about $3.2 billion in 1991 outlays, to $303 billion. But that figure has been dismissed in recent days as far too small, even by Republican conservatives like Senator John McCain of Arizona, a member of the Armed Services Committee, and by experts on military spending like Lawrence J. Korb of the Brookings Institution, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower in the Reagan Administration.
''The Administration is behind the curve,'' Senator McCain said in a recent interview. ''The fact is that we all know, beyond any possible doubt, that the Soviet Union isn't about to launch an attack.''
Referring to the Bush Administration's budget proposal, he added: ''But their budget doesn't reflect that. If they don't move, Congress will define the issue.''
 
A Seismic Shift In Official Opinion
 Underlying the changing attitudes on spending is a seismic shift in the way most of Washington now sees the Soviet Union and its allies. If there was one moment at which it became clear that opinion had turned, it was in the testimony of William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, on Capitol Hill on March 1. ''There is little chance that Soviet hegemony could be restored in Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Webster said. ''Marxist-Leninist ideology is now bankrupt. In addition, Communist parties will continue to lose legitimacy and strength, except perhaps in a small number of backward, isolated nations.''
A senior White House official, who spoke on the condition that he not be quoted by name, described the ''irreversibility'' of change in the Soviet Union as the major development that has made deeper spending cuts possible.
''It's not perestroika or Gorbachev that has changed our needs,'' the official said, ''but the fact that the Soviets aren't going to plow through countries that are unfriendly to them in order to get at Europe. Where we had enemies, we now have a big fat buffer in Poland and Czechoslovakia.''
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is still fighting the emerging consensus that 1991 outlays should be held to about $296 billion, or even a little less, and President Bush's reported conclusion that he has little choice but to go along.
''If the cuts are at that level, and it looks as if they are going to be,'' Mr. Cheney said in a telephone interview, ''then there's going to be real trouble. You can't lop off $10 billion without cutting back on personnel or on readiness. You'll end up hollowing out the forces, making them undermanned, undertrained, ineffective, which is what everyone says they want to avoid.''
But domestic budgetary and political questions are at work in the debate, as well as issues of grand strategy and weaponry, and Mr. Cheney appears to be playing a less significant role than Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
''The guy who's driving this train is Darman,'' said Mr. Korb. ''Bush will catch up, after he's calmed down the right wing, but Cheney won't.''
James R. Schlesinger, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon in the mid-70's, made the same point in a more oblique fashion. ''I worry a good bit about any tendency to deny that substantial change has taken place, and that it requires major adjustments on our part,'' he said. ''If an agency denies this, it is in real danger of becoming irrelevant to the whole discussion.''
 
Down to Specifics: Crunching the Numbers
 The Gramm-Rudman target for 1991 will require savings of about $36 billion in the overall budget, domestic and military. If Congress and the White House cannot agree on a formula, the process known as sequestration would come into play, lopping $18 billion from domestic programs and $18 billion from military ones. So as a practical matter, $18 billion has been seen as the maximum feasible cut for the 1991 military budget. By proposing the $11 billion figure, the Administration could be trying to forestall the larger cut and avoid the Congressional gridlock that could lead to sequestration.
Another element in the discussion is technical rather than political. Reductions in actual outlays can be quickly achieved only by cutting categories like personnel strength and training and maintenance, and this is why Mr. Cheney is nervous about them. Cuts in spending on new weapons systems take longer to bite, because much of the spending has already been authorized.
According to figures compiled by Mr. Aspin's staff, for example, even wholesale cancellation of major programs -the MX missile, the Midgetman missile, the B-2 bomber, a new tactical fighter, a new helicopter for the Army and the new Amraam long-range air-to-air missile - would save only $2.3 billion in 1991. But it would save $29.2 billion over the three years 1992-94.
Neither Mr. Aspin nor Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the influential Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, has named a figure for the level of cutback he favors, and Mr. Nunn declined to be interviewed for this article. Few if any lawmakers have given a detailed outline of strategic goals that could be used to determine spending levels.
But some in Congress have made no secret of the levels they favor, and they range from the $3 billion cut favored by Senator Phil Gramm, the conservative Republican from Texas, through the $13 billion cut proposed by Senator Jim Exon, a defense-minded Democratic conservative from Nebraska, the $15 billion cut proposed by Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, to the cut of almost $21 billion that has been put forward by Barney Frank, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.
But at a meeting this week, House Democrats moved toward agreement on a cut in the rough area of $12 billion to $14 billion for the coming year, with bigger cuts in subsequent years. That is not far below the level favored by Mr. Sasser, and it is not far above the $10 billion to $11 billion the White House is now apparently prepared to accept. It is also about the same figure put forward for next year in a telephone interview by Mr. Kaufmann, the author of a Brookings Institution study, ''Glasnost, Perestroika and U.S. Defense Spending.''
 
Now, the Hard Part: When Cuts Hit Home
 Setting the overall spending level is easier than deciding exactly what to cut, and that is easier than forcing those cuts through Congress. All weapons are made in someone's district and most troops contribute to some local economy, so getting votes in particular is harder than getting them in general.
''At that point, to be blunt, you are dealing with pork, self-interest and local politics,'' said an Administration official. ''Geopolitics and grand strategy take a back seat.''
Mr. Cheney, who went to the Pentagon from the House of Representatives, said: ''There's a certain amount of hypocrisy on the part of some of my former colleagues. They all want to chop away at the defense budget without cutting anything in their districts.''
Mr. Sasser said his plan would eliminate three active Army divisions, to 15 from 18; the Administration initially proposed reducing the number to 16. He would also eliminate two of 36 tactical fighter wings and one of 14 aircraft carrier battle groups.
He and most other Democrats also favor scaling back production of the B-2 bomber, known as the Stealth; huge reductions in the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative, which Mr. Bush has already trimmed from the grandiose project developed in the Reagan Administration, and cancellation of the MX missile.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, said in an interview two months ago that he doubted seriously that two mobile missile systems, the MX and the Midgetman, could survive; this week, a top Administration official said he agreed that both were in trouble and suggested that both might be scuttled in the new atmosphere generated by recent events in Eastern Europe.
''None of this constitutes any threat to our national security,'' Mr. Sasser argued, ''unless you plan to take the B-2 and bomb Colonel Qaddafi's tent with the darned thing.''
Hyperbole aside, many of those concerned with future challenges for the nation's armed forces are thinking about the Libyan leader and others like him - their countries once marginal in the global power game, but now made more worrisome by the new technology of violence.
Senator McCain, together with his more liberal Republican colleague, Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, is working on a budget and strategy of their own, Mr. McCain said, ''since no one else seems to be.''
''What worries me,'' he said, ''is that instead of the light, mobile, readily deployable high-tech military that we're going to need, instead of something designed to deal with things like new trouble in the Persian Gulf or a Qaddafi with chemical or nuclear weapons or even a civil war generated by nationalism in Yugoslavia, we'll just get proportionate cuts in everything.''
The son and grandson of admirals, himself a former naval aviator, Mr. McCain added: ''You know how they are over there in the Pentagon, those generals and admirals: 'You cut your tanks a third and I'll cut my planes a third.' That's not a recipe at all for defense in the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: American Politics Loses Way As Polls Supplant Leadership

SERIES: The Trouble With Politics: Running vs. Governing - First of four articles.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
As America's democratic visions and values seem to triumph around the world, an unhappy consensus has emerged at home that domestic politics has become so shallow, mean and even meaningless that it is failing to produce the ideas and leadership needed to guide the United States in a rapidly changing world.
''We've tended to trivialize issues to the point where meaningful debate has become almost impossible,'' Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, said in a recent interview.
Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said, ''We've got a kind of politics of irrelevance, of obscurantism, that is more prevalent than in any time I can recall.'' Politicians think the problem has only deepened since his disastrous effort to talk about tax increases in the 1984 Presidential campaign.
 
Crippling Superstructure
This unhappiness about modern politics is more than mere nostalgia for some idyllic past that never was. Politicians in both parties say government is being crippled by a new superstructure of politics that makes ideas harder to discuss and exalts public opinion over leadership. 
This is a time when the two basic tenets of American government for nearly half a century -the New Deal and military containment of the Soviet Union - no longer hold, when the end of the Cold War has left struggling democracies across the once-Communist world and fundamental questions at home about the need for a military budget of $300 billion. But the American political system is unable even to define and debate critical questions, let alone resolve them.
As the United States searches for leadership on problems from stagnant labor productivity to soaring health care costs, a Congressman is warned by his political consultant not to make a speech calling for a huge cut in the military budget because he would be moving ahead of public opinion. As use of foreign oil rises again, the political system has abandoned even discussion of nuclear power as an alternative to pollution-producing fossil fuels.
In the past, when a President failed to seize the initiative, Congress often tried to. But now both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue seem immobilized by a politics of avoidance, where poll takers and advertising producers are more influential than economists or engineers.
 
Four Chief Fears of Politicians
Instead of responding to changes in the world, the officials elected to lead the nation say they live each day in fear of the four horsemen of modern politics: televised attacks by their opponents, intense personal scrutiny by the press, cynicism on the part of the public and the need to raise huge sums to buy television time to combat the attacks, scrutiny and cynicism.
None of these problems is altogether new. But politicians say their combined impact, and particularly the force of television on both politics and on the culture in general, have reinforced each other to derail the wheels of Government.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, a veteran legislator respected in both parties as a student of the institutions of government, described the problem this way: ''When the main question in a member's mind every time he votes is, 'What kind of a 30-second spot are they going to make out of this vote?' then truly the ability of the political system to make complicated and tough decisions in the long-range interest of the United States is atomized.''
Trivialization. Atomization. Paralysis. These words have become the descriptive vocabulary on which members of both parties draw to describe the state of politics and government in America. The Democrats blame President Bush for crippling budget talks with his campaign-driven ''read my lips'' tax policy. But John H. Sununu, who helped orchestrate Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign, is equally unhappy now as he sees from his post as White House chief of staff that ''sound bite'' politics has made lawmakers, as he put it, less ''willing to take innovative stands or distinct positions or stand on principle.''
The political fear of tampering with benefits for the elderly, which many lawmakers feel is where the Government could save money, was revealed in a joke making the rounds of the Republican cloakroom on Capitol Hill after a proposal to eliminate the deficit by cutting Social Security cost-of-living increases, among other things. ''Social Security is the third rail of American politics,'' went the joke. ''Touch it and you die.''
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader of the House and a 1988 Democratic Presidential candidate, tried last week to make a partisan issue out of what he said was President Bush's failure of leadership in foreign policy. The President, Mr. Gephardt said, is doing nothing to explain the changes in the world to the American people, who remain uncertain and confused.
 
Democrats Face Position Troubles
Many Republicans concede that Mr. Bush has offered what Kevin Phillips, the Republican analyst, describes as ''a follow-up Presidency,'' evidencing little creativity on either making foreign policy or solving social problems.
But both Democrats and Republican agree with Mr. Phillips's conclusion that there has been, in his words, a larger political failure, a general ''cerebral atrophy'' among opinion leaders and an inability by the Democrats to state their positions in any way that forces the Republicans to respond.
''Europe is about to establish a truly integrated trading system with major consequences for our own economy,'' a plaintive Mr. Obey said in a recent speech. ''Japanese industries are challenging America's for world economic leadership. Are not these challenges, along with the challenge of homelessness, rootlessness and second-rate educational performance sufficiently profound to demand a vigorous, honest and substantive debate between and within both parties about how they should be met? Is American politics so brain-dead that we are reduced to having political shysters manipulate symbols?''
There was considerable uneasiness on Capitol Hill when the most eloquent statement of the nation's role in the post-Cold War world came not from one of the elected representatives of the American people, but from a playwright and former Communist political prisoner, Vaclav Havel. Addressing a joint session in his new job as President of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Havel put it this way:
''As long as people are people, democracy in the full sense of the word will always be no more than an ideal. One may approach it as one would a horizon, in ways that may be better or worse, but it can never be fully attained.
''In this sense you, too, are merely approaching democracy. You have thousands of problems of all kinds, as other countries do. But you have one great advantage: You have been approaching democracy uninterrupted for more than 200 years.''
How would this thoughtful and subtle man fare in an election here?
''How much money does he have?'' replied Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is one of his party's most outspoken critics of the way politics are practiced in the United States. ''Which consultant does he have? And is he willing to shave his mustache? Issues are not the problem, son. We're talking image. If you've got $2 million I can guarantee it.''
Cynicism by citizens toward politicians is hardly new. What is striking is the unanimity among the consumers and practitioners of politics, and how the practitioners, even as they bemoan the process they foster, are feeding the cynicism back to the consumers.
One measure of the general concern is that more than a score of institutions, including groups like the Ford Foundation and the American Bar Association, have undertaken studies based on the belief that American democracy is not working the way it should.
 
Range of Possible Improvements
Across the country, in speeches, symposiums, reports, as well as scores of interviews, a wide range of possible improvements have been offered, from lowering the remaining voter registration barriers to giving candidates free television time.
A group of present and former elected officials, including former Senators Barry Goldwater, the Arizona Republican, and William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat, have organized what they call the Center for National Independence in Politics. Its purpose is to provide voters with impartial information on candidates and their positions on issues to counteract trivial or negative campaigns.
No doubt some of the state of American politics is simply that the tides of history are running faster elsewhere. ''We are in a sorting-out period,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, ''in which the Republicans and the conservative movement are trying to figure out what phase two is'' after President Ronald Reagan. As for the Democrats, he added, they ''are trying to figure out how they create a new start.''
 
Sense of Alarm and Dismay
There is also a view that the nation will again awake when confronted with some crisis. But among politicians working in the world of today, a sense of alarm, dismay and disgust pervades. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, says he was motivated by sheer frustration at the budget deficit deadlock when he proposed his plan of tax increases, spending cuts and spending freezes last week.
The Administration hinted it might talk about taxes. But politics are so poisoned these days that Democrats responded as if invited for a walk on an ice-crusted lake.
Such suspicions contribute to the sour mood in national politics. There is the liberal legislator who complains that even other Democrats fear that talking about deep military spending cuts will lead them to be labeled as weak; there is the conservative law clerk who says he is afraid to publish law review articles because they will be used to attack him later.
The Republican Party chairman, Lee Atwater, widely regarded as a popularizer of slash-and-burn political tactics, says the real problem is a public attitude that can be summed up in three words: ''Bull permeates everything.''
 
The System
 
Bogged Down In Big Business
 The American system was not designed for effeciency, with its diffusion of power and its checks and balances. The question is, Has a new force been added that has overwhelmed the balancing mechanisms?
Winning elections has become a business, a big business with professional associations and magazines, where volunteers have been replaced by computer-assisted polling, the pamphlet by the television spot. This has driven up the cost of politics sharply. More than half a billion dollars will be spent on races for the House and Senate this year, nearly a tenfold increase over 1974. The cost of running for governor, state legislature or even city council has also soared.
A Republican consultant, Don Sipple, warns that Washington is now the seat of a ''political-industrial complex,'' a play on President Dwight D. Eisenhower's warning about the dangers of a ''military-industrial complex.''
Political dialogue and decisions are made up of the actions, large and small, of thousands of independent political figures. The intimidating and expensive quality of modern politics has made each of them a little more cautious, politicans say. When each small decision to be careful instead of controversial is added together, they say, the sum total is a major impact on political debate.
 
System Called Money-Driven
''It tends to homogenize the process,'' said Mickey Kantor, a lawyer who has long been active in California and national Democratic Party politics. ''It tends to make it money-driven. It takes the ideology out of it. It stifles creativity and strong stands, all of which is not good for the country.''
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, says the flow of campaign money ''tends to keep you locked in to your views.''
On Capitol Hill, stories abound about how the professional techniques of modern politics discourage government action and even debate, or lead to ill-conceived action. ''When it comes to dealing with the budget,'' Robert Strauss, the former Democratic national chairman, said in Senate testimony last month, ''the political process has become somewhere between timid and irrelevant.''
Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon, offered an example of how the new breed of political professionals discourages debate. He said he drafted a speech in which he wanted to call for a 50 percent cut in the military budget to produce money for domestic needs. He sent the speech to a well-known political consultant with whom he talks frequently. The consultant wrote back that his reaction to the speech was very negative.
''You should know you are way ahead of public opinion on this,'' the consultant wrote.
 
'A Safer Middle Ground'
Mr. AuCoin, who has not yet made the speech, said, ''He was urging me to a safer middle ground so I wouldn't run the risk of having my chin out too far.''
The science of public opinion measuring is being misused, Mr. AuCoin said, ''to lock you in where you are today rather than to lead society to where you think you ought to be.''
Public-opinion measurement has become a tool not only of modern politics but of government. Proponents of polling say this makes democracy more democratic. But the public is often not aware of the details of problems, said Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, and polls are measuring emotional response, not thought-out views.
Harry Boyte, director of the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, said: ''We have public opinion now, which is people's private reflexes. But we don't have public judgment. So everything is broken down into market segments. You have no public process.''
Senator McClure said this is apparent in efforts to grapple with complex subjects like clean air legislation. ''If it causes 10 deaths in the next 700,000 years, we have to stop it,'' Mr. McClure said, characterizing the distorted debate on environmental pollution. ''That's not rational. It's not intelligent. But it responds to emotion.''
It is becoming increasingly difficult to get Congress ''to make balanced judgment on good information,'' said Senator McClure, who is retiring after 25 years on Capitol Hill in frustration over what he calls the new breed of ''wet-finger politicians,'' who he said spend more time sampling the political winds than reading policy papers.
 
The Public Attitude
 
Involvement: Why Bother?
 One problem with the intense measuring of public opinion is finding out how sour it is, a disenchantment that can be traced to Vietnam and Watergate. In tracking the public mood and taking positions and packaging advertising based on that mood, politicians and their consultants are reinforcing the disenchantment. This cynicism has become a closed loop.
No one defines this loop better than Mr. Atwater, who as chairman of the Republican party, is the nation's best-placed political consultant.
He summed up, in an interview in his office at the Republican National Headquarters here, his view that the negativeness of current politics flows from a deeper discontent in the public mood this way:
''First and foremost I would say that the public's attitude about politics is very much in concert with their attitude about all institutions. If you want to look at a solid trend for the last 15 or 20 years, it is that the American people are cynical and turned off about all the institutions, and politics is one. It's only one of them.
''Bull permeates everything. In other words, my theory is that the American people think politics and politicians are full of baloney. They think the media and journalists are full of baloney. They think organized religion is full of baloney. They think big business is full of baloney. They think big labor is full of baloney. To single out politics is making a grave mistake in terms of understanding attitudes of Americans.''
 
Institutions on Decline
Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker, said that the cynicism of the last 30 years has deepened into a disconnection of individuals from politics.
The disconnection of the public can be seen as well, over the last three decades, in sharp declines in the sort of organizations that used to serve as intermediaries between the public and government - political parties, churches, labor unions - as well as in voting.
Polls and on-the-street interviews frequently turn up sentiments like those expressed by Twila Martinez, a 38-year-old San Franciscan. Ms. Martinez, who says she has evolved into a Republican, summarizes her generation's view of government and politics this way: ''It seems like another world to me. It goes on, it functions, but I don't feel like it really directly affects us.''
 
The TV Influence
 
Lay It All Out In 30 Seconds
 Television was originally viewed as a democratizing force. It did help break down party machines and let candidates speak directly to the electorate.
Now another result is becoming clear. ''The rise of electronic media has had an effect on draining content out of campaigns,'' said Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian.
Senator John C. Danforth, a Republican of Missouri, said, ''It has locked candidates into ridiculous positions because only ridiculous positions can be compacted into 30-second commercials.''
Mr. Sununu said, ''Both life style and technology has forced politics for the most part to condense its message and therefore to sharpen its focus and therefore to lose, if you will, some of the supporting detail that was part of the system when people were campaigning with pamphlets.''
 
It Is Harder to Be Heard
To make things worse, it is increasingly hard to be heard over the clatter of other information and entertainment and this, politicians say, pushes them to speak more loudly and harshly.
''I tell you what you do in a campaign,'' said Mr. Atwater, sitting at his conference table in an interview a few weeks before it was discovered that he had a benign tumor in his brain. ''You get a table like this every morning at seven o'clock and spend an hour and a half figuring out what you're going to do to get on the news that night - to get in the news hole. What stunt you can pull that will give you 14 seconds of news hole.''
The decline of political parties as the controlling force in campaigns has led to the rise of a new power: the news media. News coverage, especially on television, has become so influential in politics and government that Mr. Atwater says it ''drives the system now.''
Political consultants and politicians have little patience with journalists who complain about the lack of substance or the rise of personal attacks in politics. Even when politicians try to talk about issues, the press ignores them, assert politicians from Mr. Sununu to Senator Mitchell.
 
Tone of News Darkens
Thomas Patterson, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Government, said the tone and content of news coverage of politics had darkened dramatically over the last 30 years. In the 1960 campaign, 60 percent of the coverage of the Presidential candidates in Time and Newsweek was favorable, a study by Professor Patterson found. In 1988, only 30 percent was favorable. The same trend could be found among newspapers and television.
''Increasingly, the thread running through it is, 'There is something wrong with the campaign; there is something wrong with the candidate,' '' Professor Patterson said.
The something wrong now includes subjects previously off limits. Many journalists defend their interest, saying private behavior can reveal public character. But Judith Lichtenberg, a professor at the University of Maryland, challenges this. ''The politics of character tend to drive out the politics of substance,'' she said in a paper for the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard.
The Theodore White school of political reporting, with its focus behind the curtain of campaigns, innovative when he wrote the first ''Making of the President'' book in 1960, is now the norm. An old-style stenographic reporting of issue statements is viewed as intellectually uncritical by journalists, particularly the generation that lived through the official deceit of the Watergate scandals. But the politicians say the press, by its focus on mechanics and character, is as responsible as anyone for the negative and trivial quality of political discourse.
''By lifting the curtain the media fosters the view that campaigns are simply a game and a deceitful game at that,'' said Gary Orren, a student of campaign coverage at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Orren said: ''I don't think it's any wonder that the public wasn't particularly troubled at all when the issues of the Bush Administration and the tone of the Bush Administration right after they were inagurated bore no resemblance to the issues and tone of the campaign waged in the fall. The public has learned that the campaign is a charade. They've been taught that.'' Surveying the political scene this year, there is every sign that the problems will only deepen in 1990. The tax issue is already becoming an indicator of the tolerance of candidates and the public for policy debate.
In Texas, a state with deep fiscal problems, the primary election Tuesday was preceded by a campaign dominated by big money on the Republican side and by personal bashing and innuendo on the Democratic side. The closest thing to a policy debate was between the two candidates who each insisted they would execute more criminals.
The only real discussion of the state's financial problems came as candidates tripped over each other to promise they would not support an income tax. The question to be answered in the 1990 elections, said Mr. Sipple, the Republican consultant, is ''Does the electorate still want to be lied to about taxes?''

HEADLINE: New York Area's Population Growing, but Graying Faster

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
The population of the New York region will increase only moderately but grow significantly older during the next three decades, according to new projections.
These long-term demographic trends could constrain economic growth in a metropolitan area already confronting labor shortages in some suburbs, push wages up and increase crowding on highways.
The trends also seem likely to lead to an increase in the number of elderly people dependent on health care and other expensive services and a decrease in the number of younger workers, who would bear much of the costs. Unexpected Tax Revenues? But Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which conducted one of the studies, said that a surge of people - the aging baby boomers - moving through middle age in the 1990's might also generate unexpected tax revenues at a time when governments are facing huge budget deficits and perplexing problems like drug abuse and AIDS. 
Ms. Scanlon said she believed that the demographic outlook for the region was essentially optimistic, since it pointed to stronger pressures to increase the number of people in the labor force. Even after the prosperity of the 1980's, perhaps half a million people in New York City are still not in the work force. But Ms. Scanlon said in an interview last week that the demographic forces in the coming decades suggest ''a better use of all people, of everybody being more important, especially the disadvantaged.''
In a region of about 16 million people, the Port Authority projects that between 1990 and 2005 the number of people in their 20's will decline by about 900,000. After 2000, the agency believes, the 65-and-older group will increase by almost 700,000.
The labor force will continue to grow, but at a slower rate because of a decline in the number of young workers entering the labor pool. Tight labor markets could develop and deepen, with potentially diverse and sometimes surprising consequences. Wages in the region, already high, could go still higher as employers compete for labor. This could attract more workers from outside the region, compounding traffic and transit problems. Attitudes about retirement could also change.
''Where you saw young people working in fast-food places, now increasingly you see old people,'' said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, a Manhattan-based research group.
 
A Dip in the Median Age
Mr. Anderson's organization also believes that the area's population will age. In its forecast, it projects that in 2015 there may be 4.25 million more people over 35 years of age and 1.5 million fewer people under 35 than there were in 1985. The number of people over 85 could increase by nearly 400,000.
A particularly intriguing aspect of the Port Authority study is its projection for the region's median age. At 33.5, it is now estimated to be a half year higher than that of the nation as a whole. But in 10 years it would drop below the national figure, the study predicts. Ms. Scanlon attributes that to the expectation of a continuing surge of immigrants, who are mostly young.
The aging of the region and the nation can be traced to a sequence in which the baby boom, that surge of births from the late 1940's to the early 1960's, was followed by a baby bust in the late 1960's and 1970's, and then by an echo of the baby boom in the 1980's.
 
Middle Aged and Affluent
While the national fertility rate declined to about 1.8 births per woman in the 1970's and 1980's, the rate in the New York region dropped to 1.6, a figure Ms. Scanlon expects to remain fairly stable in the coming decades.
The Port Authority projects that in the next 15 years the number of people in the region entering the peak earning years of 40 to 64 will increase by about 1.5 million. That could result in more tax revenue for local governments now struggling to fill budget gaps.
This new wealth, Ms. Scanlon said, might also help revive New York City's financial services industry, which has lost about 25,000 jobs since the October 1987 stock market collapse.
But as these people move through their 60's, they will leave behind a smaller group of middle-aged people. That could lead to what Ms. Scanlon called a ''real dependency problem.''
 
An Older Suburbia
The aging will be more pronounced in suburbs, Ms. Scanlon and others believe, in part because most foreign immigrants, most of whom are young, settle in New York City. The city attracted more than 100,000 immigrants a year during the 1980's, and they helped it grow faster than its suburbs for the first time since the 1920's.
Immigrants will continue to help the city attract and fill jobs, Ms. Scanlon believes, giving it an edge over the suburbs in the coming decades.
George Sternlieb, University Professor of Urban Studies at Rutgers University, termed the coming decades a ''marvelous demographic window of opportunity,'' but he was pessimistic about the prospects for those who have so far been left out of the work force, including vast numbers of high school dropouts and single parents in urban areas.
''We've had unique job growth,'' he said. ''It certainly has been helpful, but it has not hit the hard core.''
The Port Authority analysis, which updates a 10-year demographic projection released in 1986, is to be published in April or May. Stephen Berger, the agency's executive director, said the new projections would guide the authority on a host of issues, from making the Path system more accessible to an increasingly elderly population to redesigning airports to suit changing passenger and freight needs.
 
Values of Studies Questioned
Some economists, however, cautioned against concluding too much from such projections, especially over the long term. They noted that the forecasts were in essence assumptions about the future based on forces and behavior of the present and past, some of which were likely to change.
For example, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said he believed that workers who will be reaching retirement age in the coming decades are better educated and generally have more interesting jobs, and that they were likely to have a different attitude about leaving them. ''Can we assume that they are going to behave as the present oldsters do and get out as early as possible?'' he said.
Thirty years is also an unusually long period for a demographic projection, some economists said. Ms. Scanlon agreed. She said the Port Authority study was subject to several uncertainties, including whether those born in the baby boom will move from the city to the suburbs as many of their parents did.
 
Assuming There's No War
In arriving at its projections, the Port Authority assumed there will be at least two recessions in the 1990's but no wars involving the United States. While one team analyzed mortality and fertility rates and migration patterns, Ms. Scanlon said, another focused on employment growth and general economic conditions.
''You go back and forth,'' she said. ''The economists learn from the demographers, and vice versa.''
A comparision of population estimates by the Port Authority and the Regional Plan Association, however, demonstrates the uncertainty of such projections.
The Port Authority expects the combined population of New York City and 12 suburban counties to grow by 5 percent in 30 years, from an estimated 15.7 million in 1990 to 16.5 million. That would be a significant shift from the 1970's, when the region's population declined, but a slower rate of growth than in the 1980's, when the region experienced its greatest economic boom since World War II.
The Regional Plan Association, which focused on the city and 26 surrounding counties, believes the region will grow by 12.5 percent by 2015, from 19.9 million in 1988 to 22.4 million.
For New York City alone, the association projects a gain of 650,000 people by 2015, from 7.4 million to 8 million. But the Port Authority believes the city population will increase by only 150,000 by 2020.
The disparity seems in part a consequence of the association's projection that the region's economy will generate more jobs and that, as its president, Mr. Anderson, said, ''people follow jobs.''
''The city has already picked up close to 300,000 people since the 1980 census,'' added Regina Armstrong, an economic consultant to the association, referring to the surge of immigrants. Given their high fertility rate and continuing flow into the region, she went on, ''you end up with 8 million people.''

HEADLINE: Baker, in Africa, Will Press Mandela on Socialism

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
On his trip to southern Africa next week, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will encourage Nelson Mandela to continue his campaign against apartheid and will also urge the black leader to abandon socialist economic principles, a senior State Department official says.
Mr. Baker, who is to begin his trip on Sunday, will be the first Secretary of State to visit South Africa since Cyrus R. Vance went in 1978. He will be the most senior Administration official to meet with Mr. Mandela since he was freed on Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison.
The State Department official said Mr. Baker would open the talks with Mr. Mandela by congratulating him ''for accepting the need to negotiate, which is not easy because there are a large number of extremists in the black community who are opposed.'' 
''Second, we will congratulate him on his moderate view on the role of whites in the future of South Africa,'' the official said. ''And third, we are going to encourage him to negotiate on a sincere basis of give and take.''
 
Advice Against Socialism
On the cautionary side, Mr. Baker is planning to tell Mr. Mandela that he should abandon ideas of nationalizing South African mines and major industries, socialist concepts that the Bush Administration views as outdated.
''We do not agree with his economic model for a future South Africa,'' said the State Department official. ''There has been plenty of time since he devised his model to experience it in other countries, such as Eastern Europe, and we would urge him to look at those countries.''
The official said, ''We will say that sanctions have played a positive role, but we think now is the time not to think of more sanctions, but to think in terms of negotiations.''
Mr. Baker's trip was timed so that he could attend ceremonies on March 21 in Windhoek, marking the independence of Namibia from South Africa. Namibia is the last African country to shed its colonial status.
 
Other Meetings Planned
But the Namibian ceremonies are little more than an occasion for what will be a round of broader African diplomacy that will include meetings by the Secretary of State with President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa; Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Anglican primate of southern Africa, and other black opponents of apartheid.
The Secretary has also scheduled a meeting in Zaire with President Mobutu Sese Seko, and separate talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of a United States-backed insurgent movement in Angola.
Mr. Baker's messsage to Mr. de Klerk, the State Department official said, will be ''to congratulate him for taking these bold and courageous steps to accept a negotiated settlement.''
The official said Mr. Baker would then ''go over with him the plans for further normalizing political life, such as lifting the state of emergency and release of political prisoners. And, third, to encourage him to engage in meaningful negotiations on an expedited basis.''
 
'Time to Encourage'
''We are not really interested in discussing sanctions,'' the official added. ''We have our legislation, we're bound by it, and we think the time has come to discuss negotiations rather than sanctions. It is time for us to encourage rather than punish.''
Another issue to be addressed by Mr. Baker is to what extent the Bush Administration is prepared to aid the Namibian Government of President Sam Nujoma, which is dominated by members of Mr. Nujoma's South-West Africa People's Organization.
In exile, Mr. Nujoma was generally considered a Marxist, but he has recently taken more moderate positions. Since coming to office, Mr. Nujoma has helped develop a Western-style constitution and has nominated several whites, business figures and opposition party members to his first Cabinet to heal the wounds of a war of independence lassting from 1986 to 1989.
The 1990 United States budget included $500,000 in aid to Namibia, with $7.8 million tentatively set for 1991. Some Africa experts argue that it is essential to increase that figure in order to make Namibia a positive example for South Africa.
 
Namibia and Angola
''There are obviously many whites in South Africa who are afraid of black rule,'' said Gillian Gunn, an analyst of African affairs at the Carnegie Endowment. ''Namibia is the place they will be watching most closely. The whites there are also Afrikaners, of the same ethnic background as those in South Africa. If the shift to majority rule is handled skillfully in Namibia, if you have whites there saying, 'Look, we have a Swapo Government and I'm doing well,' that is going to have an impact on events in South Africa.''
Randall Robinson, executive director of Trans-Africa, a coalition of prominent American blacks, told reporters after a meeting with Mr. Baker last week, ''I just don't know how you justify $900 million for Hungary and Poland and $500,000 for Namibia.''
Perhaps the thorniest issue Mr. Baker will address will be American policy toward the Soviet-backed dos Santos Government in Angola.
The Bush Administration's continued support for the Angolan guerrilla leader, Jonas Savimbi, according to Representative Howard Wolpe, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Africa subcommittee, ''is driven entirely by right-wing Republican politics and a desire to demonstrate that while the Bush Administration may have, in right-wing eyes, sold out everywhere else, they are still hanging tough on Angola - even though the Angolan Government has done nothing to attack American interests.''
 
On Covert Assistance
The State Department official said that the message Mr. Baker would be carrying to the Angolan factions is that the United States would continue to provide covert assistance to Mr. Savimbi, estimated at about $50 million a year, ''until such time as national reconciliation takes place.''
But the official added: ''I think it's important to note that we're not asking for the overthrow of the Government, we're not asking for any type of regime, we're not asking that Jonas Savimbi be made President of Angola. All we're asking for is for the Government of Angola to reconcile with a major dissident organization that represents a significant number of Angolan, to get together with them, negotiate a new political order in Angola, and we will be very happy to bow out.''

HEADLINE: A REPORT INDICTS SUDAN ON RIGHTS

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, March 17

 BODY:
The military junta in the Sudan has introduced an era of repression marked by the detention and torture of suspected political opponents that surpasses the worst excesses of the longtime military Government that ruled from 1969 to the mid-80's, a human rights observer group says.
In a report made public today, Africa Watch, an organization based in the United States and Britain, said the junta of Lieut. Gen. Omar al-Bashir, which overthrew a democratically elected Government in June, combines militarism and Islamic fundamentalism. The report called this ''a new and very dangerous phenomenon'' for the Sudan. 
Civilian opponents of the Government in Khartoum, including trade-union leaders, doctors, lawyers and university professors, have been targets of the new regime, the report said. Tribes in the southern Sudan are victims of rights abuses perpetuated by both sides in the increasingly deadly civil war, it added.
The United States regards the Sudan as strategically important because of its size and location; it borders eight African countries, including Egypt and Libya.
But Washington, a major supplier of aid to the longtime military-based Government of Gen. Gaafar al-Nimeiry, who led the sub-Saharan country from 1969 to 1985, appears to have lost whatever influence it had in Khartoum as the new junta increasingly turns toward militant Arab countries, including Libya.
 
U.S. Food Aid Continues
American economic and military aid to the Sudan ended last month under a law that bans aid to a junta that has overthrown a democracy. Washington continues to provide food aid to both sides in the civil conflict, for distribution to victims of the largely war-induced famine.
The Africa Watch report provides detailed testimony about a new and shadowy security agency created by General Bashir's Government to intimidate its opposition. Known as Islamic Security, or the the Security of the Revolution, the agency has been responsible for mass arrests and ill treatment of political prisoners, the report said, quoting detainees who have recently been released.
The prisoners were usually tortured at intelligence safe-houses in Khartoum, the report said. One of the places where detainees were tortured was the the club of the Bar Association, which was disbanded by the new leader; the room where beatings took place had the words ''Human Rights Chamber'' scrawled on its door, Africa Watch said.
One person arrested on the day of the coup told Africa Watch that the new security agency was controlled by the most radical members of the National Islamic Front, a well-financed fundamentalist Islamic group with senior positions in the army.
 
Doctors Are Targets
Physicians who led a strike in November were particularly badly treated, said the detainee, who requested anonymity. Dr. Tariq Ismail, a member of the doctors' union, told another detainee that he was arrested, blindfolded and taken to a safe-house, where he was forced at gunpoint to sit in ice water in a bathtub.
''After he got out, he was blindfolded and then beaten all over his body,'' the detainee said. ''His body is covered with marks. As they beat him, he was interrogated and subjected to verbal abuse. After two to three hours, he and the other five doctors were forced to undergo the bathtub treatment - stay half an hour in the ice water. This continued for six weeks.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Says Thin Support Imperils Refugee Aid

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA

 BODY:
The number of refugees in the world has doubled in the last decade, but the international organization charged with caring for them is facing a growing financial crisis.
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian Foreign Minister who took over as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees three months ago, estimates that he will need more than $700 million this year to look after the world's 15 million refugees. But he anticipates no more than $550 million from countries with financial constraints of their own. ''I can't fulfill my mandate,'' he said in a recent interview at his headquarters here. ''Levels of care are falling. I have only half the resources per refugee today that we had in 1980.'' 
Others share Mr. Stoltenberg's concern. Roger P. Winter, Director of the United States Committee for Refugees, told the House Committee on Hunger last month that the number of refugees rose 50 percent in the last five years but that the United Nations refugee agency's budget increased only 25 percent, while the United States' share fell to 22 percent from 27 percent. ''As a result critical services have been cut back in refugee camps throughout the world,'' Mr. Winter told the House committee.
The number of refugees in the world climbed from about 7 million in 1980 to about 10 million by 1985 before reaching 15 million today, largely as a result of continuing civil strife and the exodus of boat people from Vietnam.
As the refugee crisis has grown, the High Commissioner's budget has risen, but never by enough to meet the new demands. The agency gradually drew on a reserve of about $85 million.
By 1988 this fund was exhausted. The High Commissioner's budget fell $7 million short of requirements in 1988; the deficit rose to $38 million the next year, and it is expected to reach $150 million to $200 million in 1990, said John Horekens, the head of fund-raising services.
As a result, the level of help and protection offered refugees is being steadily cut back. An internal memo of the refugee agency dated Nov. 30, 1989, notes that ''150,000 to 225,000 refugee children are suffering from acute malnutrition. All of these children need nutritional rehabilitation. All are in danger of death.''
The agency's Head of Program Management Services, Gerald Walzer, told the House Hunger Committee last month that he had to reduce teaching of refugee children, reduce the quality of water in some camps and restrict ''basic items such as blankets, tents, shelter material, cooking utensils, heating and cooking fuel.''

HEADLINE: Tanzania Is Still Limping Despite Outside Aid

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania, March 11

 BODY:
Five years ago the Tanzanian economy was such a hopeless case that its leaders jettisoned their long-held opposition to what they regarded as the world's financial police - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - and signed up.
The Tanzanians did some but not all of the things they were asked to do, like devaluing their currency and encouraging imports. Large amounts of aid, particularly from Scandinavian countries, started rolling back into Tanzania. Despite its boldly proclaimed goal of self-sufficiency, Tanzania has long been the biggest recipient of foreign support in East Africa. 
Sweden, always respectful of Tanzania's efforts to become a model of African socialism, will give $100 million this year. The United States, which stopped allocating new aid in the early 1980's, has resumed with a modest $10 million, one-quarter of it going this year to preserving Tanzania's wildlife.
But now Tanzanians and outsiders are asking, Where has all the aid of recent years gone? And with such slow progress in repairing the devastated economy, will the foreign donors stay?
The answer to the first question, even though more consumer goods have appeared in the stores in the last four years, is often embarrassed silence. To the second, the consensus seems to be that Tanzania will have to make uncharacteristically quick decisions on matters that it has now been studying for years, or the foreign aid checkbooks will be flipped shut.
''The situation we were in was a bad one,'' said Daniel Ngowi, a Tanzanian economist. ''And we're still in a bad situation. Without donor help, public health would be much worse. On other things, I can't say if donors have made a difference in the last six years.''
Tanzanian roads, Mr. Ngowi said, are more dilapidated than they were in the mid-1980's, schools have fewer books and operate in crumbling buildings and clean water is hard to find.
The roads are so appalling that the capital of Dar es Salaam is isolated because the roads leading out are impenetrable. The route north to the country's second-most important town, Arusha, is so potholed that a trip that took 5 hours a decade ago now takes 12. Foreign money has been pledged to rebuild roads and railroads.
The collapse of the infrastructure was harshly underscored, when, according to World Bank dictates, the Government raised the producer price of cotton two years ago. The cotton growers, responding as they were expected to, worked harder and harvested twice the amount of cotton as they had in the past. But the roads to the cotton farms were so poor, trucks were unable to get to the harvest, much of the cotton went bad in storage and the farmers were left unpaid. Some cotton farmers persevered for a second season, but with the same results.
''We're trying to get Tanzania back to where it was in 1970,'' said a Scandinavian diplomat, choosing a date just before the introduction of ''ujamaa,'' or villagization by the former President and current party leader, Julius K. Nyerere. Under this program, the Government resettled, often forcibly, some nine million peasants into new village sites that were supposed to develop along communal lines.
Aside from the large-scale social upheaval, the program was costly in lost agricultural production, which is the livelihood of 85 percent of the population. But recovering Tanzania's two lost decades will take another decade, foreign donors say.
''The measures taken so far were the easy ones to implement: devaluing and allowing imports,'' said a foreign economist. ''But for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure you have to gear up. You just can't announce it.'' Representatives of the foreign donors here say they are under increasing pressure from their capitals to show results of the aid that has poured into Tanzania.
''Eastern Europe is taking so many decisions so quickly, questions are being asked about why isn't the Tanzanian Government willing to take decisions as quickly,'' a representative said. ''That kind of pressure can have the possible impact of speeding things up, but there could be so much frustration that the foreign donors and World Bank will give up in frustration.''

HEADLINE: The Making of a Census: First, Cardboard Desks

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 14

 BODY:
Just over a year ago Bill Buchanan, a personnel specialist between jobs, was given 5 assistants, 150 unassembled cardboard desks, a budget of $500,000, an office key and a mission: Make sure the residents of 42 counties in western North Carolina are counted in the 1990 census.
''First, we assemble the desks,'' said the 34-year-old Mr. Buchanan, who helped run a wilderness training camp for troubled youths before becoming a district manager for the Federal Census Bureau. ''Then I hire hundreds of people. Then, here they come. We train 'em; we do all these crazy things for a few weeks. Then they're gone. Then I sweep up. Then I look for another job.''
The once-a-decade job of counting American residents has been a study in standardization, its aim and no-frills esthetic like those of a McDonald's meal: make it quick, make it cheap, make it good, make it disposable. 
From February 1989 to May 1990, a bureaucracy of 9,000 people grew to nearly half a million people, more than 330,000 actively working, 150,000 more on call. By the end of this year, the Bureau of the Census will be back down to 9,000 employees again, and 25,000 cardboard desks will be headed for recycling centers.
 
Captured by Their Quarry
Mr. Buchanan had a head start. Most of the 484 district managers started assembling their cardboard desks only six months ago. Step-by-step directions told them how to fit Tab A into Slot C. Step-by-step memos and packaged kits sent from Census Bureau warehouses in Jeffersonville, Ind., guided every step of the process, from payroll management to space acquisition, from Federal purchasing requirements to employee relations.
Now, as the peak work period approaches, the district managers and the 12 regional managers are finding that the demography they want to capture has already captured them.
To assemble a work force, they must find people who aren't working or aren't happy in their work. To describe accurately the ethnic mosaic that is the American population, they need to find workers from all parts of that mosaic. To penetrate sometimes close-knit localities, they need local people.
''Fundamentally, we used to do this job with housewives,'' said Bill Hill, the regional census director who oversees the area from Washington, D.C., down to North Carolina, and from Virginia west to the Mississippi River. Now, he said, most of these women have left for the workplace. Students were also a prime labor pool for jobs lasting two to eight weeks. Now the baby bust of the 1970's has cut that pool back.
But the number of retired people has grown, and so has the number of younger men and women whose work is either intermittent or flexible. The ranks of many minorities have swelled, particularly among Asians. The bureau is trying to recruit as many black, Hispanic, Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese Americans as it can to penetrate their communities and get as full a count as possible.
 
Playing the Numbers Game
Thus far, according to regional officials from Denver to Boston, overall recruiting is going well. The first task that will need a lot of workers, a census of the homeless set for Tuesday night, seems to be adequately staffed.
But overall numbers are deceptive. ''If I'm at 200 percent of our target in one place, it doesn't help me if I'm at 20 percent 400 miles away,'' said Mr. Hill. The Census Bureau does not have much money to pay for moving or accommodations.
Then there's the question of who knows a given area and who is known there. Brian Monahan, Mr. Hill's deputy, explained: ''In the mountains of Kentucky, there are different communities in different hollows. You do not hire people from one community to go and count people in the next community or the next hollow. They are not well received.''
 
Picking Up Those Laid Off
The misfortunes of others are often the bureau's good fortune. Veterans of the prolonged and bitter Eastern Airlines strike are sitting at some of the cardboard desks. The depressed mining areas of Kentucky furnish so many workers that the bureau has put out ''thanks, but no thanks'' signs on its doors.
But in Concord, N.H., where high-technology industry is making the economy hum, things are tough for the bureau. Likewise, in Northern Virginia, where the per capita income is nearly the highest in the country and the unemployment rate, about 1.8 percent, is nearly the lowest, the Arlington district manager, Arthur E. Rives, is recruiting barely a third of the people he needs to meet his quotas.
 
Taking the Count on Time
An adequate pool of applicants, one that can accommodate a 60 to 90 percent attrition rate and still provide enough workers, is essential to beat deadlines.
Each missed deadline means a new expenditure. Too many missed deadlines and the bureau goes over its estimated $1 billion 1990 budget. Too many missed deadlines and there is a risk of missing the ultimate deadline, Dec. 31, when the Constitution requires the bureau to submit the overall count to the President.
Despite the recruiting trouble he is having, Mr. Rives is optimistic. ''We're doing wonders with ex-military and retired people,'' he said. And the polyglot neighborhoods of Arlington are providing a steady flow of minority workers.
A flier at a local library brought in Tuyet B. Huynh, a 54-year-old Vietnamese woman who has been in the Arlington area since 1972 and worked until recently as a part-time sales clerk.
''It's easier to get a job with this office than another Federal job,'' she said, looking up from the phone where she spends the days recruiting. ''I was thinking about going to work for the Federal Government. This is a foot in the door.''
This year, for the first time, census workers are being paid hourly rates that vary rather than a standard piecework rate. In most of Kentucky, enumerators - those who knock on the doors of households whose forms were not returned - will make $5.50 an hour. In Northern Virginia, the same job will pay $7.50. In New York, it will pay $8. Bonuses of up to $375 may also be paid. In the past 18 months, Congress has also passed some temporary measures to help census recruiters. Food stamp recipients' allotments are not reduced if they go to work for the Census Bureau, and neither are retirement checks for veterans and former Federal workers.
Many applicants have little idea what the census is all about. ''I didn't know what the job was,'' Habon Farah, a 24-year-old native of Somalia, said after her brother sent her in to take the standard 30-minute general knowledge and literacy test at the Arlington office. ''They said I may be counting people, going into houses. It would be good to learn about people in my neighborhood.''
The written test is graded and sent to headquarters for checking; at the same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation checks to make sure the Federal Government is not sending convicted felons into people's homes.
''It's difficult for the average person to be prepared for how fast all this moves,'' said Mr. Buchanan, the district manager in western North Carolina. ''We're still hustling to get everything together for the next job.''

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Proposes Rail Line to Link Major Airports

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have introduced a plan for rail service to airports that would be financed by the state, city and local transit agencies.
The line would link the central terminals at Kennedy International and La Guardia using Van Wyck Expressway and Grand Central Parkway rights of way. Stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica would connect to the Long Island Rail Road and subways. 
Many proposals for train lines have been made, but none was built because estimates of ridership failed to justify their high costs. Transportation agencies also bickered over paying for a system.
Although the new proposal is extremely tentative and a formal agreement may be years away, the plan is the first developed with the cooperation of the major transit agencies, which would pay the money.
 
Advantages of Trains
Advocates of rail service to the three major regional airports say the service is needed to ease worsening traffic congestion and to keep New York competitive with other cities. Trains are more energy efficient and less polluting and prone to tieups than other forms of transportation. Rail service is also needed because the airports are employment and commercial centers, the supporters of the proposal said.
The proposal became public at a meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Council on Friday. The M.T.A., the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the State and City Transportation Departments participated in the planning.
The cost and time for building were not announced. Transportation experts estimated that the system could cost more than $2 billion to complete. The proposal would have to cross major hurdles before being built.
The Transit Authority and the Port Authority, which operates Kennedy and La Guardia, have argued for years over paying for rail lines to airports. Transit Authority officials have accused the Port Authority of spending billions of dollars on airport improvements while failing to contribute to build a link to Kennedy. Port Authority officials have said they support a jointly financed program.
 
Economic Conduits
The director of planning of the M.T.A., Gregory Johnson, said the rail line was needed to preserve the integrity of the airports, which are economic conduits for the region, attracting business and tourist money. More than 50,000 people work at the airports, and the aviation industry represents $19 billion a year in economic activity.
The Transit Authority plans to end the express subway service between Manhattan and Kennedy, known as the ''train to the plane,'' next month because of low ridership. The proposed rail link is expected to have a substantially higher ridership than that train because it will go directly into the airports and would appeal to business travelers and airport employees, M.T.A. officials said.
The M.T.A. estimates that the rail link would take 30 minutes from Kennedy to La Guardia, and the frequency of service would initially be every 15 minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with two trains on the track in each direction at any given time.
Under the proposed airport-rail link, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would be about 45 minutes using the L.I.R.R. and assuming a small amount of time to transfer to the new line, the agency said. To La Guardia, the average travel time from Grand Central Station using the No. 7 subway would be 47 minutes.

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg

 BODY:
Those of us who have to sort trash into piles of glass, cans and paper are already aware that there is a garbage crisis. Americans generate more than our fair share of refuse, much of it in the form of non-cycled, non-biodegradeable plastic.
There's a slogan, ''Every litter bit hurts,'' the obverse of which is that every less bit of litter helps. We should be happy whenever somebody does something to reduce the load on overburdened landfills. 
That's what the Eastman Kodak Company has been trying to do with a program designed to recycle the plastic containers that come with every roll of 35-millimeter film. Last November Kodak started a pilot recycling project at several processing labs. Guess what? It worked so well that many of the major labs are now clamoring to get on board.
The recycling project applies not only to film containers but also to the plastic spools and metal cartridges that are part of the trash that processing labs have to deal with. Kodak's role is to match up recyclers with interested labs. So far 15 such marriages have been arranged. (That reportedly adds up to 40,000 empty canisters a day.) Another 60 labs will be added to the network this year, Kodak says.
If, like me, you've always felt a little guilty dropping your used film containers into the wastebasket, there are now two things you can do. One is to save the containers and take them to a lab that will recyle them. The second is to encourage the lab where you do business to join the Kodak program.
What do the labs get out of it? For one, recycling companies pay a few cents a pound for the privilege of owning the plastic. For another, the labs don't have to pay as much for rubbish removal since they generate less rubbish. Finally, there's the potential for a public-relations payoff, as labs involved in recycling appear to be genuinely concerned about the environment.
The latest beneficiary of this public-relations payoff is the Ritz Camera Centers store in Newport News, Va., which was the subject of a recent Kodak press release about the expanded recycling program. A North Carolina recycling firm picks up the store's empties and delivers them to a plant that grinds them up into reusable chips.
Other labs now in the recycling stream include Wal-Mart in Texas, Guardian Photo in Slippery Rock, Pa., Crest Photo in Elgin, Ill., Photo Service of Cincinnati and District Photo in Maryland. Most significantly, Qualex, Inc. plans to have all 37 of its labs participating by the end of the year. Qualex operates the megalabs that used to be solely owned by Kodak.
One logistical problem remains. Large-volume processing labs can fill a trailer truck in a few days, but camera stores and one-hour labs don't offer recyclers the same economy of scale. As the program expands, the economic advantages may filter down to smaller and smaller businesses. And heaven knows, Americans will surely find new uses for all those tons of shredded film containers.
Speaking of which, Kodak and Fuji came under criticism from environmentalists (including the New York City Commissioner of Sanitation) when they introduced so-called ''single use'' cameras. The criticism didn't seem to hurt the cameras' popularity; indeed, both companies have added to their single-use line. Kodak's Stretch 35 panorama model was one of 1989's unexpected marketing success stories. But some of us still worried about all the trash they generated. Well now we can worry a bit less about the environmental consequences of using Kodak's Fling, Stretch or Weekend 35 models. Beginning this year, Kodak is planning to reuse the pieces of its spent single-use cameras, incorporating some of the components into factory-fresh new ones.
Once again, Kodak is working with the major labs that process the film inside the plastic-and-paper cameras to have the emptied-out bodies returned. The company hasn't announced how many of the parts inside each body will be re-manufactured, but it is demonstrating its desire to be seen as an environmentally responsible company.
Soon, of course, photography may become a much cleaner preoccupation, without the chemistry, litter and assorted health hazards it has long entailed. The day when we all make pictures on palm-sized magnetic disks and play them on television sets is not too distant.
Already Kodak is selling something called an ''image enhancement system'' that allows commercial users to retouch and revise photographs electronically. This brave-new-world device still depends on conventional film emulsions, but it makes a lot less mess than a single-use camera and doesn't require plastic containers.

HEADLINE: ART AND TYRANNY;
Pieces Missing From the Picture

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Russell's article ''Tyrants Fall; Art Endures'' [Feb. 18] was learned, moving - and disconcerting. His account of the toppling of dictators across Eastern Europe was disturbing in the evident disconnect between what was happening in the world of art and literature - and politics - there and here over the last half-century. For, while Vaclav Havel, Mircea Dinescu, Andrzej Wajda and other dissident writers and artists were bravely standing up to tyranny, and languishing in jail cells for having done so, many in the West now celebrating their counterparts' triumphant ascent into freedom were saying and doing things that almost certainly damaged the dissidents' situation, morale, and hope.
We know, of course, how geopolitical concerns led successive American administrations of both parties to acquiesce in the repressions of the East Bloc regimes imposed by Moscow, how our Government paid lip service to the ''captive nations'' while keeping its distance from East European emigres with their unpronounceable names and unassimilated anti-Communism. Now fashionable, then they were pariahs, these somewhat strange immigrants who, like the Cuban exiles, made us slightly uncomfortable with their blatant talk of freedom and liberation. 
But what of the intellectual and artistic community in the West for whom unconventional people and ideas are their very sustenance? Did they rally to the cause of human rights behind ''the Iron Curtain'' (dreaded right-wing phrase) as fervently as they did against abuses in countries allied with the United States, such as Vietnam, the Philippines, South Africa? The question answers itself. Indeed, the word communism never appears in Mr. Russell's lengthy article, nor do Marxism-Leninism, totalitarianism, Soviet Bloc, or any of those other distasteful cold-war phrases.
It is as if all these East European countries whose uprisen peoples are fervently cutting the hammer and sickle out of their national flags happened randomly and coincidentally to produce a crop of unrelated individual tyrants - a Ceausescu here, a Honecker there - bound to each other by no system or ideology. McCarthyism, it surely can be said, ultimately proved to be Moscow's greatest ally: it gave anti-Communism such a bad name that in liberal and intellectual circles in the West that epithet became more feared and despised than the charge of Communism itself.
What of those many artists and intellectuals over more than seven decades who were passive in the face of Communist anti-intellectualism and anti-spiritualism, who, if they did not argue the outright moral superiority of Communism, retreated into that intellectual cop-out, the ''moral equivalence'' of the superpowers and their systems? In his address to Congress, Mr. Havel eloquently reminded us of what the cold war was all about - the elemental struggle between ''two enormous forces, one a defender of freedom, the other a source of nightmares.'' Nor, unlike Mr. Russell, does the playwright-turned-president have either intellectual or diplomatic qualms in identifying the name and fundamental character of the tyrants he knows so well:
''The Communist type of totalitarian system has left both our nations, Czechs and Slovaks - as it has all the nations of the Soviet Union and the other countries the Soviet Union has subjugated in its time - a legacy of countless dead, an infinite spectrum of human suffering, profound economic decline, and above all enormous human humiliation. It has brought us horrors that fortunately you have not known.''
When Havel as victim could say, as he did to his Parliament and our Congress, ''I feel - along with my fellow citizens - a sense of culpability for our former reprehensible passivity,'' it cannot be ill grace to examine our own silence - and the culpability of those in that special class Mr. Russell celebrates, who purport to speak for the very soul and values of our society. President Havel includes in his startling moral denunciation the entire Czechoslovak nation which ''as someone's meaningless satellite - has refused to face up honestly to its co-responsibility for the world. It has a lot to make up for.'' What then, in the interest of truth and moral lessons for the future, must be said of the rest of us who, unlike the Czech people, did not live under the ''boulder'' of oppression? How shall we answer our children and grandchildren when they ask, what did you do in the cold war? We especially need to hear from those in the arts, those ''honorable men and women'' for whom, Mr. Russell tells us, ''what matters, in the end, is to bear witness, to tell what no one else can tell to the best of one's ability.''
By that rigorous but fair standard, it is difficult to apply Mr. Russell's sweeping congratulatory account of the record of artists, writers, and intellectuals in the West:
''Looking back on the last 50 years - as tumultuous a time as any in human history - we see that, over and over again, literature and the arts did not let us down.''
Not all in that esteemed community deserve an encore.

HEADLINE: Why Steinbeck's Okies Speak to Us Today

BYLINE: By ALAN BRINKLEY; Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at the CUNY Graduate School, is the author of ''Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin and the Great Depression'' (Knopf).

 BODY:
The image of the dust bowl migration is imbedded in American consciousness, permanently linked to our memory of the Great Depression. It was an epic event. More than a million people, most of them dispossessed farm families, left the declining agricultural regions of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the 1930's and moved west to California. Though millions of other Americans uprooted themselves in those years, the travails of the ''Okies''captured attention in a way those of other groups did not. That was in great part because of the publication in 1939 of John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' which the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago now brings to New York in a production opening Thursday at the Cort Theater.
Steinbeck became aware of the Okies in the mid-1930's as migrant workers poured into the agricultural areas surrounding his home in northern California. Their story possessed him, and he distilled it into his account of the Joad family's troubled journey from drought-stricken Oklahoma to the false promise of the west. The novel had a sensational impact, greatly strengthened by John Ford's classic 1940 film adaptation. Even 50 years later, the book, which won a Pulitzer Prize, is generally (although not universally) recognized as a masterpiece of American literature - and as one of a relatively small number of important American novels centrally concerned with issues of social and economic justice. 
The director, actor and writer Frank Galati first read ''The Grapes of Wrath'' as a boy. He never forgot its impact on him, particularly the impact of Steinbeck's storytelling. ''My life was shifted invisibly by the book,'' he recalls. Decades later, when he began an association with Steppenwolf, the ensemble company founded in 1976, he thought immediately of the novel as a project for the group. He spent three years adapting it for the stage and then directed the Steppenwolf production, which first opened in Chicago in 1988. It played briefly last year at La Jolla Playhouse in California and at the National Theater in London.
Mr. Galati, who co-adapted Anne Tyler's novel ''The Accidental Tourist'' for film, has always been drawn to literature as a source for theater. His Ph.D. dissertation was a study of Vladimir Nabokov, and as a young director he took a special interest in adapting novels to the stage in ways that would ''let the characters live dramatically without losing the heart of the narrative modality.'' It is a genre he calls ''chamber theater.''
No one would call his $1.5 million adaptation of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' a chamber piece. With its 35-member cast, musical ensemble and length of more than two and a half hours it is one of the largest productions in New York. But there is a simplicity to the staging that reflects Mr. Galati's commitment to making the original story, not his own adaptation or direction, the center of attention.
The set consists of a largely bare stage. The most significant prop is the heavily laden Hudson Super Six truck (reminiscent of the canteen wagon in Brecht's ''Mother Courage'') that becomes the Joad family's home on its long, troubled journey. Everything is designed to draw attention to the actors and, through them, to Steinbeck's words, story and social message.
''This production,'' Mr. Galati said recently, ''emerged out of a very intensive reading that made the essential elements of the novel clear to me. The book has a deep structure, an architecture, on which all else hangs. I made that the spine of my own work.'' He contrasts his play with the 1940 film, which he admires: ''Ford brought a rich visual poetry to the story. I can't re-create that on stage. For me, the language of the book is central and the spectacle secondary.'' One reason that Mr. Galati, who is 46 years old, chose ''The Grapes of Wrath'' as a project in 1985 was that he considered it appropriate for Steppenwolf. ''We are a young, committed, ensemble company, very much like a family,'' he said, ''and 'The Grapes of Wrath' is above all else a story of family.'' (Much of the original cast has followed the production to New York. Among its members is Gary Sinise, who helped begin the project while serving as Steppenwolf's artistic director in 1985 and who now plays Tom Joad. Lois Smith as Ma Joad and Terry Kinney as Jim Casy were also in the Chicago production.) But Mr. Galati also had other reasons for wanting to put the tale of the Joads on stage. ''This story needs to be told again for our time,'' he insisted. ''It tells us that buried in our success is a deep failure. Steinbeck was expressing a hope that human generosity would rescue these homeless and dispossessed people.'' He noted a parallel today in Vaclav Havel's recent statement to the United States Congress: ''The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart.'' We are, Mr. Galati said, ''on the threshold of a new world, at the end of a catastrophic century. This story comes back to us from a dark time to invite us to reflect on what we really value.''
Steinbeck, too, was preoccupied with the question of what Americans really value. He rebelled at the idea that individualism and material success were the only elements of the American Dream. He wanted there to be something more, and he spent much of the 1930's looking for it.
It was a long and difficult search, and at times he nearly gave up. His 1936 novel ''In Dubious Battle'' was bleak, cynical and almost hopeless in its portrayal of a failed strike by migrant farm workers in California's Salinas Valley (and of the futile, heartless efforts of Communist organizers to harness the strike to the party's purposes). Individuals, he seemed to say, were incapable of mastering their own destinies in the face of oppression; but they were also incapable of effective collective action. A second novel on the plight of the migrants, a vicious attack on growers inelegantly titled ''L'Affaire Lettuceberg,'' was bitter, angry and so unsatisfying to him that he burned the manuscript. He later described it as a ''mean, nasty book.''
''The Grapes of Wrath'' (whose title Steinbeck borrowed from ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic'') was his third attempt at using the Okies to assess the meaning of the Great Depression. Here, again, there were signs of hopelessness. The novel's main characters, the Joads, come to the end of their long ordeal in worse shape than when they began it - the family dispersing, their possessions washed away in a flood, their prospects bleak.
There were signs, too, of anger - in the unvarying harshness of Steinbeck's portrait of bankers, landowners, local sheriffs and other capitalist flunkies; in the bitter commentary on the human costs of industrial ''progress''; and in the radicalization of Tom Joad, who, thinking he has killed a policeman, leaves the family late in the novel to join an undefined movement committed to social struggle. He promises his mother: ''Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there.''
But to Steinbeck, as to much of the vast audience his novel (and Ford's film) attracted, neither despair nor rage adequately expressed the real meaning of the Depression. And in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' he found at last a philosophical stance that expressed both his outrage at social injustice and his belief in the possibility of transcending it.
The true lesson of the times, he now suggested, was the importance of community - not community defined in traditional, geographical terms; not the community of a neighborhood, or a town, or a region; but a community of the human spirit, for which the only real model was the family. The apostate preacher Jim Casy (an almost purely allegorical figure whose principal function is to convey Steinbeck's spiritual yearnings) expresses something of this idea in his diffident way: ''Maybe it's all men an' all women we love, maybe that's the Holy Sperit - the human sperit - the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body's a part of.'' Tom Joad later parrots his words as he explains to his mother why he must leave the family's struggle to join a larger one.
But while Steinbeck's men talk about a transcendent community, they generally do little to help create it. The male characters die, run away from responsibility, get into trouble and disappear, or descend into helplessness and paralysis. It is the women in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' who have the strength to endure and to lay the foundations of a new human community based on universal love.
Ma Joad, the center of both the family and the novel, gradually expands her own notion of ''fambly'' to include ''anybody.'' Her daughter, Rose of Sharon, helps a starving stranger by allowing him to nurse at her breasts. (Steinbeck's publishers considered this concluding scene so maudlin they tried to persuade him to remove it, and John Ford omitted it entirely from his film. Mr. Galati has retained it in his stage adaptation, convinced that it conveys the essence of Steinbeck's message.) ''Man, he lives in jerks,'' Ma Joad explains. But to woman life is ''all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river, it goes right on.''
To its many critics, ''The Grapes of Wrath'' is a hopelessly romantic novel, bordering on sentimentality. The treacly hopefulness and boundless generosity of its beleaguered characters often strain credulity. The political message is muddled and at times naive. But the novel's occasional bathos is part of what makes it such an important document of the Great Depression. Analysts of the 1930's have long struggled to understand why in the face of such misery and distress the United States experienced so little genuine upheaval - such limited radicalism, such modest violence. The most frequent answer has been the power of individualism - the tendency of desperate people to blame themselves for their problems, America's cultural inability to think in collective terms. But Steinbeck suggests another answer to that question.
He was hardly alone among artists and intellectuals of the 1930's in scorning the conventional American dream of individual success and material progress. But he scorned as well the Marxist dream of a great collective future driven by history and ideology. He embraced, instead, another social vision, no less deeply rooted in American culture than the individualistic ethos with which it competed.
It rested on an almost romantic notion of the natural goodness of ''the people.'' It imagined a culture in which a simple, folkish warmheartedness - a spontaneous generosity - would compensate for, and eventually overcome, the cruelty and oppressiveness of the economic system. The story of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' is a harsh one, to be sure; but in many ways the novel's message was as comforting to Americans of the 1930's as that of Frank Capra's warm, hopeful, populist comedies - and not, in the end, very different from it.
Steinbeck was expressing a radicalism of sorts, challenging the celebration of the individual that had so enchanted Americans in the 1920's and that many believed had caused the Great Depression. But it was a folkish unthreatening radicalism resting not on dreams of revolution but on a faith in the simple decency of common men and women. That same evocation of community has often been the source of intensely conservative appeals. Ronald Reagan loved to point to examples of spontaneous neighborliness to justify his opposition to ''paternalistic'' government. George Bush's ''thousand points of light'' similarly evoke an imagined Norman Rockwell world in which a spirit of community emerges of its own accord, without official compulsion (or Federal financing).
That ''The Grapes of Wrath'' has never stopped attracting readers, that it has become now the basis for Steppenwolf's ambitious and scrupulously faithful dramatization, suggests the fascination with which Americans still regard the Great Depression. But Steinbeck's novel is more than an intriguing period piece. Despite its many flaws it speaks to modern audiences, as it did to audiences in the 1930's, by evoking one of America's most powerful and cherished images of itself. It suggests that running like a river beneath the surface of the nation's cold, hard, individualistic culture lies the spirit of Ma Joad, a spirit of ''fambly'' and community that, once tapped, might redeem us all.
 

 
TOM JOAD, BY THE BOOK
 The image is etched in the minds of the millions who have seen John Ford's 1940 movie version of ''The Grapes of Wrath'': Henry Fonda (in photograph at right) as Tom Joad, telling his mother not to worry, he will triumph, though he is forced to flee the corrupt officers of the law.
Now, in 1990, Tom Joad is speaking again. ''I'll be all aroun' in the dark,'' he says. ''I'll be ever'where - wherever you look. Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. An' when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build - why, I'll be there.''
But the words this time are said by Gary Sinise (below), a founding member of the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago. The group's production of the epic John Steinbeck novel opens Thursday in New York.
The Steppenwolf credits of Mr. Sinise, who is 35 years old, include directing and co-starring with John Malkovich in Sam Shepard's ''True West'' and directing Lyle Kessler's ''Orphans.'' Throughout his latest venture, he says, the image of Henry Fonda has not followed him, has not been ''ever'where,'' ''all aroun' in the dark.'' He is not at all cowed about having a tough act to follow.
''I know that people identify Tom Joad with Henry Fonda, and he's certainly one of my favorite actors,'' Mr. Sinise says. ''But there's a whole audience out there coming to 'Grapes of Wrath' for the first time through the play.''
His primary source was the book, not the movie: ''I spent a lot of time with the book. I've seen the movie a few times. It's a good film, but it's 50 years old. In the 30's and 40's in Hollywood there were restrictions and barriers. You could not do things in the movies in the 1940's that you can in the 1990's. And the acting styles we have in the 90's are different from what they were in the 40's.''
Certainly, there was little in those days to compare with the Steppenwolf style of acting, which has been described as a robust and gritty kind of naturalism with the bristling energy of the best rock-and-roll.
And just how is Mr. Sinise interpreting his role? ''Tom Joad is a very simple man,'' he says. ''He's not complex in his moral judgments or values. He is somebody who during the course of the play goes through a kind of spiritual awakening, having his eyes and mind opened to a world much greater than his small one.
''A lot of the time he's like the mythic American hero,'' Mr. Sinise says. ''But I can't play a mythic American hero. I'm just playing a farmer who lost his farm, and whose family is dispossessed, and who is searching for land, and a home to call his own, and laws to protect them. He's somebody who just wants to find a job so he can pay for some food.''

Blue Collars, Both Fashionable and Frayed

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, heeeeer's - the Common Man.
The blue-collar brigades may constitute this country's overwhelming majority, but they have been generally neglected, misrepresented or patronized on television, the very medium they use most. These days, however, working-class men and women are emerging as forceful personalities in an increasing number of weekly entertainments on network schedules. Some notable examples: ABC's blockbuster hit ''Roseanne'' and the new ''Elvis,'' NBC's ''Grand,'' Fox Broadcasting's ''Married . . . With Children'' and, spilling over into animation, ''The Simpsons.'' Possibilities for next season include ''Social Studies'' (NBC), about a working-class mother raising two teen-agers, and ''Babes'' (Fox), featuring three overweight sisters squeezed into a small New York apartment.
Entrenched, as ever, are standard stereotypes. Formula entertainment couldn't survive without them. There's no doubt that being a sarcastically jolly fatso enables the outspoken Roseanne to get away with being outrageous. But the new batch of ''ordinary'' citizens on prime-time entertainment are also proving to be significantly less predictable and more complex than their predecessors. Today's working men and women confront and squawk about inadequate paychecks, failing schools, ridiculous politicians, rocky marriages. 
Back in ''Golden Age'' days, ''The Life of Riley'' and ''The Honeymooners'' were played largely for innocent laughs. Later, in the early 1970's, Archie Bunker could get closer to sensitive social issues in ''All in the Family'' but only on condition that he remained parochial and, scattering malapropisms, ignorant. Carroll O'Connor's shrewd performance kept the character from becoming a complete buffoon. The real point: Masses of viewers, legions of ordinary citizens, embraced Archie enthusiastically. They found someone who lived in their kind of neighborhood and shared their kind of concerns.
A 1971 Federal report, ''Work in America,'' pointed to the almost total lack of dramatic representations, in contrast to the 1930's, of men and women in working-class occupations. The report said: ''Research shows that less than 1 character in 10 on television is a blue-collar worker, and these few are usually portrayed as crude people with undesirable social traits. Furthermore, portrayals tend to emphasize class stereotypes: Lawyers are clever, while construction workers are louts.'' For the most part, those regrettable depictions still hold. But there are some unmistakable signs of change. Offering dramatizations based on the life of ''the legendary'' Elvis Presley, the ABC series ''Elvis'' puts a halo around the singer's early years of struggle in the 1950's, in the process almost revering his working-class roots. The future king of rock 'n' roll is a hard-working boy, protective of his family and mindful of his manners. Unlike the stereotypes of working people that emerged in the late 1960's, when activist students ''discovered'' the poor, Elvis is not dumb or reactionary or bigoted. Despite the packaging, which is sometimes as self-consciously glossy as one of Steven Spielberg's ''Amazing Stories,'' the series inches through to new territory.
Some reasons for television's growing respect for the working class can be traced to lofty outside sources. Led by scholars such as Fernand Braudel and Herbert G. Gutman, historical studies over the last several decades have gone in new directions that, while emphasizing quantifiable statistics over official pronouncements, highlight the roles not of Presidents and elites but of laborers, slaves and office workers. These studies, in turn, have influenced writers such as Barbara Ehrenreich, whose recent book ''Fear of Falling'' offers a trenchant analysis of class structure in this country. A gradual trickle-down of these ideas to various aspects of popular culture was to be expected. But television operates on a far more practical level, and that means only one thing: ratings. Fact No. 1: The networks have lost a substantial share of their audience over the last decade. Fact No. 2: Up-scale, more well-heeled viewers are those most likely to sample the newer entertainment outlets of cable, particularly pay cable, and videocassettes. In short, the vast bulk of viewers who are stuck with traditional commercial television are the kind of working people who simply cannot afford many of the new alternatives (and may not even have cable available in their neighborhoods). And as that group becomes an ever-larger piece of the shrinking network pie, attention must be paid - and will probably be rewarded. The rapid rise of ''Roseanne'' to the top of the charts was not an accident. Roseannes across the country were making themselves heard.
Recalling the blue-collar backlash to the liberal activism of the 1960's, Ms. Ehrenreich points to a sense of exclusion and neglect permeating the white working class. Television had become simply a new channel through which middle-class professionals could talk down to them. Ms. Ehrenreich writes: ''At work they gave orders. In schools and social agencies they judged and condescended. Now here they were in one's own home, as televised commentators and experts, scolding, moralizing, carping.''
Today? Ms. Ehrenreich continues: ''Television, that great enforcer of emulation, brings to the most decrepit ghettodwelling intimate glimpses into the 'lifestyles of the rich and famous,' not to mention the merely affluent. Studying the televised array of products and comforts available, seemingly, to everyone else, the poor become more dangerous. There are no models, in the mainstream media, suggesting that anything less than middle-class affluence might be an honorable and dignified condition, nor is there any reason why corporate advertisers should promote such a subversive possibility.''
Television has been generous about letting working-class characters into certain types of programs, most notably action-adventure series and made-for-TV movies. Yes, all those police officers and firefighters, from ''Starsky & Hutch'' to the current ''H.E.L.P.,'' are, quite literally, blue-collar workers, but they have been used, for the most part, as handy tools to keep thriller plots rolling. Little if any time is spent exploring their own lives and concerns. Meanwhile, television movies are partial to depicting working-class characters in assorted crises - Farrah Fawcett as a battered wife, that sort of thing. But even here, there have been some recent advances. Christine Lahti and Jeff Daniels, for instance, starred in ''No Place Like Home,'' a movie that chillingly traced the descent of a struggling blue-collar family into homelessness.
It must be admitted that viewers, all viewers, are not yearning for programs that may leave them even more depressed than they were before they sat down to watch television. Pure escapism can be something of a necessity, as was demonstrated during the Great Depression of the 1930's when movie audiences showed a strong preference for frothy Fred Astaire musicals and Katharine Hepburn romantic comedies. But obviously the depiction of working citizens on television need not be identified exclusively with downbeat situations. On the contrary, there are those who argue that, as the nation copes with its hangover from the excesses of the 1980's, a ''rediscovery'' of the working class may be very much in order. Here, the familiar, more comforting stereotypes are again being trotted out: a supposed capacity for self-denial and deferred gratification, and especially an abiding loyalty to friends and family, a quality that even Tom Wolfe found admirable in his otherwise scathing ''Bonfire of the Vanities.''
Fox Broadcasting, eager to carve out a distinctive role for itself in the hierarchy of networks, has been consistently wooing working-class audiences with formats ranging from the drug shoot-outs of ''Cops'' to the sociological parables of ''Alien Nation.'' One of its most successful ratings performers has been ''Married . . . With Children,'' with the Bundys bringing ever-new dimensions to the stereotype of lower-class grossness. One recent episode featured Mom (Katy Sagal) cheering on Dad (Ed O'Neill) while he tangled with grotesque lady wrestlers in a Las Vegas competition. Fox usually defends this kind of exploitation with the explanation that the series is the equivalent of a cartoon.
But Fox's ''Simpsons,'' which really is a cartoon, is a considerably more perceptive treatment of the contemporary American family of modest means. Homer and Marge live in a town called Springfield, which, unlike the Springfield of ''Father Knows Best,'' has a nuclear-reactor plant and, among other things, a mediocre school system. Unlike the clan on ''The Cosby Show,'' the Simpsons battle each other and just about all outsiders as they struggle to survive in a world of rapidly falling expectations. They are strange creatures, thoroughly impossible and totally believable. And like ''Roseanne,'' ''The Simpsons'' has been climbing the ratings quickly, all the more startling given Fox's relatively low profile in terms of big stations.
By far the most rounded depiction of a working-class character can be found in ''Grand,'' an ambitious new half-hour show that tries to encompass the activities, often interrelated, of people from three different classes in the fictitious town of Grand, Pa. At the bottom is Janice, once the high-school cheerleader who married the football star, now a single mother living in a trailer. Janice works as a maid for a former classmate and her father, who happens to own the biggest business in town. Played by Pamela Reed, who refuses to stoop to caricature or easy laughs, Janice has become the most refreshingly honest character in the series as she copes with her own problems and those of her teen-aged daughter in a world where all the rules seem to be changing.
It is what Katherine S. Newman, in her book ''Falling From Grace'' (Vintage), refers to as the relatively new experience of downward mobility in American life, creating a situation in which children will not necessarily do better economically than their parents. Ms. Newman asks: ''If the 'approved program' of higher education, professional credentialism or devotion to home and hearth does not provide security and access to a life of fulfillment, then what does?'' The question sets off reverberations nowadays in the least expected places, including television entertainment.
The prospect of more blue-collar types breaking into prime time has rarely seemed more assured. Now it is a matter of treating the worker intelligently and with a degree of respect. The one obvious danger would be in programmers, the professional elite, deciding to talk down to these audiences, giving them what they supposedly want. Lord Reith, the unapologetic elitist who founded the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927, stated the obvious danger: ''He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the people want is creating a fictitious demand for lower standards, which he will then satisfy.''
The resurgence of the Common Man should not be made an excuse for falling into that uncommonly barren cycle.

Blue Collars, Both Fashionable and Frayed

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
With enough money, ingenuity and chutzpah, movie makers can do anything. They are able to re-create 19th-century Africa, the battles of the Civil War, volcanic eruptions and the new Dark Ages that will follow World War III. In movies, fetuses can talk and horses fly. Movies make the impossible look ordinary. What they can't do with any ease is imagine the time and place we live in now.
When, by chance, they present this world in some relation to its reality, the result looks strange, almost exotic, like the wasteland of Flint, Mich., seen by Michael Moore in ''Roger and Me,'' and Spike Lee's vision of Bedford-Stuyvesant in ''Do the Right Thing.''
The sight has the effect of being a major discovery. Take Martin Ritt's otherwise scrupulously commonplace ''Stanley and Iris.'' 
Shortly after a thief makes off with her purse and her weekly paycheck, Iris King, a cake icer on the assembly line at the Nevins & Davis Bakery, arrives home to receive the latest unemployment reports from her sister Sharon and brother-in-law Joe. They've been staying with Iris until they get back on their feet and, on this night, tempers are short.
Neither Sharon nor Joe has had any luck finding a job. Sharon is belligerent about it. ''Don't expect anything from us this week,'' she tells Iris, the only breadwinner in the family at the moment. Iris is a widow who is also raising two children.
''I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to,'' says Sharon. ''I'd be in my own house with my own Drexel furniture and air-conditioning.''
A few minutes later, Sharon blows up when she sees Joe go the fridge and take out a can of beer. ''Where'd you get the money for the beer?'' Joe, feeling no pain, doesn't answer. Sharon finds that Joe has spent the cash she had hidden in a cupboard. ''You stole my money!''
Now Iris is interested, since everyone is supposed to be contributing to the household expenses. Sharon becomes defensive. ''Well,'' she says, ''it's not as if I was going to go out and get a face lift. I was saving that money for my teeth.''
Joe swats her on the side of the head. Sharon screams, Joe swears and Iris sends her children out of the kitchen.
Though it is sad and desperate, this scene, which comes near the beginning of ''Stanley and Iris,'' is also funny and exhilarating.
''Stanley and Iris'' is not about teeth. Teeth are mentioned only once. The audience never does find out whether Sharon is saving for fillings, extractions or root canal work. But that one line is important.
It establishes the particularity of characters who live in a recognizable world where teeth are a fact of ordinary life. They are neither the joke they are in W. C. Fields's ''Dentist'' nor an excuse for torture, as in ''Marathon Man.''
Because the line is so specific, it identifies the social and economic setting. In this way, it helps to certify the film's real subject, which is worthy but not immediately riveting. ''Stanley and Iris'' is about illiteracy, but anybody who goes to see the movie will be ahead of it on that score: they will have read the ads. Yet ''Stanley and Iris'' is something quite uncommon. Here is a big-budget American movie, with big-budget American actors (Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro), in which characters worry about jobs, money and how to pay the bills. When they work, they work in any jobs they can find, rather than at those designed to realize innermost spiritual or artistic needs.
The innermost needs of the people in ''Stanley and Iris'' are rent, food, clothes and electricity. They are back to basics. So, too, are the unemployed in ''Roger and Me,'' and the colliding temperaments in ''Do the Right Thing.''
''Stanley and Iris,'' ''Roger and Me'' and ''Do the Right Thing'' are each, in one way and another, about the quality of life of that endangered species that used to be called the working stiff, even when out of work.
Movies about working stiffs have never been numerous or particularly popular in this country. In England, where class still counts, they constitute a genre to themselves. The most memorable being Lindsay Anderson's ''This Sporting Life,'' Karel Reisz's ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,'' Tony Richardson's ''Look Back in Anger'' (based on John Osborne's seminal play) and, most recently, Mike Leigh's ''High Hopes.'' No such tradition exists in America.
There have been exceptions, such as ''Joe,'' in which the working stiff turns out to be a paranoid, homicidal maniac, and ''The Deer Hunter,'' in which the working stiffs go off to fight in Vietnam. ''Marty'' found the highly romantized nobility of a Bronx butcher. Such movies are even more rare today. For one thing, the members of the American blue-collar or working class are no longer immediately categorized as such. Many blue-collar workers earn more than those in the so-called white-collar market. If income defines class, as it seems to do in this country, the most easily identifiable members of the working class would seem to be those who are at the poverty level, or who aren't working at all.
Oliver Stone's ''Born on the Fourth of July'' has so much on its mind that it doesn't depend on a single scene to give it credibility. Yet neither the harrowing Vietnam War sequences nor those in the Bronx Veterans Hospital, where the wounded Ron Kovic is sent for therapy, would have the impact they do if the film didn't so clearly establish the nature of Ron's background.
It's only against this background that the character's evolution into an antiwar activist has emotional weight.
Ron's initial optimism seems as much a result of how his large working-class family lives, with everyone squeezed into a small house that allows little privacy, as of the strict Roman Catholicism in which he was raised. The family isn't badly off. Ron's father works in a supermarket. Nobody is starving. But life is lived largely in terms of future opportunities, when things will be better.
The Kovics' house in Massapequa, L.I., the way it is laid out, where the bedrooms are in relation to the kitchen, living room and bathroom, is as important to the film as the locations that stand in for Vietnam.
At the beginning of the film, the house meets the family needs. After Ron returns from the war, paralyzed from midchest down, confined to a wheelchair, the house doesn't function any better than he does. He has grown up but not away. When he comes wheeling home one night, drunk again after being out with his pals, the truth of his condition overwhelms him.
Ron is fed up with everything, including the loss of all sexual power. His father tries to get him into his room. His mother screams that he has become a drunk. Ron pulls out his catheter and bluntly describes his problem. His mother is beside herself. ''I will not have the word penis spoken in this house!'' For Ron, childhood ends. It's time to move on. When movies blur class distinctions, it's because those distinctions are blurred in life. There's nothing wrong with movies about people who exist in a timeless present where the only worries are emotional and psychological. That is, as long as they don't effectively deny the other pressures with which most of us contend, including work, income and future solvency.
The difference between Nancy Savoca's ''True Love,'' a comedy about a probably doomed lower-middle-class marriage in the Bronx, and Herbert Ross's ''Steel Magnolias,'' which also has to do with marriage, among other things, is a matter of acuteness of observation in details of character, behavior, setting and speech.
Nobody in ''True Love'' worries much about the high cost of the wedding or future finances, but the way in which the characters talk and act is so accurate that one understands that, off-screen, there are other aspects to their lives.
The one-liners by which ''Steel Magnolia's'' proceeds from one dramatic moment to the next are so removed from recognizable character, except the playwright's, that the comedy seems thin and artificial.
What is reassuring in ''Stanley and Iris,'' ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' ''Do the Right Thing'' and ''True Love'' is not any so-called important theme but the manner in which each film recognizes the world in which it exists. Sometimes this recognition happens only in passing. Reginald Hudlin's ''House Party'' is a teen-age rap movie designed for the teen-agers. It doesn't mean to be a slice of life. It doesn't have any goal other than to keep its audience enraptured by comedy routines and music.
Yet ''House Party'' appreciates the quirky subtleties of these kids' social lives. It offers, seemingly offhand, details that give unexpected substance to froth. One fellow looks down on girls who live in ''the projects,'' not because of any nonsense about class, but because there's no possibility of getting a girl alone in a small apartment.
In the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's and into the 1960's, it used to be that movies were judged to be important or not, serious or not, by what they were about, not how good they were. For years John Ford's westerns were thought to be inferior to his melodrama about the Irish troubles, ''The Informer.''
Only later was it possible to admit that movies that tackle large social subjects tend to be clumsy. They stumble over their own important feet. Such films as ''The Ox-Bow Incident'' (anti-lynching), ''Gentleman's Agreement'' (anti-discrimination), ''On the Beach'' (anti-nuclear war) have always been seen by people who couldn't agree more, even before they enter the theater.
Ford did his best with his screen adaptation of John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath'' (anti-societal indifference to poverty), but it's still not the equal of ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.'' The movie is so elegantly photographed in high-contrast black-and-white that the images embalm in poetic feelings what should be primal outrage.
Hollywood once felt obligated to make the occasional socially conscious film. Darryl F. Zanuck, Jack Warner and the other great studio chiefs earned their brownie points by these considerations of the less fortunate. Today such relevant, or timely, movies are made more often for television than theaters, which have yet to receive one major movie that acknowledges the existence of AIDS.
A few stubborn film makers persist. Martin Ritt did not chance upon ''Stanley and Iris.'' It was written by his two longtime collaborators, Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, with whom he made the even more successful ''Hud'' and the Oscar-winning ''Norma Rae.''
Today nobody wants to see a string of what Zanuck might have called ''problem pictures.'' It isn't the problems that one misses on the screen. It is, rather, a kind of fiction that is not totally self-referential, to the extent that the world we inhabit seems not to exist, or to exist only in a kind of negative way.
The war on drugs is seen almost entirely in terms of enforcement, never in terms of the social conditions that make the taking of drugs so pervasive. It is fiction's equivalent to a policy that puts more emphasis on interdiction than on the treatment of root causes.
Most of these films seem lazy. Knee-jerk cynicism passes for healthy skepticism, which might ask the same kind of embarrassing questions about drugs that Mr. Moore raises about unemployment.
These days days when working stiffs go to movies, the working stiffs they see on the screen are mostly policemen or members of some other branch of the law-and-order business.
''Tango and Cash,'' ''Hard to Kill,'' ''Internal Affairs,'' ''Blue Steel,'' ''The Last of the Finest,'' to name a few. You might well get the impression from our movies that we live in a police state. In that context, a small reference to teeth is rejuvenating.
In the Feb. 18 Film View on the Oscar nominations, I gave the mistaken impression that members of Hollywood's various talent guilds are automatically members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The fact is that guild members must be invited by the academy to join the appropriate academy branch. Of the many called by their profession, only a small percentage are chosen by the academy.
Examples: Of the 9,000 members of the Directors Guild of America, 250 are members of the academy's directors' branch; of the 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America, 381 are academy members; of the 72,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild, just over 1,000 belong to the academy.
The members of these academy branches vote for the nominees in their particular fields. The entire academy membership then votes in all categories for the final awards.

Geffen Gets the Gold From MCA Inc.
 
Joni Mitchell once wrote a song about someone ''Stoking the star-maker machinery/Behind the popular song.*'' The song's subject, some say, is David Geffen. On Wednesday, Mr. Geffen sold the company that records Ms. Mitchell's songs to MCA Inc. for more than $550 million in stock. Several giant entertainment companies had entered the bidding for Geffen Records, by far the biggest independently owned record company left. To the winner goes a roster that also includes Guns 'n' Roses, Aerosmith and Cher. The shine on their gold records translated to tarnish on MCA stock. It fell 3 points to 52 3/4 last week as major shareholders complained about the dilution needed to make Mr. Geffen an MCA executive and a rich man. 
 
 
 
Selling Junk by the Block
 
''Junk bond'' traders and investors bravely tried to convince themselves last week that the Columbia Savings and Loan Association could unload its huge holdings without wrecking the market. With its $3.5 billion portfolio, Columbia's cache is the largest single junk holding of any savings institution. The news last Wednesday that Columbia would try to sell the bonds in one block caused bond prices to fall. Robert Lupo, a junk bond analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, is one of those expressing confidence that Columbia can find a buyer. ''Not at market value,'' he said. ''But they will get a better value than they would have by dumping.''
 
 
 
Thirsting For the Saks Cachet
 
Like a newly rich entrepeneur striving for higher status, the Tobu Department Stores Company of Tokyo joined Saks Fifth Avenue management in an offer last week to buy the Saks chain. B.A.T. Industries of London has received at least two other offers for the high-fashion retailer. Tobu's own style is closer to 14th Street than Fifth Avenue; its flagship store isn't even on the Ginza. But Japanese consumers thirst for the many labels that Saks serves up. Initially, Tobu hopes to open Saks shops in its stores.
 
 
 
Now It's Cigars Giving Up Castro
 
The cigar world's most hallowed alliance has turned to ashes. Zino Davidoff said on Thursday that the company he founded has ended relations with Cuba. Davidoff International plans to produce cigars elsewhere. Mr. Davidoff said that the quality of Cuban cigars had fallen off. Some blame Castro's decision to quit smoking. Davidoff's Havanas, costing as much as $60 each, are forbidden in the United States; Geneva's cigar merchants have become specialists at rapidly removing the incriminating cigar bands for the benefit of American tourists. With the Cuban Government still licensed to market cigars under the Davidoff name, the company plans to certify its own products by labeling them, ''Qualite Controlee par Davidoff & Cie., Geneve.'' Mr. Davidoff's motto, after all, has been, ''In Zino Veritas.''
 
 
 
In Brief
 
The Norton Company, a maker of abrasives, received an unsolicited, $1.64 billion takeover offer from BTR P.L.C. on Friday.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Facing Limits on Aid Control
 
The United States wants to make sure a Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe doesn't aid the Soviet Union as well. Last Wednesday, Nicholas F. Brady, the Secretary of the Treasury, threatened not to join a new development bank for Eastern Europe if the Soviet Union stood to benefit. Under pressure from Western Europe, the United States dropped its opposition to Soviet participation in the bank. Mr. Brady's latest remarks are likely to ignite another feud over limits on Soviet borrowing. But it should be understood in Washington that, in contrast to the confident years after World War II, the flow of international aid is now beyond American control.
 
 
 
Sales, Output and Housing
 
Retail sales were down nine-tenths of 1 percent in February after a 2.8 percent gain the month before. Industrial production moved in the opposite direction - up six-tenths of 1 percent in February after dropping 1.0 percent the month before. Economists say these figures, released last week, reflected higher production but lower sales of cars. As Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, said, ''The auto cycle is the theme.''
 
*
 
Housing starts declined 7 percent in February, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. They had risen 24.7 percent in January as warm weather allowed more building.
 
 
 
Trade: Deadlocked on Deadline
 
Talks aimed at solving nearly all the trade problems between the United States and Japan appeared likely by last week to solve none. Meetings since September seem to be making tensions worse. The United States has asked Japan to stimulate consumer spending, break up huge business combines, reduce the price of land and lower import barriers. Japan says that the United States must improve its competitiveness by cutting the Federal budget deficit, encouraging savings and spending more on research and development. Negotiators fear that next month's deadline for producing an interim report will leave them with little progress to speak of.
 
 
 
What Joy in Producer Prices?
 
February's flat producer prices caused more rejoicing among investors than economists. Economists saw that Friday's figures included a core inflation rate, excluding food and fuel, of four-tenths of 1 percent. Food and fuel prices have retreated from the sharp increases caused by January's cold weather, they say, but underlying inflation persists. ''The economy is stuck at an inflation rate of about 4 1/2 percent,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic advisor at the WEFA Group. Tight money is unlikely to keep costs like college tuition and health care under control, he said. But traders said they were relieved by the inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.89 points last week to close at 2,741.22, the best since Jan. 11.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Gorbachev's New Muscle
 
Now maybe Mikhail S. Gorbachev, having assumed the Soviet Union's new executive presidency, can ram through some real economic reforms. Presidential decrees to allow the leasing of factories and farmland, introduce free-market pricing and encourage private enterprises are expected. Mr. Gorbachev has called for sweeping reforms before. ''But they haven't been sweeping enough,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. The Soviet leader finally sees the futility of merely tinkering with a planned economy, Mr. Mandelbaum said. Things are in such sad shape, he added, that Mr. Gorbachev ''has nowhere to go but up.''
 
 
 
Lithuanian Independence: Costly
 
Lithuanian independence from the Soviet Union is likely to carry prohibitive costs, even if Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev drops his demand for $33 billion in compensation. The Lithuanian parliament declared the nation a sovereign state last week. But Lithuania depends on shipping manufactured goods - engines, machine tools and television sets - to the rest of the Soviet Union, a captive market for items that are shoddy even by the standards of Eastern Europe and a source of cheap raw materials in return. With just 3.7 million people, Lithuania is too small to attract Western investment, said Jan Vanous, research director of the Planecon consulting firm. ''The Soviet Union can live without Lithuania, but Lithuania can't live without the Soviet market,'' he summed up.
 
 
 
East Germans on Wheels
 
Once the Berlin Wall came down last November, East Germans had another fear: Would their sputtering Trabant sedans see them as far as the border? Volkswagen A.G. aims to relieve that worry by replacing East German Trabants with VW Polos in that nation's largest joint venture by far. Volkswagen announced plans last week to invest $3 billion in a partnership to produce 250,000 cars a year by 1994. Hauke Andersen, vice president for sales at the DG European Securities Corporation, predicts that, especially in VW's price range, there will be plenty of East German demand: ''The problem is not that people don't have any money, but that they have to wait 13 years to buy a car.
 
 
 
Free-Market Blitz in Brazil
 
Brazil has inflation so bad it causes indigestion: Restaurant patrons have to eat in a hurry or risk a higher tab by the time they are done. To the rescue of Latin America's largest economy comes Fernando Collor de Mello, a new President who took office Thursday. He has an ambitious, free-market plan to lay off civil servants, sell off state companies, improve tax collection, devalue the currency and tame the nation's 2,751 percent annual inflation. Even as he spoke, police raided supermarkets that were raising prices in anticipation of the price freeze he announced on Friday. United States banks have a huge stake in Mr. Collor's success, since Brazil is the third world's largest debtor. The new President vows to cut annual payments due on the $114 billion debt by half. Since last July, Brazil has paid nothing.

Bullish, but Just Barely, on Gold

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
''So,'' you ask, ''where is the price of gold going?'' ''Up,'' say the gold prognosticators, the gold bugs. This is the beginning of a new bull market.
But for these forecasters, the last few months have been a bit queasy. Every time the price of gold was about to settle at around $420 an ounce, it jerked back as if tied to a stake at $400. 
From November to early January, gold rose from $396.50 to $416.25, then dropped back to $404, up to $417.25 and down again to $394.50 on the third day of the new year. Since then, it has hit $417.75, and fallen. By Feb. 5 it had sprung all the way to $423.25, only to plunge to $396.25 on Tuesday.
The volatility has had an impact on the shares of gold mining companies in South Africa, Australia, Canada and the United States, and the gold funds that invest in them. The Morgan Stanley & Company gold index, which covers the major producers in these countries, hit a high at the end of Janaury but has fallen more than 17 percent since then.
While these declines present an opportunity for investing, they also call for caution. There are some forecasters who are less bullish than they were just months ago.
Among the factors that will influence the future of gold are the strength of the dollar, the smoothness of moves toward German unification and the success of the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve in holding down inflation. Serious political turmoil in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe would also affect gold.
Jordan Estra, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, expects gold to reach $450 in 1990. He said the recent decline was triggered by gold sales in Japan by investors who needed to meet margin calls as the Tokyo stock market tumbled.
But he is positive because, even in this current rut, gold is about 10 percent higher than it was six months ago. He also said he expects the dollar, which has been persistently strong against the Japanese yen and has rallied recently against the West German mark, to weaken again soon. The dollar and gold have generally moved in opposite directions. Gold inched up to $400 at the end of the week as the dollar fell a little against the mark and the yen.
David A. Poole, chief economist at International Investors Inc., a gold fund in New York, sees hints of higher gold prices in the rise of long-term interest rates around the world and the jump in total debt in the United States. He reads both increases as portents of higher inflation, which always has pushed up the price of gold. But the central banks in Japan, West Germany and the United States are ready to move short-term interest rates higher in their efforts to curb inflation. If they are more successful than some analysts expect, gold could fall.
Warren Myers, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, is also a gold bull and agrees that the dollar is the main lever on gold now. If German unification goes well, the dollar will weaken against the mark, which would be good for gold. And if the Japanese finally raise interest rates again - which is expected - the dollar could weaken against the yen, too.
But with gold in its current range, he is also worried. One indicator he watches closely is the relationship of the current price of gold and a 12-month moving average he constructs. In the past, when the price of gold has fallen below the 12-month average, that has indicated the end of the bull market. Now, the 12-month average is at $385, just ''spitting distance away,'' he said.
So for now he is recommending that investors only put a ''toe in the water.''
''I feel this is just a consolidation and that we are on our way to a bull market,'' he said. ''But if I am wrong, I don't want to be overcommitted.''
 
Stock Market Stars
 The little stock markets in Austria and Norway, which both touched new highs Friday, are still far outdistancing the world's major stock markets. For the year, Austria is up 53.6 percent and Norway is up 23 percent in dollar terms. Shipping stocks and oil prices have helped in Norway. Austria has been immune to the political and inflation concerns that have caused sharp swings in West Germany.

HEADLINE: Stemming the Losses: Trying for a Leaner Macy's

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
In the fickle world of consumption in which R. H. Macy & Company makes its living, every day is another dollar and every day may bring another horror. How is one going to sell those weasel-skin mufflers that only yesterday seemed so haute couture? Why did the buyer have to take 7,000 of the musical cutting boards?
In recent months it seems there have been nearly as many horrors as dollars for New York's biggest retailer, crowned by last week's report of a staggering loss in the latest quarter, which included the vital Christmas selling season. Thus there is a growing conviction among retailing analysts and suppliers that this is a crucial year for Macy's to wring fat from its operations and prove that it is once again capable of making money.
In an interview last week at his stately office above the Herald Square flagship store, Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's steel-willed chairman and chief executive, shouldered partial blame for the poor results but ascribed them mostly to aberrational external factors. He said that he was convinced Macy's will merchandise its way out of its woes. 
Last week Macy's reported a $39 million loss in its second quarter, ended Jan. 27, compared with a profit of $72.6 million a year ago, though sales did manage to climb by 7.2 percent, to $2.44 billion. The deficit was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the company. Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc. last Wednesday downgraded Macy's already low-rated ''junk bonds,'' to the annoyance of Macy's management.
 
Blankets of Debt
 The problem with a succession of losses is that they put pressure on Macy's in paying down its mountainous $5.6 billion debt. Macy's has been covered with blankets of debt since Mr. Finkelstein and 350 of his associates spearheaded a leveraged buyout of the company in July 1986. Additional debt was tacked on when the company bought the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains in 1988.
Unquestionably, Macy's was roiled by abnormalities last year. The debt crunch that sank the Campeau Corporation and provoked it to broadly mark down merchandise in its stores impelled Macy's to rewrite its price tickets to cling to its market share. What's more, the San Francisco earthquake last October crimped the sales of Macy's important San Francisco store, which has yet to rebound.
More generally, the big retailer is fighting a grim climate characterized by too many stores and by a flight by customers away from department stores to specialty boutiques that stock focused merchandise.
Management error has also played a role. ''It wasn't only Campeau,'' Mr. Finkelstein admitted. ''I think I have to take responsibility. We have always taken deep inventory positions and we realized in late October that it was too much and we had to take markdowns.''
In recent months, Mr. Finkelstein has worked at scaling back inventory to the levels held in 1988. Last fall, he said, inventory ran at an average of $3.4 billion in retail dollars, while this year he expects it to be at $3 billion.
''We are going to have plenty of merchandise,'' he said. ''But we are going to be leaner.''
Why did the company let inventory levels get so high? ''It was ill conceived,'' he said. ''We got a little exuberant.''
Though Mr. Finkelstein said he remains committed to a basic merchandising strategy of vast selection and a mix of store and national brands, he said he would steer the company away from the frequent promotions of the past. ''We were a promotional, value, high-fashion company,'' he said. ''We are going to move away from this.''
Over the next two years Macy's plans to eliminate half its one-day sales, bargain days that Mr. Finkelstein said draw more than double the surge of shoppers who file in on a normal day. Last year, he said, Macy's had 11 one-day sales. He expects there will be eight or nine this year (forget waiting for the April bonanza, for instance; it will not come) and probably six next year. At the same time, sales will be promoted less heavily with advertising.
Moreover, the retailer intends to cut back on the more isolated day-in and day-out, 25-percent-off-type sales that surface in various departments. As Mark Handler, Macy's president, put it: ''We're not going to give the customer the electric shock each day.''
The problematic question is how much the reduction in promotions will affect those customers whose lives are dedicated to bargains. Mr. Finkelstein acknowledged that he expects some sales volume will be lost. In what he is expecting to be a slow-growth year, he estimated that revenues will continue to climb in 1990, but perhaps 2 to 3 percentage points less than with the full panoply of sales. Yet he said margains should be higher.
Though he said Macy's is not keeping up with the seven-year plan that was crafted when the company went private and will continue to show losses the next couple of quarters, he predicted that the deficits will be appreciably below the latest quarter. ''For sure we will be profitable for the Christmas quarter,'' he said. ''That's a slam dunk.''
With the raft of sour news, the morale of Macy's employees has become a worrisome matter. Recruiters who specialize in the retailing industry report that they detect substantial uneasiness among Macy's personnel, including some of the people who are part of the buyout group, and there have been persistent rumors of impending waves of layoffs. Mr. Finkelstein said the company is constantly reviewing functions and weeding out unneeded people, but he insisted there will be no mass layoffs. ''Not while I'm running the company,'' he said. ''You can't do business from empty wagons and without people to sell it.''
 
Symbolic Actions
 While Mr. Finkelstein said he didn't think morale was bad - though he admitted, ''I might be the last to know'' - he has initiated certain symbolic actions. He has exhorted his top executives to wave the Macy's banner for longer hours, a maneuver that may have partially backfired on him.
At a conference last month of the presidents and chairmen of the Macy's divisions, Mr. Finkelstein implored them to put in another workday to prop up the mood of the troops. ''I told my associates that I'm going to start coming in every Saturday,'' he said. ''I didn't think it would hurt the morale of the employees if they saw the chairman here and walking around. I suggested they might do the same. We had had a lousy quarter and we're supposed to be hands-on management. We ought to be here. I was under the impression that people were doing it anyway.''
Some Macy's executives who were not doing it anyway were subsequently quoted in newspaper reports as being miffed about the prolonged hours.
Mr. Finkelstein's response is: ''If somebody feels put upon by this, they shouldn't be in the business. They should leave.''
Macy's bankers and investors maintain that the recent red numbers have not caused them fitful sleep. They feel the company remains viable enough to plow through the nasty retailing climate.
A number of analysts, though, are looking for Mr. Finkelstein to impose gutsy measures. ''I think they may have to cut back on everything but on the selling floor to get leaner and meaner,'' said Walter Loeb, a retailing analyst. ''They have to look at some of the outlying stores to see if they make sense and if perhaps they should sell them and throw the resources to the stores that are making the profits.''
 
'People Do Want Action'
 Many in the retailing community feel this year is crucial for Mr. Finkelstein to demonstrate beyond doubt that he has matters under control. ''People do want action,'' one analyst said. ''He's got a half a year to show the suppliers and everyone else how tough he can be. And I think he can do it.''
In viewing the Macy's situation, it is important to distinguish between Macy's and Campeau. Campeau's debt load is appreciably steeper than Macy's, and Campeau had not been meeting its interest payments. Macy's has. That being said, too many more quarters of heavy losses could hurl Macy's into a financial abyss of its own.
Yet it would probably take a recession or another Christmas as poor as the last one, financial analysts say, for Macy's to be severely crippled.
Evan Mann, an analyst of high-yield bonds at Dillon, Read & Company, said that by using a model that assumes a continued weak retailing environment, he produced projections that suggest Macy's will be able to satisfy the interest and principal obligations on its debt over the next few years. ''We think Macy's will be a survivor longer term,'' he said. ''There will be some bumps along the road. But we don't think we'll have too many Christmases like the one we just saw.''
Although Mr. Finkelstein said he had no plans to sell any stores, he did say that he intends to sell several unencumbered assets - worth some $150 million, he estimated - and use the proceeds to retire debt.
Mr. Finkelstein also said that Macy's has been approached recently by several groups of investors he declined to identify who are interested in buying into the company. He rated the odds of that happening as small, but said that if minority stakes are sold those proceeds would also be used to retire debt.
Though rumors of great distress at Macy's have sped through retailing circles this year, suppliers say they continue to get paid and are sanguine that sunnier times lie ahead.
''I've had no problem getting paid and have not hesitated to ship out goods,'' said Ken Zitomer, president of Russ Togs Inc., a clothing wholesaler. ''I think they're going through a blip with the rest of the marketplace.''
''They want to get away from the promotional syndrome where you have 500 sales days in 365 days,'' said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., another clothing wholesaler. ''They know there's no competing with suicide. If people want to commit suicide, you can't beat them. Now Macy's is backing off from the promotions and selling a lot of merchandise of ours and others at full price.''
In order to do that, Mr. Konheim said, Macy's and other stores have been putting heavy pressure on him to trim his prices. ''The mood of the country is not to go spend your brains out on merchandise that's not essential,'' he said. ''This is emotional merchandise we're talking about.''
Macy's greatly expanded its private-label business during the 1980's to bask in the higher profits to be wrung from store brands. But with sales of women's clothing contracting, suppliers and analysts say Macy's has been cutting back on private labels. Mr. Finkelstein, though, said the overall share of Macy's merchandise that is private label is about the same and he plans no change. Should Macy's have known better in preparing for the rough times? Mr. Finkelstein was quick to say that he and his top executives do not sit around staring through windows designing grand plans. ''We are busy running the business,'' he said. ''It's a rag business. It's a detail business. That's how we spend our time.''
 
DEAR INVESTOR: HERE'S BAD NEWS
Knowing things have gone poorly, the top executives at Macy's have spent a fair amount of time in recent months penning letters and meeting with skittish bankers to pacify their fears.
The company has sent out a string of ''Dear Investor'' letters to divulge how things are progressing - or not progressing.
Last Dec. 12, for example, investors received a four-page letter spelling out the turmoil in retailing. It related that the integration of Bullock's and I. Magnin was proving ''frustrating'' and taking ''longer than we would like.'' It also pointed out that no new stores would be opened in 1990 and only one in 1991 to hold down capital expenditures and focus on improving existing stores.
A March 12 letter, in addition to furnishing investors with the bleak numbers for the Christmas quarter, cautioned them about expecting too much too soon: ''We expect a flat economy in the spring and fall seasons and have planned our sales and expenses accordingly.'' But the message was still spiced with optimism: ''We view the future with enthusiasm and, though the past season was a difficult one, it is behind us.''
Besides the investor letters, Myron E. Ullman, Macy's executive vice president and chief financial officer, has conducted a number of meetings with small groups of lenders to assure them that Macy's is not in dire shape.
''We don't want to be cavalier,'' said Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman. ''When you have bad news, it's important to communicate.''

HEADLINE: The Battle Over Regulation of the Futures Markets

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Washington's version of a hostile takeover is starting to take shape. No money is on the table and no stock will change hands. But the outcome could change the markets far more - and far longer - than even the biggest billion-dollar deal.
The battle is pitting two of the nation's leading financial regulators against each other. It is also re-igniting a decades-old rivalry between New York's old-line Wall Street firms and Chicago's rough-and-tumble world of the commodities and futures trading pits.
The target of the would-be takeover is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulator of all futures trading. The agency is led by Wendy L. Gramm, a scrappy economist and former whiz kid at the Reagan budget office. 
The raider is the much larger Securities and Exchange Commission, watchdog of Wall Street, and its new no-nonsense chairman, Richard C. Breeden, a former securities lawyer and a self-assured protege of President Bush who was the chief architect of the Administration's bailout plan for the savings and loan industry.
Behind Mr. Breeden is Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, close friend of President Bush and one-time head of Wall Street's Dillon, Read & Company. In recent weeks, Mr. Brady has sent shock waves through the Chicago pits by saying that the Treasury is studying a plan that would merge the two agencies, with the clear implication that the S.E.C. would come out as the dominant regulator. (The case for a merger: Forum, opposite.) At the heart of the Treasury thinking is the contention that the divided regulatory responsibility for stocks and stock-index futures is weakening the American capital markets. Stock-index futures are contracts whose value is tied to a basket of underlying stocks; they permit investors to speculate on the future course of the market without owning any actual shares.
Among other things, Mr. Brady and Mr. Breeden argue that because of the split in jurisdiction, the Government cannot pursue effective enforcement of price manipulation between the futures and equities markets, and that different margin requirements create unacceptable levels of volatility. They also contend that jurisdictional squabbles are hampering the development of new financial instruments, jeopardiz-ing the future competitiveness of the United States in global markets. (See box.) They point to a lawsuit by the futures industry last year that stopped three stock exchanges from trading a new type of financial instrument. Within months, that same instrument was being traded in London.
For their part, supporters of the C.F.T.C. argue that any risks are being overdramatized and that the agency is doing its job well. The move, they say, is nothing more than a naked power play by forces allied with Wall Street that have bridled at Chicago's growing influence.
While it is anybody's guess whether Mr. Brady and Mr. Breeden will pull off a full-blown merger, many people close to the infighting say it is all but certain that the S.E.C. will at least wind up with expanded jurisdiction over stock-index futures. ''Anything less than that is unacceptable,'' said one senior Treasury official.
There are now many players in the growing battle, and few doubt that there will be plenty of blood on the floor by the time the fighting is over.
One of the other major figures is Leo Melamed, who earlier this month announced that he would step down at the end of the year as the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the most dominant of the commodities exchanges in that city.
Long considered the godfather of the financial futures industry, the outspoken Mr. Melamed has adroitly used his stature and Washington contacts to keep at bay for more than two years the forces that favor stripping the C.F.T.C. of its jurisdiction. Now, his lame-duck status is sure to weaken Chicago's hand.
Meanwhile, the fracas is likely to create deep tensions between the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, which have jurisdiction over the C.F.T.C., and the Senate Banking Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversee the S.E.C.
In the House, Dennis E. Eckart, Democrat from Ohio, and Dan Glickman, Democrat from Kansas, promised last week to introduce a bill to merge the agencies. In the Senate, Slade Gorton, Republican from Washington, has said he would propose a measure to give the S.E.C. jurisdiction over stock-index futures.
And ever in the background is Mrs. Gramm's husband, Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican. Senator Gramm, an influential member of the Banking Committee, is also known as one of the Senate's most skillful tacticians. So far, he has been silent on the agency squabble. But Senate etiquette will require those who oppose his wife's position to proceed gingerly.
At the center of the fracas, of course, are Mr. Breeden and Mrs. Gramm, two formidable adversaries.
Mr. Breeden, who is 40 years old and who has earned a reputation as an astute Washington operative, has declined to say that he favors taking over part or all of the C.F.T.C.'s turf. But that has not stopped him from turning out a drumbeat of warnings about split jurisdiction.
''I have not publicly argued for any change in jurisdiction; I have tried to talk about the problems,'' Mr. Breeden said in a recent interview. ''But I am not unwilling to eventually support some way of solving these problems.''
Mrs. Gramm, 44 years old, is not in as strong a position politically. A Reagan appointee, she and her agency have come under intense criticism in the wake of last year's trading scandal in Chicago, which has resulted in the indictment of more than 30 traders on charges of price manipulation and trading fraud.
Moreover, her term expires next month and she is hoping to get reappointed. Thus, Treasury officials say it will be difficult for her to stand in the way of a full or partial merger with the S.E.C., especially if Mr. Brady convinces President Bush to put his weight behind the issue.
Nonetheless, she is a long way from waving a white flag. ''In the coming year, the future of this industry will be written in large part in Washington, not Chicago or New York,'' Mrs. Gramm told traders at the Futures Industry Association's annual meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., earlier this month. ''We believe that the same agency that regulates all other futures should continue to regulate stock-index futures.''
The debate over the need for two regulators is not new. In the 1970's, the Chicago markets began trading interest-rate futures and currency futures, transforming the C.F.T.C. into more than just a regulator of pork belly, wheat and orange juice trading. Even then, the S.E.C. argued that it should regulate trading of the new financial instruments because of their impact on the securities markets.
A truce came in 1982. The S.E.C. got jurisdiction over stocks and options, and the C.F.T.C. got futures trading.
But the advent of stock-index futures began to raise concerns again about split jurisdiction, concerns that were heightened by the October 1987 market crash. The Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, headed by Mr. Brady, then a private citizen, concluded that the use of index futures by major investment houses had exacerbated the market plunge. Mr. Brady also warned that low margin levels on index futures permitted excessive speculation and that authority to set margin levels be given to a Government agency, rather than left with the futures exchanges.
David S. Ruder, then S.E.C. chairman, took up the fight, arguing that since the stock-index futures were so linked to the price of the underlying stocks, the S.E.C. should regulate both instruments.
But Mrs. Gramm, who had just assumed the head of the agency, effectively parried Mr. Ruder's claims, convincing lawmakers that her agency was up to the task and that low margin levels on futures were not a cause of the stock market plunge.
Most important, in the high-powered White House Working Group on the Markets set up after the crash to promote greater regulatory coordination, Mr. Ruder found himself the lone voice, and Mrs. Gramm enjoyed the support of the Reagan Treasury.
Now the equation has changed. Mrs. Gramm finds that she is outnumbered on the Working Group, which over the last six months has made jurisdiction its primary concern. Treasury officials say that Mr. Brady has also decided to make jurisdiction a major issue this year.
In a March 2 letter to two Senators - Christopher Dodd, Democrat from Connecticut, and John Heinz, Republican from Pennsylvania - and again in a speech last week, Mr. Brady said a complete merger was one of several options being considered.
The rumblings by Mr. Brady and Mr. Breeden have definitely put the Chicago traders on the defensive. In a turnaround, Mr. Melamed said early this month that he would be willing to consider letting stock exchanges trade index-type products.
But not every Wall Street specialist is convinced that the markets will benefit by the demise or weakening of the C.F.T.C.
Edward H. Fleischman, an S.E.C. commissioner, thinks that the two regulatory bodies actually promote more innovation than they suppress. The C.F.T.C. has been much more willing than the S.E.C. to let exchanges develop new products, he said.
And he wonders whether the S.E.C. would be able to regulate the futures markets as effectively as the C.F.T.C. does.
''We really don't understand those markets, it is a different world,'' Mr. Fleischman said, adding that the S.E.C. has not earned a stellar reputation for its regulation of options. ''You tell me what we would do differently. I would venture to say, nothing.''
 
THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
When Richard C. Breeden became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in October, he said one of his top priorities was insuring that the country's capital markets would remain competitive globally.
And the debate over whether the financial markets benefit from split jurisdiction over stocks and stock-index futures is a large part of that effort.
Looking at trends in the development of foreign markets, Mr. Breeden may be justified to be concerned.
In 1980 the total value of all stock traded in the United States was $1.4 trillion, compared with $357 billion in Japan and $425 billion in the European Community.
By 1989 the value of United States stocks had more than doubled, to $3 trillion, but Japanese capitalization had risen more than tenfold, to $4.4 trillion, and Europe had surged 400 percent, to $2.1 trillion.
Though he concedes that split jurisdiction over stocks and index futures did not create that shift of dominance in world finance, he argues that Washington has to make sure that the capital markets are as efficient as possible if the United States is to remain a major player.
''The world is changing around us and things that we did not need to do at one point in time may become necessary,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''In 198l we could afford certain inefficiencies in our markets, but you may not be able to afford those if you are in second place and in danger of slipping into third.''

More Power to the Regulators

BYLINE: By CHARLES SCHWAB; Charles Schwab is chairman of Charles Schwab & Company, a discount brokerage firm in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Since the crash of 1987, America's financial markets have taken a number of actions that attempt to corral the more abusive aspects of program trading. But events clearly show that even stronger measures are required not only to restore the integrity of the markets, but to help stem what is rapidly becoming an international crisis.
Clearly, the time for debates on program trading has passed. I believe that we must move quickly and forcefully to bring regulatory oversight of the stock-index futures markets under a single agency. 
Specifically, I believe every investor should urge his or her Congressional representative to expand the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission to include power over both the securities markets and all derivative contracts - including stock index futures and options - that are influencing stock market prices.
Expanded S.E.C. powers are the essential prerequisites for increasing the flow of funds into equities, establishing a sounder balance between equity and debt and restoring the vigor of our capital markets in the 1990's.
Everyone acknowledges that in order to function smoothly, our markets need liquidity - the ability to quickly convert an asset into cash. However, little attention has been given to the different liquidity needs of ''natural'' investors and index arbitrageurs.
By natural investors, I mean the broad spectrum of short-term traders, speculators, institutions, foreign owners and long-term individual investors - those investors who own most stocks. Within this diverse group, liquidity needs vary because of different time horizons for investment holdings.
The short-term trader may sell the hour after buying to take a profit. A pension fund sells to meet the monthly withdrawal requirements for pensioners. Individual investors may sell to pay for a child's education or because they have altered their view of a company or the market outlook.
Despite different investment objectives, these natural investors have a limited need for liquidity, a need that can be easily accommodated by the existing market mechanisms under most circumstances.
On a fairly normal day, 135 million shares change hands at the New York Stock Exchange, excluding approximately 10 percent for program trading. This is about one-sixth of 1 percent of total shares outstanding. Since the current market value of shares traded on the Big Board is about $3 trillion, natural investors normally require from $4 billion to $5 billion in daily liquidity.
In the ongoing debate over index arbitrage, proponents invariably defend the practice on the grounds that it adds liquidity to markets by increasing the number of participants.
Because the brokerage commissions and deposits on futures contracts relative to their market impact are significantly lower than for stocks and bonds, more players participate. Also, they argue that imposing restrictions on domestic markets merely forces trading offshore. The volatility caused by index arbitrage, they say, is a small price to pay for more efficient, more liquid domestic markets.
However, during traumatic periods when the need for liquidity is greatest, index arbitrage acts like a bomb, demolishing the liquidity of the market by scaring off would-be natural investors.
Computer-driven trading programs come into play during both up and down markets. But they produce the most sinister effects - and the greatest profits for arbitragers - when the market is falling rapidly.
Then, all but the most gutsy natural buyers step aside. Even stock exchange specialists appear to perform only their obligatory buying during such periods. As the number of investors willing to buy declines, liquidity vanishes and prices continue their downward spiral.
When program trading by arbitragers represents 10 percent or less of stock exchange volume, this crowding-out effect is fairly benign. During the crashes of 1987 and 1989, however, there were brief periods when program selling generated more than 40 percent of the orders. And on the day news broke of the American invasion of Panama, programs accounted for 56 percent of exchange trading.
Indeed, there are no natural limits for the selling of stocks by index arbitragers, except the absurd prospect of converting an entire index to cash. For the Standard & Poor's 500 index at today's prices, that would require more than $2.3 trillion - a sum greater than the total time deposits in our nation's banks.
Our policy makers need to take the lead, establishing an example for all of the markets in restoring investor confidence. Now is the time for Congress to act. Give the Securities and Exchange Commission the tools and authority to derail runaway program traders.
And, once the S.E.C. has been granted the powers it needs, let all investors stay vigilant to demand that it does in fact accomplish its mission.

Going in Two Directions

 BODY:

It was a week of inaction, with mixed results for the dollar. The head of the Bank of Japan returned from a trip to Europe but did not act to raise the country's official discount rate, a move that most analysts have been expecting and feel is necessary to support a very weak yen. So the yen fell a little further against the dollar. At the same time, the Bundesbank and other European central banks stopped selling dollars in what had been an effort to weaken the dollar against the mark. Despite the pause, the dollar weakened anyway. That was because inflation numbers on Friday and comments by President Bush favoring lower interest rates in the United States made some traders fear that rates could be heading down, which would make the dollar less attractive.

Bill Farley Learns More of The Downside

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Going down. And down.
That was the story of the great asset sale engineered by Bill Farley, the one-time presidential hopeful whose Drexel-financed industrial empire features none other than Mr. Farley in its television ads. 
Mr. Farley planned to help finance his takeover of West Point-Pepperell Inc. by having that venerable textile company sell off its Cluett Peabody operations. When that cash came into West Point, the banks and bondholders would see what a great buy Mr. Farley had made, and they would rush to provide the cash to complete the deal.
When Cluett went on the auction block last spring, at least $800 million was expected. The price was down to $600 million in October, when a preliminary deal was reached to sell it to the Bidermann Group, a French textile firm hoping to expand vastly its American operations.
The transaction was delayed repeatedly as Cluett operations failed to meet projections and Bidermann tried to get a better deal. With no other buyers knocking, Bidermann got the prize onFriday. It will pay $350 million in cash, plus a $60 million note on which no cash payments will be made for eight years.
The money goes to West Point, which last week also managed to get some of its bank loans extended until 1994. That will keep it going, but it doesn't solve Mr. Farley's problems at Farley Inc., the company he uses for his takeovers. It needs another $80 million or so to buy the remaining West Point shares still in public hands, but can't find a lender. Richard Byrne, a Merrill Lynch analyst, thinks Farley will propose a restructuring within two weeks, asking bondholders to take big losses.
Mr. Farley once was a very public man. He campaigned for president in Iowa a couple of years ago but dropped out when support failed to materialize, and he proudly spoke to the Georgia legislature last year after he got control of the Georgia-based West Point. Now he tries to stay out of sight.
The stock market, whose death was widely forecast in the wake of the ''junk bond'' woes that have contributed to Mr. Farley's problems, continued last week to move up anyway, hitting a two-month high as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 57.89 points, to 2,741.22. Program trading helped on Friday, as March stock-index futures contracts expired. Inflation seemed under control as producer prices were unchanged in February, with lower energy prices offsetting other increases. Industrial production rebounded, but not by enough to scare the bond market.
Another market where optimism reigns is fine art. Christie's, the auction house, broke a long-standing policy and guaranteed that five paintings would sell for more than $40 million. Christie's used to warn that an auction house could be destroyed by a guarantee that went wrong in a bear market, but now it shrugs off that risk.
After all, everyone knows that the value of high-quality art can only go up. It's just too bad Bill Farley invested in the other kind of asset, the one whose prices can fall as well as rise.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
The Mystery of the Rising Stock

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The shares of Southland Communications Inc., a small paging company based in Santa Ana, Calif., jumped 43 percent in over-the-counter trading last Wednesday. With refreshing candor, the company's executives put out a statement that day saying they knew of no reason for the rise in the share price.
A review of Southland's financial records doesn't suggest any explanation either. Indeed, the company's finances have become so frail that some Wall Street bears have been betting heavily that Southland will not sustain its recent rally. And that, in Wall Street's perverse way, may help explain last week's price jump. 
According to Southland's most recent public filings, for the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, 1989, the company is nearly out of cash and running out of credit, both from its bankers and its paging-equipment suppliers.
And while the company's reported revenues in 1989 climbed substantially over those in 1988, so did its costs, including the amount of interest it paid on money it borrowed to meet its cash needs. In fact, Southland's auditors, in their review of the company's annual results, cautioned that chronic losses and a lack of working capital ''raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.''
Moreover, a supposedly beneficial purchase of another small paging operation, which company officials have been promising for more than 18 months, has hit some new and potentially time-consuming regulatory snags, according to the company's public filings. Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities Commission to block Southland's acquisition of the A-plus Beepers Company. A spokesman for Bell said his company is claiming that A-plus's customers actually belong to Pacific Bell, because A-plus had been acting as its Bell's agent when it signed up the customers. The P.U.C. has scheduled a hearing on the case for April 3, the spokesman said. Southland said it will review its plans if the P.U.C. blocks the deal. In short, Southland is facing a host of problems. But Ahmad N. Bayaa, Southland's chairman and leading shareholder, said he believes the company's troubles are largely behind it. In this business, he said, ''there is a lot of investment up front and the rewards come later.''
Of course, the ''beeper'' business itself has become increasingly competitive. In this regard, Southland's corporate structure would seem to give it something of an edge. It transferred its Federal and state P.U.C. licenses to a separate corporation, owned by Mr. Bayaa's brother, Ziad, and rents its airtime back at bargain rates.
But even so, the company's paging business has never been able to make ends meet. And the arrangement has stripped Southland of one of the most valuable assets of any paging company, its transmission license.
Of course, investors can be durable optimists at times, seeing silk purses where only sow's ears are visible to others. That may explain Southland's stock-price history. The shares, which were trading at $3.63 last May, had moved up to $13.50 by early September.
That rally cooled a bit by Christmas, but prices hovered around $9 through the end of January. After the company filed its fiscal 1989 results on Jan. 29, the stock even began a modest rally and spent February in the neighborhood of $9.50 a share, before sliding back to $8.75 in early March.
On March 6, Southland announced somewhat vaguely that it ''intended to raise up to $5 million'' by privately selling an undisclosed number of shares to ''a select group of foreign investors'' whom it did not identify. The market ignored the news, and Southland's shares continued to be quoted at $8.75 through last Tuesday.
Then, between Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon, the stock soared to $12.75 on uncharacteristically heavy volume.
The move got the O.T.C. market's attention - especially among bearish short-sellers, who had borrowed Southland shares and sold them at those earlier single-digit prices, expecting to profit by later replacing the borrowed stock with even cheaper shares.
Some of these bears were complaining bitterly last week that they were the victims of a ''short squeeze.'' In this classic Wall Street maneuver, bullish investors demand the physical return of their own shares, which their brokers may have loaned out to the ''shorts.'' The move forces the short-sellers to become purchasers of the stock - unwilling ones, since they must buy shares in the marketplace to replace the ones they have borrowed from brokers and sold.
Several market-makers, who did not want to be quoted by name, attributed last week's climb to just such a squeeze. Such strategies are easier to execute, they pointed out, if a stock is illiquid and not widely held. And Southland's latest reports show that it has just 77 shareholders, fewer than the 300 required for listed companies on the National Association of Securities Dealers automated market, where Southland trades. The company explains that many of these investors ''were believed to be nominees for the actual beneficial owners.''
In any case, the bears on Wall Street aren't the only ones who were selling Southland shares as the price was climbing. The Bayaa brothers, the company's top executives, have been selling some of their original holdings as well, according to S.E.C. records. Since the stock began to rally last spring, the two men have reported sales of more than 82,000 shares.
Ahmad Bayaa explained: ''We all have our own personal needs . . . I needed to take care of some personal matters, but we believe very strongly in the company and we're in it for the long term, for sure.''
Assuming that these shares fetched $9 each, the prevailing market price when they were sold, the executives made about $738,000 on the transactions - an amount that almost equals the entire book value of the company itself.
 
 
 
 UTILITY INDEX: A CRYSTAL BALL FOR INTEREST RATES?
Interest rate forecasters often seek clues to the future in the behavior of dividend-paying utility stocks, considered to be the Big Board equivalents of long-term Treasury bonds.
But the trick these days is to detect when utility-stock traders are being prescient, and when they're simply being practical.
The 15 stocks in the Dow Jones utility index certainly have been running out of steam, falling 8 percent since mid-December. But is the index just reacting sensibly to the 10 percent decline in the price of 30-year Treasury bonds in the same period? Or giving a Delphic warning of even higher rates ahead?
''We really don't know,'' concedes Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bank in Newark. ''I would say it is because interest rates have already risen more than people expected, while economic fundamentals remain weak.''
If the index is simply mirroring the rise in the long bonds, as Mr. Levy suspects, ''then it isn't necessarily indicating that rates will go higher,'' he said.

Saudis and Soviets: Oil's Odd Couple

BYLINE: By HOSSEIN G. ASKARI; Hossein G. Askari, a professor of business administration at George Washington University, is senior advisor to the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd. in Washington.

 BODY:
The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of oil. Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter.
Together, these two oil giants contribute nearly one-third of the world's oil production and exports and as a result, their futures are intertwined. Cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union could be the catalyst for the disintegration of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to which the Soviet union does not belong, and the most important factor in determining the future direction of oil prices worldwide. 
Since the close of World War II, relations between the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia have been virtually nonexistent. Saudi Arabia chose to become a staunch ally of the United States and has had almost no formal contact with the Soviet Union or its Communist allies. But in recent years, as a result of policy differences with the United States on the Palestinian issue and on arms sales, Saudi Arabia has embarked upon a foreign policy initiative with the Soviet Union.
The emerging Soviet-Saudi relationship can be seen in the visits to Moscow by the Saudi Arabian foreign and oil ministers, and visits to Saudi Arabia by a Soviet deputy minister, a Soviet soccer team, Soviet astronauts and members of the Soviet press - all of this in the last 18 months.
In my opinion, these expanded contacts, though political and cultural on the surface, were in large part motivated by the collapse of the oil market in 1985-86 and by the Saudi Arabian desire to influence Soviet oil production policies in a way that would keep prices stable and at reasonable levels.
Economic liberalization in both Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union has helped to further the emerging relationship between the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia.
The demise of Comecon, the trade and economic organization that binds the Eastern European and Soviet economies, foreshadows a return to market prices for oil sold by the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe. This in turn will give the Soviet Union an incentive to maximize its return on its oil exports over both the short and long term.
Saudi Arabia has in recent years witnessed several changes in its oil industry. Production has declined from its peak of nearly 10 million barrels a day during the 1979-1981 period, to 4.9 million barrels a day in 1989. Sustainable production capacity - the level at which Saudi Arabia can produce oil indefinitiely - has also decreased from about 10 million barrels in 1981 a day to 7.5 million barrels a day today. These recent decreases in production capacity have been due to reduced expenditureson the maintenance of the oil fields.
For Saudi Arabia, with its tremendous oil reserves, the best stategy for continued prosperity is to produce enough oil so that market prices will not increase to the point that they encourage conservation among the oil importing countries. It is therefore in Saudi Arabia's interest to have oil prices range from $14 to $18 per barrel, given the current exchange rate between the dollar and other major currencies.
To stabilize prices at this level requires an increase in Saudi Arabia's production capacity. For this reason, it has recently begun a new program of investment to return to the 10 million barrel level by 1995 with the potential of expanding capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day by the turn of the century.
The Soviet Union, with smaller oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, would prefer higher prices if they do not affect its export volume. But in the real world of market economics, it will have to adjust its production and exports to levels that will sustain prices over the long haul.
To achieve this end, and avoid a replay of the 1986 price collapse, the Soviet Union will have to support Saudi Arabia's efforts to achieve a sustainable longterm price. If a fight develops and the Soviets increase their production to put pressure on Saudi Arabia's oil exports, another price collapse would be likely. This makes cooperation between the two countries the most likely scenario.
The oil markets of the future will be largely controlled by three main countries - Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union and Iraq. Kuwait, Iran and Abu Dhabi will play a far smaller role than they do now. If, as expected, Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union can reach a working arrangement, oil prices should be controlled by this small group of countries and become less volatile, rising very gradually in real terms over the next 10 to 15 years.
These are the developments that are likely to result in the disintegration of OPEC as it is constituted today.
The level of Saudi Arabian oil production will be a major determinant of oil prices in the future and will have a big impact upon Soviet aspirations for rapid economic modernization and for growth. At the same time, given the importance of oil to Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union's energy policies will in part shape Saudi Arabia's economic future.
The significance of the emerging relationship between the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia cannot be overestimated.

S & L's: Big Money, Little Outcry

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BEFORE the decade is out, the Federal bailout of the savings and loan industry is expected to cost the Government more than $200 billion. That is much more than the Government will spend on such critical social problems as preschool education, drug control and aid to the homeless. It is more than will be spent on highways, air traffic control and pollution abatement. It amounts to more than $1,300 for every American taxpayer, and it will not enhance national security, promote economic growth or improve public welfare one bit.
It is, by any measure, the biggest debacle in public finance in the United States since the Great Depression. One way or another, the public will pick up the tab, in the form of higher taxes or reduced spending for other programs. A natural question is, why has it not become one of the biggest political scandals as well?
To be sure, some elements of scandal are there. Lies, greed, graft, negligence, back-room deals and outright corruption were behind a huge raid on the public till. Powerful politicians and tycoons were largely responsible. 
But it has not become a scandal like Watergate or Teapot Dome in part because too many politicians have had their hands soiled by the savings and loan mess. So many are to blame that few are left to blame them.
 
Beyond Comprehension
''Literally hundreds of people have culpability on the issue, either through sheer negligence or by working on behalf of savings and loan executives operating renegade financial institutions,'' said Peter B. Teeley, an adviser to George Bush in the last Presidential campaign. ''It is impossible to say this is a Republican problem or a Democratic problem because you have so many people involved on both sides.''
Other factors have also limited the political damage:
* The enormous scale of the problem makes it difficult for people to grasp. ''Small corruption is easy to understand and, for politicians, usually fatal,'' said Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic strategist. ''Big corruption is seldom fatal because it is beyond most people's comprehension. People can't understand a $200 billion loss.''
* The difficulty is concentrated geographically. The vast majority of thrift institutions that have failed have been in the Southwest and California. ''In most parts of the country, it's a nonissue,'' said Donald F. Kettl, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, who has been studying the situation.
* No depositor lost a dime. The deposits in the savings and loan associations that went belly up were Government insured. The investors alone suffered directly, not the general public.
For an issue to be a cutting issue, said V. Lance Tarrance, a Republican poll taker based in Houston, it must have three characteristics: People must be aware of the elements; it must be meaningful to them in that it affects their pocketbooks or their trust in Government, and it must highlight a difference between the political parties. The savings and loan situation fails all three tests.
 
A Deal Made in Secret
The seeds of the financial disaster were planted in the Carter Administration, when galloping inflation and sky-high interest rates threatened to bankrupt the savings and loan industry. With their money tied up in long-term low-interest home mortgages, the thrifts could not compete with other financial institutions permitted to pay high rates of interest.
In 1980, with Congress controlled by Democrats, a law was enacted lifting the limits on interest rates the savings associations could pay and allowing them to make a limited amount of consumer loans and investments in commercial real estate. Moreover, in a deal made in secret that was never debated in public, the law raised the ceiling on Federal deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000.
In 1982 and 1983, with Ronald Reagan in the White House and the Senate under Republican control, legislation was approved broadening the institutions' capacity to make unsecured commercial loans and to invest in huge amounts of commercial real estate. In the following years, for budgetary and perhaps ideological reasons, the Reagan Administration appointed far too few regulators to monitor the changing system.
Many savings institutions remained conservative in their investments, but others rolled the dice in the hope of a jackpot. In the mid-1980's, falling oil prices led to a collapse of land values, especially in the Southwest and California, creating huge losses for thrifts heavily invested in commercial property. Once they had lost their own investment, unscrupulous owners of thrifts could essentially gamble with Government money. If a risky investment paid off, they got the profits. If, as often happened, the gamble failed, the Government had to pay off the depositors.
 
The Bubble Popped
Savings and loan executives bought some insurance of their own by developing close relationships with lawmakers in virtually every Congressional district and contributing millions to their campaigns.
Finally, the bubble popped. Thrift institutions began to fail by the hundreds. In the last years of the Reagan Presidency, the Administration, in Professor Kettl's words, ''fiddled while the savings and loans burned,'' ignoring the burgeoning crisis at a time when it might have been solved much more cheaply than now.
In 1987, Congress was assured that the problem could be solved for about $10 billion. By last year, the estimated cost had reached $159 billion. And now, as troubled savings institutions that have not been closed continue to lose money, private analysts say the total is likely to exceed $200 billion.
In 1988, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Fernand J. St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat, was defeated for re-election primarily because of revelations about his connections with savings and loan lobbyists. Last year, the top two Democrats in the House of Representatives - Jim Wright of Texas, the Speaker of the House, and Tony Coelho of California, the majority leader - were forced from office in part because of questionable dealings with savings officials.
Five Senators, four Democrats and a Republican, came under investigation because of their relationship with Charles H. Keating Jr., perhaps the highest roller of all. The failure of his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine, Calif., will cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
None of the five senators - Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona - are up for re-election this year. But public opinion polls show their standing has slipped, and the issue would probably complicate their campaigns in 1992 or 1994.
Other lawmakers who could be hurt include Representative Denny Smith, an Oregon Republican, who sat on the board of a savings and loan that failed, and Representative Frank Annunzio, an Illinois Democrat, who is chairman of the regulatory subcommittee and who accepted large contributions from Mr. Keating.
But the detritus is so widespread that few politician can afford to point a finger. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis tried tentatively in the last Presidential campaign to blame the Reagan Administration but quickly pulled back when Republicans singled out Speaker Wright.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, accused the Bush Administration last week at a Banking Committee hearing of failing to move swiftly enough because of internal bickering and turf battles within the Government. But no one joined him.
''It's regarded as a tar baby,'' Representative Schumer said afterward. ''No one wants to get ensnarled in it. You know, there aren't too many ribbon cuttings when you deal with S. & L. matters.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Latin America Is Transformed; Making Progress Is Another Matter

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
THERE were smiles and embraces all around as the popularly elected leaders of Latin America came together last week to meet the two newest members of their club: Patricio Aylwin of Chile and Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil. But the festive atmosphere barely began to convey the mix of giddy pride and apprehension permeating the region.
In the last year Latin America has gone through a surprising transformation, quiet compared with Eastern Europe's but profound nonetheless. The culmination was the defeat in free elections of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the inaugurations last week in Santiago and Brasilia of elected presidents who owe nothing to their militaries. That combination of events produced the odd sight of Vice President Dan Quayle in Santiago shaking the hand of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, just hours after supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet had attacked Mr. Quayle's motorcade. 
In Brazil, as in Chile, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras, recent elections have ended with the victory of center-right presidents who believe in the market economy, popular suffrage and all the other values that the United States holds dear. The results offer an extraordinary opportunity, one that last week allowed President Bush to announce the lifting of a five-year economic embargo against Nicaragua and the creation of a ''fund for democracy'' to help the new governments in Nicaragua and Panama, where the American invasion and overthrow of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has brought to power a government of the same ideological bent.
Washington, though, still seems to be merely reacting to - and sometimes misinterpreting - events. The tentative peace feelers extended to the Sandinistas just before the Nicaraguan election last month suggest that despite statements to the contrary, the Bush Administration had expected Mr. Ortega to remain in power. The recent withdrawal of United States support of Nicaraguan rebel leaders based in Miami, allowing them to be replaced by younger, more aggressive contras, may have deprived Washington of leverage essential to a peaceful transition in Nicaragua.
''We don't plan ahead,'' said an American official in the region. ''We didn't have an aid package sitting there ready for Panama or Nicaragua, so we've had to develop one on the spot. It's not the best way to do things, but it seems to be the way that we always end up doing it.''
The reluctance of some congressmen to approve a $1 billion aid package for Panama because they believed the money would be better spent in Eastern Europe has also raised questions about Washington's commitment. Throughout Latin America there is envy of the attention the United States is giving Eastern Europe and alarm that this hemisphere is being ignored. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel laureate novelist from Colombia and a longtime supporter of the Cuban revolution, was probably speaking for many when he said in Santiago last week that ''the day the United States launches a perestroika of its own, Latin America will change fundamentally.''
 
Widening Distinctions
In the 1980's, only one country in Latin America enjoyed an increase in per capita income: Colombia, whose economy is skewed by its principal exports, cocaine and marijuana. Elsewhere, the money that ordinarily could have gone to relieve poverty and improve education and health has been eaten up by inflation - 80 percent a month in Brazil as Mr. Collor takes office - or diverted to repay a collective foreign debt of over $400 billion.
For those reasons, political liberalization and the disappearance of autocratic military regimes have not brought anything resembling economic democracy. If anything, class distinctions have probably widened; much of the middle class that seemed to be forming 25 years ago has been driven back into poverty, especially in South American countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Peru. Peasants who were just beginning to move out of a subsistence way of life have disappeared from the economic map altogether.
All that lends credence to the claim that Latin America remains ''a volcano waiting to erupt,'' in the words of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela. More than half of the Latin American population is under 30, has no memory of prosperity or democratic transfer of power and holds a demonstrated affection for charismatic young leaders claiming to offer new solutions to old problems.
Last week's inauguration in Brasilia means that neither of the presidents of the region's two largest countries, Brazil and Mexico, has yet celebrated his 42d birthday. Both Mr. Collor and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico come from traditional political families but they represent a new leadership class: technocrats, either foreign-educated or inspired by developments abroad, who have denounced the economic stagnation and concentration of political power in their societies.
The hemisphere's longest-reigning head of state - and last remaining despot, given the fall eight days ago of Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril of Haiti - also made his way to Brasilia, but his presence served mostly to emphasize his own growing eccentricity and isolation. Fidel Castro said he was going to Brazil to strengthen contacts with other Latin American governments and because ''you have to show the imperialists you aren't afraid of them.''
He warned that if Cuba abandons Marxism-Leninism, ''the independence of the other peoples of Latin America will be reduced practically to zero'' because Cuba will no longer serve as a lightning rod for American hostility. But coming after he had just jailed a group of human rights leaders and introduced bread rationing, his words seemed hollow.
 
An Out-of-Step Relic
''When are they going to begin to understand us?'' Mr. Castro complained in Brasilia, referring not only to his enemies in the United States but the growing number of Latin American political leaders and intellectuals who see Cuba as a relic, out of step with the times.
In the next few weeks, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic are scheduled to hold their presidential elections, rounding out the cycle of more than a dozen elections in little over a year. None of them has been challenged by sore losers or overturned by military men worried that the winner will embark on radical social experiments.
Given Latin America's turbulent past, that forbearance in itself may be cause for celebration. But if the new leaders fail to deliver on their promises of better times or are left in the lurch by the United States, Latin Americans will once again have to worry about falling back into a cycle in which their choices seem limited to apocalyptic revolutionary movements or military governments determined to resist change.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
No-Strings Help for the Soviet Union: Yes or No?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR those who listen closely, a new debate on American policy toward the Soviet Union can be heard stirring in Washington.
The Bush Administration has gone through several phases in its approach to Moscow. In round one, immediately after coming into office, the White House dismissed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a ''drugstore cowboy - all hat and no cattle.'' Round two came last spring, when in the face of change in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and under pressure from Democrats in Congress, the White House actively engaged the Soviet leader. The bywords became ''mutual advantage'': the United States would do business, from arms control to trade agreements, provided it was in the mutual advantage of both countries to do so, with the emphasis on American interests first. 
The prospects for a third round were raised last week by the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. He argued that the changes in the Soviet Union are so fundamental and so ripe with the possibility of an irreversible transformation that the United States has to go beyond a narrow interpretation of ''mutual advantage.'' Washington, Mr. Gephardt said, should be aggressive in helping the Soviet Union make the transition from Communism to democracy, even if it means taking steps which, in the short run, appear to be of advantage only to Moscow.
Mr. Gephardt argued: ''How can the Soviets pull Red Army troops out of Eastern Europe if they have no jobs and no homes for them to return to in Russia? Stability, democracy and a market economy in the Soviet Union are in America's strong self-interest.'' Therefore, he added, the United States should provide Moscow with food aid, waive trade restrictions, relax bans on high-tech exports, consider Export-Import Bank loans and encourage private investment in Moscow.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, lost no time in denouncing the proposal. Calling Mr. Gephardt a ''frustrated fount of trivia,'' Mr. Simpson said, ''two-thirds of the American people oppose substantial aid to the Soviet Union.''
President Bush himself dismissed Mr. Gephardt's suggestion as partisan sniping, saying: ''We have no request for food aid to the Soviet Union. You just want to put it on a ship and send it over there?''
The answer to that question, more and more Soviet experts say, is yes.
''We can make a difference,'' said Robert Legvold of the W. Averell Harriman Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union at Columbia University. ''Why? Because the Soviet Union itself has arrived at the moment of truth. If Gorbachev is not able to move toward a radical economic reform program, at a time when you already have a radical political atmosphere created inside, he and the entire process he has set in motion could be undermined, producing just what we have wanted to avoid all along - unstable change.'' Even extensive American aid would make only a marginal difference, Mr. Legvold said, but at such a critical moment, it may be precisely the slight difference that will help.
An Administration official countered that the Soviet Union is not any shorter of food this year than in the previous 20; rather, its problem is inefficient distribution. If the country would institute the proper reforms quickly and stop wasting money aiding Cuba, this argument goes, it would not need any significant help from abroad and would attract investment.
In summarizing the emerging debate, a Harvard University political theorist, Michael J. Sandel, said one should draw a distinction between dealing with Eastern Europe and dealing with the Soviet Union. It made sense, he said, for Washington not to give any real aid to Poland or Hungary so long as the Communists were still in power, to avoid the risk of forestalling reform by shoring up Communist governments.
But the Soviet Union isn't Eastern Europe. The Communist Party is more deeply rooted; it will only be uprooted by a gradual transition process.
Said Mr. Sandel: ''What we now have to debate is this: How realistic is it, if we held out and let Gorbachev sink or swim without substantial aid, to suppose that the Soviet Union would move to a genuine multiparty democracy in the short term? That is the issue. If that is realistic, then we should show restraint. If it isn't realistic, if full democratic reform will take much longer to unfold, then we have to support a transition process, which Gorbachev represents.''

HEADLINE: Yes: Drive Down the Deficit
No: Don't Punish the Poor

 BODY:
George Bush wants to be the Education President. Yet he won't spend much money on schools. He wants to end drug abuse. Yet he won't spend much for treatment. He wants to help the poor. But in his 1991 budget, discretionary programs for low-income families are only half what they were, adjusting for inflation, 10 years ago.
Why the stingy contradictions? Because, the President claims, the nation cannot afford expensive public programs while the Federal deficit remains so high. That proposition lacks both logic and evidence. Even worse, many people believe it, thoughtlessly. 
Americans may not want to help the poor or rebuild schools. But they surely can afford to do both.
The specter of Federal deficits has contorted public discourse. Deficits must be controlled. But that does not require victimizing the poor or sacrificing investment in the economy. If Federal borrowing is too high, the nation can pay for valuable programs the old-fashioned way: with higher taxes.
 
Of Course, Reduce the Deficit
Federal deficits threaten the economy. By siphoning money from private capital markets, Federal borrowing leaves less for corporations looking to invest in new plant and equipment. That could stunt the nation's capacity to produce.
Federal deficits also make the nation increasingly dependent on foreign loans. These loans are O.K. as long as the money is used for productive investment. But foreign loans are also used for private and public consumption. That merely postpones the day of reckoning when the Japanese or West Germans must be repaid - with interest. To protect the economy from both of these threats, Federal deficits need to be lowered.
 
But by How Much?
No one knows the right amount. Some experts argue that Congress only needs to keep the deficit from rising. As the economy grows, the importance of the deficit will fall. Other experts call for more radical medicine: cut spending and raise taxes by enough to turn the current $100 billion deficit into, say, a $60 billion surplus.
Congress is already headed toward a deficit that is comfortably between these two targets. Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, the deficit - including Social Security - will fall to zero by the mid-90's.
Once that's achieved, saving and investment levels should recover from their depressed levels and compare favorably with Western Europe.
Though the evidence is murky, that deficit reduction path seems right. It has not always seemed so. Over recent years, students of the deficit have wavered. So has this page. A year ago, for example, we called for surpluses. The present path to an even balance seems sufficient. That is because there is as yet no compelling evidence to drive the deficit much lower. By doing so, Congress would probably postpone needed investment in airports, scientific research and education.
 
Besides, What's the Rush?
There remains the question of timing. Whether the deficit is $20 billion higher or lower next year is of no great importance. What is paramount is for Congress to control the path of deficit reduction over time.
That is why the recent proposal by Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is unnecessarily hasty, and punitive. Despite noble ideas for protecting the poor, his one-year freeze on spending, including Social Security, and tax increases would harm many low-income families in ways that a longer-term solution would not. Their pain would be justified only if the deficit posed an immediate crisis. But it doesn't.
 
Face the Right Choices
Now, having settled on a prudent target, Congress faces two tasks. The first is to eliminate the gimmicks that it has devised to evade the budget law. Next, Congress has to get on to the central business of politics: choice.
Programs must be judged by their individual merits, not by some twisted relationship to the size of the deficit. Is the nation better off with more missiles in silos or fewer potholes in highways? Should the taxpayers give more to the poor or spend more on themselves?
These are hard questions. It's up to Congress to decide which programs work and then pay for them with a reasonable combination of taxes and borrowing. Contrary to the teachings of supply-side zealots, raising taxes to pay for valuable public programs does no economic harm. Rejecting them on grounds of public poverty is a disgraceful deceit.
The task for Congress need not be daunting. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law offers a realistic target for the deficit. And after a decade of slashing tax rates, there is plenty of room to take care of both the economy and the needy. The deficit can be controlled without distorting America.

HEADLINE: Keep Those Economists Out of the Vineyards;
Chile Next?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Wine Equation Puts Some Noses Out of Joint'' (front page, March 4), you quote me as saying that France's Bordeaux region is ''somewhere between violent and hysterical'' about Prof. Orley Ashenfelter's theory that wine is the product of weather conditions.
I basically agree with Professor Ashenfelter and his new and interesting system of rating through weather conditions. After all, the grape is a fruit and subject to the variations of good or poor weather. My selections for the 1980 decade closely parallel Professor Ashenfelter's, with 1983, 1985 and, potentially, 1989 as the greatest of vintages.
On a scale of 1 to 10, here are my ratings of 1980's Bordeaux
vintages:
 
 1981 . . . 7-9
 1982 . . . 6*
 1983 . . . 9-10
 1984 . . . 4-5
 1985 . . . 9-10
 1986 . . . 7-8
 1987 . . . 5-7
 1988 . . . 7-9
 1989 . . . potential 10
 
(*Hugh Johnson has described this vintage as clumsy and thick, though he rates it 8-10.)
As for California, Professor Ashenfelter believes it's too hot there to make much difference, but the combined day and night average temperatures of Bordeaux and Napa are nearly identical. Therefore, it is practical to assume Napa could easily match Bordeaux and, in some cases, has already done so; witness the Mondavi 1986 pinot noir reserve and the classic 1987 Mondavi cabernet sauvignon reserve.
I am keeping an eye on Chile as the next great liquid asset area. The general wine-growing region seems to be a cross between Bordeaux and Napa. Thank you for this highly interesting article.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
AIDS: The Price of Vendetta

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
In the annals of medicine, cures for diseases have come through one person's inspiration or years of research by teams of scientists.
But never have researchers, working alone or together, had to struggle against some of the conditions that surround much of the AIDS work in this country: hate, bigotry, vendetta, rage and contempt.
The five uglinesses that enmesh AIDS work took root almost from the moment the AIDS epidemic was discovered in this country less than a decade ago. Now it is taking a new form - vilification of those who say heterosexual transmission of AIDS is a growing danger in the world. 
In the beginning fear was the soil for the anger and the fury. AIDS came so quickly, struck so hard and was so deadly. Who would not be afraid? But fear was nourished by prejudice against those who were seen then to be the only sufferers from the disease and its carriers -male homosexuals.
Brand them, put them in concentration camps. Rarely heard anymore -but remaining in the memory.
Then it developed that the disease was being spread widely through infected needles used by drug addicts, as well as through homosexual intercourse.
Walls began to go up in the mind. These were poor addicts, usually black. All anybody else had to do to be safe was avoid people like that. Just live elsewhere, have more money.
The particularly callous used the connection between AIDS and drugs as a reason for legalizing drugs. Needles would be cleaner!
Even when AIDS babies began filling special wards in city hospitals, even when it was discovered that the blood-donor pipeline had been contaminated, most Americans felt safe behind their walls.
Then, slowly, not so safe. The realization began to take hold that heterosexual transmission of AIDS was not a possibility, but was right here with us.
The evidence seemed to be that drug addiction or contact with infected homosexuals or bisexuals could usually be tracked down. But sometimes, here and in Africa, there was no such track.
The scientific community argues about the extent of the danger of heterosexual transmission in the United States. That is right and inevitable. AIDS figures have to be revised constantly, up or down, as more information comes in about this new disease that has such a long, undetectable incubation period.
In any case, with more American women getting AIDS through their own addiction or through sex with needle users - and with heterosexual transmission already a devastating plague in Africa - it was sensible to send out warnings.
The issue has plain political and economic significance. If increased heterosexual transmission is seen as a possibility, many people who never thought of AIDS as being part of their own world would push for more research and hospitalization money.
Altogether an important, still developing issue to be researched and discussed seriously. But what is happening is that those AIDS specialists who are worried about the spread of heterosexual transmission are being attacked anonymously by some of their colleagues and publicly by some journalists as if they were despicable, fund-grubbing criminals.
The latest outbreak comes in a book, ''The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS,'' by Michael Fumento. It is interesting principally because it shows how a writer can turn an important subject into a display of petulance and vendetta that sadly diminishes the value of his own considerable work and inquiry.
Coincidentally, Dr. Jonathan Mann, the American who heads the AIDS work of the World Health Organization and has warned about the spread of heterosexual AIDS, resigned Friday because of undisclosed differences with the head of the organization.
That is a loss to the work of W.H.O. The scientific community hopes and expects him to stay in the struggle against AIDS.
But chances are that all of us are already paying a price for vendettas targeting those who work against AIDS.
Researchers, clinicians and science writers are human. So some - this has no reference to Dr. Mann - are beginning to avoid a hard and sometimes dangerous field where one of the rewards is likely to be endless calumny.
Still, the fact is that all the nastiness may snarl and slow AIDS research but it has not destroyed it.
That is a small miracle. It is also a large testimony to those who say they will be damned if they give up work against AIDS - love them or not. It is what they want to do with their lives.

HEADLINE: UNSETTLING THE OLD WEST

BYLINE: by Richard Bernstein: Richard Bernstein is a national cultural correspondent of The Times.

 BODY:
GHOST TOWNS ARE AMONG HER FIRST EXHIBITS. Patricia Nelson Limerick, who teaches Western history at the University of Colorado, takes out a bundle of glossy black-and-white prints that she keeps at her home in Boulder and shows me scenes of dilapidated cabins, saloons, sagging mining shacks amid empty landscapes.
''If you live in Western America, you know that there are relics all over the place of things that didn't work out,'' she says, using her exhibits to make a broader point. Limerick, along with a growing number of scholars, is busily promoting an entirely unromantic vision of the history of the American West, a vision where failure thrusts itself rudely into former, more comforting notions of success. ''The West is the place where everybody was supposed to escape failure,'' she continues, ''but it didn't happen that way.'' 
Limerick, who is 38 years old, and other - generally young - historians of the American West are saying that traditional Western history, the stuff we were taught in elementary schools and universities alike, the narrative that Limerick sometimes calls ''the old hat frontier history'' in which ''heroic pioneers brought civilization to a savage wilderness,'' is distorted, misleading, exclusive, chauvinistic and, in the words of some more rhetorically radical historians, even ''racist'' and ''sexist.'' As an example of this objectionable approach, she offers a key sentence in the standard textbook in the field, the fifth edition of ''Westward Expansion: A History of the American Frontier,'' by Ray Allen Billington and Martin Ridge: ''The history of the American West is, almost by definition, a triumphal narrative for it traces a virtually unbroken chain of successes in national expansion.'' The myth, say the rebellious, dissenting historians, assumes an untamed land subdued by ruggedly independent white male settlers who created democracy, prosperity and the glories of American life. The myth, they vigorously contend, is wrong.
Indeed, as Limerick shows her pictures and slides, she seems to take a certain sardonic pleasure in pointing out evidence of how shaky the West really was - the busts that followed booms in the frontier economy, the sudden abandonment of newly settled places after brief periods of habitation. There is, for example, a sagging mine-shaft house in Caribou, Colo. And there is a row of wind-battered wood buildings lining an empty street in a town surrounded by treeless mountains; Limerick calls the town ''the ironically named Apex.'' One of her favorites is Ashcroft, Colo., an abandoned mining town just a few miles from Aspen, where the beautiful people congregate. Ashcroft, whose buildings are laid out ''as if a sculptor had placed them,'' is a town of such great natural beauty that it might inspire the sort of romantic sighs that once emanated from British romantics as they gazed upon the ruins of Greece and Rome. Limerick entertains no illusions of past glories. She told an audience in Casper, Wyo., last January: ''Towns with Ashcroft's natural beauty do not stand a good chance of making us backslide from the new Western history, back to the vision of pioneers putting up quaint buildings in lovely open(Continued on Page 56) spaces, evidently for the pure pleasure of having rooms they could sit in and look out at the mountains.''
For Limerick, the ghost towns provide undeniable proof that the West has a complicated, ambiguous history, a history as much of suffering as of fulfillment. Such skeptical notions no longer seem iconoclastic. Every other week there seems to be another academic conference in some Western locale. The pile of journal articles furthering the new historians' ideas grows higher and the shelf space taken up by their books ever longer - books like ''Many Tender Ties: Women in Fur-Trade Society,'' by Sylvia Van Kirk; ''Far From Home: Families of the Westward Journey,'' by Lillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens, and Elizabeth Hampsten; ''Cannery Women, Cannery Wives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry,'' by Vicki L. Ruiz; ''Forgotten Frontier: A History of Wyoming Coal Mining,'' by A. Dudley Gardner and Verla R. Flores. The regional political establishment has become increasingly receptive to a vision of the West as a place of pitiless struggle involving not only Gary Cooper white guys, but just about every human type - Indian chiefs and black newspaper men, society dames and prostitutes, missionaries and Chinese real estate investors, fur trappers and squaws. The Western Governors Association is publishing a collection of essays on new ways of looking at the West; the one by Limerick - ''The Rendezvous Model of Western American History'' - stresses the view of the West, dear to the new historians, as the most ethnically diverse part of the country.
But wait. What is new here? Did Limerick, Van Kirk, Schlissel, and their colleagues discover ghost towns? Are they the first to penetrate the myth of the heroic West? One need only think of such famous American historians as Charles Beard or C. Vann Woodward to get a flavor of a revisionist, iconoclastic history of America, or of such historians of the West as Gerald Nash, Earl Pomeroy and Howard Lamar, whose works laid the foundation for today's frontal assault on the Hollywood version of Western expansion. These historians also described its costs, its violence, the destruction of both men and nature that the march across the continent entailed.
One of the main targets of the new historians is the very granddaddy, the great progenitor of modern Western American history, Frederick Jackson Turner, the Wisconsin-born scholar against whose turn-of-the-century frontier thesis all other interpretations of Western history have long been measured. For Turner, the existence of the frontier, that steadily receding zone of wilderness being invaded by the forces of civilization, gave America its special character, its rough-and-ready democracy, its stress on adaptability and innovation. The new historians charge Turner with being ethnocentric - of excluding everybody but white males from his account of the West. But earlier schools of thought had already subjected Turner to merciless, unfavorable scrutiny. He and his followers, some critics say, exaggerated the role of the frontier, making it not just an element in the Western story but the story itself.
What then, if anything, is truly different in the new history? Some scholars, perhaps a bit miffed at the attention Patricia Limerick is getting, whisper discontentedly that the whole thing is a media event, that there isn't much new in the new historians' work. But even these skeptics allow that the new scholarship represents a point of view, an attitude about the country, that in at least one key and potentially controversial respect marks it off from much of the revisionist scholarship on America that has appeared in the past. It is this: Many historians, skeptical of both Turner and Hollywood, took it as axiomatic that the Westward expansion was violent and often tragic for many - especially the Indians. Yet they saw it as an inevitable process, a historic good whose end, a free and powerful country stretching from sea to shining sea, justified the price. The new historians are not so sure. They are blazing a pioneer's trail toward an altered view of the moral status of America itself. The new historians question the very idea of a Western - and thus an American - success story. They represent a tipping of the moral scales to that unhappy point where national faults and imperfections seem to balance national virtues.
''My argument in Casper was that this region has had an advanced curriculum in failure,'' Limerick said during my visit to her home, a bungalow in the shadows of the Rocky Mountain foothills. Limerick is erudite and witty. She punctuates her scholarly points with anecdotes about everybody from Silverheels, a legendary Colorado prostitute, to Coronado, the ill-fated Spanish explorer. She has a pleasant self-deprecating sense of humor. At the same time, she sees it as her mission to impart lessons about environmental destruction and the costs of a boom-and-bust economy before, in her view, it's too late. ''Failure has its tragic, injurious side,'' she told me. ''It also has its educational side. Failure is one of the great opportunities to learn.''
But read the works of these scholars and a certain gloom sets in. Things were not as great as we thought they were. More than half of the people who came out to strike it rich in gold and silver lost everything and went back, if they went back at all, nearly destitute. There was suffering and oppression, of women and of those who were black, Asian or Hispanic - and, of course, most conspicuously of all, of Indians, who were cheated and massacred wholesale.
In his latest book, ''Rivers of Empire,'' Donald Worster, a leading exponent of the new history who teaches at the University of Kansas, describes the great Western irrigation projects, the same projects that made deserts blossom, as an ecological and political misfortune. Western development brought about a ''hydraulic society,'' he writes, one in which Federal and state bureaucracies combined with agribusiness to impose what was ''increasingly a coercive, monolithic and hierarchical system, ruled by a power elite based on the ownership of capital and expertise.'' The result is ''sharply alienating.'' It represents the brutality of the thirst for ''total power'' and ''total possession.'' The original dream of a land of small, independent farmers was ruined.
Limerick, talking last fall to a group of Government space policy planners, poked fun at the ''new frontier'' metaphor, particularly as it applied to the exploration of space. Ronald Reagan, she reminded her audience, once compared the landing of the space shuttle Columbia - that emblem of ''true grit'' - to ''the driving of the golden spike which completed the first transcontinental railroad.'' Limerick jumped all over the metaphor. ''To anyone who is serious about history,'' she told the space planners, the golden spike ''is also a reference to enterprises done with too much haste and grandstanding, and with too little care for detail.'' She listed, among the faults in the great transcontinental railroad venture, ''executive misbehavior, large-scale corruption, shoddy construction, brutal labor exploitation, financial inefficiency.'' (It might be noted in this connection that Limerick's next book is tentatively entitled ''Troubled Land: Failure and Defeat in Western Expansion.'' It's about ''the working men and women whose dreams evaporated'' and ''the moral failure involved in building profitable enterprises on the basis of unrestrained, inhumane exploitation of labor.'') So persistently have the new historians debunked the Western myth that a number of other historians (including those who agree that some myths need smashing) feel uneasy, sensing that the pendulum is swinging too far in the other direction. A gentle critic, but also a mentor, is Howard R. Lamar, Sterling Professor of History at Yale, who taught Limerick and several other members of the new Western historians' group. They did their doctoral degrees under his direction. Professor Lamar distances himself from some of his pupils' ideas, even while praising them for their enthusiasm and energy. ''I think that what we have here is an image of an ideal West, and the real West doesn't come up to it,'' he says. ''So they tend to look at the dark side of things. There, I have to part company, but in a friendly way. I'm an optimist.'' Less gentle is William H. Goetzmann, a Pulitzer Prize winner who teaches history and American studies at the University of Texas - and is also a former student of Lamar's at Yale. His harsher view of Limerick and company mingles skepticism over the supposed newness of some of the new historians' discoveries with a strong sense that the scales of judgment have tipped too far toward the negative. ''They've discovered that there were Indian atrocities, that there were fights over water, that Mexicans were discriminated against, that mining stripped some of the land, that life was hard, and so on,'' Goetzmann objects, contending that these ''discoveries'' had already been made by other scholars, including himself, scholars who put the new elements of the picture into a more balanced perspective. ''But that doesn't mean that the American Western experience wasn't important or that it doesn't have its positive side in American history.''
TO FIND ALL THE practitioners of the new Western history you would have to travel a great deal, most of it in the West itself, to the great state and private universities and to tiny community colleges alike. For the most part, the new historians are Westerners themselves, and, as Professor Lamar remarked, they have a ''ferocious'' regional pride.
Limerick, born and raised in Banning, Calif., - a place that seemed dull to her as a child but whose cattle ranchers, Indian reservation, large black and Hispanic populations make it seem to her now a prototypical Western place - is clearly the most prominent and most visible of the new historians. This seems in part due to tremendous energy, to her wry sense of humor and skills as a public speaker, in part to her book ''The Legacy of Conquest: the Unbroken Past of the American West,'' which is widely regarded as the most complete and intellectually compelling summary of the new historians' views. But she herself, a little uncomfortable with the attention she's gotten, is quick to name others in the new historians' school whose work she admires.
One of them is Peggy Pascoe, 35 years old, a soft-spoken woman who teaches at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and is about to publish an expanded version of her doctoral thesis as a book. Pascoe was born in Butte, Mont. She went East to Sarah Lawrence College for a master's degree and then to Stanford University for her doctorate. She remembers Butte as a ''town in decline. People lived in the past as much as in the present. Everybody had stories of the miners' strikes of 70 years before.'' Butte, she recalls, was once dominated by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company: ''it was a town with a very large immigrant base.''
There is nothing to suggest a revolutionary about Pascoe. She is trim and sedate, pensive and deliberate. Yet her chief concern, the history of women in the West, represents some of the bolder and more intensely revisionist themes of the new historians. Her forthcoming book, ''Relations of Rescue: The Search for Female Moral Authority in the American West, 1874-1939,'' is a study of efforts by four middle-class white women of generally Victorian values to set up ''rescue homes'' for the female victims of ''male abuse'' - Chinese prostitutes in San Francisco, Mormon wives of polygamous husbands in Salt Lake City, Indian women on the Omaha Reservation in Nebraska and unmarried mothers in Denver. One of her underlying themes is that the inclusion of women does not merely enrich the overall picture; it changes it dramatically. She notes in this regard that some historians, aware of feminist scholarship, have added paragraphs here and there on women in an effort to redress the imbalance in favor of men - but in her view, this is inadequate compensation.
''It's 'add women and stir,' '' says Pascoe. ''It's adding the word 'women' without changing much of anything else.'' Or, as Limerick put it in her ''Legacy of Conquest'': ''Exclude women from Western history, and unreality sets in. Restore them, and the Western drama gains a fully human cast of characters - males and females whose urges, needs, failings, and conflicts we can recognize and even share.''
For Pascoe, the study of women also provides a point of departure to yet another central theme of the new historians: that American life has been unfair, even tragic to many. ''I'd be inclined to say that the interesting questions about American history are questions about inequality,'' she says. Does that make her a radical? An academic revolutionary who would discount the very notion of American opportunity? ''I'm not saying that inequality is the central factor of history, but that those are the questions that are most important for us as Americans to have answers to.'' It is this concern that prompts her to invoke what has become a common trinity in scholarly research these days: ''Class, race and gender are the axes of inequality,'' she says, ''and so for a historian interested in one sort of inequality - that is, gender inequality - theoretically it makes a great deal of sense to pay attention to other sorts of inequality, such as class and race.''
Across the hall from Pascoe at the University of Utah is Richard White, whose specialty is the history of the environment and Indian history. White, 42, whose shoulder-length hair, mustache and casual dress suggest the 60's culture of protest, has just completed a textbook on Western history that he hopes will supplant Billington and Ridge, authors of the standard textbook in the field. He describes his entry into the historians' ranks as a kind of happy accident arising out of his 60's political activism.
''In 1968,'' he said, talking in his office at the university, where the windows frame the stunning Wasatch Mountains on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, ''an Indian friend and I were going to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.'' They were on their way to the anti-war demonstrations there. ''The bus broke down,'' White recalled. ''Many things happened. After a long interlude, we ended up in the Pacific Northwest at demonstrations for Indian fishing rights on the Nisqually River.'' White became interested in the Indians and then in the environment. He went to graduate school at the University of Washington where he wrote a doctoral dissertation on the environmental history of Island County, near Seattle.
That kind of history, studying the landscape the way other historians might read a document - determining how the land was shaped by human habitation and how it in turn shaped its habitants - represents a major concern of the new historians, one that White has developed in his book, It's Your Misfortune and None of Mine: A History of the American West, soon to be published by the University of Oklahoma Press.
''My text doesn't mention the frontier,'' White observes, marking himself off from Turner and such Turnerians as Billington and Ridge. His point is that the very notion of a frontier is an ethnocentric one, deriving entirely from the point of view of the European settlers in the East. For the Indians and even for the early Spanish settlers of the Southwest, the ''frontier'' was, quite simply, home. The settlers coming from the East saw this vast territory as a ''wilderness,'' but White argues that it was actually a landscape already deeply shaped and profoundly altered by centuries of Indian habitation. Competition among different peoples over the land - not its settlement by European pioneers - is, for White, the crux of Western history, .
''I treat the West as a region,'' he says. ''The whites moving in to the West represent one of a series of migrations but not the only one. For Western historians, the great challenge has been that Turner gave such a gratifying meaning, while the meaning that we get from Western history is not nearly as clear and not nearly as gratifying.'' What ''we'' are saying, he continued, ''is that there are people left out, that the continent wasn't empty, that bad things happened that have to be mentioned. And so it does seem more pessimistic.''
But what of criticisms like those of Professor Goetzmann, who believes that this stress on the ''bad things'' obscures a larger, happier reality - that many millions of people, not all of them white, have achieved a free and prosperous life in the American West? Do the new Western historians really intend to portray our collective past as a disaster?
''I wouldn't say it's a history of disaster,'' White said. ''What we emphasize is costs. In the old Western history, the only costs were the obstacles that had to be overcome. One of the things we emphasize is that it matters where you're looking. If Indians are looking at American history, it's hard to see a triumph. Hispanics looking at American history, it's hard to see a triumph. That's not the whole story, but it's part of the story.''
AS I READ AND talked with the new historians, I began to realize that this eagerness to tell a different part of the story reflected a broader transformation in American intellectual life, encompassing more than just our conception of the territory west of the Mississippi. The work of White, Pascoe, Worster, Limerick and their colleagues bears a resemblance to efforts taking place elsewhere. Recently, the Board of Regents of the New York public school system, eager to compensate for centuries of European ethnocentrism, mandated a new curriculum that would give recognition to the contributions of nonwhites. Two years ago, Stanford University provoked a national debate on the scholarly ''canon'' when its faculty voted to revise required courses based on a list of Western classics, substituting for some traditional works on the syllabus works whose emphasis is ''women, minorities, and persons of color.'' In the same spirit, a recent book entitled ''Colorado Profiles'' carefully included an ethnic cross-section: White tycoons and gunslingers stood cheek by jowl between its covers with the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle; the New York Jewish Indian fighter Sigmund Schlesinger; with Chin Lin Sou, a Canton-born railroad foreman and gold miner, and Lewis Price, a black former slave who won and lost a fortune as a Denver real estate baron.
The curriculum fights at Stanford and the effort to write a history of the West that stresses darker themes are symptomatic of a basic change in American universities that has occurred over the last 20 years. It represents the migration into tenured positions of men and women with ideas that seemed radical during the protests of the 1960's. Richard White, sitting in his office in Utah, recalls that ''many of the people who are grouped together in the new Western history were in college in the 1960's and for many of them the formative experience was the anti-war movement.'' Peggy Pascoe concurs. ''At the time I got to college in Montana,'' she recalls of the 70's, ''the 60's were still alive and well. I felt like I was growing up in the 60's.''
The new history of the American West incorporates the post-Vietnam mood. It reflects the willingness of the 60's generation to find the invisible worm eating away at the once blushing rose of the American self-image. And who is to say that is a bad thing? Nobody who has read the works of Worster, Limerick, White and others would disparage the seriousness of their scholarship. And it is hard to look at those photographs of ghost towns without sharing some of Patricia Limerick's Gibbonesque gloom. Sentimental illusions are not a good basis for national creeds, and certainly the creed of the West has been among the most sentimental of all. But it is useful to bear in mind that, just as Turner and the Turnerians were products of their time, the most optimistic period in American history, so too are the new historians. They are products of a more complicated, more ambivalent epoch, one that has led many of their generation to look at their country and find it wanting. It's hardly surprising that the new historians, in searching the West for our national origins, for clues to our national character, have found it wanting as well.

HEADLINE: NEWSPAPER COLUMNISTS: LITERATURE BY THE INCH

BYLINE: By KARL E. MEYER; Karl E. Meyer is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Pick up a newspaper anywhere in the United States and you will be addressed by insistent strangers known generically as columnists because each occupies, more or less, a column of newsprint. The term also has an apt association with the I-shaped pillar from which the columnist can harangue the populace - like St. Simeon Stylites of Syria, who spent 30 years preaching from the top of a column in the fifth century. He has come to be the patron of an unruly calling.
Some columnists are local institutions, a few so popular that they are said to own their cities. Many more are syndicated, so that if you travel around the country their eyes seem to follow you from passport-style photographs used to relieve the grayness of Op-Ed pages.
Though the form is common, its pedigree is awesome. Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce ascended from the column, as did H. L. Mencken and Ring Lardner. Mr. Dooley's dialogues, the Uncle Remus tales and George Ade's ''Fables in Slang'' were cradled in newsprint, as was the verse laboriously typed by the cockroach Archy in Don Marquis's cubicle at the old New York Sun. But in our more prosaic age, the most influential practitioners deal with what E. B. White, an occasional columnist, called the political pickle. 
Judgments differ on how much influence senior columnists wield. In 1975, when he himself was still a Washington columnist, Marquis Childs guessed that James Reston of The New York Times had roughly the power of three United States Senators. Three seems a lot. Still, a columnist of rank like Mr. Reston enjoys an obvious advantage over a Senator. Members of Congress are elected; columnists are more like life peers in Britain's House of Lords. This helps explain the resentment on the part of successive Presidents over the need to placate these potentates; there is no two-term limit for a Scotty Reston.
Of modern Presidents, none was more transfixed by columnists than Lyndon Baines Johnson. He courted them incorrigibly with lavish flattery and shoulder-squeezing bonhomie. Once, during a White House news session, he saw Walter Lippmann in the throng; rushing over and grasping him, the President all but shouted: ''This man here is the greatest journalist in the world, and he's a friend of mine!'' That was in early 1964, when a good many people would have agreed with Johnson. Lippmann had been sought out by nearly every President since Theodore Roosevelt; he was but 26 years old when he drafted Woodrow Wilson's famous Fourteen Points. In 1958, Nikita Khrushchev invited the columnist and his wife, Helen, to a hunting lodge in the Soviet Urals to discuss ways of thawing the cold war (the phrase was introduced by Lippmann). ''Today and Tomorrow,'' Lippmann's column, appeared three times a week in more than 200 newspapers, and by common consent his lucid treatises were read and pondered by an influential elite no President could ignore. In his years at the pinnacle, he was interviewed annually by CBS television, an eminence accorded to no other journalist, before or since. In his reckoning of columnists, Marquis Childs described Lippmann as Supreme Pontiff.
Alas, the honeymoon ended badly. That any journalist might differ purely on the merits with his policies was a notion Johnson never seriously entertained. He had courted Lippmann's support ardently, attending the columnist's 75th-birthday party and instructing his aides to show him drafts of forthcoming Presidential speeches. But Lippmann was a sphere-of-influence conservative who at first doubted, then dissented from, the Administration belief that vital United States interests were at risk in Vietnam. As ''Today and Tomorrow'' became increasingly critical, the President became testier, to the point of having his staff comb through old columns in quest of blunders by the Supreme Pontiff - these were then maliciously read aloud at White House dinner parties. By this time, the White House was scoffing that Lippmann had reverted to isolationism, prompting an impassioned reply, ex cathedra, that conveys something of Lippmann's grand manner:
''A mature great power will make measured and limited use of its power. It will eschew the theory of a global and universal duty which not only commits it to unending wars of intervention but intoxicates its thinking with the illusion that it is a crusader for righteousness, that each war is a war to end all war. Since in this generation we have become a great power, I am in favor of learning to behave like a great power, of getting rid of the globalism which would not only entangle us everywhere but is based on the totally vain notion that if we do not set the world in order, no matter what the price, we cannot live in the world safely. If we examine this idea thoroughly, we shall see that it is nothing but the old isolationism of our innocence in a new form. Then we thought we had to preserve our purity by withdrawal from the ugliness of great power politics. Now we sometimes talk as if we could preserve our purity only by policing the globe.''
As such admonitions became more insistent, communications ceased between President and Pontiff, and soon senior officials boycotted social events at which Lippmann might be present. On May 25, 1967, Lippmann wrote his farewell column, explaining that after 36 years of ''Today and Tomorrow'' he no longer felt the need to find out ''what the blood pressure is at the White House, and who said what and saw who and who is listened to and who is not listened to.'' Two days later, the Lippmanns sailed for Europe, departing permanently from a capital that had grown too small for a columnist and a President. The point of the story is that it could have occurred in no other country. Where else does any chief of state care that much about the judgment of a journalist? And Walter Lippmann was scarcely an isolated case; there was also his longtime rival, Joseph Alsop.
The Indochina war that Lippmann opposed Alsop supported, indeed even helped start by hectoring successive administrations to take up France's burden after the fall of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Lippmann and Alsop appeared on alternate days in The Washington Post, and their clash provided something like the continuing duel between Government and Opposition benches in the House of Commons. But Alsop had an insider's advantage: he was the good friend and Georgetown neighbor of John F. Kennedy, on whom he had a profound influence. A firm believer in global policing, Alsop became certain in the late 1950's that a deadly ''missile gap'' was widening, and that the United States was lagging perilously behind the Soviet Union in the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Kennedy seized on the issue, and brushed aside President Dwight D. Eisenhower's protestations that the ''gap'' was grievously overstated. When Kennedy became President in 1961, he found that Ike was right. It made no difference. The new Administration proposed and won approval for the biggest peacetime increase up to that time in defense spending, thereby propelling an arms race that came to feed on itself without journalistic assistance. It is true that Alsop was not alone in pressing the missile issue on Kennedy, but the columnist knew better than others how to get under a politician's skin by turning a strategic argument into a test of manhood. Lyndon Johnson was once heard to murmur as he ordered 50,000 more troops to Vietnam, ''There, that should keep Joe Alsop quiet for a while.''
Alsop's younger brother Stewart exerted a different kind of influence, less that of a public philosopher or needling debater than of a shrewd family lawyer dispensing good sense. Stewart Alsop initially teamed up with Joseph when the Alsops launched ''Matter of Fact'' in 1946, then parted a decade later and eventually conducted his own column in Newsweek, occupying the pulpit that had been created for Lippmann in 1962. In a turbulent era, he had the knack of catching a mood and guessing what it meant with ''but-of-course'' reasoning. During Watergate, he came up with a sound explanation for the strange behavior of those embroiled in the scandal: ''My theory derives from the peculiar relationship between two minority categories in the human race - the crazy-brave and the phony-tough. Most people who have been in a war, and a lot of people who haven't, have come across specimens of both breeds. The crazy-brave, who are a lot rarer than the phony-tough, are always doing crazy things that ought to get them killed, or at least maimed, but nothing seems to happen to them. They also exercise a kind of hex or double whammy on the phony-tough, and they keep getting the phony-tough into terrible trouble.''
The Watergate crazy-brave was G. Gordon Liddy, who offered to kill himself when the break-in misfired, and who once threatened to kill a wide-eyed Jeb Stuart Magruder if his hand was not instantly taken from Liddy's shoulder. Thus, Stewart Alsop reasoned, the phony-toughs who dominated the Nixon White House were too smart to give an unambiguous green light to the harebrained idea of breaking into Democratic headquarters, but were too craven to stand up to the crazy-brave. Similarly, Lieut. Col. Oliver North was the crazy-brave Marine years later who hexed his phony-tough White House superiors during the Iran-contra affair - or so theorized two professors who had clipped and saved the Alsop column and quoted its argument in a Washington Post Op-Ed article that began: ''One of the enduring frustrations of journalism is the short half-life of the column, with the result that insights provided by the occasional exceptional column are eventually lost to future generations.''
I understood their lament. My father, Ernest L. Meyer, wrote a column six days a week for 15 years, first for The Capital Times of Madison, Wis., then for The New York Post. In Wisconsin, my father was telegraph editor as well, and wrote his daily piece after locking up the final afternoon edition. He used a copy pencil for a longhand draft, then typed hunt-and-peck to exact space. He did something different every day, mixing commentary with light verse, parodies or recollections of his boyhood in Milwaukee, his first newspaper job (in Warden, Wash., for $4 a week plus board), his student years at the state university or whatever. Wherever he went, the column went along: on European trips, summers in Cape Cod, visits to Washington or Hollywood or with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin. Like many other columnists, he delighted in exploiting his wife and progeny - myself, my brother Leonard and sister Susan - as walk-on extras whose prattling provided the ever-essential ''peg.''
After my father died in 1952, I came into possession of his scrapbooks, the potter's field of journalism. Some years later, having made my own way into the same business, I went carefully through these scrapbooks, better able to judge the skill and stamina that went into writing a fixed quota of literate prose every day, with no time allowed for indisposition. And it saddened me, not just on my father's account, to reflect how much first-rate work vanished into the common dustbin.
So I decided to attempt an anthology. My first surprise was the sheer number of columnists. By my reckoning, the feature syndicates and major newspapers distribute the offerings of 200 columnists, most of them writing two or three times a week. Then there are the local columnists - light essayists, gossipmongers, specialized writers on chess or cooking, sports columnists, cracker-barrel wits, political pundits or whatever - on 1,700 daily newspapers, 2,400 weeklies, 14,000 newsletters, 4,700 magazines, 3,000 specialized international publications, 900 ethnic and foreign-language periodicals, and nobody knows how many student newspapers, daily and weekly. In America, it is fair to say, at least 15,000 columnists compose short signed articles at regular intervals - a truly vast garrulous army feeding on the depleting forests of Canada.
Its ranks have been swelled by exalted political figures. The two Presidential Roosevelts, Calvin Coolidge, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan have this much in common with Eleanor Roosevelt, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Fiorello La Guardia, Henry Wallace, Harold Ickes and Fighting Bob La Follette - each sought for a while to improve the American mind through the medium of a newspaper or magazine column (in Mrs. Roosevelt's case, she did both simultaneously, writing for the Scripps-Howard newspapers and Woman's Home Companion).
Interestingly, the column continues to flourish, notwithstanding the supposed decline of the print medium and the rise of electronic journalism. Television, if anything, has given syndicated columnists more influence, plus a celebrity status useful in commanding vast speaking fees. During the reign of radio, Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson hawked their revelations on weekly broadcasts, and Franklin Pierce Adams enjoyed an autumnal renown as a panelist on ''Information, Please,'' an early-day quiz program stressing wit more than prizes. But this only feebly adumbrated the star status of columnists who, beginning in the 1970's, became fixtures on current-affairs talk shows: George Will, Carl Rowan, Tom Wicker, William F. Buckley Jr., Ellen Goodman, to name a few. Thus the shrinkage of a literate audience has been offset by the gain in the columnist's reach and influence.
Columnists, in short, have benefited the land of the free by contributing, as Lippmann did, to what President Bush has called ''the vision thing.'' More commonly, they have been energetic advocates exerting influence through the quality of their arguments and their independence from an electorate that has learned to put up with them. They have from time to time added sparkle and sense to the national discourse, disseminating phrases that quickly became commonplace (''egghead,'' ''middle America,'' ''cold war''). And having been given a license to be rude, reckless, silly and prejudiced, the columnist can in a single effusion entertain at breakfast and after dinner provide the stuff for postprandial argument.
Over the years, to be sure, the column's literary texture has changed. Good light verse abounded two generations ago; even good doggerel is a rarity today. Who today can match Ring Lardner's ear for what George Ade called ''the sweet vernacular''? And there's nobody with the obsessive perfectionism of Don Marquis, who crowded his ''Sun Dial'' sketches with a host of imagined characters. ''I got to seeing that column,'' Marquis remarked ruefully, ''as a grave, 23 inches long, into which I buried part of myself every day.''
Still, it is always the best of times and the worst of times in the world of journalism, where golden ages tend to be embalmed in memory and unconsulted archives. Thus E. B. White, ruminating on the excellence of Don Marquis, declared that the newspaper column had grievously degenerated:
''In 1916 to hold a job on a daily paper, a columnist was expected to be something of a scholar and poet, or if not a poet at least to harbor the soul of a transmigrated poet. Nowadays, to get a columning job a man need only have the soul of a Peep Tom or a third-rate prophet. There are plenty of loud clowns and bad poets at work on papers today, but there are not many columnists adding to belles lettres, and certainly there is no Don Marquis. . . . Mr. Marquis's cockroach was more than the natural issue of a creative and humorous mind. Archy was the child of compulsion, the stern compulsion of journalism. The compulsion is as great today as it ever was, but is met in a different spirit. Archy used to come back from the golden companionship of the tavern with the poet's report of life as seen from the under side. Today's columnist returns from the platinum companionship of the night club with a dozen pieces of watered gossip and a few bottomless anecdotes. Archy returned carrying a heavy load of wine and dreams. These later cockroaches come sober from their taverns, carrying a basket of fluff.''
So it seemed to White in 1950, yet one may reasonably wonder if he did not put his thumb on the scales. For every Don Marquis, there were a hundred third-rate poets and insipid paragraphers. There were no political columnists with the grace of a James Reston, the acerbity of a Murray Kempton or the craft of a George Will. Even as the number of newspapers shrank, the boundaries of discourse widened, so that a Miss Manners or an Anna Quindlen have been able to write unblushingly about hitherto unmentionable matters, in and out of wedlock. And an age rich in B's - Baker, Buchwald, Breslin, Bombeck and Buckley - may in hindsight be seen as not entirely contemptible, perhaps even as a silver age.
In an anthology of essays compiled long ago J. B. Priestley offered an important truth:
''To anyone with any knowledge of literary history, there is nothing more amusing than the not infrequent complaint of critics and reviewers, who imagine that they are standing for the dignity of letters, against the practice of collecting contributions to the Press, essays or critical articles, and making books of them.
''We are always led to infer that this is a new and reprehensible practice, a mark of a degenerate age. The truth is, of course, that all the best essays in the language have first seen the light in the periodical press. . . . The economic influence is easy to understand. What is not so easy to understand is the influence this periodical work has upon the essayist's attitude of mind. . . . When a man is writing regularly in one place for one set of readers (and nearly all the essayists were regular contributors to the Press, appearing in the same periodical at regular intervals), he tends to lose a certain stiffness, formality, self-consciousness, that would inevitably make its appearance if he were writing a whole book alone.
''He comes to feel that he is among friends and can afford as it were to let himself go, and the secret of writing a good essay is to let oneself go. . . . It also encourages him to focus his attention upon passing little things that he might have disdained were he not writing for the next week's paper. He is a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, and it is his pleasure and privilege to glimpse the significance of such trifles, so that for a second we see them, surprisingly, against the background of the Eternities.''
What Priestley expressed was itself a glimpse of a not-so-obvious truth about the fruitful communion between writer and audience. There's nothing shameful about journalism as a venue for letters. Without overstating the claims for what is at best an uneven popular art, one can say that in the voice of the columnists one can hear, if at times discordantly, the joyful voice of a free people.
 
 This essay is adapted from the introduction to Karl E. Meyer's anthology, ''Pundits, Poets and Wits: An Omnibus of American Newspaper Columns,'' which will be published next month.
 
 
 
HITLER WASN'T KIDDING
From Dorothy Thompson's ''On the Record'' column, March 15, 1939:
 As anyone who reads ''Mein Kampf'' carefully . . . must see, Naziism . . . is nothing more or less than the kernel of a movement which will theoretically come to rest nowhere until it has established the supremacy of the Teutonic and allied races over the earth, reducing the rest to vassalage. . . . For it now appears that Hitler lays claim to the whole territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, in which non-Germans outnumber Germans in the ratio of four to one. . . . He believes that this territory consists of inferior Slavs, Magyars and other not quite white people who should be ruled by . . . the Germans.
It is now possible to see . . . that he really means this. . . . There was Czechoslovakia: a well-organized, on the whole prosperous, well-governed, liberal state. . . . Since last September this state has been pulverized. . . . Poland . . . will be, probably, the next state to be smashed. . . . There will be a continuance of the provocation of the Polish minority in Danzig in the hope that this will bring retaliations against Germans. . . . There will be a mobilization on the Polish border; another ultimatum. . . . The whole of southern and eastern Europe is in for this pulverization and plunder process.

THE HOUSE OF MORGAN
An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance.
By Ron Chernow.
Illustrated. 812 pp. New York:
A Morgan Entrekin Book/
Atlantic Monthly Press. $29.95.
Who knows what's really happening on Wall Street? The huge buyouts, the big bankruptcies, the gyrating stock market, the tenuous dollar have everyone uneasy. Even experts would welcome a calm, objective historical perspective. With ''The House of Morgan,'' Ron Chernow, who once directed financial policy studies at the Twentieth Century Fund, provides just that, and much more. 
Using the firm started by Junius Spencer Morgan - the firm that in the 1930's split into the commercial bank of Morgan Guaranty Trust, the investment bank of Morgan Stanley and the British merchant bank of Morgan Grenfell - Mr. Chernow takes us on an extraordinary journey spanning generations and continents. It is a saga of incredible cunning, as when J. P. Morgan Sr., the founder's son, learned to control American companies around the turn of the century by creating and dominating groups of their bondholders, or when, eight decades later, the three Morgan firms all learned to play the tough, slash-and-burn takeover game better than anyone else. It is a story of noble triumphs, as when the Morgan partners led the effort to tap European money to build the American railroads, or when they mounted successful campaigns to keep Britain and Japan on the gold standard before World War II. It is also a tale of greed and deception, as when the house bought unused rifles from the United States Government during the Civil War and promptly sold them back to the Army at six times the original price, or when, in the days before strong Federal regulation caught up with them, Morgan partners sold stock to friends at below-market prices before those securities were issued to the public.
What was it that made the Morgan name the most powerful in 20th-century finance, surpassing even that of the Rothschilds? Partly, it was circumstance. The business was started in London in the 1830's, trading American bonds in Europe to finance expanding industry in the United States. England gave the House of Morgan a European elegance, instilled it with a tradition of old-fashioned service and provided it with entree to the European upper classes that, for the next half century, were the world's big lenders. As the representative of those with money, the bank gained leverage over the American borrowers who desperately needed capital to grow - the railroads, the steel companies, the manufacturers of heavy equipment. It was a short step from there to gaining control over a vast industrial empire.
In addition, the Morgans had the talent and the style to earn the respect of the rest of the financial community, which looked to them and their partners to lead whenever the stock market crashed, whenever the dollar needed a prop and whenever New York City needed a bailout (the first time was 1907). As triumph followed triumph, reflected in unrivaled art collections and opulent yachts, the legend grew, propagated by talented partners who not only carried on the day-to-day work, but themselves became confidants of kings, Presidents and dictators. Even the ire of reformers like Louis Brandeis and William O. Douglas, both of whom would later be Supreme Court Justices, or the ranting of populist Congressmen and senators could do little to poison the Morgan name.
But ''The House of Morgan'' is much more than a detailed and colorful description of a family and an institution, more than a parting of the curtains on the three secretive Morgan firms. It contains several themes of crucial importance to understanding American finance today.
The first is the changing relationship between financiers and industrial companies. Mr. Chernow explains how the house was able to control corporate America at the turn of the century and how it lost its leverage later on. Yet, taking the story up to the late 1980's, Mr. Chernow describes the direct ownership stake Morgan Stanley has in some 40 companies, with 72,000 employees and over $7 billion in assets (according to Mr. Chernow; Forbes magazine puts the figure at over $20 billion). He also focuses on Morgan Guaranty's willingness to bankroll hostile takeovers of major companies. We are left to ponder whether the relationship between Wall Street and American companies had by late 1989 come full circle.
A second refrain is the seesaw of power between Wall Street and Washington. In the early 1900's the moneymen overwhelmingly controlled the national economy. Later they were reined in by the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and the reforms of the New Deal, and after 1945 they were further constrained by central banks and finance ministries both in the United States and abroad. But is Wall Street once again beyond control? After all, Congress has been groaning about stock market volatility, and it is horrified by the wave of debt-creating leveraged buyouts. Yet the lawmakers seem helpless to do much about these issues.
Mr. Chernow has also used the House of Morgan, with its deep roots in London and New York, as a lens for observing the uneasy relationships between nations that are big lenders and those that are big borrowers. He begins with the 19th century, when the United States was in heavy debt to foreign lenders, and traces the transition to the time when the country became the major - the only - banker to the world. Now, of course, history has repeated itself: we have become the world's largest debtor, our palm held out to Europe and Japan for all the funds we can get.
Finally, the story of the Morgan empire is a tale of several extraordinary people. Junius imbued the bank with the best of patrician values. J. P. Morgan Sr. and J. P. Morgan Jr. both became household names. From the period before World War I up to the Eisenhower years, the Morgan partners Tom Lamont and Russell Leffingwell conducted financial diplomacy between the White House and the highest officials of England, France, Germany, Japan and Mexico, giving the House of Morgan truly global status. Mr. Chernow leads us to wonder whether Wall Street's shortage of public-spirited leaders at the present time is in part responsible for its current demoralization, lack of standards and growing ill repute.
Certainly, Mr. Chernow believes that the Morgan firms have become like their competitors - predatory bankers with little concern for anything but the bottom line - only much better at the game. He concludes that they have squandered their former reputation of being unswervingly loyal financiers to the world's most respected companies. But he seems ambivalent about whether this could have been avoided in the modern era, dominated as it is by deregulated markets and ferocious competition.
''The House of Morgan'' is no expose, being free of gossip and the kind of backstabbing that usually takes place when writers interview former partners or competitors. But neither is it dry. Mr. Chernow has managed to get close to his characters in their business achievements, and in the anguish of their personal lives too. The story is beautifully balanced. The author is respectful of the enormous power wielded by the Morgan men, but he is also often skeptical of their motives. He extols the accomplishments of certain partners, but he highlights as well the egregious lapses of judgment and the moral flaws of the executives, including the deep strains of anti-Semitism in the Morgan culture.
As a portrait of finance, politics and the world of avarice and ambition on Wall Street, the book has the movement and tension of an epic novel. It is, quite simply, a tour de force.
 
 
 
PIERPONT TO THE RESCUE
 [J. P. Morgan Sr.'s] power flourished during the steep industrial recession that began in 1893. Over fifteen thousand commercial firms failed in a contraction that led to class warfare and quasi-revolutionary strife. . . . Every company that failed and was reorganized by a bank ended up the bank's captive client. In 1892, General Electric had been formed through a consolidation of the Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric. When the new company failed the next year, Pierpont rescued it and thus insured GE's future loyalty to the House of Morgan.
Oppressed by debt and overbuilding, more than a third of the country's railway trackage fell into receivership, and English investors exhorted Pierpont to bring order to the industry. Thwarted by gentleman's agreements, Pierpont now tried another approach to forming railway cartels: he would reorganize bankrupt roads and transfer control to himself. Then he wouldn't be at the whim of government or feuding railway chiefs. In reorganizing railways, he ascended to a new plateau of power, beyond what any other private businessman had yet achieved.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Testing the 'Bump' in Bumpers

 BODY:
There were some good things about my first car. For one thing it cost $125. I traded in savings bonds for it, actually what we called war bonds when my grandmother bought them for me.
Another good thing, the car got terrific mileage, and that was important in the days when you could pull into a service station and reasonably ask for a buck's worth of gas. 
The car was the same age as me, a 16-year-old 1936 Ford with an 85-horsepower V8. It had a body that seemed to be made of cast iron. It was quick and tough and cheap, and it started on the first click of the foot starter - when the battery wasn't dead.
But live electrons didn't matter, because the car also started with a simple push on a bumper that was made for pushing. And (aha!) we finally get to the point. Because that car had spring steel bumpers, front and rear, and there was never a question about damage unless you ran the thing full-tilt into a brick wall.
That is not true of today's automobiles, and a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety bears out what we all know: tap a new car and you are tapping your bank account.
I must confess that I am less than fond of the Insurance Institute. It is a lobby supported by insurance companies, and I have always thought of it as a no-fun, ax-to-grind bunch that would have us wear steel helmets while driving 10 miles an hour in the fast lane.
All the same, these guys seem to be on to something this time, and the findings in the accompanying chart show that tests on 16 small 1990 sedans resulted in extensive damage. That is hardly surprising; what is surprising is the pricetag for the sort of minor damage that happens every day in shopping-center parking lots.
The institute's bumper-bashing is performed annually, and the Arlington, Va., organization says it is meant ''to provide an indication of the relative performance of bumpers on popular models.'' The tests involve driving the cars into front and rear flat barriers, hitting angle barriers and imposing a rear ''pole impact,'' all at 5 miles an hour.
The car that fared best this year was the Honda Civic DX, whose damage in the four tests totaled $769. The car that performed worst was the Daihatsu Charade SE, with five times as much damage at $3,838.
It is hard to relate even the first of those figures to a car that is essentially an econobox. But Brian O'Neill, president of the Institute, laid the numbers at the feet of the Federal Government, faulting it for rolling back requirements for stronger bumpers in 1982.
''The whole point of bumpers is to bump at low speeds without damage,'' he said. ''But every bumper we tested this year did a poor job of preventing damage and some were downright lousy.''
Moreover, he said, there is no way for consumers to tell which cars have bumpers that are merely poor and those which have bumpers that are all but useless. When the requirement for zero damage was dropped to 2.5 from 5 m.p.h., he said, the Department of Transportation promised that consumers would be supplied with performance figures, allowing the marketplace to determine an apt cost for protection.
That never happened, O'Neill said, so the organization began to test on its own.
Part of the idea behind the tests also is to keep the heat on the automakers, O'Neill said, adding that many manufacturers ''aren't taking this pocketbook issue seriously.''
For example, he said, Hyundai weakened the bumpers on its Excel during production of the 1990 models. A 1990 Excel made before the change sustained $562 damage in the rear-into-pole test. The same model with the weaker bumpers sustained $721 damage.
''Consumers couldn't find the bumper change on the Excel even if they looked for it,'' he said. ''But it means newer Excels cost more to repair after low-speed crashes.''
There are two sides to the question, of course, and the bumper law, first applied to 1973 models, was intended to preserve the ''safety integrity'' of steering, braking and lighting systems in low-speed mishaps, while simultaneously reducing repair costs.
In practice, though, the law put a drain on consumers' pocketbooks. Compliance by the manufacturers increased car prices. And insurance premiums went up because the energy-absorbing bumpers were costly to repair. They were too heavy, too complex.
It makes a person wonder whatever happened to spring steel.

Luring Business

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
To attract private investment to South Jamaica, Queens, New York State's Urban Development Corporation is teaming up with the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation to come up with benefits that companies might enjoy by moving their operations into that economically depressed neighborhood. The two groups will spend $66,700 over the next eight months on outside consultants who will conduct a feasibility study to see if a seven-acre site at Liberty Avenue near Tuckerton Road could be used for food-processing companies. 
The area is in the South Jamaica Economic Development Opportunity Zone, one of 19 in the state that have been earmarked by the Urban Development Corporation for assistance in bringing in new companies and jobs. Companies with low credit ratings may get help with loans, the state providing up to one-third in low-interest gap financing. In some cases, the state underwrites loans from conventional lenders such as banks. In its three years, the program for high-risk companies has helped secure $35 million in loans, of which $5 million is in default.
Vincent Tese, the U.D.C. chairman, calls the three-year-old Jamaica zone singularly successful. He said 115 companies have opened operations there for a total investment of $81 million.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: New Houses in Newark;
Seeking Out the Middle-Income Buyers

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A RESURGENCE in home building under way in Newark over the last two years is about to take a new turn toward one- to four-family houses. This is the likely result of the New Jersey Legislature's authorization last year of five-year tax abatements for them in urban areas.
''Hundreds of small operators that own small lots will build, mainly two-family houses selling in the $160,000-to-$170,000 range,'' said Manuel Rosa, a broker who works with many small builders.
But so far it is the town-house condominium - for which abatements have long been available - that is the for-sale product-of-the-day in Newark. And for a city with a reputation as a citadel of the poor, the number of them is surprising. Newark ranks 781st in per-capita income among the 785 municipalities of the 31-county tristate region, the Rutgers University Regional Report found last year. 
About a third of the 2,000 new housing units built in Newark from 1986 to 1989 serve a low- to moderate-income population. That construction gets the benefit either of state housing grants or fund transfers from wealthier towns seeking to meet their regional obligations to generate low- and moderate-income housing under state law. These are called regional contribution agreements.
For the rest of the production there are no income limits on buyers. This market-rate housing typically sells to families earning at least $35,000, and often there are two incomes bringing total household income above $50,000. The housing gets no direct public assistance in the form of capital grants, but it almost always gets significant property-tax abatements from the City Council.
Formulas written into state law determine how much abatement can be granted. For housing that is for sale on urban renewal land, property taxes may be set by the municipality at 2 percent of the total construction cost, including land, for 30 years. Abatements on land outside urban-renewal areas run for only five years.
Abatements are the key to new-home construction in Newark. By holding taxes down to perhaps $2,000 a unit instead of $5,000 on a $100,000 condominium, for example, the city leaves buyers with the resources to carry a mortgage covering 90 percent of the purchase price. And middle-income first-time buyers are finding the new condominium affordable in Newark when it is out of reach, because of high taxes, in the suburbs.
''We are seeing a consistent pattern of people moving back into the city,'' said Joseph Sheridan, mortgage officer with the Norstar Mortgage Company in Woodbury, N.J. ''Forty percent of the buyers we are servicing in Newark are coming from outside the city. Half of them are relocating from another region and the other half are from the suburbs buying a home for the first time.''
About half these middle-income buyers are black. The rest come from a mixture of racial and ethnic backgrounds.
The most ambitious private endeavor that has blossomed in the environment of low taxes and low-cost land is the Society Hill at University Heights project of K. Hovnanian Enterprises, the big national building company based in Red Bank, N.J. In two years Hovnanian has completed or begun 360 condominiums in the very area that was devastated by the race riots of 1967.
Market-rate units - 85 percent of the total - sell for about $90,000 to $100,000 ($111,400 to $120,000 if the buyer takes all the available extras). Eventually there will be 1,200 units over 40 neatly manicured acres of urban land, an average density of 30 units to the acre. Most of the current buyers are households of two or three with annual earnings between $45,000 and $50,000.
''We're bullish about housing growth in Newark,'' says Ara K. Hovnanian, president of the company.
WHILE condominium production has wound down in the suburbs, it marches forward on land Hovnanian continues to buy. In the most recent purchase Hovnanian paid about $4,900 a unit - $495,000 for 3.2 acres of land for 102 units off Springfield Avenue. Two years ago the builder was paying only $1,300 a unit.
Currently, city-held land has a fair-market value ranging from $5,000 to $8,000 per buildable housing unit, depending on location, said Harold Lucas, the city's director of development. That is triple the value of three years ago, he said.
Another town-house development, just getting under way in the Central Ward, shows the expansion of housing activity to the very heart of downtown, with a house that is intended for a still higher income-level of buyer than at Society Hill. It is called the Commons at Arlington Street.
Banking on a location close to major institutions and employers - the offices of The Newark Star-Ledger, the city Health and Welfare Department building, St. Benedict's Prep School, the Arts High School, among others - it is seeking buyers able to pay $134,000 to $138,000 for a 2,200-square-foot, three-level house. Buyers are likely to have household incomes between $50,000 and $70,000.
The Commons will bring 90 new housing units to three-and-a-half acres of land off Court Street near the Star-Ledger offices, across the street from a low-rise co-op called University Court. Arlington Street runs down the center of the new development.
There will be 50 factory-built single-family houses, all 25 feet by 28 feet, produced by Avis Homes Company of Avis, Pa., trucked to Newark and mounted on site-built foundations. There are two full living levels in all these houses, with two or three bedrooms and two or two-and-a-half baths. The third, or street, level serves as a basement in half the houses and a one-car garage, with entryway and den, in the other half. The houses with full basements get two outside parking spaces in front and are entered at the second level from a short flight of steps.
A low stone fence will surround the development. The architect is George E. Jones of Johnson Jones Architects in Princeton.
The Commons development also includes the rehabilitation of a former Police Department warehouse building into 40 apartments.
ACCORDING to Wilbert Allen, a joint-venture partner in the development with principals of the Mountain Development Corporation of West Paterson, N.J., the Commons is the first new housing venture in the center of Newark's business district in 25 years. Mr. Allen, a former Newark planning director, is president of Urban Development and Management, based in East Orange, N.J., a developer of modular housing.
The principals of Mountain Development, a developer of commercial and industrial property as well as housing, are L. Robert Lieb, Jeffrey Aidekman and George H. McLoof Jr. The Commons is its first housing venture in Newark.
The 15 houses currently in construction as the first phase are on land obtained from the Newark Housing Authority, which sold it for $48,000, or $3,200 a house. The rest of the site is owned by the city and has yet to be sold.
The project is striking as an effort to capture the middle-income buyer in downtown Newark at prices higher than the town-house norm. These are upgraded houses, many with three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths, all built to permit fireplaces as a $3,500 option, with large walk-in closets in the master bedroom, cathedral ceilings, skylights and generous kitchens.
''Most people want three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths,'' Mr. Allen said.
But will they be able to afford it? That is where tax abatement comes into play. Taxes will be roughly $1,500 a house, compared with three or four times that if they were based on the city's tax rate of $15.37 for every $100 of assessed valuation. Accordingly, two-income families with earnings above $50,000 a year are expected to be able to afford the mortgage payments.
Qualified buyers will be offered State Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency loans, but most buyers are likely to have too high an income to qualify. The current rate for state-assisted loans is 8.725 percent, about 1 1/2 points below the market rate.
These loans usually are used only by low- or moderate-income buyers, however. Hardly any of the market-rate buyers at the Society Hill development use them, and probably few will at the Commons.
''It is a pleasure developing in the city,'' said Mr. McLoof of Mountain Development. ''In the suburbs they fight you every step of the way. We are doing projects in Jersey City, Paterson and Elizabeth.''
Also striking in the Arlington Street development is its low density for the location. In another era, Court and Arlington Street would have been the setting for multifamily construction, with a density of at least 50 units to the acre.
BUT the absence of Federal involvement in housing production means the end of high-density inner-city housing. It cannot be delivered at a low enough price for the market, and the construction risks are too great for a private builder. One-family houses are another matter. Donald Harris, president of Vogue Housing Connection in Newark, said he was planning to build 42 three-bedroom town houses in the North Ward, selling for about $115,000. He hopes to use the new tax abatements authorized by the Legislature for one-to four-family houses.
''There's a slowdown in New Jersey, but Newark won't be affected,'' he said. ''Where can you get land at such a reduced rate? And the Mayor is fast-tracking applications. Slowness adds 30 percent to costs.''

HEADLINE: The Struggle To Preserve Old Churches

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
FOR a quick glimpse of the problem, take a two-minute walk in Brooklyn Heights, New York City's best-preserved enclave of 19th-century brownstones, its first landmark district and a neighborhood with a glut of religious real estate.
Preservationists, clergymen and congregants in this Brooklyn community and others across the nation are struggling to find ways to restore their old churches and synagogues. Organized religion's membership and financial resources have been dwindling for decades, and hundreds of its buildings are scarred by neglect.
Aggressive new fund-raising techniques are being employed. Some congregations have opened their doors to commercial tenants. Others have sold their buildings to developers to be rebuilt into housing or offices. 
In all cases, paying the bills for restoration has required a delicate balance between the goals of worship, community service and preservation.
The difficulties are not new, but deteriorating houses of worship are attracting a fresh surge of attention in communities that range from the impoverished inner cities of the Northeast to small desert hamlets in the Southwest.
''The bills to repair and restore these buildings can be quite staggering,'' said Representative Peter H. Kostmayer, Democrat of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, who held a hearing last week in Philadelphia to explore ways the Federal Government might help finance restoration of religious structures.
IN Brooklyn Heights, with more than a dozen ornate 19th-century churches in less than half a square mile, the tour might start at the corner of Clinton and Montague Streets, where the 146-year-old Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity looks forlorn, its entrances covered by protective sidewalk bridges and four of its 66 stained-glass windows - the earliest detailed, large-scale examples of stained glass produced in the nation - temporarily replaced by plywood.
St. Ann has become a preservationists' cause celebre. About $15 million is needed to complete its restoration over the next 10 years. Its congregation is sharing the landmark sanctuary with a church-related performing arts group, which has booked everything from chamber music to a recent performance by the rock singer Lou Reed, best known for his 1988 hit ''Dirty Boulevard'' and his classic of the 70's, ''Walk on the Wild Side.''
One block south, at the corner of Clinton and Remsen Streets, is the former First Church of Brooklyn, a 140-year-old building. Developers bought it in the early 1980's, restored its exterior and, despite neighborhood protests, rebuilt its interior into cooperative apartments.
Two blocks farther south, at Clinton and Livingston Streets, is the Venetian Gothic St. Anne's Church, designed in the 1860's by Renwick and Sands, the architects of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. The deteriorating building is surrounded by sidewalk bridges.
''This could be a model of the dilemma facing a lot of wonderful landmark churches,'' said Hal Wilke, spokesman for the Packer Collegiate Institute, a neighboring day school that bought the church from the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island in 1968 and uses part of it for classrooms.
But Packer, unable to find uses for all the space in the church, has spent more than a decade looking for someone who could. It has sought other churches that might buy it, and talked to developers who proposed apartments, offices and even a nightclub. So far, the search has been futile.
''It would take enormous dollars to renovate that building,'' said Mr. Wilke. ''Our mission is education, not renovation.''
The problems in Brooklyn Heights are not as severe as those in many poor urban areas.
''It has been a long time since this community had the financial strength to maintain a building like this,'' said the Rev. Isaac Miller, rector of the George W. South Memorial Church of the Advocate, a huge, 100-year-old French Gothic structure in a predominantly black area of North Philadelphia.
The congregation of this Episcopal church has shrunk to less than a third its size before World War II, when its vaulted sanctuary would be filled by more than 700 worshipers on a typical Sunday.
Today its congregation numbers 200. Its financial resources have dwindled even more rapidly with the flight of affluent congregants to the suburbs.
Nonetheless, Mr. Miller said, the church has raised $600,000 in donations, principally from philanthropic foundations in Philadelphia, to repair the badly deteriorated roof. Another fund-raising drive is planned, he added, with a goal of $1 million more to have the facade repointed and waterproofed and to make other long-delayed repairs.
''The building has incredible needs and the only way we can deal with this is with support from beyond our walls,'' Mr. Miller said.
Although paying for expensive restoration work is the overriding problem, the questions sometimes are more complicated. Clergymen say many churches and synagogues, particularly those more than 100 years old, are now far too large for the smaller congregations of the 1990's, and have too few meeting rooms suitable for neighborhood groups, day care, services to the poor and homeless and other functions.
Landmark regulations in many areas have added another layer of complexity. In New York City, designated historic landmarks cannot be torn down without the approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and any work on their exteriors can be done only with the permission of the agency and if it conforms in materials and design with the original structure.
Dozens of churches and synagogues have been given landmark status in the city, but not everyone is pleased by the distinction.
''The question becomes whether we should struggle to maintain a building we would rather not have,'' said Edward C. Horn, pastor of the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, a 100-year-old Methodist church at the corner of 86th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan whose 200 congregrants attend services in a huge, badly dilapidated structure capable of seating 1,200 in its nave.
THE church has been struggling for a decade for approval to demolish and rebuild. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1980, waged an unsuccessful challenge in court to have the designation removed and now plans another challenge under financial ''hardship'' provisions of the city's landmark laws.
Church officials across the nation say membership has been declining most rapidly among long-established denominations, which built most of the large religious structures in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The National Council of Churches, an umbrella organization of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations, said that although the number of people attending church has remained constant over the last 20 years, ''old line denominations,'' including the Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church and the Methodist Church, together have lost more than 5 million members.
Membership in the Roman Catholic Church, the nation's largest Christian denomination, has not fallen off, the group said. But it added that demographic shifts had removed large numbers of Catholics from urban neighborhoods where they had previously supported large old religious buildings.
Representative Kostmayer said one way of tapping Federal support may be to direct the National Parks Service, either through legislation or Congressional pressure, to set aside money to restore important, landmarked religious buildings. The agency has declined such support in the past, saying it might be challenged on constitutional grounds related to the separation of church and state.
Foundations in some regions of the country have been increasing their support. For example, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a preservationist group, established a Fund for Sacred Sites and Properties in 1986, and has so far raised $650,000 from the J. M. Kaplan Fund and other donors to be distributed in grants for the restoration of religious buildings.
The Conservancy's fund has distributed $500,000 in grants to 129 projects. They include the repair of the roof at the Church of the Holy Apostle, a 142-year-old Episcopal church at Ninth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan and the installation of an elevator and other work necessary to improve access for handicapped congregants at the Brotherhood Synagogue, a 131-year-old building originally erected as a Quaker Meeting House on Gramercy Park South.
''The preservationist community recognizes that these churches and synagogues are important structures, and it is putting its money where its mouth is,'' said Edward T. Mohylowski, director of the Fund for Sacred Sites and Properties, which has scheduled an exhibit of photographs of some of the churches it is working with from Thursday through April 14.
The exhibit, ''Landmarks of Hope: Preserving Sacred Sites in the Empire State,'' will be held at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue at 50th Street.
But even with expanding foundation support and calls for assistance from Washington, no one holds out hope that money can be raised to repair and restore all the historic religious structures that are suffering from declining membership and scant financial resources.
''These buildings are immense and complicated, but that is their glory,'' said A. Robert Jaeger, a co-founder of Partners for Historic Places, a nonprofit preservationist group established in Philadelphia last year to advise religious institutions around the country on restoration of their properties.
''Without an awful lot of money, we are going to have to be inventive,'' he added.
One unusual approach is in the blighted Central Ward of Newark, where the 115-year-old Roman Catholic St. Joseph's Church was acquired for $130,000 in the early 1980's by a nonprofit community group. It has since spent $2.5 million in a painstaking restoration of its facade and stained-glass windows and a complete renovation of its interior.
The building has been transformed into St. Joseph's Plaza, a complex of two restaurants, a health spa, a group medical practice and offices for several nonprofit agencies. It is fully leased, with commercial tenants paying enough rent to support other operations of the community group, New Communities, which has built more than 2,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing in Newark.
''The church offered an excellent opportunity to provide something of a unifying force in the Central Ward, a place that had a lot of negative feeling,'' said Bill Linder, a Roman Catholic priest and founder of New Communities. On a typical weekday, the building's health club and restaurants are patronized by a multiracial mix of professionals from the Central Ward and elsewhere in Newark.
Toward the other end of the preservationist spectrum is a project in New Mexico to restore dozens of small 18th- and 19th-century adobe churches and chapels scattered at remote crossroads in the state's rural landscape. Many of the congregations and communities they once supported have dispersed with economic shifts and urbanization.
NANCY ARNON, project director for the New Mexico Community Foundation, a rural economic development group, said 800 of the historic adobe structures have been catalogued, most in need of repair. The principal problem, she said, is that adobe, a mix of soil, sand, water and straw, disintegrates when left to the elements without routine maintenance.
Since organizing a restoration campaign two years ago, she said, her group and others involved in the effort have had little trouble finding volunteer workers. She said hundreds of people with family roots in the rural towns had attended ''work weekends,'' some of them traveling hundreds of miles from their homes in larger Southwestern cities, to work on the churches of their ancestry.
One of the churches that has been almost totally restored is La Capilla de San Antonio, built in 1865 in Chacon, a community with less than 40 families northwest of Santa Fe.
''Work on our church has been a tremendous point of pride for all of us,'' said Mary Romero, an accountant in Chacon who, with her husband, a firefighter, are caretakers of La Capilla de San Antonio. Last year they organized their community to provide food and lodging for dozens of people who visited on 10 work weekends and repaired the badly weathered adobe structure.
 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO RESTORATION
EVEN when religious institutions succeed in raising outside financial support, the process of restoring their buildings can be difficult. Take the case of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, an Episcopal church in Brooklyn Heights.
Renovation of the church, built in the Gothic Revival style in 1844 with the first detailed, large-scale stained-glass windows produced in the nation, has been going on slowly and erratically since 1979 when the New York Landmarks Conservancy began raising money for the work. It raised $300,000. In 1983, when it became clear that a much larger fund-raising campaign would be needed than was originally planned, the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts was created and took over the project. The group's board includes the rector and members of the church, preservationists and an artistic director who books performances in the building.
More than $1 million has so far been raised from individuals and foundations, including a $250,000 grant announced this month by the Getty Foundation of California.
A stained-glass shop has been set up in the rectory, and 13 of the 66 badly deteriorated stained-glass windows have been cleaned and rebuilt. Lower portions of the church's facade have been restored.
But much more work is required, and much more money must be raised. Members of the board of St. Ann Center say it will take $15 million more to complete the restoration of the church. A 10-year plan now being circulated spells out what work is to be done, but provides no assurance the funding can be obtained.
Those in charge of the restoration say the performances in the church, conducted most weekends in its 700-seat sanctuary and a separate auditorium, are an integral part of the effort. Although ticket sales are devoted to the center's support and do not generate enough money to contribute to the restoration unless performances are staged as fund-raising benefits, they say the performing-arts venture has drawn widespread attention to the building from people who otherwise might not have visited it or any other church.
Among performers who have appeared there are Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, a country and western group; John Cale, the avante-garde composer; Mariann Faithfull, the rock singer, and Peter Serkin, the pianist.
''WE sometimes feel as though our space is being invaded,'' said the Rev. William D. Persell, the rector of the church, whose 200 congregants often find themselves sharing space at Sunday morning services with Saturday night's props. ''It is not my mission to produce rock concerts,'' he added. Despite the aggravations, he said the mixed use of the church had succeeded in drawing new members, including young people who first attended performances and later joined the church.
Leaders of the St. Ann Center say the restoration plan, besides the ongoing work on the stained-glass windows and facade, includes replacing the church's heating, electrical and plumbing systems and making alterations in the sanctuary to more efficiently accommodate its combined use for worship and performance.
One plan is for a moveable stage in front of the altar for performers and their props. On Sunday mornings, the stage would be lowered and removed from view. - THOMAS J. LUECK

HEADLINE: TALKING: Rent Rules;
Tenant Rights In Flux

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
TENANT rights, especially in a highly regulated environment like New York City's, are in a constant state of flux. Court decisions, administrative rulings and legislative amendments make it hard for tenants and landlords to keep up with their rights and responsibilities. This is particularly true for the narrowly focused changes that do not make headlines when they are announced.
Several such modifications were made in rent-regulation rules during the last year that may have escaped notice, these among them:
* Landlords have won the right to permanent increases in rent after they complete major capital improvements. 
* A new fraud task force has been established in the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to investigate the filing of fraudulent information by landlords with the division's Office of Rent Administration.
* The right of an elderly person to break a lease to enter a nursing home has been established in law.
There also has been a decision affirming the right of a tenant to make certain improvements in an apartment.
The decision concerning major capital improvements came in November in Ansonia Residents Association v. New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
The State Court of Appeals turned down a challenge from the tenants in the 500-unit building at 2109 Broadway, near 74th Street, who had maintained that any rent increase for large-scale improvements - in this case new storm windows - had to be limited to the recoupment period rather than go on indefinitely.
The tenants had argued that once an owner had recovered his costs, the rent increases should be nullified.
A lower court had agreed with the tenants. But the housing agency and the landlord appealed, resulting in a reversal by the state's highest court.
Nevertheless, if tenants have reason to believe that their rent was raised without the capital improvement's having been made, or that a new and higher rent has been established through other fraudulent means, they may write to the new fraud task force created by the state housing agency (Office of Deputy Commissioner, Office of Rent Administration, D.H.C.R., 9231 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, N.Y. 11433).
Further, as a result of a decision in Versailles Realty Corp. v. D.H.C.R., upheld in the Appellate Division, Second Department, several months ago, regulated tenants in co-op buildings can no longer be charged a higher rent for a major capital improvement if it was paid for by the co-op corporation's reserve fund.
Under two laws that became effective late last year, the elderly all over New York State now have the right to break a lease without incurring penalties. Both are designed to protect an elderly tenant who wants to move into housing for the elderly or a nursing home during the term of a lease.
If the tenant is entering a publicly funded nursing home or nonprofit housing unit, the minimum age for qualification is 62 years; if the new accommodations are in the private sector - say, an age-restricted condominium - the minimum eligibility age rises to 65.
Thirty to 60 days' notice, depending on circumstances, must be given in both instances. Some leases signed before 1989, or in the early part of the year, may not qualify.
Lawyers note that such legislation is likely to become increasingly important to older tenants in expensive apartments now that the market for high-rent accommodations is soft. With fewer tenants seeking such apartments, landlords are less likely to be forgiving when an elderly tenant wants to break a lease.
Without the new protection, the accumulated sum due over the remainder of the lease could cost a tenant thousands of dollars.
LAST October, a decision was handed down that could deter landlords from initiating capricious eviction actions. Garay v. Devine involved a tenant in a Manhattan apartment who had installed new kitchen appliances without the landlord's consent. Reversing a lower-court decision, the Appellate Term, First Department, ruled that the landlord could not evict the tenant because the change did not materially damage the unit or its value.
According to Deborah Davis, a New York City lawyer who handles many landlord-tenant cases, this decision should deter landlords from starting eviction actions based on paltry violations of lease terms.
''But it still means that you cannot go ahead and make structural changes without permission,'' she warned.
Warren Estes, a New York City lawyer with expertise in landlord-tenant matters, warns tenants that owners are becoming more aggressive in seeking the rents due them.
''In today's economy, and with higher amounts outstanding,'' Mr. Estes said, ''most landlords are watching their delinquencies more closely.''
He has noticed that landlords are demanding the full rent due on a lease while tenant complaints are being adjudicated, and the courts are supporting their demands.
In part, many lawyers say, owners are reacting to the long delays, sometimes as long as two years, in getting decisions from the state rent agency on tenant allegations of rent overcharges. In such cases, tenants had been withholding rents. Now owners are seeking evictions for the rent delinquencies.
In many of these cases, the courts are now directing tenants to pay the disputed amount into escrow accounts until their complaints are resolved.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Downtown Brooklyn;
Two Tall Office Towers Planned on a Single Block

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
AT once symbiotic and competitive, two enormous commercial projects, within 60 feet of one another on a single block in downtown Brooklyn, have emerged from complex negotiations and are now in the final stretch of the city's review procedure.
It is by no means guaranteed that either will get built - both are in need of major tenants - although city officials and the two developers speak optimistically about the continuing demand for the kind of space they will offer: large, relatively cheap and close to a lot of transportation.
The two buildings would be on a large block bounded by Jay, Adams and Willoughby Streets and Tech Place, on which Family Court and the New York City Transit Authority headquarters are already situated.
At the northeast corner would be 330 Jay Street, a 473-foot tower, the second tallest in Brooklyn, whose architect likens it to a column from an ancient Egyptian temple. Developed by Forest City Ratner Companies of Manhattan and designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's New York office, it would have 1.1 million square feet, about equal to the Chrysler Building. 
Forest City Ratner is also developing the Metrotech commercial and academic complex, on the other side of Jay Street. In return for giving up two sites within Metrotech for development by the Chase Manhattan Bank, Forest City Ratner received from the city the right to build at 330 Jay Street. That is now the site of a seven-story center of the Human Resources Administration, which has been largely vacated.
Directly south of 330 Jay Street would rise Renaissance Plaza, a 23-story office tower atop a seven-story base with a 384-room Hilton Hotel. The structure would be built by the Muss Development Company of Forest Hills, Queens, and designed by William B. Tabler Architects of Manhattan. The office tower would have 700,000 square feet, the hotel 350,000 square feet.
Although both buildings would have 30 stories, the difference in floor-to-ceiling heights would make the Ratner tower 75 feet higher than Muss's and second on the Brooklyn skyline only to the 512-foot Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building.
Both Joshua L. Muss, a principal in Muss Development, and Bruce Ratner, the president of Forest City Ratner, were asked whether the other's development was a help or a hindrance.
''We want that hotel very, very badly,'' Mr. Ratner said, speaking about the Hilton on Mr. Muss's site. ''It's very important for our Metrotech center. We'll do everything we can to help Josh land a tenant.''
Did Mr. Ratner mean that he would not mind if a tenant chose Renaissance Plaza over 330 Jay Street? ''I can't honestly say I'd rather see it,'' he answered. ''There are some tenants that we'll obviously both go after.''
Instead, Mr. Ratner said: ''A tenant usually latches on to a building. Once they latch on, we don't try to fight like the dickens to get that tenant out of Josh's building.''
''We collaborated for very good reasons,'' Mr. Muss said. ''We're both advocates and anxious that downtown Brooklyn be developed. Critical mass is important. Second of all, we're a hotel. And hotels thrive on office space. The more office space, the more the hotel thrives. Keep in mind that we were very anxious to see that Chase settled in, too.''
IT has not always been sweetness and light. Renaissance Plaza was already on the drawing board when Mr. Muss read in newspapers that Forest City Ratner would develop 330 Jay Street - between his tower and a ''sweeping and unbelievable view'' of the Manhattan skyline.
''There was more than a little discussion,'' Mr. Muss said, with more than a little understatement. After prolonged negotiations, he emerged with an agreement that would limit the width of the development at 330 Jay Street, so that it would not form a ''Great Wall of China'' across the north side of his site. Also, he picked up another 100,000 square feet of space for his development, as the result of a rezoning prompted by the Ratner project.
''We need both the Ratner development and the Muss development,'' said Karen Burkhardt, acting director of the Brooklyn office of the City Planning Department. ''I'm glad we were able to find a way to accommodate both.''
''The revival of Brooklyn is real but it is still somewhat tenuous,'' she said. ''Given the state of the economy, we are not blase about it. City agencies still need to encourage and foster redevelopment.''
What the city is doing in the case of the Ratner and Muss developments is making available a property-tax exemption of 100 percent for 13 years, with a phase-in of 10 percent a year after that.
It is granting a 12-year abatement of the commercial occupancy tax and a 12-year tax credit of $500 a year for every employee that a tenant moves from Manhattan into the Brooklyn developments. Tenants would also save money through a tax credit that the city estimates would reduce their energy bills by 30 percent.
''There is a need for large floor plates, for technologically sophisticated space and also a need for low-cost office space,'' said Anthony Mannarino, executive vice president of the Public Development Corporation. ''Will the market have an effect? Clearly it does, but those factors will remain. These buildings will be very attractive.''
Besides competing with Manhattan and New Jersey and Mr. Muss, Mr. Ratner is competing with himself, in a sense. He had to make 330 Jay Street distinctive from Metrotech. ''It is our headquarters building,'' he said. ''It is the best located of any site. It is the most highly designed. It is for front offices, for a tenant looking for an identity.''
David M. Childs, a partner in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, said 330 Jay Street would ''not try to mimic the pyramid tops'' of the Metrotech buildings or the One Pierrepont Plaza tower at Pierrepont Street and Cadman Plaza West. Indeed, its roofline cornice would splay outward, recalling a much different Egyptian motif: the papyrus-form columns from the Temple of Amon at Karnak.
Mr. Childs described the underlying design philosophy:
''It shouldn't look like a relocated Wall Street, Manhattan building. Brooklyn architecture has historically been big, robust, early 20's warehouses, industrial buildings, telephone buildings - which I love. It is a much brawnier, stronger architecture. It is not effete.''
AS originally designed, 330 Jay Street was 505 feet tall, only seven feet shy of the Williamsburgh building. Mr. Ratner was asked whether he ever considered proposing the tallest tower in Brooklyn.
''We're not into that,'' he answered. ''We don't have to be the tallest, as long as it gets up and built.''
Before that happens, the City Planning Commission would have to approve several actions, which it expects to vote on by the end of the month.
The northern part of the block would be rezoned to increase the allowable floor-area ratio to 10, from the current 6. (In a zone with a ratio of 6, the owner of a 100,000 square foot parcel could build a 600,000-square-foot structure; with a ratio of 10, the building could have 1 million square feet.) The commission must also approve the disposition of the city-owned land to the Public Development Corporation, which would lease it to the developer for 99 years, at a rent equal to 10 percent of the appraised value of the land. And the commission must approve special permits affecting the tower's height and setbacks and allowing construction on the site of a 320-space parking garage.
Further, a special permit that was already granted to Mr. Muss's project would have to be modified to allow for the increase in usable floor space. Ms. Burkhardt said the extra bulk would fit within the overall dimensions as originally approved, because the amount of space used for mechanical purposes had been reduced.
The Muss project would take the place of a small, modestly landscaped park called Columbus Plaza. But Ms. Burkhardt said there were already some 10 acres of parks and plazas in the vicinity.
Community Board 2 has voted in favor of the project. ''Downtown Brooklyn is meant to be developed,'' said Jerry Renzini, the chairman of the local board. ''It's at the crossroads, it's centrally located for all services and the space is there.''

9TH-CENTURY MASTERS
Works of two 19th-century New England masters may be seen in a dual exhibition opening today at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. ''John Twachtman: Connecticut Landcapes'' contains 25 paintings made by the American Impressionist between 1889 and 1901 at his 17-acre farm in Greenwich and in nearby Cos Cob. ''Winslow Homer in the 1870's: Selections from the Valentine-Pulsifer Collection'' features 11 watercolors and oils including the well-known ''Berry Pickers.'' Acquired directly from the artist in the 19th century, they have remained in the private collection of one family.
The Twachtman show was organized by the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It covers a period in Twachtman's career when he had departed from his earlier Barbizon-inspired work and had not yet begun his more broadly executed later paintings. 
An admission of $2, $1 for students and the elderly, will be charged for the pair of exhibitions. They are accompanied by four lectures, scheduled Tuesday evenings to April 10, and three film screenings, at noon Thursday, 2 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday. Admission to the lectures is $7, or $25 for the series. The first, ''Winslow Homer and Houghton Farm,'' begins at 5:30 P.M. Tuesday, with Linda Ayres, the museum's associate director for exhibitions. The films are free with an exhibition ticket. Hours are 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. For a recorded weekly listing of events, call 247-9111.
Residents of Fairfield County may want to take advantage of a trip to the Wadsworth Atheneum on Tuesday; it is being organized by the Westport Arts Center and covers the Twachtman and Homer shows as well as a third exhibition, ''Master Drawings'' by Tiepolo, Daumier, Courbet, Degas, Dali, Picasso, Delacroix, Moore, Miro and others from the museum's permanent collection.
The group will depart by bus from the parking lot at Jogues Hall, Fairfield University, at 9 A.M.; an additional pickup will be made at the Westport Arts Center, 17 Morningside Drive South at 9:30 A.M. The group is expected to return in late afternoon. A fee of $38 includes transportation, museum entrance and refreshments. Call 254-4110 to register.
 
BRIEF EXPEDITIONS
The brief expeditions into the outside world taken by a woman and her Alzheimer's disease-afflicted mother and grandmother provide the title for Jo Carson's play ''Day Trips,'' winner of the $10,000 Joseph Kesselring Award following its premiere last fall at the Los Angeles Theater Center. The prize is given annually to promising playwrights who have not yet had national attention. Ms. Carson wrote the work from personal experience.
A series of previews begins Saturday to March 29, with a formal opening on March 30. The play runs to April 28 at the Hartford Stage Company, 50 Church Street, Hartford. The director is Michael Engler, who directed ''Eastern Standard'' for Seattle Rep and the Manhattan Theater Club and Larry Gelbart's ''Mastergate'' for the American Repertory Theater and a subsequent run on Broadway.
Performances are at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday to Thursday, 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday, 2:30 and 7:30 P.M. Sunday and 2 P.M. Wednesday. Tickets at $20 and $25, and preview tickets at $13 may be reserved by calling 527-5151.
 
ALICE WASHBURN
In 1919, a year before American women had the right to vote, 50-year-old Alice Trythall Washburn filed her first building permit. She was the architect for 80 houses built during the next 10 years in Hamden, Cheshire and New Haven.
''A Washburn Celebration'' at the Eli Whitney Museum in Hamden, composed of photographs and artifacts detailing her work, is the result of an investigation by a student of art history, Martha Yellig, who had heard that several houses in the area had been designed by a woman architect. The homes, for which Mrs. Washburn provided garages, were precursors of the suburban explosion of the 1930's and 40's.
The stock market crash of 1929 destroyed Mrs. Washburn's career and she retired; her death certificate listed her occupation as housewife.
The exhibition was mounted in cooperation with the museum by the Hamden Historical Society, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, the New Haven Preservation Trust and several civic and cultural organizations. A series of related lectures, demonstrations and tours of the homes is scheduled through the month of May. The museum, at 915 Whitney Avenue, is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Wednesday, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Thursday to Saturday and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. Admission is free. Call 777-1833 for more information.
 
THE USES OF LAND
The agenda of a Fairfield 2000 seminar called ''Land Use Management for Southwestern Connecticut - Ideas for the 90's'' includes placement of the area in context with other parts of the country, understanding the relationship between economic growth and open-space conservation, attracting business and industry to appropriate sites, an overview of transportation on the Route 7 corridor, affordable housing and a lack of consistency in state, regional and local planning.
The seminar, scheduled from 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thursday at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, is sponsored by the Regional Plan Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.
Speakers include Robert Yaro, senior vice president of the Regional Plan Association; John Mullin, head of the department of landscape architecture and regional planning at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Alan Altshuler, director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard; Susan Podsibeh, specialist in affordable-housing dispute mediation at the University of Massachusetts, Boston; Ben Chinitz, former senior researcher for the New York Metropolitan Region Study; and Michael Cacace, Stamford lawyer and executive committee member of the planning and zoning section of the Connecticut Bar Association.
A fee of $50 covers the seminar, materials and lunch. Call 356-0390 to register or obtain more information.
 
W.P.A. MURALS
Norwalk is believed to have one of the largest collection of Works Progress Administration murals in the country, documenting the effects of the Great Depression on local life. Two of the paintings by Alexander Rummler - ''Oyster Shuckers'' (1937) and ''Days End'' (1940) - were recently donated to the Norwalk Maritime Center by the city, and they will be the subject of a talk by Ralph Bloom, a city historian, at 7 P.M. Wednesday in the Maritime Center on Water Street. Admission is $7. Call 852-0700, extension 206 for reservations. $90ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
>More Than a Potato, A Lesson in Life

BYLINE: By DR. Elizabeth Feuer; Dr. Elizabeth Feuer is a former public health physician for the State of New Jersey with a longstanding interest in environmental and public health issues.

 BODY:
LIKE many New Jerseyans, I have a vegetable garden out back. I grow a half-dozen tomato plants, a few rows of beans, some zucchini - a vegetable smorgasbord. I get a deep satisfaction from working the soil and making things grow. And in raising a portion of our food organically, I enjoy the feeling that I am doing something worthwhile both for my family and for the environment. It never occurred to me to carry out an economic analysis of my costs and receipts. I just grew what I felt like and tried to be sensible.
Last year, however, I decided to grow potatoes. I bought some ''spudlets'' - tissue-cultured seed stock - and threw them under the mulch. They sprouted and grew. All summer long I picked off Colorado potato beetles and sprayed liquid seaweed fertilizer, and when fall came, I dug up my bounty. Harvesting my 20 pounds of Irish Cobblers and Yellow Finns was like finding buried treasure. The potatoes were small but delicious, and I enjoyed that almost primitive satisfaction that comes from having food ''put by.'' Unfortunately, my pride was short-lived. 
A few days later I went to the supermarket for my regular weekly shopping, and there, plastered on the window, was a poster advertising 10 pounds of potatoes for $1.79. My entire summer's effort was valued at about $3.58.
My first reaction, when confronted with this unpleasant financial truth, was to blame myself. There had to be a reason I ended up so far behind. Most likely, I decided, my yields were not what they should have been. The weather was bad, rain all summer. Manure is hard to find and hard to truck; I didn't put on enough. I vowed to do better next year. It wasn't that the sums involved were large - $5 here, $10 there - but it distressed me to think I couldn't break even. That I couldn't make my garden pay.
Of course there are all kinds of reasons for gardening, as I mentioned before. There are psychological satisfactions and health benefits. There is the undeniable pleasure of biting into a vine-ripe tomato sprinkled with fresh basil. But the potato? The humble potato? Do the ones from my garden really taste that much better than those I buy at Acme?
It was only later, as my bruised ego recovered, that I realized the problem was more general than I had at first supposed. My house, on its one-acre suburban lot, is part of a development carved out of an orchard 20 years ago. Ghostly neglected apple trees greet me every time I walk around the block. My neighborhood is a daily reminder that in today's New Jersey, increasingly, farming does not pay. And my neighbors, blessed with a sandy loam soil that could grow almost anything, grow grass - acres of it. There is only one other vegetable garden in my entire development.
People are busy, people have good jobs, and food is so cheap at the store. Why bother? It's hopeless, trying to beat the supermarket at its own game.
But - should we try? As gardeners, as consumers, should we feel good about paying as little as we do? Growing potatoes as I do, by hand, organically, in a small, carefully maintained plot, does not pay, nor will it ever. Not if the standard is that offered by agribusiness and my local grocery chain. I was looking at the problem the wrong way around. Instead of trying to be like them, they should be like me. It now seems to me that the food in the supermarket is too cheap.
What does it really cost to grow 10 pounds of potatoes? Maybe prices are low because we are not really footing our bills. We are deferring or ignoring the true expenses of growing our food. In place of muscle power we are using energy in the form of gas and oil - a kind of principal, yesterday's savings, that will be squandered in the space of a few years. We allow our topsoil to erode; we ollute our ground water, leaving the reckoning for another day. We destroy wildlife, by plowing from fence row to fence row, by cutting rain forest, eliminating every last square inch of natural habitat on earth as fast as we possibly can. What is the cost of that? Who knows? It's hard to figure the cash value of a red-eyed vireo or grizzly bear.
What about the price of meat? We all like to be able to afford a steak or veal cutlet. But veal calves today are raised in unspeakably cruel conditions, in cages so confining the animals can barely move. They are fed artifical formula laced with antibiotics, to prevent their succumbing to the diseases brought on by poor sanitation and overcrowding.
Even apart from the moral price we pay, treating animals in this fashion - what of the abuse of valuable drugs? Salmonella will in time develop resistance to every antibiotic we can make. What will we do then when people get sick? Is cheap veal really worth it? But decency costs. Responsibility costs. Raising animals the old way, in a barn, is simply too expensive - or so we are told.
The list goes on and on. In every grocery receipt are a hundred hidden expenses. Monoculture. The loss of genetic diversity. The loss of the family farm. When will these bills fall due? I don't know precisely. But I am quite sure that someday we will have to pay up.
In the meanwhile, I intend to do my small part to redress the wrongs. I intend to enjoy my very expensive potatoes. And this year I will grow some more. With time and effort, I hope to improve my soil, better my yields.
But I no longer care whether I raise my spuds as cheaply as I could buy them. More than any other vegetable, the lowly potato symbolizes sustenance, life itself. I think we would all do well to plow up some grass, chop some leaves for mulch and plant a few.

HEADLINE: Picking a Banjo Through 50 Years of Protests

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: BEACON

 BODY:
TO hear Pete Seeger tell it, the singer and political activist is falling apart. His voice is ''50 percent gone,'' he says, and he gets by only by ''persuading the audience to sing along.'' His memory is going, too, and that's not all. ''I can't remember where I put my hearing aid five minutes ago,'' he says.
But to spend a day with the tall, still slender 71-year-old radical in his home overlooking the Hudson River is to experience something else: a vibrant man who leaps up from a discussion of the origins of ''We Shall Overcome'' to check the maple sap boiling outside under clouds of steam.
The phone rings constantly, interrupting a story about Woody Guthrie or a discussion of events in Eastern Europe with a call from the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington or with changes in concert dates that inextricably fill a full week two months hence. 
 
'It Takes Me Longer to Do Things'
''You're booked for the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth,'' says Toshi, his wife. ''You're going to die.'' The singer nods agreeably, telling a visitor mischievously that ''I'm as busy as I've ever been in my life, partly because it takes me longer to do things.''
If Pete Seeger is slowing down, few seem to have noticed. And if his voice is going, fewer care. Hardly a weekend passes that he is not singing somewhere, alone or in concert, often raising money for an organization or meeting with a group on behalf of one of the causes he has promoted since he found that he could ''make a living picking a banjo.''
And if his life is the thread that pulls together the protest movements of the last 50 years, then his wife, Toshi-Aline Ohta, has done much of the weaving. For that partnership, which began in 1938 when they met as members of a square dance group in Manhattan, the Seegers will be honored today by those who know them best - their friends and neighbors.
The Westchester People's Action Coalition has assembled the Seegers' three children, Daniel, Mika and Tinya; his sister, Penny; the folk singers Odetta, Oscar Brand and Guy Davis; Fred Hellerman, who was a member of the singing group the Weavers; Harold Leventhal, who has managed Mr. Seeger and other singers for decades; Corliss Lamont, the poet and author; and the Nobel Laureates George Wald and Linus Pauling.
They will meet at 1 P.M. at the Thomas H. Slater Neighborhood Center in White Plains for a lunch that has long been sold out. The purpose is to present Wespac's Peace and Justice Award ''to the Seegers, who live their lives so that the rainbow race of children can see a new day of peace, green grass, sunshine, blue sky, clear water and a song,'' and to hear some of the music that has helped galvanize seekers of change in this nation for decades.
''At first, Toshi said no to being honored, because she really shuns the limelight,'' Mr. Seeger said. ''This is also about the first time she's consented to an interview, really, in 45 years. 'Talk to my husband,' she'd say, 'he's in the business.' ''
 
'10 Hours of Yard Work?'
It is not that Mrs. Seeger is shy, exactly. She will challenge his estimate of how much he does around the house (''Since when do you do 10 hours of yard work?'') or how much time he devotes to answering mail. (''If he did 10 hours a week answering mail, we wouldn't be so far behind. Sometimes he gets six months behind.'') She will jump in with answers of her own. To a question addressed to her husband, asking if he had trouble remembering songs learned a long time ago, Mrs. Seeger says, ''No, but does he have trouble remembering a grocery list! He can't even remember where he put it.''
She will work with him on a list of performers for a concert or a hootenanny, gently encouraging the balance of personalities, style and even gender that will insure a success. And she will step to his side while he is on the phone to Washington with a statement that can surely be heard in the nation's capital: ''Tell Mr. E.P.A. that you have housework to do.''
She will listen to him discuss the history of folk music in this country - ''prior to the 1930's you could count on the fingers of one hand the people who tried to sing folk songs on the stage'' - with the observation that ''you're contradicting yourself, referring to folk songs, because you don't believe in that terminology.''
Her husband agrees, saying that he was ''a fool to let people call what I did 'folk music' '' when he began singing at college campuses in the 1950's, after being blacklisted because of his left-wing associations and former membership in the Communist Party.
''Folk music should have been kept an academic term,'' he said, ''because now it's like the word 'culture,' which means one thing to an anthropologist and another to somebody in society news.''
 
'Singing Songs They Made Up'
To the average person, he said, ''the word 'folk' means somebody with a banjo or guitar singing songs they made up.''
Mr. Seeger has been arrested, indicted by Congress and blacklisted in the musical industry for his support of striking workers, civil rights movement leaders and Vietnam War protesters. But he looks at his life's work in simple terms:
''I'm an incorrigible jack-of-all-trades. There's lots better banjo pickers than I am. I guess probably as a song leader I'm the nearest thing to being a pro. What song's the right song, what's the right tempo, what's the right word or two - not too many - to get a small group started.
''If they start, others will join in. It's like the leaven in the bread, and it gets easier and easier for me, because if I face a big audience, I can be fairly certain there are a few out there who have sung with me before. I know they're there, and when they start, pretty soon others say, 'Well, they're singing, I guess I will, too.' ''
 
From a Classical-Music Family
The singer would seem to have been destined for other things. He came from a family of classical musicians. His mother, the former Constance de Clyver Edson, played the violin at parlor concerts; his father, Charles, a musicologist, conducted the Cologne Opera for a brief period. At the age of 25, Charles Seeger became the youngest full professor in the history of the University of California.
It was at Berkeley that Professor Seeger, who scorned politics in general and Socialists in particular, was challenged by a young economist who took him to see the migrants in the San Joaquin Valley. Soon the musicologist became associated with radical groups like the International Workers of the World, and followed a political path that would also determine his son's future.
''Both of us came from families that had been well off,'' Mrs. Seeger said, ''but whose parents were to know hard times in the 1930's Depression.'' She said her mother was from ''the old South'' while her father ''was the son of one of the first students in Japan selected to study in Europe 120 years ago.''
''My grandfather witnessed the short-lived Paris Commune of 1871, came home a radical and in 1911 was arrested for helping raise money for Sun Yat-sen to start a revolution in China.'' He was sentenced to banishment, she said, but under Japanese tradition ''a son could accept his father's banishment, so my father left Japan and worked on four continents until he landed in this country and stayed.''
 
The Best-Known Dropout
Mr. Seeger's education included four years at Avon Old Farms, a Connecticut boarding school, and less than two years at Harvard University, where he studied sociology. As a biographer, David King Dunaway, noted, the singer may be the best-known dropout of the class of 1940, which produced John F. Kennedy.
Mr. Seeger wanted to be a journalist but failed to get a newspaper job, and so turned to music, forming the Almanac Singers with Woody Guthrie, Lee Hays and others. They played union halls and migrant farm worker camps until World War II sent Mr. Seeger overseas. He married Toshi on a furlough, she said, after they got to know each other when she volunteered to help him catalogue a collection of labor songs.
''Now we know what volunteering can lead to,'' she added.
 
Life in a Log Cabin
In the early 1950's they moved to a few acres overlooking the Hudson River in this hilly community, building a small log cabin on a site that is still inaccessible on snowy days except in four-wheel-drive vehicles. It was here, in the drafty cabin, that they raised their children.
A few years ago the Seegers moved into their present home, adjacent to the log cabin. Better-insulated, it has cathedral ceilings, large windows that scan 20 miles of the river and the frequent presence of two grandchildren: Kitama, a 9-year-old boy, and Moraya, a 2-year-old girl, the children of Tinya.
''Our daughters work as potters just below us,'' Mr. Seeger said, and Mika lives in Beacon with her 17-year-old son, Tao, while he attends high school. ''Tao sings with me often,'' he said. ''We both enjoy singing together.
''We'll start on the same note and his voice will hold it out, nice and even and straight and strong,'' he said, drawing a horizontal line in the air, ''while mine just vanishes.''
Mr. Seeger's own fame came after 1949, when he and Lee Hays, Fred Hellerman and Ronnie Gilbert formed the Weavers, recording ''Goodnight Irene'' and other hits. By 1952 they had sold more than four million records and helped popularize country and folk music on a national scale.
 
Before the Committee
''In 1955, Pete was questioned about his political beliefs by the House Committee on Un-American Activites,'' Mrs. Seeger said. ''He did not use the Fifth Amendment but simply said, 'I've a right to my opinions; you have a right to yours.' ''
He was cited for contempt of Congress and, in 1961, was sentenced to a year in jail. ''I accepted every booking that came in, figuring that most of them would be canceled,'' his wife said. ''But the Appeals Court acquitted him and nothing was canceled. It was a horrendously busy year,'' she said, adding: ''Never again. Next time let him go to jail.''
The singer's neighborhood ties were forged in a violent encounter in 1949, when they were still living in tents on the site they were clearing for their home. He was to sing in a concert in Peekskill featuring Paul Robeson, the soloist with the rich bass voice.
Mr. Robeson, who was ''loudly pro-Russian,'' according to a local paper of the time, drew hundreds of union supporters and hundreds of rock-throwing protesters. The Seegers, who took their son and infant daughters to the concert, recall pulling glass splinters from their hair and skin.
 
Inspiring the Clearwater
The Seegers' links with their Hudson Valley neighbors have improved over the years. In 1969, the singer inspired the construction of the Clearwater, a replica of a 19th-century sailing ship that has championed the effort to clean up the Hudson River. ''We take 15,000 schoolkids out on the ship every year,'' Mr. Seeger said, ''and invented a way to pay for it. We take the parents out, and they pay for their sail so the kids can go free.''
Clearwater's ''Great Hudson River Revival,'' a yearly weekend feast of folk celebrities and ethnic instruments, now command six stages on the campus of Westchester Community College in Valhalla. It is scheduled this year for June 16 and 17.
Mr. Seeger is now engaged in the struggle to keep the shores of a cleaner Hudson River ''open to everybody.'' He enlisted Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's support two years ago, when Mr. Cuomo gave an award to the Hudson River Fishermen's Association, to help open a beach near here.
He is also trying to organize a family reunion for next summer. The singer said that his father, who later remarried, had seven children. ''Although scattered over the globe,'' he said, ''they're all still alive, with 20 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.''<
 
TO CELEBRATE, 'SING OUT!'
 
IN May, Pete Seeger will have a concert in the Beacon Theater to celebrate four decades of ''Sing Out!'' a topical song magazine that he said ''has been 40 years on the brink of bankruptcy.''
The singer has written a column in the publication for most of its existence. It takes its name from a chorus of a song by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays that has stimulated three generations of protesters and demonstrators:
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning,
I'd hammer in the evening,
All over this land.
I'd hammer out danger,
I'd hammer out a warning,
I'd hammer out love between
My brothers and my sisters
All over this land
 If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning...
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning.
I'd sing it in the evening,
All over this land.
I'd sing out danger,
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between
My brothers and my sistersM
All over this landM
Well, I got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song
All over this land.
It's the hammer of justice,
It's the bell of freedom,
It's the song between
My brothers and my sisters
All over this land.

HEADLINE: The Nuts and Bolts Of East-Bloc Travel

BYLINE: By BRIAN F. HAYES; BRIAN F. HAYES, formerly on the staff of the Travel section, has studied in West Germany.

 BODY:
FROM the East Berlin side of the Brandenburg Gate to Wenceslas Square in Prague, Americans are discovering Eastern Europe in record numbers, particularly as the changes in governments there have led to the loosening of visa and customs procedures. However, the resulting confusion at border crossings and crowds in consulates may still mean lost time, effort and frustration for travelers.
''Every day there is a new law and the next day the new law is gone,'' says Traude Sourisseaux, of Koch Overseas, a tour operator serving East Germany, where visa and customs procedures have long been among the most strict and time-consuming in Eastern Europe.
Like the political and economic reforms, changes in immigration and customs laws vary considerably from one country to another. East Germany and Poland have significantly altered their currency exchange policies; Czechoslovakia has eased its visa policy; Bulgaria has begun making visas available at the border, and Hungary has left intact its relatively open visa and customs policies. 
With government officials and travel agents struggling to keep up with the steady stream of new regulations, the watchwords for travelers headed to Eastern Europe in the coming months are ''patience'' and ''plan ahead.'' Some travel agents and State Department officials expect the projected flood of Western tourists, especially this summer, to overwhelm some bureaucracies.
In every consular office ''it's going to be quite hectic,'' warns Jan Dvorak, who heads Travisa, a Washington service that obtains visas for travelers.
Already, some Eastern European consulates in New York and embassies in Washington, with small staffs that are inexperienced in processing large numbers of visitors, are having difficulty handling the flow of visa requests. Mr. Dvorak said he had even heard reports of passports being lost at some consulates; to reduce the chances of this happening he suggested sending passports by certified mail or a delivery service requiring proof of receipt. Americans should also check their passports for expiration dates as some countries may refuse to issue visas unless the passport is valid for at least several months after the start of the planned trip.
The following is a roundup of visa requirements and currency regulations in Eastern Europe. The information was compiled from interviews with tourist boards, State Department officials and Eastern European consulate and embassy officials.
 
East Germany
Since the breaching of the Berlin wall, the East German Government has abolished the requirement that foreigners convert the equivalent of $15 to East German marks for each day spent in the country. Importing and exporting East German marks remains illegal, but it is unclear whether visitors can convert unused marks back to hard currency. Visitors who plan to return still have the option of depositing money in special bank accounts, good for one year, for use the next time they visit the country. To avoid problems, money should be changed in small amounts and only at official exchange offices. With rates at these offices improving (3 East German marks to each West German mark; earlier it was a one to one ratio) the black market, and its legal risks, is becoming less attractive.
Other laws remain on the books, but are not necessarily being enforced with rigor. For example, East Germany still requires Americans crossing between East and West Berlin to use either Checkpoint Charlie or the Friedrichstrasse subway station. Yet some travelers have recently reported using some of the new crossings established at other points along the wall, particularly the Brandenburg Gate, to relieve the crush. Who can use these checkpoints, according to United States officials in Berlin, seems to depend on the East German border guards on duty.
Visa regulations have emerged intact from the political upheaval. To get a visa valid for more than 24 hours, visitors must first make hotel reservations, or, if they intend to stay in a private residence, apply for special permission from a travel agent or the East German Embassy. Hotel reservations can take from 10 days to several weeks for approval, while applications for staying in a private residence can require up to eight weeks for approval. Upon showing proof of accommodation at the border, a visitor will receive a single-entry visa for about $8.
The Government permits free travel throughout the country, but travelers must stay in the hotel or private residence that they listed on their visa application. The only exception to the rule applies to drivers between West Germany and Berlin using transit visas, obtained at border crossings, who must remain on routes marked ''transit.''
Customs laws remain essentially unchanged, but travelers are reporting less strict enforcement. Customs agents, especially in Berlin, are subjecting luggage to little more than a cursory inspection or, in many cases, simply waving people through. Travelers are still prohibited from taking antiques and certain luxury items bought with East German marks, such as crystal, optical equipment and jewelry, from the country, but restrictions on printed matter seem to be easing.
State Department officials expect the bureaucratic confusion to persist until some time after a permanent government, scheduled to be elected today, takes office.
Information. East German Embassy (1717 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036; telephone 202-232-3134 between 1 and 3 P.M.) or Koch Overseas (157 East 86th Street, New York, N.Y. 10028; 212-369-3800).
 
Poland
Like East Germany, Poland has dropped its minimum daily currency exchange requirement. Travelers are still forbidden to import or export zlotys. It is also impossible to convert unused zlotys back into hard currency, so visitors are advised to change money in small amounts as needed.
Although immigration and customs officials may be spending less time examining documents and searching for contraband since the old regime relinquished power, travelers are saving little time. Whether arriving in Poland by car or air, visitors are still met with long lines at entry points. ''Just because the politics and the economy have changed doesn't mean the country isn't still run by an army of bureaucrats,'' said an American official.
At Okecie International Airport in Warsaw, the congested arrival point for virtually all international flights into Poland, the adventure begins at the baggage conveyor belt, for travelers receive no indication as to which belt their luggage will appear on. After clearing passport control and retrieving their bags, travelers must tackle the currency declaration forms, often provided only in Polish. Customs has improved slightly under the new Government. Those travelers carrying only money, cigarettes, cameras, electronic gear, gifts and other personal items may use the line marked ''Nothing to Declare.'' When leaving the country, travelers should be careful to avoid taking out any antique, work of art or book without a receipt stating its date of production. It is illegal to remove any of these items produced before 1945 without official permission.
Visa applications take about two weeks to be processed, but consulate officials suggest allowing extra time. Visas, which are good for up to 90 days, are issued for specific lengths of time, so travelers should indicate how long they intend to stay. Prices range from $23 for a single entry to $120 for multiple-entry. Discounts are available for students, group tour participants and holders of prepaid vouchers for travel services.
Information. Orbis, the Polish National Tourist Office, (342 Madison Avenue, Suite 1512, New York, N.Y. 10173; 212-867-5011), or the Consular Division of the Polish Embassy ( 2224 Wyoming Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20008; 202-234-2501).
 
Czechoslovakia
Czechoslovakia, which has been issuing most visas without much difficulty in recent years, has further simplified the process, especially for former Czechoslovak nationals, a group that had often encountered problems in the past. Under regulations that took effect last year, travelers may obtain visas valid that day at four locations along the border. Visitors entering from Austria can get visas valid for up to 30 days and costing $30 at Dolni Dvoriste, Hate and Petrzalka; those entering from West Germany can get them at Rozvadov. To avoid lines, however, State Department officials still suggest applying for visas at a Czechoslovak Embassy, either in person or by mail, before leaving for a trip. Allow several hours' wait at an embassy or several weeks for the mail.
Czechoslovakia still requires a minimum daily currency exchange, so be prepared to change about $15 a day. Changing more than the daily minimum will qualify a visitor for a more favorable exchange rate, but it may take a long time to convert unused crowns; carrying crowns across the border, either in or out, is forbidden. Travelers entering the country must also declare any large amounts of foreign currency.
Vladimir Barta, a director of Czechoslovakia's Ministry of Tourism and Commerce, said visitors showing a credit card - they needn't promise to use it - exempted them from the obligation to change any amount at the lower rate.
Customs laws, which seldom posed serious problems to travelers in the past, have remained nearly unchanged.
Information. Cedok, the national tourist bureau, (10 E. 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-689-9720), or the CzechoslovakEmbassy (3900 Linnean Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20008; 202-363-6315) between 10 A.M. and noon.
 
Romania
Until the new political leadership stabilizes, travelers should be prepared for the possibility of changing regulations and confusion among officials. The State Department advises Americans to exercise caution. The situation had stabilized and no Americans had been threatened, the department said in a Jan. 15 advisory, but it added that there is a potential for random violence. Americans are advised to check with the United States Embassy in Bucharest.
The new Government has, however, eliminated the daily minimum currency exchange requirement, andtravelers can now convert any leftover lei back into hard currency. As before the revolution, travelers may obtain visas at the border valid the same day, good for up to 30 days, for $21 or through the mail from an embassy. Travelers are also subject to fewer intensive baggage inspections and are less likely to be denied entry.
Information. Romanian National Tourist Office (573 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-697-6972) or the Romanian Embassy (1607 20th Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008; 202-232-4747).
 
Hungary
For years Hungary has had some of the easiest entry procedures in Eastern Europe, and recent reforms should have little, if any, effect on acquiring visas. Travelers can obtain visas at the airport or at the border, if traveling by car or bus. Those wishing to enter by train must procure a visa in advance from any consulate, embassy or Ibusz tourist agency office, which usually takes only 48 hours. Prices range from $15 for a 30-day, single-entry visa up to $50 for multiple entry, good for six months.
Hungary does not require a minimum currency exchange, but does enforce some currency restrictions. Travelers are limited to 100 forints (about $3) when entering or leaving the country and must declare any large amounts of Western currency. Travelers must use designated exchange offices. It is possible to convert forints back to Western currency, but the amount cannot exceed half the amount exchanged or $50.
Customs has seldom been a problem for Western tourists, and should not be now.
Information. Ibusz, the Hungarian National Travel Bureau (1 Parker Plaza, Suite 1104, Fort Lee, N.J. 07024; 201-592-8585) or the Hungarian Consulate (8 East 75th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021; 212-879-4127).
 
Bulgaria
Bulgaria now offers travelers the option of obtaining visas at the border, rather then requesting them through the mail; they are valid for up to three months from the date of issue. A regular visa, ordered by mail, takes about seven days and costs $19, while visas obtained at the border and express visas, which can be processed within 24 hours, cost $38. Organized tour groups and children traveling on a parent's passport do not require visas.
Although the Bulgarian customs officials are still fairly thorough, travelers are reporting that the process is more relaxed and less time-consuming than in the past. When departing, it is wise, however, to save all receipts as proof that an item was bought with money changed at official agencies. In addition to imposing legal penalties, the Government is discouraging black market transactions by offering an 80 percent bonus above the official exchange rate to visitors traveling on a tourist visa, rather than one for business or visiting relatives. The premium rate can be obtained only at Bulgarian offices of Balkantourist, the National Tourist Office. There is no required minimum daily currency exchange.
Information. Balkan Holidays, (161 East 86th Street, New York, N.Y. 10028; 212-722-1110) or the Bulgarian Embassy (1621 22d Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008; 202-387-7969).
 
Yugoslavia
Yugoslavia, which has been perhaps the most relaxed Eastern European country in terms of obtaining visas, is considering plans to eliminate visa requirements altogether. According to the Yugoslavian Embassy, a decision could come as early as this month. Until then, visitors may continue obtaining 90-day visas at the border free of charge. Multi-entry visas, good for a year, are also available.
Yugoslavia has no minimum daily currency exchange requirement and the dinar, which has recently been made convertible, can be freely brought in and out of the country. Tourists have the choice of changing their money for dinars or Yugoslav National Bank Checks. Many hotels, restaurants and other tourist services give a 10 percent discount for using these checks, which can also be reconverted to Western currency.
Information. Yugoslav National Tourist Office (630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111; 212-757-2801) or the Yugoslav Consulate General (767 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-838-2300).
In planning for any trip, State Department officials and travel agents recommend allowing plenty of time, both when applying for visas and going through immigration and customs. Even though some countries now offer visas at their borders, the lines may be long and travelers are advised to apply for visas before they leave. One American official cautioned that while the customs and border agents may be more friendly, when it comes to paperwork, ''It's still not Western Europe.''

HEADLINE: Vienna, Gateway to the East

BYLINE: By PAUL HOFMANN; PAUL HOFMANN is a native of Vienna.

 BODY:
ON a clear day you can peer into Czechoslovakia and Hungary from the Kahlenberg, the 1,585-foot-high hill on the outskirts of Vienna.
The two countries seem even closer to the Austrian capital since the end of 1989, when the barbed wire fences along their borders came down and the watchtowers were abandoned. Now travel organizations in Vienna are offering a tempting array of proposals for low-cost trips to one or both of the two neighboring nations - by air, rail, bus, car or Danube boat.
American travelers who have not made firm arrangements for visits to Eastern European countries before leaving home but later decide to take a side trip to that part of the Continent will find Vienna a convenient communications and services hub. Flying time to Budapest is little more than half an hour, to Prague an hour. A bus or car trip to Budapest takes two-and-a-half hours, to Prague three hours, to Bratislava 45 minutes. The Austrian and Czechoslovak state railroads introduced new passenger trains linking the two countries early this year and plan to increase and improve service further when their summer schedules go into effect in May. 
Negotiations are under way to extend the existing line of the Schnellbahn, a fast commuter rail network, between the center of Vienna and Schwechat Airport to Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, less than 20 miles away.
Citizens of the United States need visas for both Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The Vienna office of the official Czechoslovak tourist organization, Cedok, 12 Parkring (telephone 512-0199 or 512-4372) and of the Hungarian tourist agency, Ibusz, 26 Karntnerstrasse (515-5500) will obtain tourist visas in a couple of days, or, if application is made early in the morning, even overnight.
Two passport photos must be submitted for each application and a fee of $14.50 for Czechoslovakia and $26 for Hungary must be paid. The telephone numbers of the Vienna Cedok and Ibusz offices are now busy most of the time. At the beginning of March there were no lines of people in either office, but they may become crowded as the tourist season advances.
Travelers arriving at Ferihegy Airport in Budapest or by car or bus at any Hungarian border crossing may request a visa there, but some waiting in line may be necessary. Rail passengers must have their visas by the time their trains reach the frontier.
Czechoslovak border formalities have been simplified for Cedok's standard eight-hour visit to Bratislava by speedboat on the Danube from Vienna: only one passport photo and a nominal fee are required for the group visa. The $43 package includes a bus tour of Slovakia's historic capital with an English-speaking guide and a Slovak lunch at a Bratislava restaurant. Children from 6 to 15 years pay half price; those under 6 travel free.
United States citizens needed individual visas for all other package tours to Czechoslovakia or Hungary in early March; however, tourist officials of both countries said visa requirements might soon be eased.
The respected Bratislava Opera House is luring music lovers from Vienna, who may spend the night in the Slovak city or return to the Austrian capital after the last curtain. A group of Viennese aficionados recently chartered a shuttle bus for five Bratislava opera performances with same-night return to the Austrian capital.
Total price, including the opera tickets, was $145. Similar arrangements, which are also open to Americans holding Czechoslovak vias, are offered from time to time. Cedok would know the details. Budapest also occasionally includes tickets to its national opera house or to some operetta as part of tour packages. A one-day bus trip from Vienna to Budapest and back organized by private operators costs around $120, including lunch but not the opera.
One of many Ibusz options is an eight-day bus tour of Hungary, starting and ending in Vienna, with all meals and accommodation in double rooms with bath or shower, at $468 a person.
A Cedok-sponsored trip from Vienna to Prague by second-class rail costs $207 a a person. It includes two nights in a double room at a four-star hotel (first class, but not deluxe), with breakfasts and one main meal. The Czechoslovak state agency and private tour operators offer many other fixed-price options for groups or individuals.
As Vienna's position as a major gateway to Eastern Europe is strengthened language schools in the old imperial city suddenly find themselves overrun by people who want to learn Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Russian. The Vienna branch of Berlitz said the number of students in its Hungarian classes had doubled in a year and those in its Russian classes risen by 150 percent in the same period. The school's Czech, Serbo-Croat and Romanian courses were also reported to be much in demand. The Economic University of Vienna is offering new courses in Eastern European languages and is negotiating with academic institutions in Moscow, Prague, Budapest and Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, with a view to establishing language-student exchange programs.
In addition, a new six-story steel-and-glass World Trade Center is just about to open opposite the Schwechat Airport terminal. It will offer information, advice, office space, and catered product shows as well as communications and other facilities and services to executives passing through Vienna on their way to or from Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Where the East Bloc Rocks

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. RYBACK; TIMOTHY W. RYBACK is the author of ''Rock Around the Bloc,'' which was published recently by Oxford University Press.

 BODY:
ON a Friday night in Prague in June, as couples strolled across Wenceslas Square or promenaded down the Narodni Street toward the National Theater, Czechoslovak rock fans lined up outside Chelmnice, one of the hottest spots to hear rock in Central Europe.
The club, in a working-class district of Prague, 20 minutes by tram from the city center, stood in the grim shadow of concrete housing blocks, known in Czech as sidliste. There was no sign, no billboard, no marquee. But the hundred or more Czechs - a collage of punks, fashionably dressed youths and aging hippies - that crowded the sidewalk before the doorway were evidence enough that something was ''happening.''
As the doors opened, the crowd pressed up the narrow stairs, surrendering their cover charge of 25 crowns (about 75 cents) at the second-floor entrance. Inside, the cinderblock walls were hung with paintings by underground artists; the sinister images evoked the mood of Franz Kafka's Prague. To one side, wine and schnapps were sold in small plastic cups. 
The crowd shuffled across the cement floor and into a stark amphitheater lined with metal bleachers. The room quickly filled; the standing-room-only crowd pressed together so that the doors could be shut. After some delay, the members of Garaz, one of Prague's fiercest punk bands, wandered listlessly onto the stage, picked up their guitars and unleashed a barrage of high-decibel rock - the new sound of Socialism.
For 30 years, Communist regimes, especially in Czechoslovakia, annoyed by the proliferation of rock music among their young, tear-gassed, clubbed and sometimes imprisoned rock musicians and their fans. That began to change in the late 1980's. Yet even while official campaigns railed against rock music, Eastern Europe had a thriving rock culture that has come to include domestic renderings of blues, punk, rap, reggae, pop, disco and heavy metal.
''A lot of their rock is derivative, but there are also some very interesting bands,'' says Hope Carr of Sightwaves, a management company based in New York that represents several top East European bands. According to Ms. Carr, the best groups are those that allow distinctive East European qualities to ''infiltrate the rock idiom.''
Currently, the East European rock scene is centered in small clubs in obscure corners of large cities, with Prague and Budapest offering the most diversity. Most of these clubs, not intended to cater to Western tourism, have a Spartan, often gritty feeling that is closer to the everyday reality of East bloc life, and in a sense, closer to the original roots of rock and roll.
THE grit has a price - which is extremely low. Cover charges and ticket prices are negligible, ranging from under $1 to $3 in local currency: 3 to 10 marks in East Germany; 20 to 30 crowns in Czechoslovakia; 10,000 to 25,000 zloty in Poland; 60 to 80 forint in Hungary. (Western visitors can avoid long lines in front of rock clubs by extending a tip in hard currency - 5 West German marks should do it.)
 
East Berlin. In East Berlin, the rock scene is in Prenzlauer Berg, a prewar, working-class district of the city, accessible by tram from downtown. Prezlauer Berg has long been a refuge for East German counterculture. Local punks, their hair spiked with sugar water, loiter in the entryways to crumbling, war-ravaged, turn-of-the-century buildings.
In the evening, East Berliners retreat to their apartments, or, in recent months, to the West Berlin night scene. By 9 o'clock, the city is deserted. As life drains from East Berlin streets, lines begin to form outside clubs in Prezlauer Berg such as Erich Franz, which showcases mainstream rock and progressive East German rock bands, and the Jugendklub in the Langhannstrasse, a center for local blues and heavy metal bands.
If you want to spare yourself a tram ride to Prenzlauer Berg, the Haus der jungen Talente in the Klosterstrasse, a five-minute walk from the Alexanderplatz in central East Berlin, features live rock concerts every Tuesday night, and has disco evenings on the weekend with occasional live performances. The dim interior has a stark, utilitarian atmosphere, like an overgrown garage.
As few concerts are announced on billboards and the rock clubs are not prominently advertised, East Berlin rock fans rely on the daily paper B.Z. am Abend for concert information. The paper, which costs 30 pfennig (less than one cent) and arrives at kiosks between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, lists the concert schedule for each evening.
Compared with West Berlin's nightlife (one of the most dynamic on the Continent), the East Berlin club scene is desperately limited. But there are good reasons for checking out the rock bands there. The East Berlin critic Ralf Dietrich insists that his country's bands generally have ''more guts'' than their counterparts in the West. ''Most of our bands are not as polished as West German groups,'' Mr. Dietrich observes. ''They don't have good guitars or amplifiers, but they play more from the stomach, more from the heart.''
East Berlin rock bands offer a diverse musical fare, including new wave by Vision, ''post-punk punk'' by Sandow, mainstream hard rock by Rockhaus, and heavy metal by Babylon. Three up-and-coming bands that Dietrich especially recommends are Iron Henning, Big Savod and Deep Manko.
Two of the most respected and professional groups on the East Berlin scene are Silly and Pankow, both new wave bands from the early 1980's. Silly features the sassy Tamara Danz, who emerged as East Germany's leading lady of punk and funk following Nina Hagen's 1977 defection to the West.
Pankow, named after a Berlin suburb populated by high Communist party officials, originally showed the influence of the Rolling Stones, but has developed into a dynamic band that combines the energy of the Clash with the innovation of the Talking Heads. Although its lead singer, Andre Herzberg, recently broke from the group, Pankow intends to continue making appearances.
 
Prague. In contrast to East Berlin, Prague has a vibrant club scene. ''There are about 30 discos in the city of Prague,'' says the Prague rock promoter Richard Houska, ''and quite a number of very good live rock venues. It has gotten much better for rock in the past year.''
At the moment, Mr. Houska says, two of Prague's leading rock clubs are KD Barikadniku and Chmelnice. Chmelnice, a theater that features stage as well as music productions, has opened its doors to many of Prague's leading cult bands, including Pulnoc. Pulnoc, heavily influenced by Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, is a favorite of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
KD Baribadniku, a leading club for heavy metal, achieved notoriety two years ago when it was assailed in the press for promoting ''fascist'' music. Officials closed it for ''bad hygenic conditions and excessive noise.'' In January, the club reintroduced heavy metal and is now a popular spot.
The monthly publication Prehled Kulturnich Poradu v Praze, which is available at all hotels and in most cigarette and newspaper kiosks, provides concert information for most Prague clubs. Concert tickets can also be purchased at several locations on or near Wenceslas Square: Alfa, Cerna Buze, Melantrich.
 
Warsaw. The economic crisis in Poland has almost obliterated Poland's live rock scene, which in the early 1980's was one of the most explosive in Eastern Europe. ''There are almost no bands playing in Warsaw right now,'' says the Polish rock star Zbigniew Holdys. ''Everyone is too concerned about finding money to live.''
Still, several Warsaw clubs are worth visiting. Hybrydy, until recently a leading venue for Polish punk and reggae music, still holds occasional live concerts though it relies primarily on recorded music.
Warsaw's two venerated rock clubs, Riviera-Remont, the birthplace of Poland's punk scene, and Stodola, the former club for Mr. Holdys's legendary antigovernment band Perfect, still feature occasional live performances, but now serve primarily as discotheques. Riviera-Remont is typical, an undistinguished structure with an institutional atmosphere.
The bimonthly magazine Wik, available at all kiosks, lists the names and addresses of the leading clubs as well as upcoming concert events.
 
Budapest. Once called the merry barracks of the Soviet bloc, Budapest offers the most diverse rock culture in Eastern Europe. There are hundreds of ''discotheks,'' often bars or restaurants with dance space, and an estimated 50 clubs with live bands.
''Budapest offers just about every kind of music from classic rock to punk and heavy metal,'' says Kate Lorinzci, a long-time observer of the Hungarian rock scene. According to Ms. Lorinczi, top Hungarian bands include KFT, which draws on the Beatles and Supertramp; the Hobo Blues Band, a veteran Budapest rock band that echoes the Rolling Stones, and Dolly Roll, a band renowned for its mainstream pop orientation.
According to Ivan Herskovits, a producer for Hungarian radio, Budapest's Young Artists Club is currently the city's most fashionable gathering place for rock fans and Budapest's trendy crowd. The club, which has a restaurant and a bar, features a nightly discotheque and a live rock band on the average of once a week. ''It looks like a normal rock club,'' says Mr. Herskovits, ''but you have a lot of eccentric types from the art scene, not just rockers.''
Live performances at the Young Artists Club tend to feature experimental and progressive rock; among the best bands are Sziame, re-formed from one of Budapest's legendary punk bands, Kontroll Group, and the Happy Dead Band, a group that sounds, according to Herskovits, ''like Frank Zappa and new wave.''
The rock club Lagymanyosi K.H. serves more mainstream rock tastes, showcasing the folk-rock band Barbaro as well as the Hobo Blues Band, who have put out hits since the 70's.
The Black Hole, in a working-class district, is Budapest's leading punk venue. It is a series of dim, graffiti-painted basement rooms with a gritty atmosphere, the Black Hole is open Thursday to Sunday and features live bands exclusively. Its crowd is mainly young men and women who dress largely in black and affect punkish haircuts. Three of the top groups to watch for are the Kretins, The Love and Cardinal.
P.M. (Pesti Musor) magazine, a weekly available at most hotels and newspaper kiosks, provides a full listing of concert and entertainment information.
 
CHECKING OUT THE CLUBS
These clubs, based on recommendations by Eastern European rock critics and musicians, represent a cross section of the most popular and progressive rock venues in East Berlin, Prague, Warsaw and Budapest.
 
East Berlin
Haus der Jungen Talente (68/70 Klosterstrasse; telephone 21030) is a center for youth culture center near the Alexanderplatz.
Capacity is 500. On Tuesday live rock concerts are presented; on Saturday and Sundays recorded and live music. Concerts begin at 7 or 8 P.M. The club serves wine and schnapps but no food.

World's Tallest Building Raises Questions

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

 BODY:
APPROVAL has been granted by the City Council here for the world's tallest building. But will it ever be built? And, if it is, will the sky-high rents needed to recoup construction costs make it difficult to attract tenants?
Those questions started making the rounds of the development and banking communities after Lee Miglin and Paul Beitler won approval in January to build a 125-story tower with 1.9 million gross square feet of space.
The developers, who have been partners for eight years as Miglin-Beitler, have built eight commercial projects here.
Height and scale are not unusual here. Among other formidable buildings, the city has the 110-story Sears tower, which for the time being is, at 1,468 feet, the world's tallest building. It also has the 1,105-foot, 96-story John Hancock Building and the Merchandise Mart, which, with 4.2 million square feet, was the world's largest building in floor area until the Pentagon was built. 
But the combination of a soft office market and an unusual marketing plan has led many to say the Miglin-Beitler tower cannot work.
''With the 1986 tax act, real estate investments can't be sheltered easily,'' said Robert Meers, president of Broadacre Development Company of Chicago, office and retail developers. ''Why should anybody take this kind of risk to find out nobody is there?''
The design by Cesar Pelli & Associates of New Haven calls for a tower resembling a needle rising 1,950 feet, although its rentable space - 1.4 million square feet - is more typical of a 40- to 50-story building here. Floors will range from 7,000 square feet at the top to 18,250 in the lower stories. By contrast, an average office floor in Chicago is roughly 23,000 square feet.
Construction at this height will add 20 percent to the cost, according to Mr. Beitler. The cost is being verified now, but Mr. Beitler estimates it at $400 million to $500 million, including everything from site acquisition to architects' fees, construction and permits. That puts the cost per square foot between $210 and $263.
How that can be recouped without making office rents unaffordable is a question being asked by many. Hard construction costs are expected to be $110 a square foot, compared with $80 for the average Class A downtown building.
Financing was originally to be in place this month, but Mr. Beitler now says there will be no announcement until June.
For the building to be economically viable, Mr. Beitler says, it must bring in $24 million a year in rent and other revenues. He intends to have half of that guaranteed before any office space is leased. According to his calculations, an 840-car garage at the building's base will generate $6 million a year, an observation deck will bring in $3 million, a restaurant, $1 million and the rental of broadcast transmission rights, $2 million.
But others doubt that a restaurant can operate successfully at such a rent. And the rising number of garages being built in Chicago may make it difficult for an operator to count on being able to generate $6 million from the new garage.
Five garages with spaces for a total of 5,000 cars have been built downtown since 1987 and more are under construction. One new garage, with space for 1,000 cars, is less than half a block from the tower site.
The Miglin-Beitler building occupies less than half a block of the southwest corner of Madison and Wells Streets. The site has been owned by the developer for eight years and has a parking lot on it now. Two of Miglin-Beitler's completed projects are on corners at this intersection, the 1982 Madison Plaza and the Paine Webber Tower, which formally opens next month.
The corner is at the edge of the central business area of the Loop and links to newer developement occurring a few blocks west. The elevated train that runs along Wells is both a boon and a curse at this corner, providing excellent public transportation but generating noise and casting shadows.
ALTHOUGH construction costs for the proposed tower have not yet been determined, competitive office rents for it are fixed, Mr. Beitler says: $28 a square foot in the lower stories, $34 in the mid-section and $39 at the top. The current market rate for Class A buildings in the central Loop, where office rents are highest, is $32.50.
Mr. Beitler is depending for leasing on smaller firms of lawyers and consultants that want and can afford premium space.
''I believe the marketplace has completely changed,'' he says. ''Companies are downsizing not expanding. Consulting firms and small startups have people who are used to high-end environments. They don't want a nook in a huge building.''
David Mosena, Commissioner of the city's Department of Planning, appears to agree with Mr. Beitler. ''I think the building has a better than 50-50 chance of being built,'' he said. ''There are a lot of office buildings out there looking for tenants. This may have an edge because it will be the world's tallest building and because of its appeal to small offices.''
Mr. Beitler is also counting on small firms partly because there is nothing else. Chicago's downtown building boom has left the city with a soft office market. In 1980, the downtown vacancy rate was 4.1 percent; as of January 1990 it was 11 percent. In the last three years eight buildings with more than 800,000 square feet of office space have been completed and six more are under way. Chicago now has a total of 113.1 million square feet of office space.
THE most desirable and sought-after tenants were the city's large legal firms and accounting offices, all of which have signed leases recently. Projects just being completed and older buildings with empty space are having difficulties finding tenants, and negotiated rent giveaways of more than one year are common. Sears, which is moving its offices out of its tower to a suburban site, faces the unhappy prospect of having to rent its 50,000-foot floors. Miglin-Beitler's own million-square-foot Paine Webber Tower is only 56 percent leased.
Still, in a time when most cities are overbuilt, Chicago continues to look attractive. A report for Equitable Real Estate of New York by the Real Estate Research Corporation of Chicago, in which more than 100 professionals in real estate development, lending and research were interviewed, ranked Chicago fourth, behind Los Angeles, Washington and San Francisco as a major real estate market in 1990.
Chicago may be the only city in the country where the Miglin-Beitler Tower could be built. Houston, which has no zoning and a fondness for skyscrapers, is still recovering from its economic troubles. Other cities, like Boston and San Francisco, are limiting development through tough zoning. Chicago, however, remains disposed to accommodate developers; it has, says Mr. Beitler, ''a compassionate process.''
Commissioner Mosena characterizes the city's zoning as ''lenient.'' The code was written in 1957 and has not been substantially altered since. It allows for a downtown-based floor-area ratio of 16, considered generous for a big city, although in line with New York City's central-business district densities. In New York, the centrally located midtown avenues are zoned for a floor-area ratio of 15, with bonuses available for plazas and subway improvements. A floor-area ratio of 16 means that 16 square feet of building are allowed for each square foot of land.
But a system of bonuses permits developers to trade arcades, setbacks and plazas for a greater F.A.R. Thus a developer can at times more than double the code F.A.R., as was the case for the Miglin-Beitler Tower with its floor-area ratio of 33.1 as a bonus for setbacks. Chicago is also less rigorous than either Boston or New York in requiring and evaluating sunlight and shadow studies and environmental impact studies.
Although the Miglin-Beitler tower required city approval, it did not need a zoning variance. In 1974, after the 4.5-million-square-foot Sears Tower was built within the boundaries of Chicago's code, zoning was amended to require review for any building higher than 600 feet. These planned developments, as they are called, require the developer to meet with Planning Department officials, who evaluate the project. The process usually takes no more than six months. The full City Council votes on planned developments, usually following the recommendation of the Planning Department.
Since the plan development provision was added to the zoning code, no project has been rejected because of its height.
Despite questions about the feasibility of the Miglin-Beitler tower there is no doubt the developers are serious. In late February, soil borings were being taken on the site for testing in anticipation of sinking foundations within the year.

Chicago may be the only city in the country where the Miglin-Beitler Tower could be built. Houston, which has no zoning and a fondness for skyscrapers, is still recovering from its economic troubles. Other cities, like Boston and San Francisco, are limiting development through tough zoning. Chicago, however, remains disposed to accommodate developers; it has, says Mr. Beitler, ''a compassionate process.''
Commissioner Mosena characterizes the city's zoning as ''lenient.'' The code was written in 1957 and has not been substantially altered since. It allows for a downtown-based floor-area ratio of 16, considered generous for a big city, although in line with New York City's central-business district densities. In New York, the centrally located midtown avenues are zoned for a floor-area ratio of 15, with bonuses available for plazas and subway improvements. A floor-area ratio of 16 means that 16 square feet of building are allowed for each square foot of land.
But a system of bonuses permits developers to trade arcades, setbacks and plazas for a greater F.A.R. Thus a developer can at times more than double the code F.A.R., as was the case for the Miglin-Beitler Tower with its floor-area ratio of 33.1 as a bonus for setbacks. Chicago is also less rigorous than either Boston or New York in requiring and evaluating sunlight and shadow studies and environmental impact studies. Although the Miglin-Beitler tower required city approval, it did not need a zoning variance. In 1974, after the 4.5-million-square-foot Sears Tower was built within the boundaries of Chicago's code, zoning was amended to require review for any building higher than 600 feet. These planned developments, as they are called, require the developer to meet with Planning Department officials, who evaluate the project. The process usually takes no more than six months. The full City Council votes on planned developments, usually following the recommendation of the Planning Department.
Since the plan development provision was added to the zoning code, no project has been rejected because of its height.
Despite questions about the feasibility of the Miglin-Beitler tower there is no doubt the developers are serious. In late February, soil borings were being taken on the site for testing in anticipation of sinking foundations within the year.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM WILLINGTON;
After 15 Years, Plan for I-84 Truck Stop Still Angers Residents

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN George L. Giguere drives the rural stretch of Interstate 84 between Manchester and the Massachusetts border, he sees an opportunity where other people see just trees.
The opportunity is the 32-acre tract of cleared land he owns at Exit 71 in Willington, where he has proposed a truck stop that would include a 200-seat restaurant and a motel with 60 to 70 units, a haven for weary truckers who are emerging from, or are ready to enter, the traffic jams of Hartford 25 miles to the southwest.
''I've consulted one of the top marketing experts in the country, and I've been told this will be one of the most successful travel parks in the country,'' said Mr. Giguere, of Woodbury. ''It's absolutely the perfect location.'' 
But many residents area see Mr. Giguere's dream as a nuisance and vow to fight it. They have already delayed construction for 15 years.
Penny Dionne, who lives about four miles from the planned truck stop, has been one of its most vocal critics. ''From an environmental standpoint, it's a disaster,'' she said.
She has received calls of support from people who live miles from the proposed truck stop, she said, and even from residents of neighboring Stafford.
 
'Like a Carnival'
Mrs. Dionne said she stayed at a truck stop once, near the Pennsylvania-Ohio border.
''I couldn't believe the noise,'' she said. ''And the smell of the trucks, and then the lights. It's almost like a carnival going on all the time.
''I don't think there's a town in Connecticut that would say, 'Give us a truck stop.' In fact, anyone who proposes a truck stop should be forced to live right next to it.''
First Selectman Roger W. Perry said that he had not polled residents about the truck stop and that he did not want to disclose his own feelings, particularly because the town is appealing an order by a judge in State Appellate Court that it grant the building permits for the project.
''When things are under litigation, it's not proper for me, as a town official, to be commenting on them,'' Mr. Perry said. He also said the Board of Selectmen had never taken any stand on the truck stop.
''It's not our business to take stands on issues like this,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We don't try to influence planning and zoning one way or another.''
Meg Reich, executive director of the Windham Regional Planning Agency, whose district includes Willington, said her agency had not had to vote on the truck stop, either. But she said she wondered whether the point is moot.
''The economy at this time is not the best for starting any new business,'' Ms. Reich said. She noted that a truck stop had recently closed, just over the state line in Sturbridge, Mass., about 10 minutes from Willington.
''Just how many truck stops can this world support?'' Ms. Reich asked.
 
Isolated Area
The disputed site is on Route 320, known locally as Ruby Road, one of three exits off the Interstate in Willington. It is an isolated area, with no houses nearby. The nearest neighbor is Red and Art's Service Station.
Mr. Giguere said the truck stop was proposed in 1975 by Willington Woods Associates, a partnership that renewed the building permits for two years before it began work at the site. There is now a cleared gravel lot on two levels, awaiting concrete foundations, asphalt driveways and parking lots.
No additional work was performed for several years, and in 1984 the permits were transferred to Mr. Giguere, who has won awards for another of his projects, Lakeridge in Torrington, a 475-unit condominium complex.
When the permits were renewed, though, a citizens' group sued to block the project. From 1984 to 1986, Mr. Giguere fought in Superior Court in Tolland County to defend the action of the Willington Planning and Zoning Commission that gave him the permits. But after he won the legal battle in 1987, the commission revoked the permits.
''There was no reason given,'' Mr. Giguere said. ''They just said they didn't want a truck stop there anymore. It didn't matter how many hundreds of thousands of dollars I had spent on design and engineering, they just didn't want it.''
 
Reviewing Ruling
So after years of defending the commission, Mr. Giguere took it to court. He also sued a former First Selectman for organizing the opposition, an action that has been dropped.
Mr. Giguere also sued the chairman of the zoning commission, Herbert E. Klei. ''People would be aghast if they knew the way you can be treated by these zoning boards,'' Mr. Giguere said.
He said he and his lawyers were reviewing a recent Superior Court decision in Litchfield County that held members of a zoning commission personally liable for damages for arbitrary decisions, because he does not believe the Willington board has ever given a good reason for reversing itself.
Mrs. Dionne said, however, that the board had not reversed itself but had not agreed to endless extensions of an old building permit.
 
Threat to Traffic
''We've gotten a lot smarter about environmental issues since 1975,'' Mrs. Dionne said. ''No one wants this kind of thing in town now.''
She said in addition to the pollution and noise, there would also be the danger of two or more trucks colliding and threats to traffic.
''People don't want to be fighting trucks getting on and off the highway,'' Mrs. Dionne said. ''When you have that many trucks in one area, it magnifies the possibility of an accident.''
Mrs. Dionne said neighbors were also worried about the crime that usually accompanies a truck stop.
''Prostitution is a problem at almost every truck stop in the country, along with drugs,'' Mrs. Dionne said. ''We don't have a police force. It's just a rural, country town.''
 
Security Force Promised
''And they're talking about a movie room in the plans,'' Mrs. Dionne said. ''I can just imagine what kind of movies would be shown, and I'll bet they're not Walt Disney.''
Mr. Giguere, however, said he would employ a security force, because truckers want a well-managed place to stop.
''To allow those things to go on at a modern truck stop would be the kiss of death,'' Mr. Giguere said.
''But the thing that really ticks me off is that without the truck driver, nothing happens in this country. For a town to be sitting out there and say all these people are no good and to use every method to subvert my efforts to put up a high-quality facility irritates me beyond belief.''
Mr. Giguere said that before state police patrols began rousting them, truck drivers used to pull off the side of the Interstate in Willington and sleep in their cabs. He is sure, he added, that there would be a market for the truck stop.
He said he was also sure that the ruling favoring his permit will be upheld and that he will soon begin construction.
''I'm ready to start that project on a week's notice,'' Mr. Giguere said.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: SAM GEJDENSON;
The Fallout From Military Cutbacks

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SAM GEJDENSON, the 41-year-old Bozrah Democrat who has been elected five times to Congress from Connecticut's Second District, has long been an advocate of economic diversification to make Connecticut less reliant on defense industries.
With the recent thaw in East-West relations and corresponding projections of military cutbacks, Mr. Gejdenson suddenly finds his views more popular. He is the co-author of the Economic Diversification and Defense Adjustment Act, which would appropriate up to $200 million this year to begin job retraining for dislocated defense workers and pay health insurance premiums for them while they are out of work, among other things. He has also co-sponsored bills to close some overseas bases, limit chemical and biological weapons and improve financial controls over the Pentagon.
Between town meetings around his district last week, Mr. Gejdenson agreed to answer questions about military spending. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q: You hear a lot of talk these days about the ''peace dividend.'' How would you define that? 
A: Well, if you listen to the Bush Administration, there is none. They really aren't ready to make the tough decisions in defense that need to be made. The question for this country is: Is our strength and our future protected better by spending $5.5 billion for the B-2, $2.8 billion for MX rail garrisons or $4.8 billion for Star Wars - or is it really in strengthening the economy and investing in the future, in research and development and education, as well as in economic opportunity in Eastern Europe, to make sure it's not just the West Germans and the Japanese who are the only ones to take advantage of the changes taking place there.
I think the greatest irony is while the Bush Administration is running to warm relations with China, within days of students being executed, they virtually have been unable to respond to anything Gorbachev has done.
Q: How large is the peace dividend going to be?
A: I think the defense budget this year, if we can get it down to $291 billion, we're doing very well. There's about a $15 billion difference between what the Bush Administration is calling for and what those of us who have proposed a ''Budget for a Strong America'' are calling for. The danger is if you don't stop some of these programs in the first year. We've locked into some of these expensive programs so that sometimes it costs us more to stop the program than to finish it.
Q: Why have even $291 billion if the threat is disappearing?
A: Part of it is because you just can't shut it down overnight. Part of it is you have to make sure all this establishes itself. But the biggest mistake we've made is we're not ready to pull our resources out of Western Europe and Japan. Japan has a $55 billion trade surplus with us, and we're subsidizing their defense. The Germans are dancing together under the Brandenburg Gate, and we're defending West Germans from East Germans.
Q: There's already several camps of opinion emerging concerning how the peace dividend should be spent. What are your own views?
A: We don't have that great a choice. We ought to use some of it for deficit reduction, maybe 25 percent, something like that. But you have to use the rest of it to deal with unmet needs and keep the economy growing.
If you lose workers in defense, if you bring soldiers home from Europe, you've got to put them to work somewhere, or the economy will slow down, and the deficit will go up. We ought to put those people to building housing and education programs and other programs that the country needs. If you took all the defense money and just tried to reduce the deficit, you'd have a massive recession.
Q: Why won't some people acknowledge the diminishing threat?
A: I think it's instinctive in mankind to be somewhat cautious. There have been other periods in the world when things have calmed down only to become somewhat troublesome. But I don't think we've seen as radical a change in the world situation between East and West in modern history. You have fundamental changes going on, and you can never know how it's going to end, but I think you can be certain if we simply sit on the sidelines, it will end up worse.
The best hope for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is for the United States to help them build their democracy. That's what we're best at. That's what the Nicaraguan election proved.
Q: Will we then maneuver our defense forces to the drug war and fighting terrorism, and end up just shifting the budget?
A: No, hopefully we'll pay attention to the things we should be paying attention to, although it doesn't seem so from the Bush budget, of course. We ought to be investing in education and health care and housing and the environment. The President's proposal on the highway system is absolutely pathetic.
When you look at things like the drug war, there is a responsibility there, but we ought to help the towns by putting police on the streets and through education.
Q: You've got a heavily defense-oriented district. Do your constituents believe the talk about peace?
A: Everyone is concerned about their job, but the mind-set is there. People in this district wanted a defense cut for decades. For the whole Reagan era, they didn't think it made sense to build every weapons system the Pentagon or the defense contractors wanted.
Q: Are you concerned things in your district, like the submarine base or Electric Boat, which builds submarines, could be held hostage if you continue demands for scaling back defense?
A: No. The danger is, if we buy things we don't need we won't have money for the things we do need. Nobody's going to be able, long term, to keep things that aren't necessary. I was working with a group yesterday, we're trying to change priorities. People talk about cutting the B-1 or the MX or Star Wars and the Midgetman, but nobody talks about cutting submarines. We need them.
Q: How have you been able to maintain good relationships with defense contractors in your district despite your calls for cutbacks?
A: I think it's because I've been honest. I was called by one of the defense contractors in the northern part of the district, who brought me in front of 400 workers and said, ''Tell them why you voted against the B-1.'' I don't know if I won any votes that day, but I told them the truth. And I think history has shown it was an absolute disaster we built the B-1.
Q: Is there any model for diversification?
A: Eastern Connecticut has led the nation with Seatech, a diversification incubator; we hope to have the money in April or May to really kick off the first part of how to adjust for peace. This is the first defense-focused incubator in the country, defense-focused in the sense that it recognizes areas that need to change. When the woolen mills left, they left behind plants, facilities, workers, equipment that was outdated. The workers had been trained for technology that died a hundred years earlier, and just kind of hung on by accident. This time it's different, we have the best workers, the most modern facilities, the best equipment, and it is possible to replace imports, to start exports, to grow in non-defense areas.
Q: You started to talk about diversification 10 years ago when you were first elected. What convinced you so early?
A: I think it was the woolen mills. When I was growing up, entire communities were decimated by the fact one mill left, 5, 10, sometimes 15 years earlier. I think it sensitized all people who are in public service in eastern Connecticut, Republicans and Democrats. I had a Republican mayor in my office, from Groton, David Winkler, talking about diversification and wanting to do anything he could do. It's irresponsible to sit there in the good times and not do anything to prepare for the bad times.
Q: Are you getting more support for your views these days?
A: You know, you do it for so long, you talk about it for so long, and no one's listening, no one's responding to it. Then all of a sudden you've got so many calls on diversification you'd rather talk about anything else.
Q: Is it too late to start diversification now, without dislocation?
A: No, absolutely not. There will be some areas harder hit, but basically all the Federal programs are in place.
If you take the trade readjustment act, which provides education, health care, training, and the Small Business Administration loans, and other programs, put it all together and say communities that get a notice that their plant's being shut down because of lack of demand for defense items, they should be immediately eligible for all these programs.
We can make it work. We had Sikorsky that said it at one point looked into making light rail cars. This country now buys them from Japan. Maybe if we pushed them a little, with financing and other incentives, they'd do it for sure. That would help our trade picture and it would help the economy.

HEADLINE: Township Ties Economic Hopes to New Prison

BYLINE: By JAMES RUTHERFORD

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
WHEN New Jersey's first Federal prison opens its gates next month, officials say, it will be an example of enlightened penal philosophy - a structure without surrounding walls or guard towers. It will also be a prison that its neighbors have invited into their economically depressed rural community in the hope that it will bring development and jobs, local officials say.
Formal dedication of the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution at Fairton, in Cumberland County, is scheduled for April 24. Attending it is none of the tension that might have been expected locally. Rather, the prison is opening amid the kind of ribbon-cutting hoopla associated with new supermarkets and shopping malls.
Tomorrow the Federal Bureau of Prisons will take members of the news media on a tour of the new prison, and later in the week it will hold a ''community open house.'' Local service organizations, social clubs, even the Boy Scouts are invited - anyone curious to see a prison that more closely resembles an industrial park than a place where criminals must be kept for society's protection. 
 
'We Don't Hide Anything From Anyone'
''We've tried to reach every area of the county,'' the warden, Michael B. Cooksey, said. ''If anyone in the community is concerned, we can address those concerns. We operate an open prison. We don't hide anything from anyone.''
Mayor Kennard Hildreth, whose 44-square-mile community will be home to the prison's 1,000 male inmates for an average of six to eight years each, said: ''It's a lovely place. I've been through it.''
It is more besides. The Fairton prison, which is about 40 miles southeast of Camden, has become a locus of hope for the residents of these flat, sandy vegetable farms and sleepy saltbox houses deep in the scrub-pine woods at the southern end of New Jersey. Commercial development is virtually nonexistent here. Unemployment runs in double digits in a county whose 7.2 percent jobless rate is the highest in the state, according to the State Department of Labor.
''We feel it is going to be a tremendous asset,'' Freeholder Clair Miller said.
For the Bureau of Prisons, the $45 million institution is the latest part of a nationwide construction boom intended to provide living space for a growing prison population of more than 55,000. The system is already 67 percent over capacity and its numbers are expected to double by 1995, said Greg Bogdan, a spokesman for the bureau in Washington.
Institutions similar to Fairton have opened in the last few years in Pennsylvania, Oregon and Florida. Two more are in the planning stages, in Pennsylvania and Georgia.
The Fairton prison is tucked away from view on 250 acres, deep in a forest of oak and pine. The only evidence of human activity is Fairton Road, a deserted two-lane strand of asphalt that opens onto State Highway 49 about seven miles to the east. Occasionally visible from the roadside are a few rude wooden stands nailed to trees and left in anticipation of the deer-hunting season.
The prison was designed for 550 inmates. But overcrowding in Federal prisons has spawned a system of ''double bunking,'' which will double that number. The site will also include a security unit for people who are placed in the Federal witness protection program.
A $9.8 million detention center run by the Federal Marshal's Service will be added next year. The detention center, designed to house 150 to 200 people awaiting trial or sentencing, is expected to expand to 600. It will siphon off some of the overcrowding at the New York Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and provide bed space for a daily average of 150 Federal inmates temporarily incarcerated under contracts with the jails in Bergen, Cape May, Gloucester, Passaic, Mercer and Somerset Counties.
Fairton's cell blocks are actually four detached two-story units. Each contains 128 cinder-block cells, each with a window, a desk, a storage cabinet, a porcelain sink, a mirror and a porcelain toilet. The cells have windowed doors of steel rather than bars. Each housing unit has a central seating and recreation area and a desk staffed by two uniformed guards.
 
An Intricate Security System
The units are linked by outdoor concrete paths that cross landscaped grounds and a copse of oak trees and converge on a complex of factories, where the inmates will work; classrooms, a library, a dining hall, a chapel, a gym, a weight room, a commissary, a hospital and administrative offices. Beyond the complex are two softball fields, outdoor basketball courts and a track.
Officials say that the pride of the entire system is a carefully planned and intricate layering of security. It operates on three separate but interconnecting levels: design, screening and strict regimentation. ''If there is such a thing as a state of the art, this is it,'' said John Weaver, spokesman for the prison.
The entire prison complex is antiseptic in appearance, constructed of tile and cinder block with generous amounts of glass, which is both pleasing to the eye and allows for nearly complete visibility from anywhere within the central complex. Interior corners are equipped with closed-circuit cameras and monitors.
The perimeter is ringed by two rows of looped razor ribbon, 12 feet high and drawing its name from the one-and-a-quarter-inch knife-shaped razors attached to it. The fences are electronically sensitive to contact, which can be pinpointed anywhere along their length from a central control room.
Beyond the wire, the prison complex is circled by a mile of road that will have two 24-hour, armed motorized patrols. Every staff member, from uniformed guards to secretaries, undergoes correctional and weapons training.
Internally, security will be maintained by population control, prison officials say. Inmates will be screened before admission according to the nature of their crimes and past criminal history.
Mr. Cooksey said most of those accepted at Fairton would be drug offenders, about 30 to 35 years old, with two to five previous arrests and at least one previous incarceration, usually a short-term one. They are not considered violent, he said, because their records do not identify shooting crimes or robberies, and none have made escape attempts.
Inmates will also be screened by a staff physician and a psychiatrist when they enter the prison. All phone calls will be monitored by computer. Every piece of mail will be opened and checked for contraband.
It is uncertain when inmates will begin arriving, mostly because the prison is awaiting approval of its well water system by the State Department of Environmental Protection.
The prisoners will find a daily routine that is strictly regimented. They will be responsible for upkeep of their cells and the bathing and dining areas. Every inmate who can function on an eighth-grade level or above will be required to take at least 90 days of schooling, which will lead to a high school equivalency diploma. All will have jobs to perform, for which they will be paid from 11 cents to $1.10 an hour, depending on the skills involved.
 
'Inmates Do All the Work'
''We learned a long time ago that we can't rehabilitate an inmate, so we train them to help us run the prison,'' Mr. Cooksey said. ''The inmates do all the work. They do the plumbing, cooking, cleaning up, the nonsensitive clerical work, the wiring and electrical work, grounds maintenance, landscaping and carpentry.''
''Everything we do,'' he added, ''is geared to keeping the inmates busy. Idleness is the worst thing in the world to a prison. You will never see an inmate idle. The facility will be kept immaculately clean. We have an overabundance of labor. We know their whereabouts every minute of the day.''
Inmates will buy all their luxuries - from postage stamps and telephone calls to toothpaste and shampoo - from their earnings.
At the heart of the system is Federal Prison Industries, known by the trade name Unicor, which will operate 41,376 square feet of factory and vocational training space at Fairton.
A division of the Bureau of Prisons, Unicor is entirely self-supporting from sales of inmate-manufactured products to the Federal Government - everything from national-park signs and mailbags to uniforms, life rafts and the furniture in Congressional offices.
Unicor bids competitively with private industry for Government contracts. Its largest customer is the Defense Department. Unicor sales last year totaled $327 million, said Dean Leech, the Fairton prison's associate warden for industries and education.
At Fairton, Unicor will be primarily engaged in the manufacture of electric cable for use in military tanks and helicopters. It will also sponsor a pilot program in which a private contractor, Unibase of Salt Lake City, will train and employ inmates in data processing.
 
A Community Relations Board
From the standpoint of the prison's new neighbors, good public relations have been achieved through the formation of a community relations board. Its 27 members include Mayor Hildreth, Freeholder Miller, Warden Cooksey and representatives of the police departments of the county, the Sheriff's Department, schools, hospitals and private businesses.
''Any opposition has more or less quieted down,'' Mr. Hildreth said. ''No one has expressed concern about escapes.'' Mr. Miller said: ''It looks like a college campus. It's secure; it's remote. I couldn't find any negatives.''
County officials hope that the prison will be a tonic for its sluggish economy and chronic unemployment.
Mr. Miller, a resident of neighboring Upper Deerfield Township who is a business professor at Cumberland County College, was largely responsible for leading the prison proposal through four years of planning and negotiations between the Bureau of Prisons and the residents and officials of Fairfield Township. He also helped obtain a $1 million state grant to buy the site and extend a county sewer line to it.
''I did it mainly from an economic development standpoint,'' he said. ''I'm an economist, and I know a lot about development. It's a clean industry. It's spawned a lot of construction and a lot of jobs.''
 
Starting With a Staff of 260
The prison will open with a staff of 260, which includes uniformed officers, administrative and clerical personnel, and skilled tradespeople, at annual salaries ranging from $14,573 to $29,891. The staff will increase by 230 jobs when the marshal's detention center is opened.
So far, 87 jobs have been filled by residents of southern New Jersey. Fifty-two are from Cumberland County and 10 from Fairfield Township, which has a jobless rate of 12.4 percent.
The financially strapped township received $255,000 last year under New Jersey's Distressed Cities Program. The State Division of Local Government Services has supervised the township budget, which has failed to balance, since July 1989.
Mr. Hildreth is guardedly optimistic in his assessment of the prison's role in Fairfield. ''I think, in the county as a whole, it's going to mean a lot of jobs,'' he said. ''In the township a few people have been hired, not a whole lot. But it could mean a lot of positive things in some areas, in terms of services for the township. I'm hoping the township will be able to take advantage of some of those things.''
What Mr. Miller and county officials point to is the $10 million to $12 million the prison will annually pump into the local economy in wages and purchases of goods and services from businesses in the region.
 
Benefits for Subcontractors
The county has already reaped some significant benefits from $12.4 million in construction awards that went to four local subcontractors. The related jobs and other benefits have been a shot in the arm, said Glenn R. Nickerson, spokesman for the county. ''We're very pleased that the Bureau of Prisons is happy with the location and how they've been received in the area,'' he said. ''We're pleased that they're looking to expand the long-range employment possibilities.''
Mr. Miller is looking ahead to a lot of secondary benefits from the prison. He said one new hotel was under construction in nearby Millville, partly to accommodate the anticipated influx of prison administrators, marshals and visitors and families of the inmates. He said two or three hotel chains were also exploring the area, possibly to build another hotel in the county seat of Bridgeton, some 10 miles to the north of Fairton.
''A prison is a negative thing in a lot of people's minds,'' he said. ''It used to be that there was community opposition. But when you think about it, there is no pollution, no traffic, no burden on the school system. Any development has negatives. Here, there are none. Now, when you look across the nation, there is actually competition for them because they are seen now as a tremendous economic value to a community.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Mandate for Unity 'as Soon as Possible'

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Monday, March 19

 BODY:
In their surprising endorsement of a conservative alliance led by the Christian Democrats, the East Germans declared loudly that, as a young voter named Susanna Frank put it, ''We should get out of this mess as soon as possible.''
The large vote for the Christian Democrats and more generally for parties backed by Bonn was in effect a death sentence for the German Democratic Republic and an endorsement of absorption, as quickly as possible, into big, rich West Germany.
Even those worried about their jobs and social benefits seemed to accept that unification was like an injection -painful, frightening, but unavoidable and so best gotten over with.
 
An Exuberant Celebration
''Every day we waste not having reunification just makes matters worse,'' declared Miss Frank, a 25-year-old East Berliner who seemed to echo the sentiment of hundreds who flocked to a discotheque in the center of the city on Sunday for an exuberant celebration by the Christian Democratic Union of a victory that no polls and no pundits had really anticipated.
Even many East Germans probably did not know for sure how they would vote in the first free election in their state. The one consistent thing polls had shown was that many voters were undecided, and in the weeks before the election the public mood seemed to lurch daily from hope to despair. 
When they went behind the voting partitions - borrowed from West Berlin - the majority of the 12 million voters decided that they saw no point in clinging to any vestiges of the system that had left them poor, shabby and suffering from pollution. More than 40 percent voted for the C.D.U., and three-quarters cast their ballots for parties backed by counterparts in West Germany.
 
Next: An All-German Ballot
The first free election in East German history, many pointed out, was likely to be its last. The next election in which East Germans vote, possibly within a year, is likely to be an all-German ballot.
In effect, the election of a Parliament dominated by West German-backed parties marks the real beginning of German unification. Whatever pace it assumes, the process can lead to only one conclusion now.
One international effect is likely to be felt at the talks between the two Germanys and the four major victors of World War II in Europe -the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - which will soon begin in earnest. The Germanys will effectively speak with one voice.
The Soviet Union in particular has tried to slow the process toward unification and has resisted efforts to place a united Germany in the Western camp. But a pro-Western government in East Berlin will make Moscow's case harder to maintain.
Sunday's vote was a major milestone in the tumultuous but peaceful revolution that for the East Germans began last May, when East Germans began trickling west through newly opened gates in Hungary. By fall, the trickle was a flow that undermined the hard-line Communist regime of Erich Honecker and led his retreating successors to open the Berlin wall.
 
Euphoria and Dismay
 In the turbulent months that followed, the euphoria of reunion was supplanted by the dismay over revelations of East Germany's true economic plight, and even more by the despair of the East Germans as their visits to the West revealed their relative poverty.
The exact timetable for unification remains unknown. Obviously relishing a victory for which he could claim the major credit, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany declared that the East Germans had rejected socialism of any sort, and that ''the voters showed they want to go the way of unity with the Federal Republic.''
The vote in effect gave Mr. Kohl the possibility of extending considerable influence over East Germany and pursuing his goals of swift currency and economic union. But he left unclear when he expected political union.
One possible factor in his hedging was a growing resistance to hasty union in West Germany. A West German television poll showed that 66 percent in West Germany favored taking time in unifying the Germanys.
 
'Quick Path to Unity' Backed
But as Ibrahim Bohme, the chairman of the Social Democratic party in the East, acknowledged, what is clear is that in East Germany, ''the people have voted for a quick path to unity.''
Outside the C.D.U. celebration, the sentiments were more blunt. ''If I could do it, I'd have unity overnight,'' declared Hans Neubauer, 51 years old. ''A lot of us older people want to live our lives now. We've had the Reds long enough. Just look at the outcome.''
The tentative election results gave the Christian Democrats 40.9 percent of the vote and 164 of the 400 seats in the People's Chamber under the proportional representation system. Their sister party, the German Social Union, got 6.3 percent and 25 seats.
The third member party, Democratic Reawakening, gathered 0.9 percent and 4 seats.
The Social Democrats' total was 21.8 percent of the vote, which entitles them to 87 seats. The successor to the discredited Communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, placed third with 16.3 percent of the total and 65 seats.
While West German-backed parties took 75 percent, none of the home-grown parties except the Communists managed to win any significant support. New Forum, the first movement forged in the rebellious fall, managed to garner less than 3 percent for its coalition of popular movements.
 
Grand Coalition Likely
The C.D.U. and its conservative allies are considered likely to seek a grand coalition with the Social Democratic party to achieve the two-thirds majority needed to change the Constitution and clear the way for unification.
Lothar de Maiziere, the chairman of the East German C.D.U., said coalition talks would start on Monday. ''What we need is a majority that can change the constitution,'' he said. ''That's why we need a very broad coalition, in which I don't exclude the S.P.D. or the Liberals.''
Mr. de Maiziere, 50 years old, replaced Gerhard Gotting as chairman of the C.D.U. last October. A slight man with a goatee, Mr. de Maiziere quickly tried to salvage the party, purging the old guard and committing the party to a market economy and rapid unification. He served as a Deputy Prime Minister in the caretaker coalition of Prime Minister Hans Modrow.
Mr. de Maziere joined the C.D.U. when he was 16. He played the viola in various orchestras for about 15 years, until forced to quit by an arm ailment in 1975.
He turned instead to law, and part of his practice was to defend conscientious objectors. He was born in Nordhausen on March 2, 1940, into a devout Protestant family descended from genteel Huguenot exiles from France. He is married and has three daughters.
As head of the C.D.U., Mr. de Maiziere stands to become Prime Minister of a government whose primary function will be to prepare its own absorption into the Federal Republic.
The vote was less a testament to Mr. de Maiziere than to Mr. Kohl, who in seven weeks of campaigning on a platform of rapid unity had taken the small and tainted East German C.D.U., for 40 years a tame appendage of the Communist Party, and thrust it to the front.
Until political change swept through East Germany last fall, the East German C.D.U. was one of the ''bloc parties'' maintained by the Communists as window dressing. Once the Communist old guard fell, the C.D.U. quickly unloaded its own old leadership. Mr. Gotting, the former chairman, is in prison awaiting trial on corruption charges.
That past kept Mr. Kohl away until February, when the S.P.D.'s widening lead prompted him to shape an East German alliance of the C.D.U. with two smaller conservative parties. He then threw his formidable weight behind a powerful campaign.
The only solution to East Germany's plight, Mr. Kohl argued in six rallies that drew 1.2 million East Germans, is a rapid economic and monetary union, followed by political unification. The message was spread by 2,000 other West German speakers, 20 million leaflets and half a million posters.
''The people put trust in him, who promised a lot of money,'' groused Oskar Lafontaine, the probable S.P.D. candidate in December's West German elections. ''That's Kohl. We'll be reminding him daily of his promises.''

HEADLINE: CONSERVATIVES BACKED BY KOHL TOP EAST GERMAN VOTE SOLIDLY BUT APPEAR TO NEED COALITION

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Monday, March 19

 BODY:
A group of conservative parties, led by the Christian Democrats and actively supported by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, scored a surprising victory on Sunday in the first free election in East Germany. The eastern Germans had not freely cast their ballots since Hitler abolished the Weimar Republic after coming to power in 1933.
The victory of the Alliance for Germany, which most strongly advocated reunification with West Germany, raised hopes among many East Germans that a joining of the two Germanys would come about soon. But political leaders interviewed on East and West German television declined to set timetables. 
Although the alliance finished first in the voting, it did not appear to have won enough seats in Parliament for a majority.
 
Top Finishers
Tentative final results, announced early today by the election commission, gave the three parties of the alliance 48.1 percent of the vote, which entitles them to 193 seats in the 400-member Parliament. Finishing a distant second were the Social Democrats, the early favorites in the campaign, who emerged as the election's big loser. The discredited Communists finished a surprisingly strong third. Lothar de Maiziere, the East German Christian Democratic leader, speaking to television interviewers, hinted strongly at a ''grand coalition'' of his alliance and other parties, including the Social Democrats.
Ibrahim Bohme, the chairman of the Social Democrats, also hinted that his party was interested in a coalition role.
Chancellor Kohl glowed with satisfaction at what he called the ''splendid result'' of the election. In a television round-table discussion in Bonn, he strongly urged the formation of a coalition of ''all democratic parties'' in view of the seriousness of the problems facing East Germany.
 
Effect on Kohl
The results in East Germany were expected to affect the campaign for West German elections in December in which Mr. Kohl, who campaigned vigorously here for Christian Democratic candidates, is seeking to retain power.
Although he says that he favors gradual unification of the two Germanys, his critics assert that he wants to move too fast, possibly because so many East Germans now appear to be politically conservative and therefore inclined to support his party. The conservative alliance's victory was also seen as a rejection of socialism. [In Washington, The Associated Press quoted a White House statement hailing the election as a ''historic occasion.''] In party-by-party tallies, the election commission said the Christian Democrats had received 4.69 million votes, or 40.9 percent of the total. This gave them 164 seats. A sister party, the German Social Union, received 6.3 percent of the votes and 25 seats. The third member party, Democratic Reawakening, gained 0.9 percent of the vote and 4 seats.
The Social Democrats' total was 2.5 million votes, or 21.8 percent, and 87 seats.
A further surprise on the left was the unexpectedly strong showing of the successor to the discredited Communists, the Party for Democratic Socialism. The party placed third, with 1.87 million votes, or 16.3 percent, and 65 seats.
The New Forum, the citizens' movement whose protests were pivotal in forcing the Communists from power last year, participated in the election in a coalition called Alliance 90, which also included Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights. Alliance 90 received less than 3 percent of the votes.
 
Genscher Allies' Standing
The most likely coalition partner for the victorious conservatives was a grouping of liberal parties backed by the Free Democratic Party of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister, which is already the junior partner in the West's governing coalition. Its East German counterpart received 5.2 percent of the popular vote and 21 seats. The remaining seats had yet to be decided.
Electoral participation, which had been expected to be high, surpassed expectations. A total of 11.5 million, or 93.2 percent of 12.3 million eligible voters took part.
Mr. de Maiziere, whose party was once a subservient junior partner with the Communists before they were ousted last year, is the leading candidate for the post of Prime Minister. He refused in television interviews to discuss this or any other personnel question before he meets with his party's executive committee today.
In an indication of the break with earlier elections in this country, which were limited to approving candidates chosen by the Communist Party and its junior coalition partners, voters were told they must use voting booths so that ballots could be marked in secret. In the absence of competition, voters before had, for the most part, simply folded their ballots and put them in an urn. The booths used in Sunday's voting had to be imported from West Germany.
 
Currency a Top-Priority Issue
Chancellor Kohl and Mr. de Maiziere, speaking separately, proposed parallel ideas for the new government. The Chancellor listed in first place the introduction of the West German mark as East Germany's official currency.
At the same time, he said, a framework must be created for the introduction of a market economy, where supply and demand determine economic activity instead of the existing planned economy.
The Chancellor said this should be accompanied by measures to protect East Germany's citizens against resulting risks like devaluation of their old-age pensions and unemployment likely to result from the closing of inefficient enterprises.
Mr. Kohl declined to set a timetable for the completion of such measures except to say that they should be carried out ''as quickly as possible.'' He said such internal steps were a prerequisite for progress in the international negotiations on reunification, in which the two Germanys will deal with the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain.
 
A Plea to Remain in East
The Chancellor, like other East and West German leaders speaking in hours of television interviews and panel discussions through the night, urged East Germans to take heart from the election results and abandon plans that ''perhaps hundreds of thousands'' among them might have of joining the continuing exodus to West Germany.
He urged them to ''stay home'' and ''go to work'' so as to help in the economic reconstruction of their country. ''Those who come here now will be lacking there,'' he cautioned.
Mr. Bohme, the Social Democratic leader, who had said throughout the campaign that the Social Democrats were opposed to any coalition, said Sunday that he would not accept a Cabinet post.
Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the West German Social Democrats, like other leaders of his party, said that the important thing was that after so many years free elections had taken place, even if he found the results unsatisfactory.
''Who would have thought a year ago that tonight there would be 80 Social Democrats in the East German Parliament?'' said former Chancellor Willy Brandt, honorary chairman of both the West and East German parties at East German Social Democratic headquarters. ''In any case, this was not the last election.''

HEADLINE: 1986 Tax Reform Act Affects U.S. Revenues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Big Shortfall in Corporate Taxes Thwarts Key Goal of 1986 Law'' (front page, March 6) cites a number of reasons corporate income tax revenues may be lower than predicted. Yet you gloss over the only reason that individual income tax revenues are higher and the central reason that corporate tax revenues are lower than Government economists predicted. 
The reason is that official revenue estimators ignore the practical fact that taxes affect the behavior of taxpayers. When corporate taxes were increased, corporate investment and doing business as a corporation became less attractive, so revenues did not reach anticipated levels.
When individual rates were reduced, the incentives were changed, individuals chose to work more, save more and move tax-sheltered investments into taxable investments.
The Chamber of Commerce predicted these effects in the debate over the 1986 tax reform and has long encouraged revenue estimators to take them into account. Perhaps you should ask the Government revenue estimators why they insist on using economic techniques that provide policy makers with erroneous revenue estimates.

HEADLINE: The Japanese Are Working Themselves to Death;
Don't Hurry History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report from Tokyo (Business Day, Feb. 26) on impediments to United States-Japanese trade talks and the exasperation of American negotiators with Japanese refusal to scrap the Large Scale Retail Stores Law. This law enables small retailers to block the introduction of large department stores and supermarkets, which can be expected to carry more imported goods than small mom-and-pop stores.
Never mind that the Japanese Government, which controls only the lower house of Parliament, could not possibly get such legislation approved. You report ''the United States has demanded that the law be scrapped.'' 
Next to this, the Business Scene column explains the plight of big-name department stores like Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue: ''The problem is that the public is rattling around in too many stores - with too much shopping space.'' Overcapacity, the column notes, is producing constant store closings and job losses, until even the giants are in danger.
Quite obviously, there are two very different systems of economic and social policy involved here: the one entirely market oriented and indifferent to waste and disruption; the other rooted in the view that guidance is a good thing.
For the United States to demand that Japan change the ways that have brought it this far, a demand the Japanese Government could not honor even if it tried to, seems arrogant. Granted, Japanese consumers would be first to benefit from wider choices and lower prices, but it would be a good deal healthier if they asked for those changes, instead of being presented with an outside demand.
In the years before Matthew Perry negotiated the first United States-Japanese trade treaty in 1854, Japanese urban ''machi,'' or sections, were communities of blocklong streets, closable at both ends by wooden gates for security, in which frontage owners had shares and decided who could move in or out, rather like the members of an exclusive co-op or condominium.
One can imagine the howls if Japanese negotiators were to demand free entry for their nationals in defiance of any restrictive agreements. That too might be a good thing, but it wouldn't be very smart. ''A wise man,'' Adlai E. Stevenson once said, ''does not try to hurry history.'' Not when there are more important things at stake and certainly not when it won't work anyway.

HEADLINE: U.S. Found Lagging in Children's Well-Being

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Children in the United States are more likely than children in 11 other industrialized countries to live in poverty, to live with only one parent or to be killed before they reach the age of 25, according to a Government report released today.
American children were also more likely to die before their first birthday than children in the other countries except for the Soviet Union, the study showed.
The study by the Census Bureau compared 57 social, economic and health indicators for children in the United States to those in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Soviet Union, Sweden and West Germany.
While other studies have shown that economic and miltary strength of the United States has not guaranteed that its citizens would be at less risk for a host of social, economic and health problems, the new report is the first to compile data for children and to emphasize them. 
The report, ''Children's Well-Being: An International Comparison,'' was issued by the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. It used a new Census Bureau compilation that includes international statistics on the well-being of children.
''The dead babies, the murders, the child poverty, are a hemorrhage on human resources and the American spirit,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is chairman of the select committee. ''We just can't continue to have it go on. It escalates the amount of budget resources that must go in to clean up the mess.''
 
Impetus to Child Care Bill
The release of the report comes as the House Education and Labor Committee and the Ways and Means Committee are nearing an agreement on a comprehensive child care bill. The measure has been bogged down by differences between the two committees over where the money should come from and whether to create a new program or expand an existing one.
''This study will add additional steam to the child care bill,'' Mr. Miller said.
The United States lags behind every other country in the study except the Soviet Union in the number of children who die before their first birthday. In 1986, the most recent year for which figures were available, 10 American children per 1,000 births died before the age of 1, as against 5 children per 1,000 in Japan and 25 per 1,000 in the Soviet Union. The figures for the Soviet Union may be even higher, the report said, because it does not count the deaths of some born in high-risk groups.
Also in 1986, American males under 25 were five times more likely to be killed than were similar males in the other 11 countries. The murder rate for American females in is less than one-third that of American males, but it is still one and a half times that of the next highest nation.
Australia and the United States had the highest percentages of children living in poverty, 17 percent, the report said.
 
Highest Number of Divorces
The United States also had the highest number of children under 18 whose parents had divorced, the report said, as well as the highest number of families headed by a single parent.
In the United States, 10 percent of women aged 15 to 19 said they had been pregnant, as against 8 percent in Hungary, the next highest nation, and 1 percent in Japan, which had the lowest rate.
The United states did compare favorably in the amount of money spent on education and in the rates of youth suicide and youth unemployment.
''Many believe that how well we take care of our most vulnerable population is a measure of our commitment to the society over all,'' said Kay Johnson, the director of the health division of the Children's Defense Fund. ''If we do not get behind a national commitment to invest in our children, our poor relative performance can have an enormous impact on the productivity of our future.''
Copies of the report will be available from the Census Bureau in July, at a price that has not yet been determined.

HEADLINE: Spring Training Towns Lose Hopes for Baseball

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHANDLER, Ariz., March 17

 BODY:
If you arrive in this desert town in midafternoon these days, it is usually still possible to catch a few innings of major league baseball at Compadre Stadium, the immaculately manicured, 5,000-seat winter home of the Milwaukee Brewers.
Unfortunately, because of the baseball lockout all the action has been on a battered television set in a corner of the stadium souvenir shop. Over and over, the management has been playing a videotape of a 1988 exhibition game against the archrival Chicago Cubs, a glorious event that attracted nearly twice as many spectators as the stadium has seats.
The memento-crammed shop provides folding chairs, beer and authentic ballpark franks, all cheerfully dispensed by retirees like Shelby Scruggs and Ralph Rondeau, who volunteer their time every year to help out at the stadium. Lately, they have been directing most of their energies to trying to cheer up the few hundred people who stop by each day, many just to peer forlornly at the empty stadium. 
''Some of 'em come in here real angry at us,'' Mr. Rondeau said. ''But after a while, they realize that we're all victims of this thing.'' [But there was reason for hope as negotiators for the owners of major league baseball teams and players reached an agreement late Sunday night and teams began making plans to send equipment to their camps.] Toting Up Their Losses Officials in Chandler and Arizona's six other Cactus League communities say they are still toting up their losses from the monthlong lockout, which mainly involves a disagreement about when players become eligible for salary arbitration. The lockout has cut deeply into the $145 million in statewide income that is usually generated by the exhibition season. The situation is equally bleak for Florida's Grapefruit League, whose 17 spring training sites had been expected to bring in up to $330 million.
The lockout has been particularly troublesome for Plant City, Fla., a town of about 40,000 on the west coast. Three years ago, it built a new stadium for the Cincinnati Reds to use as their spring training home, and this year the new stadium has remained idle.
Mayor Bob Henderson estimated the stillborn spring training season has cost at least $170,000 in lost parking fees and ticket purchases.
Hotel bookings are down in Bradenton, a community of about 40,000 south of Plant City that is the spring training home of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
''We were expecting about a 5 percent increase this year over last, but we've had a 10 percent decrease instead,'' said Sergio Ortiz, the general manager of the Holiday Inn Riverfront in downtown Bradenton.
In Mesa, Ariz., the Cubs' winter home, eight miles up the freeway from Chandler, motel occupancy is off 7 percent. Two hundred miles away in Yuma, where the San Diego Padres and California Angels train, officials are projecting a loss of at least $8 million. In Scottsdale, the spring headquarters of the San Francisco Giants, volunteers from the local Boys Club are trying to figure out what to do with thousands of dollars worth of souvenirs they had planned to sell at games.
 
Worries About a Mortgage
And in Chandler, a farming and light-industrial center of 85,000 located 20 miles southeast of Phoenix, the businessmen who own the four-year-old Compadre Stadium, which receives no public subsidies, say they do not know where they are going to get the money to make a $193,000 mortgage payment next month.
''We're in a real bind,'' said Frank. P. Pezzorello, the 42-year-old manager and part-owner of the $2.2 million ballpark, which donates a portion of its spring training proceeds each year to local charities and community groups.
Right now, the only real money coming in, Mr. Pezzorello said glumly, is from the sale of T-shirts featuring a baseball diamond wrapped in chains and the legend ''I Was Locked Out at Spring Training 1990.''
At $12.50 apiece, the shop has sold nearly 1,000 so far, some to loyal fans in faraway Wisconsin who heard about them on local radio stations.
''Our only real hope,'' Mr. Pezzorello said, ''is that someone with a lot of money will step forward and say, 'Hey, we'll help you out - you guys have done a lot for the community.' ''
As for the rest of the spring season, Mr. Pezzorello has all but written it off, considering that the regular season is scheduled to start on April 2.
''If they settled tomorrow,'' he said, ''the Brewers would come here to practice and the fans could come to watch. But it would take 10 days for us and the Brewers to get ready to play exhibition ball, and there's just no time left for that.''
In the long run, many residents say, the real damage to spring baseball may be more spiritual than economic. Forced to find other outlets for entertainment, many dedicated fans appear to have done the unthinkable: They have begun to get used to the idea of life without baseball.
The phenomenon has been especially pronounced in Arizona lately, where Gov. Rose Mofford posed for photographs the other day holding a football after her triumphant announcement that Tempe, Ariz., had been designated as the site of the 1993 Super Bowl.
Hardly anyone mentioned that Tempe's Diablo Stadium, 14 miles north of Chandler, is where the Seattle Mariners were supposed to be training this month.
 
Super Bowl and Basketball
''Nobody around here is talking about anything but the Super Bowl and college basketball,'' said Gloria Bow, a co-owner of the Stadium Club Restaurant and Sports Lounge in Chandler. ''I think the baseball fans are really bummed out by what's happened, and that once it starts up again, it's going to take them a while to get back into it.''
Visitors to the area are busying themselves with what Steven L. Vierck, the executive director of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce, described as Arizona's ''alternative forms of entertainment'' - sightseeing, golf, buying turquoise jewelry and attending events like last week's four-day Chandler Ostrich Festival, which commemorates the period at the turn of the century when Chandler produced ostrich plumes for women's hats.
''I have a feeling,'' Mr. Vierck said with a satisfied smile, ''that a lot of people may have ended up doing more driving and spending more money than they would have watching baseball.''
Although business is off in the region, the overall effects appear to be something less than the commercial disaster many had feared. Many people planning visits to the Chandler-Mesa area, stuck with nonrefundable travel and baseball tickets, went ahead with their vacations despite the lockout.
''We've lost a little bit, but I don't think it's as bad as it could have been,'' said Red Sather, owner of the 50-room Chandler Inn, one of the town's most venerable motels.
But small concessionaires who normally supply the local stadiums are hurting, along with community groups like the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley, which has been desperately trying to raise money selling a competitive line of lockout T-shirts.
 
Finding Other Diversions
''We were hoping to watch the Brewers play the Padres this week,'' said 65-year-old Joyce Madigan of Green Bay, Wis., as she gazed out over the desolate green expanses of Compadre Stadium, which is surrounded by dairy farms, a 27-hole golf course and freshly plowed fields of alfalfa that seem to sweep all the way to the craggy blue mountains on the horizon.
She flew here from Wisconsin the other day with two women she knows from her other favorite sport, league bowling.
''But now,'' she said, ''I think we'll be driving out to Grand Canyon instead.''
''Or Las Vegas,'' said Fern Smith, 68, of Eau Claire, Wis., who, like Mrs. Madigan and 71-year-old Florence Boehringer of Milwaukee, bought nonrefundable airline tickets months ago.
''If you must know,'' Mrs. Smith added in a confidential tone, ''we're spending money like water.''
Mike Turney of Antigo, Wis., who had stopped by the Compadre souvenir shop with three equally husky friends to buy a few extra-large lockout T-shirts, said: ''It's a real disappointment. We'd planned the trip to watch baseball, but now I think we're just going to play a lot of golf.''
''And drink,'' one of his sunburned traveling companions added cheerfully.

HEADLINE: La Crosse Journal Honoring The Wire That Won The West

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA CROSSE, Kan.

 BODY:
A couple of decades ago, La Crosse started a museum devoted to barbed wire and declared itself the Barbed Wire Capital of the World.
Signs on the highway attest to the claim and so does a sign on the Old West-style false front of the Barbed Wire Museum, the only museum dedicated solely to ''devil's rope,'' as old-time cattlemen called the wire.
Nobody since then has contested the claim, and the town has become a mecca for collectors of old wire specimens. But some people became a bit edgy recently when a group of Texans announced plans for a barbed-wire museum of their own. 
And a scholar of wire lore up in De Kalb, Ill., reminded a banker here that his city had perhaps an older claim to a place in barbed-wire history than anyplace else.
''We already had our title,'' said Brad Penka, president of the La Crosse Chamber of Commerce. ''We want to retain that if we can.'' He said word of the Texans' proposal ''sort of accelerated'' planning for a new and bigger Barbed Wire Museum.
Already, said Gary Kay, president of the Nekoma State Bank, the bank has a pledge of $12,000 in matching funds awaiting the start of construction.
Those who might wonder at so much ado about barbed wire haven't been to La Crosse, population 1,600, stretched out along U.S. 183 halfway between Oklahoma and Nebraska.
As people like Ivan Krug, former president of the Kansas Barbed Wire Collectors Association, can tell you, it was barbed wire that tamed the West; never mind the rifle and the six-shooter.
The first barbed-wire fences, in the late 1860's, were used to keep animals out. Homesteaders used the wire to protect their crops and farm ponds from nearly wild longhorned cattle at a time when the range was open and cattlemen were kings.
Legends (and movies, in the 20th century) abound: sodbusters dying for their fences, others nearly scared to death when coffins were left on their steps as warnings.
But when the wire was new, hundreds of inventors saw the chance of riches and filed for patents based on varying twists and turns of the wire. Soon the cattlemen themselves started fencing in plains and manufacturers in De Kalb began mass production of barbed wire.
And today thousands of collectors from across the country meet at annual conventions in places like La Crosse to trade, buy and sell 18-inch specimens of the wire, at prices up to $400.
They match skills at wire games. They vie with each other at stapling the wires to fence posts and cutting and splicing the strands, a ritual of the conventions held here the first weekend of May.
The La Crosse museum displays 500 specimens of barbed wire, along with dozens of tools used in fencing -for instance, cutters and and wire-stretchers - and ointments and liniments for the wounds that the barbs can inflict on farm and ranch animals.
La Crosse may have the only museum devoted solely to barbed wire and fencing, but there are institutions across the country that include wire collections, as Delbert Trew, president of the Texas Barbed Wire Collectors Association, said the other day.
Mr. Trew and his group plan to install its collections in a building at McLean, in the Texas Panhandle, Mr. Trew said. They propose a catchy title, Devil's Rope Museum, but he said they never intended to cause any uneasiness here in La Crosse.
''We're not going to try to call ourselves the world capital of anything,'' he said, ''and we'll help the folks up in La Crosse any way we can.''
De Kalb was the home of Joseph Glidden, a prolific inventor and holder of a patent once validated by the United States Supreme Court, and Jacob Haish and Isaac L. Ellwood, early manufacturers of the wire.
''We sort of think of ourselves like that, though we don't put it in those terms,'' said Gerald Brauer, director of the Ellwood House Museum in De Kalb, referring to the La Crosse assertion. ''We think of this as the birthplace of barbed wire. We even call our high school teams the Barbs.'' He said the museum's collection began near the turn of the 20th century, before most people ever heard of wire collectors.
Never mind, said Rick Weigel, head of a museum building committee; La Crosse was first to claim the title. And after all, the town is near the geographic center of the plains the old wires tamed.

HEADLINE: He's Discreet, but Poised to Unseat Thatcher

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 18

 BODY:
He has never said publicly that he is running against her, but Michael Heseltine, who walked out of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet four years ago, looks set to make a comeback as Mrs. Thatcher falters in opinion polls.
Mr. Heseltine will turn 57 on Wednesday, a day before an important by-election for a parliamentary seat in mid-Staffordshire. It is a traditionally safe Tory seat in the rural English Midlands, but one that the Conservatives risk losing for the first time in a decade, largely because of voter dissatisfaction with Mrs. Thatcher and her economic policies.
''We live in a wholly unpredictable world,'' Mr. Heseltine likes to say. 
Mr. Heseltine, whose regal bearing and silver hair attract attention wherever he goes, has hardly exchanged two words with Mrs. Thatcher since he resigned as Defense Minister in January 1986. The two split over whether a British helicopter company should be sold to an American company, as she preferred, or to a European consortium, as he advised.
 
One of Heath's Disciples
Mr. Heseltine is often described as the last disciple of Edward Heath, the former Conservative Prime Minister. He is an enthusiastic supporter of full British participation in the move toward a single European market in 1992.
But unlike Mr. Heath, Mr. Heseltine has not let his differences with Mrs. Thatcher become bitter in public. His is in a waiting game, positioning himself as the only Conservative alternative in the unlikely event that the Prime Minister resigns before the next national elections. For months now, the Conservatives have been trailing in opinion polls by as many as 19 percentage points.
But Mrs. Thatcher is also in a waiting game - waiting for her anti-inflation economic policy, with its high interest rates, to bring down mortgage rates before she has to call the elections. Conservative voters would be less likely to vote against her then than they are in midterm by-elections like mid-Staffordshire's on Thursday.
The next national election does not have to be called until June 1992, unless so many Conservatives revolt before then that Mrs. Thatcher loses her 100-seat majority in Parliament.
 
A Little Too Polite
That is almost unthinkable, so Mr. Heseltine is working the circuit, with never an unkind word for Mrs. Thatcher. She responded in kind today in an interview with The Sunday Express, describing him as a ''very able'' speaker. Between the lines, though, there's a world of difference.
If Mrs. Thatcher is popularly seen as ''anti-Europe,'' resisting British participation in the European Monetary System because it would take away the sovereign right of Parliament to decide Britain's economic policies, Mr. Heseltine tries to look as European as he can.
If Mrs. Thatcher is all gumption and why-don't-you get-up-and-go on the domestic front, Mr. Heseltine is for more compassion.
Speaking to a group in London on Friday, Mr. Heseltine credited the Government's policies with creating a record number of homeowners, with bringing prosperity to the elderly and with generating higher spending on education and health than ever before. But then he took his jabs. ''For all the things of which we can be proud, there are areas of shame,'' he said, particularly for the growing British underclass of the homeless. ''I see a sense of Tory concern historically interwoven with the success of my party.'' His message was not lost on the British press, which leaps on the least hint of dissent within party ranks.
 
Tories Trail Badly
Mr. Heseltine is therefore eager to be seen campaigning for the Conservatives, who need the help. According to a poll by Market & Opinion Research International, published today in The Sunday Times, the Tories would get only 29 percent of the vote in Thursday's by-election in mid-Staffordshire, compared with 55 percent for the Labor Party. All it took was for Mr. Heseltine to say, as he did in a profile in The Sunday Telegraph a week ago, that he had not been asked.
Charles Prior, the Conservative candidate in mid-Staffordshire, said that after reading those remarks, he called his liaison with Parliament and had an invitation telephoned to Mr. Heseltine, who was campaigning in Kings Bromley two days later. ''He is, after the Prime Minister, the best known Conservative figure in the country,'' Mr. Prior said.
Mrs. Thatcher herself is not campaigning for Mr. Prior, who said it was not customary for a sitting Prime Minister to campaign in a by-election. Mr. Prior's Labor Party opponent is Sylvia Heal, a 48-year-old judge.
 
Getting the Word Out
This weekend, there was Mr. Heseltine on the Letters to the Editor page of The Times, still the place to be noticed for Conservative opinion-makers, with a subtle mix of support and criticism for the Government in the guise of what Britain could learn from Germany and Japan.
A little less of the Thatcherite hands-off-the-economy approach seemed to be his answer.
''The first lesson is proper management of the economy to provide price stability as the essential background for industry and commerce,'' he wrote. ''That is why I argue for an independent central bank and our early membership of the exchange-rate mechanism.''
''I don't see the circumstances in which I will challenge Mrs. Thatcher,'' Mr. Heseltine said in a recent interview with Bryan Appleyard of The Independent, who observed that this remark, like the speaker's public appearances in support of Government policies, was ''deliciously ambiguous.''

HEADLINE: The Japanese Are Working Themselves to Death

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a United States citizen living in Japan, I found Anna Quindlen's ''Men at Work'' column (Feb. 18), on American men working 12-hour days, particularly frightening. In Japan, this has been carried to tragically absurd lengths.
In Japanese corporate culture, presence is productivity, loyalty to the organization is measured by time at one's desk, and employees are reluctant to be seen leaving the office, whether they are ambitious or not. The behavior resulting from these attitudes is the cause of ''karoshi,'' or death from overwork. 
Karoshi is on the rise. The Japan Times, in a December editorial ''The Pace That Kills,'' reported that in 1989, more than 1,300 families sought advice on filing claims against companies, the wives and mothers contending that the death of their spouses was caused by overwork. These were only the reported cases, with the number of unreported cases likely to be at least as high.
An article headlined ''Death Rate Due to Overwork on the Increase for Employees'' gives details about several karoshi cases. Some karoshi victims were working 50 days straight and more than 100 hours of overtime every month. One man was commuting daily between Osaka and Tokyo, and was logging 135 hours of overtime a month. His wife claimed he was getting about five hours sleep a night. In another case, an investigation into the death of a man employed at a ball-bearing factory revealed that he and his co-workers were not allowed to take any days off because they had to keep the factory's machines running 24 hours a day. Again, these are just the reported cases. Many of my friends and acquaintances work 10- and 12-hour days every day with little or no vacation.
Numerous books in recent years have purported to explain the secrets of Japanese business success and exhorted Americans to emulate them. While there may be much about Japanese business culture worth imitating, death from overwork is not. Yet Ms. Quindlen's column suggests that the ideas at the root of karoshi have appeared in the American workplace. I hope my fellow countrymen will not carry these ideas to Japanese lengths.

HEADLINE: Hungary's New Sports World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 18

 BODY:
With a magnificent spring-like day as a backdrop Friday, many of Hungary's great fencers of the past honored one of their own, Aladar Gerevich, on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Between 1932 and 1960, he won seven Olympic gold medals in saber ''and probably would have won more,'' said one of the celebrators, Pal Schmitt, were it not for the cancellation of the Olympics in 1940 and 1944 because of World War II.
The festivities lasted an hour or so and seemed a temporary respite from the larger problems at hand in Hungary, where sports, like everything else, is undergoing rapid change.
Since last October, when the Communist Party began losing its grip, leading to next Sunday's elections, the first free vote in 40 years, the sports system has been totally reorganized. Power and responsibilities are vested in elected leaders of individual federations for each sport, much the way things are in the United States, rather in an individual serving as Minister of Sports. 
The federations develop their programs by working with athletes and coaches in sports clubs throughout the country. Hungary's national Olympic Committee remains in place to coordinate efforts of the federation in developing elite athletes. Who Will Pay? Despite the reorganization, however, critical aspects of sports in Hungary have not been addressed, leaving sportsmen of every stripe anxiously waiting to see how - or even if - the new government contends with them. Not surprisingly, their questions have to do with financial support.
''For the top sports in our country, there has always been enough money,'' said Schmitt, an Olympic gold medalist in 1968 and 1972, a member of the International Olympic Committee for seven years and the secretary general of the national Olympic Committee since last June.
Indeed, Hungary has ranked among the 10 leading nations in gold medals in all but one summer Olympics since 1928. Hungary was among the countries that boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles games.
''But I have seen what is beyond the shop windows,'' Schmitt added. ''It is important that the new government declare how we maintain sports as a social activity in our culture. With so little money, it has led to a neglect of sports in schools and sports for all, which has had a very very negative effect on the average health standards.''
In all of Europe, Hungary has among the highest levels of alcoholism, smoking, heart disease and suicide in addition to a life expectancy that is among the lowest.
The dichotomy of a small country's achieving success in the Olympics at the expense of sports for the masses is hardly limited to Hungary among nations once part of the Soviet bloc. A similar situation with much more dramatic differences existed in East Germany for years. Only since the demise of the East German Communist Government last fall have the interim leaders withdrawn some Government support of elite programs to satisfy citizens clamoring for better equipment and greater access to facilities.
 
Few Opportunities
In Hungary, a country of 10.5 million, a growing economic crisis, brought on by rising prices, taxes and unemployment has foreclosed the possibility of citizens' enjoying the sports of their choice. At the same time, Schmitt said, the Government has been unable to continue subsidizing physical education programs in schools and universities.
That not only contributes to the health problems, he said, but also undermines the Olympic effort, particularly for team sports like basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball and even soccer, a national passion. Hungary failed to qualify for the World Cup finals this summer for the first time in 20 years.
''This is just my opinion,'' the 47-year-old Schmitt said. ''Sports, as an activity, bears a close connection with the standard of living. If I have money, I can afford a lot of things. I can play tennis, go to the beach, go hang-gliding, wind surf, rent horses to ride. But we're in a country with much bigger problems than how to send kids to play sports. We have parents with more than one occupation, both working up to 12 hours a day, and their standards of living are very low.''
As one of the nation's senior sports officials, Schmitt worries that whichever party wins the elections its leaders will not necessarily grasp what he sees as the connection between sports programs for all citizens and higher health standards.

HEADLINE: New Bid for Protection By U.S. Textile Lobby

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Afraid that the Bush Administration will give away too much during international negotiations, the domestic textile industry is preparing another legislative push during this election year seeking import restrictions.
The drive by textile and apparel industry lobbyists and their friends in Congress is expected to be approved at a Capitol Hill strategy session on Wednesday. It raises the political stakes over comprehensive and far-reaching multilateral trade negotiations that have been going on for nearly four years.
The talks are known as the Uruguay Round, because they began in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay. Scheduled to end in December, the talks include negotiations over how to open up trade in services, cut piracy of intellectual property, reduce investment-related trade distortions and end subsidized trade in agriculture. 
One trade issue the industrialized countries must expect to negotiate and, in all likelihood, make concessions on, is textiles.
''We can't ask developing countries to make concessions in intellectual property rights and services and then keep our markets closed in textiles,'' said Stanley Fischer, chief economist at the World Bank. ''It would show that the industrialized world is just not serious about these trade issues.''
 
Curbs on Third-World Imports
For 25 years, under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States and other developed countries have taken special measures to curb imports of textiles and apparel from third-world countries.
To persuade developing countries to participate in the new round of talks, which are sponsored by the GATT, the countries were promised that the extensive network of bilateral textile quotas that are renegotiated every five years would be phased out by the end of the century.
For many third-world countries, where labor is in far greater supply than capital, garments are among the few products they have to sell.
In impoverished Bangladesh, for example, apparel products account for 40 percent of exports. ''We are strong in labor-intensive industries, but under the M.F.A. we cannot even use our competitive advantage,'' said Akbar Ali Khan, an economics specialist at the Bangladesh Embassy here.
Yet even with the arrangement, Bangladesh has not done badly. Over the last decade, its apparel exports have risen almost tenfold, to $450 million last year.
 
A Potential $8 Billion Boon
According to studies done by the World Bank, the phase-out of the arrangement could add $8 billion to the $43 billion in textile and clothing export sales third-world countries enjoy now.
For Uruguay Round negotiators, the critical issue is the transition period until the projected termination of the arrangement, in 10 years. Countries like Bangladesh want liberalization to begin now, with generous import growth rates built into any transitional quota system.
But the domestic textile and apparel industry, which employs two million Americans, has told the Administration that if it is to give up protection, it wants more, not fewer, restrictions now.
''There has to be a transition mechanism that would truly slow import growth to provide a more certain investment environment, so that our members can undertake investments needed to increase their competitiveness,'' said Carlos Moore, executive vice president of the American Textile Manufacturers Association, one of the principal lobbying groups.
The industry also wants to keep its tariff protection. Last lowered under the Tokyo Round in the 1970's, American tariffs are 20 percent on apparel, 15 percent on fabrics and 10 percent on yarn.
 
A Test for the Textile Industry
It is not the first time the industry has worked for more restrictive quotas. Congress passed restraint bills twice in the last five years, but after Presidential vetoes, in 1986 and 1988, could not muster the votes needed to override.
This election year may be no different. Still, the new legislative strategy could be a factor in what is likely to be a battle in Congress next year when the Administration asks Congress to approve any Uruguay Round package agreed upon in December.
George Bush's handy defeat of Bob Dole in the 1988 North Carolina primary has led some people to say the strength of the textile lobby may be overrated. Senator Dole, Republican of Kansas and the Senate minority leader, campaigned for textile quotas in a textile state and lost to a free trade advocate who became President.
Other domestic lobbying groups -for example, insurance companies and banks that would gain from liberalization of financial services and publishers and motion picture producers who would benefit from tougher copyright safeguards - are likely to push for exploration of their own political and economic trade-offs by the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and President Bush.
The textile industry says it wants quotas that would permit growth of imports by no more than 1 percent a year. But many economists believe that this level would barely meet demand for clothing in the United States and would guarantee high consumer prices.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Sharedata Slipped As Its Stock Rose

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AS 1989 ended and the new year began, Sharedata Inc. was struggling to survive after the loss of the only profitable products it ever had, computer game versions of the popular television shows ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Jeopardy.'' Insiders were funneling in cash, and the company was paying interest rates of up to 30 percent to keep the doors open.
But that was not the view stock market investors seemed to have of Sharedata. Buoyed by a report from a small brokerage house that ignored the company's problems and forecast a surge in profits even as the company was predicting large losses, the share price leaped. 
From a low bid of 75 cents a share in October, the price rose to $7.625 in January, just before insiders got a long-delayed clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell large parts of their holdings to the public.
Since then, the share price has settled back to $3.25, and the company faces new liquidity pressures. Some executives, on whom the company had said it was relying for a turnaround, have left, and it is far from clear whether Sharedata can come up with products to keep it operating.
The case of Sharedata provides evidence of both the strength and weakness of the current system of Federal securities regulation. The S.E.C. appears to have forced very detailed disclosure of the company's problems and to have stepped up the pressure for the company to acknowledge the risks as the stock price rose.
But these disclosures can only be found in the documents filed with the commission. Salespeople pushing stocks may have never read them, let alone told customers about them. ''Our inquiries lead us to conclude that the Sharedata Corporation is on the verge of a marked improvement in revenues and earnings from the computer software market,'' said a report dated Nov. 27 from the Princeton Financial Group, a small New Jersey broker-dealer.
That report did not even get Sharedata Inc.'s name right. And although it was published months after Sharedata filings with the S.E.C. reported that the company lost the licenses, effective Sept. 2, for the television game shows that had provided more than half of its revenues, the report listed those products as still being sold by the company.
In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Sharedata lost $519,284, or 12 cents a share, just about what the company was forecasting in late November.
Sharedata now is involved in a bitter fight with the company that licensed the games to it. That company, IJE Inc., obtained an injunction on Friday barring Sharedata from selling computer games that had been returned to it by retailers after they failed to sell in 1989. Michael S. Williams, Sharedata's president, said Friday that those returns had been greater than expected, but he said he did not know how much effect the increase in returns would have on results in the current quarter. IJE is also seeking large damages over several issues.
Last week appeared to be a crucial one for Sharedata, with $250,000 in short-term loans coming due, including one for $24,000 with a sky-high interest rate of 30 percent. Mr. Williams declined to say if any had been paid, but professed nonchalance. ''I'll call and get an extension,'' he said of one loan.
In its filings, Sharedata emphasized that its main hope for getting enough cash to stay in business was the exercise of 2.3 million warrants, each allowing the holder to buy a share for $1.25. The warrants are owned by Sheldon L. Miller, the company's chairman, who got legal clearance to exercise them and sell the shares in late January, at the same time other insiders got permission to sell shares. Mr. Miller could not be reached to comment, but Mr. Williams said none of the warrants had been exercised.
Sharedata's hope for a return to profitability rests on some office software that it has yet to market successfully, and on its newest product, introduced last week. That is a game that can be played on Nintendo machines. Mr. Williams said the company did not have Nintendo's permission to sell such games but believed it had found a way around that company's patent protections. He said Nintendo had not been formally advised of that opinion and so far had not commented on it.
One warning the S.E.C. forced Sharedata to add to its filings was that ''the existence and exercise of the warrants may have the effect of depressing the market price'' of the company's shares. Whether that was the cause or not, the share price peaked a couple of weeks before the insiders got permission to sell, but hung near that level until they were allowed to do so. It then fell sharply over the next two weeks.
How does Princeton Financial, which issued the bullish report that ignored the company's own cautions, feel about what has happened? When Anthony Pontieri, Princeton's president, was reached on Friday, he said he would not discuss the stock.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column on Monday about Sharedata Inc. misstated the month during which the company estimated a loss for the quarter that ended Dec. 31. The company made the estimate, of a loss of $500,000, in January 1990, not November 1989.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The 4A's Get A Call From Congress

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALM DESERT, Calif., March 18

 BODY:
The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee called on the advertising industry on Saturday to help sell his deficit-reduction package to the nation's business community.
In a speech at the annual convention of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Congressional committee responsible for drafting tax legislation, told more than 600 people, most of them advertising and communications company executives: ''You need a healthy economy so that people will have the money to buy the goods that you so successfully market. I need people with selling skills who can convince the American people that they'll have to make some short-term sacrifices so we can solve our shared problems.''
In a subsequent interview, Mr. Rostenkowski explained that he wanted advertising executives to ''sit down with their clients and let them know what the problem is, so that we can help solve the deficit.'' 
''You're the people who put the spin on things,'' he said. ''Join the army. Help me out.'' The object of his concern was a plan he recently put forward that he said would reduce the Federal budget deficit by $511.6 billion over the next five years. The program calls for one-year freezes in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and other Government spending, cuts in the nation's military budget and increased taxes on personal income and gasoline.
Mr. Rostenkowski's address to the advertising trade association, whose 72d annual meeting ended Saturday, was the latest in a national tour he has been conducting to drum up support for his proposal among different interest groups.
While he avoided any direct criticism of American business in his address, Mr. Rostenkowski chided the advertising industry for influencing the nation's acceptance of budget deficits. He said, ''Our Government has embraced the very idea that your industry has sold so successfully to the American people: buy now, pay later.''
But Mr. Rostenkowski sought to allay the industry's continuing fear that advertising will become a target for legislators hungry to raise revenues, opening his talk by affirming that his committee has ''no such plans at this time.''
For at least two years, ever since Florida passed, and subsequently rescinded, a measure to tax advertising distributed in the state, the ad industry has been fearful of further state or Federal efforts to tax advertising expenditures or restrict their tax deductibility.
Still, Mr. Rostenkowski, who was instrumental in shaping the compromise between the Reagan White House and his own party that allowed passage of the 1986 income tax overhaul, refused to rule out the possibility and in a subsequent interview he acknowledged, ''It's hard for me to say yes or no'' to a Federal tax on advertising expenditures.
But he added that, to his knowledge, only one member of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Richard T. Schulze, Republican of Pennsylvania, had discussed taxation of advertising. He said the committee had not even studied the amount of revenue that could be raised through such a program.
Because it is a magnified reflection of the broad world of business, Madison Avenue has long been stereotyped as a Republican stronghold. Indeed, several executives in attendance here worked on the campaign advertising teams for Presidents Ford and Reagan. Nevertheless, Mr. Rostenkowski's message was well received by the executives, particularly his expressed willingness to link tax increases for specific purposes, like deficit reduction.
''People in that room are not interested in socialism,'' said Curtis R. Troeger, chief executive of Doremus & Company, a New York ad agency. ''If they knew where the tax money would go, it would make it easier to accept.''
Still, most of the ad executives said they would continue to oppose a tax on advertising, even if it were part of a broad plan to share the burden of deficit reduction among various constituencies.
''An income tax rise, a value-added tax, O.K.,'' said William H. Monoghan, the chief executive of Cabot Communications in Boston. ''But I think it's a mistake to tax advertising, because it's a mistake to tax anything that would diminish the creation of sales.''

HEADLINE: BIGGER BUDGET GAP IS SEEN BY DINKINS AS TAX MONEY LAGS

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that New York City faces an additional budget gap of at least $700 million for the fiscal year that starts on July 1. He ordered city agencies to prepare $500 million more in cuts that would severely trim services, and said more new taxes would be needed.
The new estimate is on top of the $1.1 billion gap that the city expected when Mr. Dinkins announced his $27.8 billion preliminary budget on Feb. 1. By law the city must have a balanced budget, so it must take actions each year to close the expected gap - the difference between its planned expenditures and its anticipated revenues. 
The new gap comes with budget prospects worsening for the state, from which the city is hoping to get some relief. Yesterday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, under severe pressure to close an estimated $1.5 billion budget gap, reversed a long-held position and proposed increasing the state's gasoline tax for the first time in 18 years. [Page B1.] 'Serious' Problems He did not suggest how high to raise the tax but said that just the fact that he was proposing an increase ''should give you some idea of how serious'' the budget problems are. Mr. Cuomo, who has frequently denounced supporters of a gas tax, estimated that a 5 cent-a-gallon increase would raise state revenues by about $200 million a year.
Mr. Dinkins said the city's new budget gap estimate was caused mostly by a $335 million projected shortfall in tax receipts and by the city's decision that it could no longer count on receiving $303 million from the sale of the old Coliseum site in time to help in the coming fiscal year. He said the Coliseum money would not be included in the budget to be issued about May 1.
 
Uncertain Revenue Source
The decision about the Coliseum seemed intended both to pressure community groups on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to settle a lawsuit that has held up the deal and to satisfy fiscal monitoring agencies that had criticized the city for including such an uncertain revenue source in the budget, a decision by the Koch administration.
At the same time, with the state's deadline for adopting its own precarious budget just weeks away, the Mayor's latest gloomy news put pressure on legislators in Albany to give the city as much aid as possible.
Mr. Dinkins, who met with his budget advisers at Gracie Mansion Sunday night, said he did not yet know just what the new cuts would be, but he said that they could range from closing firehouses to deferring hiring of police officers. The cuts already proposed call for everything from fewer sanitation and parks workers to reductions in library and cultural programs.
In response to a series of questions yesterday about whether certain items might have to be cut, Mr. Dinkins repeated, ''We may, we may, we don't know yet.''
 
'Dreams Deferred'
''It certainly is the worst of the bad news,'' the Mayor said at a news conference at City Hall. ''But it is clear that we have little option, if any. We have no option.'' Later, he added, ''Hopefully what we're talking about is dreams deferred, not dreams denied.''
The Mayor said the rest of the new $700 million gap was caused by new and revised economic projections that forecast additional tax shortfalls of $335 million, as well as an additional $70 million increase in mandated expenses. Together with hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts and other actions already announced in recent weeks, that means the city will have had to close a total gap of about $1.8 billion for the coming fiscal year.
Besides the new service cuts, Mr. Dinkins said the city would seek to close the expanded gap with $200 million more in bond refinancings and tax increases on top of the $550 million package of state and city taxes it has already proposed. He said he could not yet say what additional tax increases he would seek.
Mr. Dinkins's comments came less than a week after the State Financial Control Board said the city's budget would probably not be balanced without even deeper cuts than the Dinkins administration had proposed.
The cuts that have taken effect so far have mostly involved deferrals in hiring city workers and reductions through attrition.
 
'False Expectations'
In a letter to all agency heads yesterday asking for their recommendations for more cuts, Mr. Dinkins said he would prefer eliminating some programs entirely, rather than reducing them ''to a point where they exist in name only, something that would limit my decision-making options and present a set of false expectations'' about services.
Mr. Dinkins said the city still expected the Coliseum sale to go through eventually but could not count on it happening in time to help with next year's budget, as he had planned just six weeks ago. The sale of the site at Columbus Circle to Boston Properties, which intends to build a new skyscraper there, has been held up by litigation from community groups.
Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife said negotiations to settle the lawsuit had been unsuccessful but were continuing. She said that even if the suit were ended, there were some technical ''legal and financial issues left unresolved'' about the sale and that it would take ''a substantial amount of months'' to close the deal.
Faced with the prospect of severe service cuts, opponents of the deal, including some of Mr. Dinkins's political backers like State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, will undoubtedly come under greater pressure to reach a settlement.
Mr. Dinkins - who as Manhattan Borough President had opposed including the Coliseum money in the budget but said that since it was there, the city should go forward - said he had talked with the litigants ''repeatedly.''
 
'Sort of Stuck With It'
Of having the money in the budget, he said, ''We were sort of stuck with it.'' But he declined to criticize the Koch administration too harshly. ''Frankly, I think we need to dwell on resolution of the problem as opposed to fixing blame.''
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said new projections on the $335 million revenue shortfall showed that about $150 million of that would come in falloffs in corporate and commercial rent taxes, $95 million in personal income taxes and $35 million in other business or income taxes, as well as a $55 million slowdown in anticipated real-estate taxes.
Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for the City Council, which must approve the final budget this summer and which has the sole power to raise real-estate taxes, said it was too soon to comment on Mr. Dinkins's announcement. ''When they show us specifically what they're going to do, then we'll have something specific to say,'' she said.

HEADLINE: AT HOME ABROAD;
Wind Of Change

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
A premise of political life in all the black countries of southern Africa has suddenly been thrown into question. It is the rooted belief that South Africa menaces the life of the country.
There has been every reason for that feeling. Over the last dozen years South Africa has raided, bombed or invaded all of its black-ruled neighbors. By supporting guerrilla wars it has destabilized governments and bled societies. 
All this has been seen as an aggressive effort to maintain the power of South Africa's white minority. But now President de Klerk has unbanned the anti-apartheid political movements and released Nelson Mandela from prison. Next month in Cape Town he will meet an African National Congress delegation.
The system of white supremacy has by no means been abandoned as yet. But a process of change has begun in South Africa, and her neighbors have to know it. Already the Government has stopped its aid to guerrillas and promised that there will be no more cross-border raids. It has given up its colonial grip on Namibia, which becomes independent tomorrow.
If the menace is really fading, if there is a chance for a democratic government in Pretoria, the effect on the politics, the economics and the psychology of the region would be profound. It would be as fundamental as the dwindling of the Soviet threat is for Europeans and Americans. And as dislocating.
An ironic recent example: Zimbabwe officials have joined the A.N.C. in calling on the South African Government to end its state of emergency. But then people pointed out that Zimbabwe, too, has a state of emergency. It was renewed most recently just two months ago.
The menace of South Africa has been a justification for repressive measures in the black-ruled countries of the region. Change in South Africa might well produce pressure for liberalization elsewhere.
Something similar may be true of one-party systems. In Zambia, for instance, President Kenneth Kaunda has governed for 25 years. The country is an economic ruin. Yet last week Mr. Kaunda rejected the idea of allowing other parties than his to exist.
If South Africa moves to an open political system, there surely would be reverberations. The changes in Eastern Europe have already had their effect. Joe Slovo, General Secretary of the South African Communist Party and a member of the A.N.C. executive, has called for ''a multi-party post-apartheid democracy.''
Zimbabwe is a prosperous country and a pleasant one, the internal tensions of the past greatly eased. But opposing President Robert Mugabe is not easy.
When a newspaper exposed official corruption and a minister was convicted, President Mugabe pardoned him - and the editor was ''promoted'' out of his job. In primary elections held recently a number of prominent figures in the governing party were defeated, but the party committee voided some of those results.
In the past Mr. Mugabe has spoken of making Zimbabwe a one-party state. His intentions now are uncertain. But many Zimbabweans are against that idea, and democracy in South Africa could stiffen their resistance.
Change in South Africa would of course have great economic significance for the region. Zambia and Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique all trade with South Africa now because they must, although they subscribe in theory to sanctions. The end of apartheid would encourage booming trade with the area's economic powerhouse, and have an enormous potential for growth.
The economic role of a post-apartheid South Africa might well have uncomfortable aspects, too. Local businesses may fear the competition. If South Africa avoided the folly of centralized economic controls, others could find it harder to maintain existing rigidities: the elaborate price ceilings that stifle growth in Zimbabwe, for example.
Thirty years ago Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, visiting Cape Town, said ''the wind of change'' was blowing through Africa. With Namibian independence, colonial and minority control will have ended everywhere save South Africa. If political change comes there, a fresh wind may well blow back up the continent.
The transition to a South Africa that has a respected place in the region will hardly be an easy one. But the possibilities can be glimpsed already. Many countries will have large stakes in the talks that begin in Cape Town on April 11.

HEADLINE: A Good Deal on Prison Cells

 BODY:
With prison crowding in New York State at a critical point, Gov. Mario Cuomo and his Corrections Commissioner, Thomas Coughlin, offer an excellent deal: 3,000 prison cells for the price of 1,700, in half the time. Why do state legislators hesitate?
Last year, as part of a larger crime law package, the Legislature approved $160 million in bonding authority to build two 750-cell prisons and a 200-bed drug and alcoholism treatment center, pending approval for actual construction. But as projections for this year's prison population surged to alarming levels, Mr. Coughlin came up with a better idea. He proposes using the $160 million to expand five existing prisons by 600 cells each. 
Those 3,000 new cells could be constructed for the same money because there would be no need for new mess halls and other central facilities. Furthermore, it would take only six months to complete the 600-cell expansions, while building the new full prisons would take about a year.
There is urgent need for that kind of flexibility. Facing the most severe budget crisis in years, Albany isn't likely to come up with much new money for prisons this year. Yet prisons now are at 120 percent of capacity, and tougher sentences, combined with more aggressive police pursuit of drug dealers, promise no relief. Mr. Coughlin has already been forced to the potentially explosive practice of double-bunking inmates. Unless the 3,000-cell plan is approved soon, he asserts, the double-bunking might continue well into next year.
Why hasn't the Legislature rushed to embrace the substitute plan? At first, Assembly leaders argued that probation, drug treatment and other programs to ease the load on prisons ought to be considered along with more cells. Such services are essential to an overall corrections policy. But Assembly leaders now appear to recognize the urgency created by the budget crisis and the double-bunking problem, and seem prepared to accept the 3,000-cell plan.
The State Senate seems more reluctant, perhaps for political reasons. Two new 750-bed prisons are attractive plums to dangle before economically depressed upstate communities that vote for Republican senators.
Such preoccupation with politics is shortsighted. Viable criminal justice rests on a solid correctional system; putting it at risk, whatever the reason, is irresponsible.

HEADLINE: Mr. Kohl's Divisive Appeal for Unity

 BODY:
Voting in their first free election since 1932, East Germans commendably turned out en masse to register their desire for a quick, sharp break with their Communist past. They threw their support behind right-of-center parties backed by West Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who held out hope that rapid unification soon would bring economic prosperity.
But Mr. Kohl's highly partisan handling of the unification issue may come back to haunt him, Germany and Europe - unless he and other German leaders demonstrate appropriate sensitivity to European concerns, particularly about the inviolability of borders. 
Mr. Kohl and his Christian Democratic allies in East Germany took some hard shots at their main rival, the Social Democrat Party. The Social Democrats had been expected by many to be the leading party in East Germany before the campaign got under way. But the East German conservative alliance succeeded in exploiting the general revulsion against Communism. They painted the Social Democrats as ''Reds'' who harbored reservations about free markets and rapid unity.
These attacks will not be helpful when it comes to gaining Social Democratic support for the tough decisions that lie ahead on unification. Yesterday, leaders of the Social Democrats showed their displeasure by rejecting the conservative alliance's invitation to join a broad-based coalition government.
As matters stand, then, the conservative coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats will be able to muster a parliamentary majority. But it will not have the two-thirds vote needed to amend the East German Constitution on critical questions.
An equally troubling concern is Mr. Kohl's management of the German border issue during the campaign. For weeks he refused to reaffirm existing boundaries between Germany and its neighbors. Then, under intense pressure from all over Europe and the United States, he relented to a degree.
It would be unfortunate if Mr. Kohl's nationalistic dance on the border question helped his conservative allies in East Germany win many votes. And it would be worse still if German leaders, East and West, now believed they had a mandate to proceed toward unification without being attentive and responsive to the rest of Europe.
Of course, Europeans and Americans rejoice with the German people in their first free election in almost 60 years. Of course, maybe everyone except the Soviets likes the idea of an all-German government prepared to remain a member of NATO in some form. But all this good will could quickly sour if Germans do not complete their march toward unification in harmony with their worried friends and neighbors.

HEADLINE: White House Resisting Further Pentagon Cuts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The White House said today that it was not willing to accept major cuts in its proposal for the military budget in the fiscal year 1991 and that it believes it has already offered Congress adequate reductions.
The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush Administration, under widespread pressure from Congress and elsewhere, had decided to accept cuts almost as large as those that lawmakers are urging in the 1991 Pentagon budget. The article was based on interviews with senior Administration officials.
In January, the Administration proposed a budget of about $303 billion for 1991, a cut of about $3.2 billion from what military programs would cost after accounting for inflation. The article said the Administration had decided to accept a much bigger cut, around $10 billion or $11 billion.
Asked about the article today, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ''Every number is negotiable.''
But he added: ''Our position is that we have proposed a budget that calls for something like $3.9 billion in cuts. We intend to stick with that proposal. That is our proposal. There is not a $10 billion or $12 billion cut number that we are prepared to accept.''
Still, Mr. Fitzwater said that the Pentagon had been conducting ''some very active and aggressive reviews of our defense needs'' and that in the future, if the Soviet threat continues to diminish, ''there certainly will be significant reductions in the Defense Department.''

Without Apology, a Defender of Deng Tells Why

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 19

 BODY:
He is ostracized by intellectuals and hailed by the leadership. He is the author of newspaper columns and recipient of death threats. The writer in question is He Xin, a social commentator and one of the best-known intellectual supporters of the present Government.
At a time when most Chinese intellectuals are still quietly seething at the Government, Mr. He goes out of his way to endorse it. For those in the West who believe that China's octogenarian leadership will inevitably be replaced by supporters of rapid liberalization, Mr. He is a rude surprise. He is a well-read, intelligent 40-year-old who sounds like Deng Xiaoping. 
''Americans care tremendously about personal freedom,'' Mr. He said in a recent interview, between puffs of a cigarette. ''But China is a country of 1.1 billion people, geographically immense but lacking in cultivatable land. If we didn't have a strong government, if we had American-style personal freedom, then China would fall into terrible chaos.''
 
A Red Guard in His Youth
A husky man with close-cropped hair just beginning to gray, Mr. He's was a lonely voice until the rise of the hard-liners last year. He does not have a university degree, for he came of age as a Red Guard when the universities were closed during the Cultural Revolution, but he has written more than a dozen books on a variety of subjects.
In his books and essays, he inveighs against rapid economic liberalization, against modern trends in literature and against the trend among intellectuals to blame China's traditional culture for the country's problems.
''Zhao Ziyang was very displeased when he saw this,'' Mr. He declared happily, waving a long essay that after much internal wrangling appeared in People's Daily a year ago. But it was the student democracy movement, which ultimately led to the dismissal of Mr. Zhao from his post as party leader, that most clearly distinguished Mr. He from other intellectuals.
The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs recently published a copy of a confidential memorandum by Mr. He to the leadership, written on April 28, a day after one of the momentous demonstrations of the student movement. It was a remarkable call for the Government to accept the democracy movement as a serious threat.
 
Fears Decades of Disorder
''Civil war, military coups and popular uprisings in China for decades to come are now far from unthinkable,'' his memo said.
Yet the memo also warned against taking too repressive a line, for that might antagonize the population and create dissident heroes. Instead, Mr. He suggested that the leaders deal with allegations of corruption and take other steps to restore public confidence. Above all, he argued, the Government should avoid violence.
''History has taught us that in the long run those who die as a result of political repression invariably become heroes and martyrs,'' he wrote.
His arguments were not heeded, but Mr. He today does not question the eventual use of force. He says that the situation deteriorated after he wrote the memo, and that he understands the leadership's decision to use force.
 
Bloodshed Was 'a Great Pity'
''It is a great pity that there was bloodshed,'' Mr. He said. ''But the situation was getting worse and if force wasn't used it could have gotten out of hand and the consequences would have been unimaginable.''
Word of Mr. He's secret advice to the leadership spread among intellectuals, and deepened his reputation as a traitor. For while he urged restraint, he clearly came down against the democracy movement and his memo even named a few intellectuals as instigators of the unrest.
After a July television appearance in which he expressed strong support for the Government, and a few like-minded newspaper essays, Mr. He received a flood of 4,000 letters from around the nation. He says the letters alternately hailed and condemned him.
The role that Mr. He plays has no direct counterpart in the West, for nominally he is only a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. But scholars are widely respected in Chinese civilization, and they can help buttress or undermine the legitimacy of a government.
 
The Confident Communist
After the crackdown, when most intellectuals were silently disapproving, it was very important for the Government to have younger people, and especially scholars, to grant a seal of approval to the repression.
The essence of Mr. He's argument is that while democracy is a worthy goal, it takes decades or centuries to develop the educational and cultural base that can nourish a democracy.
''We all want a free environment in the end,'' Mr. He says. ''But if we tried to achieve this overnight, we would only get turmoil and disaster.''
He says he is confident that Communism will endure in China and that there will be no further popular upheavals like the one last year.
 
Says He's Faced Death Before
An economist said Mr. He attracts attention because ''it's just very hard for the leadership to find anyone his age who agrees with them.''
Mr. He acknowledges that he has received several death threats, but he says he faced death before - in the Cultural Revolution - and is not worried. While Mr. He enthusiastically joined in the Cultural Revolution, in 1970 he was accused of being a counterrevolutionary and was beaten and ''struggled against.'' His wrists still bear the scars of handcuffs, tightened as a form of torture.
Nonetheless, the experience apparently generated more a horror of chaos than of repression. Today, many intellectual antagonists of Mr. He are behind bars, accused of being ''counterrevolutionaries,'' and he is untroubled. If they merely expressed erroneous views, they would not be jailed, he suggested, while if they were behind-the-scenes organizers of the democracy movement, then it is only right that they be punished.
''They would have led our country into an abyss of misery,'' he said of those now in disgrace. ''If the student movement wasn't controlled, China could have entered several decades of turmoil.''

HEADLINE: 'Model Minority' Label Taxes Asian Youths

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Zhe Zeng, an 18-year-old junior at Seward Park High School in lower Manhattan, translates the term ''model minority'' to mean that Asian-Americans are terrific in math and science. Mr. Zeng is terrific in math and science, but he insists that his life is no model for anyone.
''My parents give a lot of pressure on me,'' said Mr. Zeng, who recently came to New York from Canton with his parents and older brother. He has found it hard to learn English and make friends at the large, fast-paced school. And since he is the only family member who speaks English, he is responsible for paying bills and handling the family's interactions with the English-speaking world.
''They work hard for me,'' he said, ''so I have to work hard for them.'' 
As New York's Asian population swells, and with many of the new immigrants coming from poorer, less-educated families, more and more Asian students are stumbling under the burden of earlier emigres' success - the myth of the model minority, the docile whiz kid with one foot already in the Ivy League. Even as they face the cultural dislocations shared by all immigrants, they must struggle with the inflated expectations of teachers and parents and resentment from some non-Asian classmates.
Some students, like Mr. Zeng, do seem to fit the academic stereotype. Many others are simply average students with average problems. But, in the view of educators and a recent Board of Education report, all are more or less victims of the myth.
''We have a significant population of Chinese kids who are not doing well,'' said Archer W. Dong, principal of Dr. Sun Yat Sen Junior High School near Chinatown, which is 83 percent Chinese. ''But I still deal with educators who tell me how great the Asian kids are. It puts an extra burden on the kid who just wants to be a normal kid.''
Perhaps the starkest evidence of the pressures these students face is the dropout rate among Asian-American students, which has risen to 15.2 percent, from 12.6 percent, in just one year, though it remains well below the 30 percent rate for the entire school system. In all, there are about 68,000 Asians in the city's schools, a little more than 7 percent of the student population.
Behind these figures, the Board of Education panel said, lies a contrary mechanism of assumed success and frequent failure. While teachers expect talent in math and science, they often overlook quiet Asian-American students who are in trouble academically.
The report also said that Asian students frequently face hostility from non-Asians who resent their perceived success. And though New York's Asian population is overwhelmingly Chinese, this resentment is fed by a feeling in society that the Japanese are usurping America's position as a world economic power. Some educators said that because they are often smaller and quieter, Asian students seem to be easy targets for harassment.
Teresa Ying Hsu, executive director of an advocacy group called Asian-American Communications and a member of the board panel, described what she called a typical exchange at a New York City school. One student might say, ''You think you're so smart,'' she said, then ''someone would hit a kid from behind and they would turn around and everyone would laugh.''
Since Asian cultures dictate stoicism, she explained, students in many cases do not openly fight back against harassment or complain about academic pressures. But though they tend to keep their pain hidden, she said, it often is expressed in ailments like headaches or stomach troubles.
 
'Acutely Sensitive'
''We have a group of youngsters who are immigrants who are acutely sensitive to things other students take in stride, like a door slamming in their face,'' said John Rodgers, principal of Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan.
Norman Thomas, whose student body is about 3 percent Asian, had two recent incidents in which Chinese students were attacked by non-Asian students. The attackers were suspended.
But tensions escalated after a group of 30 Chinese parents demanded that the principal, John Rodgers, increase security, and rumors spread that ''gangs of blacks'' were attacking Chinese. Both incidents, however, were one-on-one conflicts and neither attacker was black. In some cases, Mr. Rodgers said, Chinese students say they are attacked by blacks but that they cannot identify their attackers because all blacks look alike to them.
In response to the parents' concerns, Mr. Rodgers said, he increased security and brought in a speaker on cross-cultural conflict.
Traditionally, Asian parents have not been that outspoken, educators say. While they often place enormous pressures on their children to do well, most Asian parents tend not to get involved with the schools.
Lisa Chang, a 17-year-old senior at Seward Park - which is 48 percent Asian - recalled being one of six Asians at a predominantly black intermediate school.
''Inside the school there was no big deal,'' she said. ''I was in special classes and everyone was smart. Then I remember one day being outside in the snow and this big black boy pushed me. He called me Chink.
''Then, at home, my parents didn't want me to dress a certain way, to listen to heavy metal music,'' Ms. Chang said. When she told her dermatologist that she liked rock and roll, the doctor accused her of ''acting like a Caucasian.''
Ms. Chang and other students say there are two routes some Asian students take: they form cliques with other Asians or they play down their culture and even their intelligence in hopes of fitting in.
 
Wedged Between Two Cultures
Most Asian students are acutely aware of being wedged between two cultures. They say their parents want them to compete sucessfully with Americans but not become too American - they frown on dating and hard-rock music. There is also peer pressure not to completely assimilate. A traitor is a ''banana'' - yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
There is anger, too, over the perception that they are nerdy bookworms and easy targets for bullies. .
''A lot of kids are average, they are not what the myth says,'' said Doris Liang, 17, a junior at Seward Park. ''In math, I'm only an average student and I have to work really hard.''
Ms. Liang said she sometimes envies the school's Hispanic students.
''The Hispanic kids, in a way they are more open,'' she said. ''They're not afraid to bring their dates home. If you're Chinese and you bring your date home they ask a lot of questions. My parents only went to junior high school in China, so when we got here they wanted us to do well in school.''
Nicole Tran, a 15-year-old senior who spent the early part of her life in Oregon, said she believes her generation will be far more assertive.
''We are the minority minority,'' said Ms. Tran. Of the white majority, she said, ''We are moving too fast for them.''
Dr. Jerry Chin-Li Huang, a Seward Park guidance counselor, said he believes that Asians in New York are in part experiencing the cultural transformations common to all immigrants.
He notes that more of the new Asian immigrants - whose numbers in New York have swelled 35 to 50 percent in the past five years to about 400,000 -are coming from smaller towns and poorer, less educated families.
It was the early waves of educated, middle-class Asian immigrants whose children became the model minority, Dr. Huang said. Many of the students he sees have problems.
For one thing, Dr. Huang said many Asian parents are reluctant to admit that their children need help, even in severe cases. He said he had a schizophrenic Chinese student who began constantly wearing a coat, even on the hottest summer days. The parents were of little help.
''I have other children who run away from home because of the pressures,'' said Dr. Huang. ''I had two sisters who had to go to school then work in the factories, sewing. Their parents could not speak English so they were helping them with the bills. The girls said they barely had time to sleep.''
Dr. Huang said many non-Asian teachers come to him for his insights because they have few Asian co-workers. Asian are 1.4 percent of all school counselors; 0.8 percent of all principals, and 1.4 percent of all teachers in New York City.
Among its recommendations, the task force called for more Asian counselors and teachers.
People like Ms. Hsu, of Asian-American Communications, are optimistic that the situation for Asian students will improve as students and educators talk openly about it.
''I gave a workshop and I talked about the quotas, the Chinese exclusion act,'' said Ms. Hsu. ''Two black girls came up to me. One said: 'You know, I always thought the Chinese kids were snooty. Now after hearing what you went through I feel you're my brothers and sisters.' ''

HEADLINE: Florio Urges Taxing Rich

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 19

 BODY:
Behind the cascade of numbers released last week with Gov. Jim Florio's new budget stands a startlingly clear statement of philosophy by New Jersey's new Governor: he plans to shift money from the rich to the poor.
Beyond Mr. Florio's short-term plans to balance the next budget by cutting deeply into state programs and raising more than $1 billion in new sales taxes, he is proposing to double the income tax on the state's most affluent residents in 1992. This he sees as a long-lasting answer to some of the state's most vexing and ideologically charged problems.
The higher income tax would raise an additional $1.25 billion. That new money would go to relieve high property taxes for homeowners who earn less than $65,000 a year. It would be used to aid poor school districts. And it would help lift the cost of welfare and social services from cities and counties, a burden now borne most heavily by poor cities like Camden and Newark. 
Mr. Florio's income tax plan has helped define how he wants to be perceived as Governor. The image, politicians say, is of a lean, tough liberal.
 
Growth or Fairness as State's Goal
''He has cut expenditures radically, in the most painful and visible way,'' said George Sternleib, a professor at Rutgers University. ''But after that he has set his priorities as a very liberal Governor. It has been so long in public life since we have had a public figure who espouses and acts on these doctrines that it comes as a shock.''
For two decades the debate over the state's dependence on property taxes for revenues has raised conflicts between rich and poor, suburbs and cities, taxpayers and schools. Most of all, it has brought heated argument over whether the state government's first goal should be to encourage economic growth or to make the state a fairer place to live.
Since the 1960's critics of the tax system have said New Jersey resembles a child who continues to wear clothing that is long outgrown; its system for towns and cities, which rely almost entirely on property taxes, is a holdover from the days when New Jersey was a bucolic place of small towns and county governments that provided simple and inexpensive services.
In 1985, according to a state commission, property taxes were 41 percent of all state and local New Jersey taxes. In the the fiscal year that ended June 1988, the state raised $9.13 billion in taxes, and local governments raised $7.75 billion in property taxes.
Though the State Legislature enacted a modest income tax in 1976 -it now rises to a top tax bracket of 3.5 percent on income over $50,000 - critics continued to complain that the state's reliance on property taxes was generating a series of problems.
For one, in New Jersey as in other states, school districts raised money thorugh property taxes, meaning that children in poor districts, where schools received less financing, were deprived of the education available to children in richer districts.
 
Suit Challenges School System
A lawsuit against the state Department of Education, which is expected to be decided soon by the State Supreme Court, challenges the current school financing system as unconstitutional.
Second, urban leaders complained that the property tax system caught them in a fiscal trap: Social problems like crime meant higher taxes for more police, encouraging businesses and affluent residents to leave for lower taxes of the suburbs, which, in turn, caused city taxes to go higher.
Moreover, with many services paid for by property taxes, including the courts and welfare, property owners in almost all areas of the state saw their tax bills jump in recent years.
In July 1988, a commission reported to Gov. Thomas H. Kean on proposals to change the tax system. Among the many recommendations was raising the income tax for households with incomes of more than $50,000 from 3.5 to 4.0 percent, and raising the tax rates for incomes of more than $100,000 from 3.5 to 4.5 percent.
 
Symbol of Big Government
But to most Republicans an income tax increase remained a powerful symbol of big government and the state's attitude towards business.
''That would have been killing the goose that laid the golden egg,'' Governor Kean said later, after rejecting the commission's findings.
The budget package Mr. Florio announced last week really came in two steps. The first step would raise $1.4 billion in sales taxes, taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and petroleum products in fiscal 1991, which begins this July 1, to balance the state's strained budget.
The income tax increase, to take effect January 1, 1992, would, in effect, adopt the philosphy of the commission report that Mr. Kean rejected. But Mr. Florio went further, raising $1.2 billion in taxes on those with incomes over $55,000, with households earning more than $100,000 paying a 7 percent tax. Seventeen states have higher income tax brackets than 7 percent.
In fact, aides to the Governor said, the 202,000 housholds that earn more than $100,000 would pay 75 percent of the income tax increase, or an average of about $4,500 more for each of those households.
The $1.25 billion raised by the income-tax increase would be used for property tax relief of up to $500 to those with incomes of less than $65,000, relieve county and municipal goverments of some welfare and social service costs, and fund a new school aid formula for adequate financing of education for students in poorer districts.
The Administration ensured that much of that money would go to to the poor, the elderly, and those living in cities and urban counties. For example, the decision to relieve local and county governments of welfare would ensure far more relief for poor urban areas. The administration decided not to take over the costs of running the courts, a Kean Administration proposal, which would have lifted a burden that is more alike for rich and poor counties.
''It was a courageous move on the part of the Governor,'' said Richard Roper, the director of the Program for New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School, who has long supported property tax revision.
Critics of the commission report in 1988 are already beginning to take aim at what they describe as a threat to business.
''It just takes my breath away,'' said Assemblyman Charles Hardwick of Union County, who bitterly opposed the commission report when he was the Republican Speaker of the Assembly. ''I see people leaving New Jersey because it will become a high-tax state.''
Florio Administration officials say, however, that they carefully considered the impact of the proposed increases on the economic climate of the state. One decision they made was not to raise corporate taxes, they said.
State Treasurer Douglas C. Berman, who oversaw the drafting of the Florio budget, said the Republicans cannot demonstrate that an increase in personal income taxes leads business executives to take their corporations out of the state. Mr. Berman described such logic as ''an argument for rich Republicans to avoid paying their fair share.''

HEADLINE: A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The theft at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston on Sunday is the largest and latest in what art experts and law enforcement authorities are calling an epidemic of art thefts. Spurred by soaring art prices and the increasing resourcefulness of thieves, art theft now ranks as one of the most lucrative forms of crime, they say.
Museum officials and insurers say the dramatic increase in thefts has not only heightened concern about security at museums and galleries but has also caused a spectacular rise in art-insurance costs. This rise has increased the financial burden on museums that mount major exhibitions of art on loan.
Last year, the International Foundation for Art Research, a New York organization that compiles information about stolen art, received reports of about 5,000 thefts. That was only a small fraction of the total, according to the foundation's director, Dr. Constance Lowenthal. 
Although sketchy reporting and record-keeping means there are no reliable statistics, Dr. Lowenthal estimated that art theft is now a $1 billion- to $2 billion-a-year business.
''Law-enforcement officials in much of the world see art theft as a low priority,'' she said. ''Furthermore, many smaller museums don't report thefts because they don't know a work has been stolen or have adequate information to prove that a theft has occurred.''
 
'Much More at Risk'
 The growing economic toll of art theft is partly a consequence of today's overheated art market.
''With the increase in art values, insurance premiums have gone up because there's much more at risk,'' said Harold Smith, a New York insurance adjuster who specializes in fine art. ''Add to this the fact that there's more art theft and damage. And the biggest danger to the art world is that thieves are getting much better at disposing of stolen art.''
What does become of priceless art like Vermeer's ''Concert'' or the three Rembrandts and five works by Degas, all of which were among the 12 artworks stolen on Sunday from the Gardner Museum, or Monet's famous ''Impression, Sunrise,'' still missing more than four years after it was taken from the Marmottan Museum in Paris?
''I don't know how on earth they could get back on the art market,'' said Jane Yeingst, the former art-theft analyst for the American office of Interpol in Washington. ''There might be unscrupulous collectors who'd buy them, but you'd really have to limit who they were shown to. They're either held on to, abandoned or, unfortunately, destroyed.''
A popular but unsubstantiated theory is that thefts of well-known artworks are commissioned by wealthy black-market collectors like the evil genius in Ian Fleming's novel ''Dr. No.'' ''Someone may have been behind the theft at the Gardner,'' Dr. Lowenthal said, ''but it's unlikely it was a Dr. No-type scenario, with someone wanting the paintings for their own delectation.''
 
Is the Black Market Growing?
 But Dr. Lowenthal says there may be a growing black market, particularly in Japan, for even well-known artworks. ''It's mostly speculation, but there are several elements to this 'Asian possibility,' '' she said. ''The Japanese have been spending a lot of money on art in recent years. In 1988, some paintings by Corot that were stolen in France were recovered in Japan, and we keep hearing rumors that the Monet is in Japan. And Japanese law on stolen art is not good for owners. There's only a two-year statute of limitations on recovering stolen art from a Japanese purchaser who did not know it was stolen.''
Other experts believe that thefts of major artworks often have ''quiet ransom scenarios,'' Dr. Lowenthal said. Insurance companies officially deny that they ever pay ransom, but law-enforcement officials and some insurers say that it is sometimes paid. ''Reward money is supposed to be offered for information leading to the recovery, prosecution and conviction of thieves,'' Dr. Lowenthal said, ''but I imagine that sometimes money from insurance companies is available under less stringent conditions. It's a dangerous route for insurance companies to embark on, because it's essentially blackmail and leads to more of the same.''
Huntington T. Block, a Washington art-insurance dealer, said, ''When a well-known work is stolen, generally the owner can expect a ransom call -whether months or years later - because he is the only person the thief can deal with.''
 
Many Thefts, Few Arrests
 Whatever happens to stolen masterpieces, thousands of lesser artworks vanish from museums, libraries, art galleries, private collections, churches and synagogues each year. Only about 12 percent will be recovered, Dr. Lowenthal said, and just a fraction of those recoveries will result in arrests.
''Most minor works, like prints, jewelry and decorative arts, go back on the art market,'' Ms. Yeingst said. ''They're often taken to another country to be sold, and the chances that the right person will look at them in an auction catalogue and recognize they're stolen is slim.''
Smaller museums, art dealers, collectors and churches, which rarely have elaborate security measures, are particularly vulnerable to theft, said Lieut. John Kelly, commanding officer of the New York Police Department's special frauds squad, which oversees investigations of art thefts.
 
Private Collections in Jeopardy
 Even though private collections are generally well insulated from the public, they are also major targets for thieves. In July 1988, for example, an armed thief posing as a building inspector entered a Gramercy Park apartment in Manhattan, tied up the housekeeper and the building superintendent, and stole 30 paintings and prints, including works by Picasso and Renoir.
New York's hundreds of private galleries have been victims of many thefts over the years, but the recovery record has been good, said Lieut. Joseph Pollini, who heads the New York Police Department squad that investigates major burglaries. In February 1988, Old Master paintings worth an estimated $6 million to $10 million were stolen from the Colnaghi Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and have yet to be recovered. Several more recent thefts - of 15 contemporary paintings, from the Dyansen Gallery in SoHo on Feb. 13, and of a $1.4 million Alexander Calder sculpture from the Perls Gallery on Madison Avenue on Jan. 21 - were quickly solved.
 
Next Victim: the Public
 The threat of theft may plague art owners, but the most immediate danger of increased art prices, art theft and insurance costs for the public is that blockbuster exhibitions may become a thing of the past, museum officials say.
''The sudden escalation of art prices has meant that too much of your budget for special exhibitions gets chewed up by insurance,'' said Charles S. Moffett, senior curator of paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Although the Federal Government indemnifies some loans of art from abroad for up to $125 million per exhibition, ''for an exhibition of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist or classic modern paintings, it doesn't take you very far,'' he added. ''It's beginning to make it quite difficult to do certain kinds of exhibitions. Our Gauguin show in 1988 might have been a project we couldn't pursue today.''
Diane Waldman, deputy director of the Guggenheim Museum, said: ''Insurance now accounts for up to one-third of the budget for exhibitions like our 50th-anniversary show, which took place in 1987. Five years ago, it would have been 10 percent.''
''Increasing prices also affect operating budgets,'' she added, ''because museums have to keep re-insuring their collections.''
 
Insuring for the Worst Case
 Whereas private and corporate collectors generally insure each work they own for a fixed value, museums and dealers usually do not itemize their collections or insure specific works, and few museums or galleries insure their collections for their full value. ''If they did, they would have to close their doors because of the cost of premiums,'' Mr. Block said. The high cost was cited as a major reason the Gardner did not have theft insurance.
Museums and galleries typically have ''all risk'' policies for theft, vandalism and fire that cover their collections for a blanket amount. Costs depend on museum location, architecture and security measures, but annual premiums for $10 million in insurance range from $10,000 to $50,000 a year.
Museums try to calculate their maximum possible loss in a worst-case scenario like a fire or a bombing, said Axel Beyer, executive vice president of Nordstern Insurance Company of America. Thus they may insure their collections for only about 15 to 25 percent of the total value, he said.
But many museum officials agree with Phillip Babcock, director of risk management at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, that ''the primary mission of museums is to protect and preserve their collections.''
''They should use their resources to reduce the risk of loss through improved security and better identification of objects,'' he added. ''Insurance should be at the bottom of the list.''
 
Keeping Thefts in Check
 Although the United States has no central registry of significant artworks in its museums and other cultural institutions - unlike France, Belgium, Italy and Japan - several American organizations do monitor art theft.
For example, the International Foundation for Art Research has records on nearly 32,000 stolen works and updates its catalogue of stolen art 10 times a year. The F.B.I. also has a database of stolen art, with images of thousands of works, stored on laser disks.
Museum officials have even begun to overcome longstanding fears that discussing theft would scare away potential donors, Dr. Lowenthal said. ''Museum policies have changed from secrecy to openness,'' she said. ''They've realized that publicizing theft will promote recovery.''
But art theft remains a low priority among law-enforcement officials. ''Many institutions have no liaisons with police departments,'' said Katharine Leab, founder of another database, called Bookline Alert Missing Books and Manuscripts. ''So police often have no understanding of their problems.''

HEADLINE: Where Balloons Fail In Clearing Arteries, New Devices May Help

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

 BODY:
Researchers are working on more than two dozen new devices that are designed to clear heart arteries by cutting, drilling, burning or pulverizing obstructions.
The devices, which are mounted on thin tubes snaked into the heart arteries, might find wide use in correcting deficiencies and side effects of a conventional therapy that relies on tiny balloon devices to widen a channel, the researchers say.
When that technique, coronary angioplasty, is used, new obstructions develop within six months in 30 percent of the cases, and they are often as severe as the original obstruction. In up to 4 percent of cases, the vessel reseals shortly after the procedure because of the collapse of part of the obstructing material that has been pushed back by the balloon or of flaps of tissue from the artery. Often emergency bypass surgery is required. 
 
'Balloon Has Limitations'
 ''There is a lot of excitement in the field because the balloon has limitations and people see opportunity,'' said Dr. George Sopko, who administers grants for cardiovascular research from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
But none of the new devices has proven successful enough to replace balloon angioplasty. ''Early on, there were limited attempts to look at devices as replacements, but now the trend is to look at things that are complementary to angioplasty,'' Dr. Sopko said.
Dr. Donald S. Baim of Harvard Medical School, who is director of invasive cardiology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, said, ''Nothing looks like an absolute replacement for angioplasty.''
Angioplasty is a common treatment when arteries carrying blood from the heart become clogged or obstructed with a sticky, yellow plaque formed from cholesterol, minerals, cell debris and other material. The blockage can lead to chest pain from restricted blood flow and sometimes heart attack.
Researchers working with the new devices hope to get part of a heart catheter market with worldwide annual sales of $500 million; the total is expected to double in five years. The precision devices generally cost $500 to $1,000 apiece, experts said, and are used only once.
Dr. Baim, who has tested several of the new devices, said: ''More than a million angioplasties have been done and we know a lot about it. It's the most tried, true and versatile technique for opening arteries and something would have to be pretty spectacular to displace it.''
Dr. Sopko said that because of its commercial potential, most of the research on alternatives to balloon angioplasty is being sponsored by the private sector, not the government.
In angioplasty, doctors run an uninflated balloon on a thin tube through an artery in the leg. Tracking the procedure by X-ray, surgeons move the balloon to a blocked area and inflate it, cracking and crushing the plaque against the arterial walls to open a channel through which blood can flow more freely. Although the plaque is pushed aside, it is not removed.
 
The Search for Alternatives
 Looking for alternatives, researchers at scores of companies and medical centers are developing mechanical devices that burrow through plaque by slicing it away, high-speed bits that drill in and pulverize the block, lasers that heat and ''weld'' back plaque compressed by a balloon, and low-heat lasers that disrupt the structure of the plaque and disintegrate it.
Cutting or shaving devices appear to be getting the most attention from developers. For example, Duke University researchers led by Dr. Richard S. Stark, working with Interventional Technologies Inc. of San Diego, Calif., are testing a catheter with a rapidly spinning, cone-shaped tip containing tiny blades. As the cone shaves pieces from the obstruction, the plaque is continuously extracted by suction.
Dr. Timothy Fischell, a Stanford University cardiologist, and his physicist father, Robert Fischell of Johns Hopkins University, are also developing cutting devices to get at tough plaque that resist balloons. They have patented bullet-shaped catheters with cutting edges on the trailing end; the devices first pierce the deposit, then slice and collect plaque as they are pulled back out of the vessel.
Coronary balloon angioplasty, first accomplished in 1977 by Dr. Andreas Gruentzig in Switzerland, became an established procedure in the early 1980's. The procedure is also widely used to open clogged vessels in the leg and kidney, but most research attention has focused on the heart.
Experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 of the procedures, which cost about $8,000 each for treatment and hospitalization and $2,000 more for the surgeon, will be performed this year in the United States.
Angioplasty is sometimes an alternative to much more expensive coronary bypass surgery, in which veins are transplanted to carry blood flow around clogged vessels.
 
Complications and Drawbacks
 Specialists say the procedure has major complications and drawbacks, including the sudden collapse of the artery shortly after the procedure. Surgical teams normally stand by in case the vessel cannot be reopened.
The balloon technique is not very effective when total or nearly total blockage prevents entry of the catheter, or when there are elongated or odd-shaped blockages or plaque attached more to one side of the vessel than the other. It also has difficulty dilating rigid plaques made hard by calcification or the accumulation of tough, fibrous material.
 
Preventing Re-stenosis
 The most persistent problem has been re-stenosis, or the return of narrowing deposits to some vessels, which occurs within six months in 30 percent of coronary arteries and more than 40 percent of leg vessels opened by balloons.
Re-stenosis is believed to be a result of injury to the vessel caused by insertion of the tube and expansion of the balloon, which stretches and tears the artery wall. For unknown reasons, the rate of this type of closure is even higher, 45 to 50 percent, in bypass graft vessels, and balloon angioplasty sometimes is used to clear them.
''When you think of what the balloon does to the artery, it's very crude,'' said Dr. Timothy A. Sanborn, director of the cardiovascular research program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. ''It cracks and stresses the vessel and doesn't really remove the plaque, just compresses it. We're trying to find kinder, gentler ways of doing this.''
Some researchers are optimistic that the restenosis problem might be helped by physically bracing the artery against collapse.
For example, Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems of Warren, N.J., is testing a collapsible scaffolding or stent that is carried into an blocked vessel around a balloon catheter. When the balloon inflates and depresses the plaque deposit, the mesh-like metal device, called the Palmaz-Schatz stent, expands to form a supporting structure inside the vessel wall. Researchers said tests of the Johnson & Johnson product in hundreds of patients indicate it could stop acute closure when properly inserted.
Another method that shows promise for fighting the re-stenosis and abrupt closure problems is the excimer, or cold, laser. With this approach, pulsed ultraviolet light energy photochemically shatters plaque, but releases little heat.
The excimer laser system being developed by Advanced Interventional Systems of Irvine, Calif., is undergoing clinical tests at several hospitals. It delivers laser energy through bundles of optical fibers at the end of a catheter.
Excimer systems, Dr. Sanborn said, appear to produce a smoother channel through plaque and to seal off flaps of tissue that can suddenly close a vessel. ''With patience and more time I think some of the devices might end up superior'' to angioplasty, Dr. Sanborn said.
Some new research also focuses on modifying and improving the classic balloon method. Dr. J. Richard Spears of Wayne State University in Detroit has combined an inflatable balloon with a laser heat source to create a ''hot balloon'' catheter that is being widely tested. The device heats the wall of the artery to the boiling point of water while inflating the balloon under pressure, a procedure that Dr. Spears says creates a larger, smoother channel while welding back the plaque deposit.
The researchers at Duke are also testing what they call an autoperfusion balloon catheter, which allows blood to flow through a tube in the center of the balloon while it is inflated. Preliminary tests indicate that this approach, which does not totally block the vessel, will allow gradual, more prolonged periods of balloon inflation that may improve outcomes.
Dr. Robert Ginsburg, head of the vascular therapy center at Stanford University Medical Center, said many of the devices being tested would probably end up having a role in treating clogged arteries.
''But none of these devices will be perfect for all occasions, all patients,'' Dr. Ginsburg said. ''I envision having several available on the instrument tray of an operating room and the surgeon picking different ones, depending on the peculiarities of the case, like a golfer selecting different clubs from his golf bag depending on the shot he wants to make.''
 
IMPROVING BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY AND REPLACING IT
 
In balloon angioplasty, arteries clogged by plaque are opened with an expanding balloon, snaked to a blocked area, often a coronary artery. The technique has been used more than a million times; new techniques are being tried to supplement it.
 
Problems and Side Effects
Balloons work poorly when blockage is nearly total or when plaque deposits are long, awkwardly positioned or hardened. The vessel may reseal immediately after the procedure or later.
 
Cold laser energy carried through bundles of optical fibers shatters plaque, makes a smoother channel and seals off flaps of the artery wall.
 
A laser heats the artery wall while the balloon is being inflated to make a large, smooth channel and weld back the plaque.
 
Other Devices
A motorized device uses a tube with a rapidly spinning cone-shaped tip containing tiny blades. It shaves pieces from the plaque blocking the artery; suction carries the debris through the tube and out of the body.
 
When the balloon inflates and depresses the plaque, it can stress and weaken the artery. A collapsible mesh scaffolding carried along with the balloon expands to brace the artery against collapse.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, March 20

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure from the turmoil in the stock market and a weak yen, the Bank of Japan ended weeks of speculation by announcing here at midday that it was raising its official discount rate a steep one percentage point, to 5.25 percent, its highest level since 1981.
The announcement calmed some of the uncertainty that had plagued the market every since talk of a rate increase began more than a month ago. But many had felt it had come too late and thus had contributed to a growing sense of despair over the downward spiral in the financial markets here.
Although the move was intended in part to bolster the yen, its impact was momentary at best. The dollar fell to slightly less than 153 yen after the news of the central bank's decision raced through Tokyo trading rooms. The dollar, however, quickly rebounded to 153.60, shrugging off both the discount rate increase and continued intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
 
'Great Disappointment'
''There was great disappointment by the lack of reaction in the foreign exchange market,'' said Jeffrey Guy, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities. ''It was not a very bright day.'' Japan has been at pains to prevent the yen from declining further because a weaker currency would tend to widen the country's already huge trade surplus. A weak currency makes exports cheaper to foreign buyers and makes imports dearer. There has been concern here that the falling currency could aggravate the already strained relations between Japan and the United States.
The discount rate announcement came against the backdrop of a plunge in the Tokyo stock market on Monday and a further decline on Tuesday.
 
Slide Continues
In the shaken Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 4.1 percent Monday as it continued its worst slide since the worldwide stock market crash in October 1987 and tumbled another 1.5 percent today.
In New York on Monday, the investors shrugged off the news from Tokyo, and the Dow Jones industrial average managed a gain of 14.41 points, to 2,755.63. [Page D10.] In Japan today, the market seesawed throghout the morning and then was pushed lower in the afternoon, with the Nikkei tumbling a further 456.05, to 30,807.19.
The increase also carried great significance for Japanese corporations and the economy. It reinforced the view that the era of ultra-low interest rates, which made a large contribution to the international competitiveness of Japanese companies, had ended.
The discount rate, which is charged commercial banks on certain short-term loans and which acts as a benchmark for other interest rates, has been increased four times and more than doubled since last May, when it stood at 2.5 percent. It was last increased on last Christmas Day in a futile attempt to arrest the decline of the yen against the dollar.
On Monday, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 600 points in the morning, and the drop accelerated in the afternoon, with the index closing down 1,353.20 at 31,263.24. Trading volume was a remarkably thin 400 million shares, about half the level of a moderately active day.
The plunge left the market down by 4.1 percent for the day and 19.6 percent for the year, erasing most of the gains of last year. It was the second time this year that prices have plummeted more than 4 percent in a single day.
The same pattern of recent weeks was repeated Monday: selling pressure was not heavy, but there was almost a total absence of buyers, which put share prices in something close to free fall in the afternoon. Large institutions, which so often in the past have acted as a backstop for tumbling prices, have been conspicuous by their absence this time, adding to the despair of Japanese investors.
 
Pessimism Abounds
''I don't want to say that it's the end of the world, but everyone's mind is set, they interpret everything pessimistically,'' said Masa Nakamura, head of international equities trading at Goldman, Sachs & Company's Tokyo office. ''Nobody has the guts to put in a bid'' to buy shares, he added.
''What's been happening has severely damaged confidence,'' said Nick Akers, a senior analyst at James Capel Pacific Limited. ''I just don't see the big institutions coming back in a hurry.''
A further psychological blow to the market was a steep plunge in the shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the telecommunications giant. Its shares fell 20,000 yen, or about $130, to close at 1,180,000, the first time the issue had fallen below its initial offering price of 1,197,000 in 1987. In addition to NTT being hit by the general worries in the market, the Government is considering forcing a breakup of the company.
 
Officials Are Perplexed
Even senior Government officials are beginning to show how perplexed they are, not just by the steepness of the slide, but by its persistence in the face of what is still a generally healthy Japanese economy.
For instance, at a briefing for reporters on Monday, a senior Bank of Japan official commented: ''We expected some correction this year, but I admit it's larger than we thought. It's extremely difficult to explain by economic terms.''
A number of factors are contributing to the growing pessimism, without any single influence dominating, analysts said.
Foremost in the minds of many here is the falling yen and the Japanese Government's inability to arrest the slide. The dollar has risen a little more than 7 percent against the yen this year. The Bank of Japan has spent more than $10 billion buying yen and selling dollars to try to reverse the trend, but its efforts have had no impact.
 
Celebrating Spring
Wednesday is a national holiday in Japan, to celebrate the first day of spring, and there was speculation that the central bank would increase its discount rate today in advance of that break, as happened.
By creating the expectation of higher rates, the weak yen had contributed to a big decline in the bond market, where rates have jumped to their highest level in nearly six years.

HEADLINE: Getting Burned By the Frying Pan

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Kentucky Fried Chicken's middle name is beginning to spell trouble.
Concerned about fat and cholesterol, which seem to fairly ooze out of the company's namesake, more and more Americans are turning to chicken that is grilled or baked or broiled - anything but fried. No matter that some studies show many of these have nearly as much fat and almost as many calories per serving as the fried version.
The shift has caught Kentucky Fried Chicken and other established purveyors in the $5 billion-a-year industry with offerings, both old and new, that are still almost always fried.
''Increasing health concerns among consumers are inhibiting the growth of Kentucky Fried Chicken,'' said Elden Chang, a restaurant analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
Last month, Kentucky Fried Chicken reported that its fourth-quarter earnings declined 12 percent, to $28.5 million, on a sales gain of 3 percent, to $420.9 million, compared with the period a year earlier. The chain's parent company, Pepsico, tersely attributed the decline to ''lower customer counts.'' Higher prices and more restaurants accounted for the meager sales growth.
 
A New Chain Tastes Success
Picking up on the consumer mood, new entrants like a fast-rising Southwestern chain called El Pollo Loco, and poachers from the hamburger business, like Burger King, are prospering from sales of non-fried chicken. El Pollo Loco, based in Irvine, Calif., has become the nation's fastest-growing major chicken chain. And Burger King's ''BK Broiler,'' a broiled-chicken sandwich introduced last month, is already selling at a rate of a million a day. That compares with the two million Whopper hamburgers that it sells each day.
As the warm-weather months approach, when most fast-food chicken is sold, Kentucky Fried Chicken's fried-food onus is not its only problem. It is also hurt by high chicken prices and rising competition from what many analysts see as a near-saturation of fast-food outlets.
Kentucky Fried Chicken, based in Louisville, Ky., is the largest and weakest link in the strong restaurant chains of Pepsico. By contrast, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are performing vigorously.
To try to move the chicken chain ahead, Pepsico has installed new management. John Cranor 3d, a longtime Pepsico executive, replaced Richard Mayer as chairman of the chicken division when Mr. Mayer left last year to join Philip Morris's General Foods U.S.A. Just last week, the president of Kentucky Fried Chicken-USA, Steven Fellingham, resigned and was replaced by Kyle Craig, an assistant to Pepsico's chairman, D. Wayne Calloway. Pepsico also brought in William McDonald, a Pizza Hut executive, to direct marketing, Under the new management, Kentucky Fried Chicken has started test-marketing grilled chicken. It is also tightening operations and broadening its fried menu. ''K.F.C. doesn't have the best reputation for cleanliness and service,'' Mr. Cranor has told securities analysts. He has reorganized field operations, revamped training and is conducting more frequent inspections of franchisees. A new fried-chicken sandwich and other new products, like spicy chicken wings, are being added to attract more lunch-time business. Most of the chain's sales are at dinner time.
The $5 billion that Americans spent last year on fast-food chicken was more than triple the $1.4 billion spent in 1980, according to the National Broiler Council, a Washington trade group for chicken producers. Ninety percent of the fast-food chicken was deep-fried.
 
First Fundamental Menu Change
But the 10 percent of the market that was not is expected to grow quickly. ''Over the next two or three years, the proportion of chicken grilled, baked or broiled could easily double,'' said William P. Roenigk, an economist with the broiler council. ''There are a lot of people out there -nobody knows how many - who say, 'I love chicken, but I just won't eat it fried.' ''
Grilled chicken would be Kentucky Fried Chicken's first fundamental menu change since the company's founding in 1955 by Harland Sanders, known as the Colonel. But the chain says it will not be available nationally soon, even though results in Louisville, Las Vegas, Nev., and Canberra, Australia, are promising.
The company is still tinkering with the grilling equipment to determine how to incorporate grills in the already cramped kitchens of the chain. The national introduction of grilled chicken will be sometime next year, said Richard M. Detwiler, a company spokesman.
The only national fast-food chicken company, Kentucky Fried Chicken is by far the market leader, with a 67.6 percent share, according to estimates by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, based on figures from Nation's Restaurant News, a trade magazine.
 
Popeye's Is Climbing
Popeye's, the growing No. 2 chain, with 13.3 percent of the market, recently acquired third-ranked Church's, with an 8.1 percent share. Popeye's is converting the faltering Church's outlets to its Cajun fried-chicken format. Fourth-ranked Chick-Fil-A, a fried chicken chain with a 6 percent share, is steadily increasing its share by concentrating on its base in the South, where people still love their chicken fried.
But the rising star is fifth-ranked El Pollo Loco (The Crazy Chicken in Spanish). The company has prospered partly by promoting its broiled chicken as a ''delicious and healthy fast food'' prepared in accordance with American Heart Association recommendations.
With sales per store of about $1.1 million in 1989, El Pollo Loco ranks at the top of the industry, Donaldson Lufkin said. That is nearly double the sales level of it competitors.
Moreover, El Pollo Loco's total sales grew by 27.2 percent in 1989, again at the top of the industry. That compares with Kentucky Fried Chicken's 3.5 percent. El Pollo Loco, a unit of TW Services, a privately held food service company in Paramus, N.J., does not disclose full-year sales or profits.
 
A Rapid Rise
El Pollo Loco had only 17 outlets in Southern California in 1983 and now has 203 restaurants in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Although the chain plans to concentrate its growth in the Southwest for now, said R. Neil Croak, franchisee marketing manager, ''this is a concept viable across America.''
While El Pollo Loco uses ''healthy fast food'' to its advantage in its ads, the fat and calorie content of grilled chicken, marinated in fruit juices and herbs, is similar to that of fried chicken.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy organization in Washington, compared company-provided data for typical portions of Kentucky Fried Chicken and El Pollo Loco chicken. As a percentage of calories derived from fat, a widely used nutritional index, Kentucky Fried's chicken scored better at 49 percent, compared with El Pollo Loco's 52 percent.
Kentucky Fried Chicken was indeed 39.5 percent higher in cholesterol and 75.3 percent higher in sodium, ounce for ounce. But it was only 9.5 percent higher in calories and a scant 2 percent higher in fat.
''That is very interesting,'' Mr. Detwiler, the Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman, said of the nutritional analysis. ''I suspect most people don't know that. I certainly didn't.''
El Pollo Loco attributes the mixed nutritional picture to the fact that its data were based on an average of the white-meat breast and dark-meat wings and thighs. ''Dark meat is typically 20 percent higher in fat than white meat,'' said Gayle A. De Brosse, the company's director of research and development.
 
Costs Shoot Up
Mainly because of increased demand for chicken at supermarkets and restaurants, Kentucky Fried Chicken has seen its raw material costs rise by 19 percent, to $500 million, from $420 million in 1987. Mr. Chang, the Donaldson, Lufkin analyst, said chicken prices were still near their peak of 70 cents a pound.
Perhaps the largest external pressure on Kentucky Fried Chicken is the sheer number of fast-food outlets of all kinds competing for customers.
Analysts estimate the number of American restaurants in the 100 leading chains - serving burgers, chicken, pizza, seafood and steaks -increased nearly 19 percent in just the last three years. That is a total of 119,161 major restaurants, or one fast-food place for every 2,100 people.
Such intense competition is at the heart of the dispute between Kentucky Fried Chicken's management and its franchisees, who own more than 70 percent of the chain's nearly 5,000 outlets in the United States. (There are also more than 3,000 international restaurants, from Beijing to Barbados.) The company wants to change the franchisee contract to allow more outlets in the few areas that have fast-growing markets.
The Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchisees filed suit to block the move, fearing that new stores could be placed too near existing ones and sap their sales. Management and the franchisee group are now negotiating the contract.

HEADLINE: Soviets Seek Bond Advice in U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Soviet Union, struggling to invigorate its economy, is turning to American financial experts for advice on raising money to build much-needed projects, from hospitals to factories.
With the approval of senior Soviet officials, an American team is developing ways of borrowing similar to those used by more than 40,000 local governments in the United States. Several of the proposals are to be presented in early April when the Americans visit the Soviet Union.
Important to the American group's proposals is showing how a relatively small amount of money can be stretched to finance projects that would greatly benefit the Soviet economy. That technique is widely used by local governments in the United States, which borrow money by selling bonds to pay for construction of large projects, then repay the bonds over years or decades. In the Soviet Union, bond financing is unknown, and projects are financed on a ''pay as you go'' basis, with no long-term borrowing. 
 
A Daunting Task
But while the pool of savings in the Soviet Union is large, persuading citizens and enterprises to invest in bonds to finance new projects will be a daunting task. Bond purchases mandated during the Stalin years were later repudiated. And with inflation estimated at 10 percent for consumer goods whose prices are not controlled, many savers are more interested in buying gold, rugs and artwork. New financial instruments will require some salesmanship to overcome the suspicion that the investments may not hold their value.
Nevertheless, Sergei Plekhanov, a deputy director of the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada, a research organization that is part of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and is working with the American team, said from Moscow in a phone interview that the program ''has the full-scale support of the Soviet Government.'' The supporters include Deputy Prime Minister Leonid I. Abalkin, chief economic adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and officials of the Commission on Economic Reform, a state agency.
 
Idea 'a Breakthrough'
''The budget is really tight, and the prospect of raising funds through the state for many necessary projects is not very good,'' Mr. Plekhanov said. ''But there are huge amounts of funds that are just lying out there not being used, and the idea of using new financing mechanisms to channel them to public health looks like a breakthrough.''
Soviet officials are tentatively planning to apply the new financing techniques to construction of a 300-bed AIDS hospital in Moscow, one that would not be state-owned. Soviet supporters of the American team expect this project to be popular enough to make the public and Government officials accept the novel financing techniques more quickly. Other projects envisioned are buildings for six regional financial exchanges and a factory that would produce an as yet unidentified product now being imported.
 
Small-Scale Application
''What we are doing is coming up with ideas that might be applied now on a very small scale, but which might serve as a template for many larger projects in the future,'' said Jeffrey A. Sachs, a New York financial consultant who made connections with Soviet officials and assembled the American financial team.
The financing plans come at a time when the Soviet Government is experimenting with many economic changes to strengthen private enterprise and loosen the reins of state control over the economy.
While bond sales require governments to pay interest, they have the advantage of spreading the cost of major projects over many years, so that small governments can afford large projects and still have money for other essential purposes. Stretching out repayments also allows governments to pass the cost on to citizens who use the project over many years.
 
Absorbing 'Ruble Overhang'
Another objective of the financial proposals is to absorb some of the ''ruble overhang,'' the vast store of money that Soviet citizens and enterprises have accumulated but have no place to spend or invest. Economists worry that the supply of rubles, combined with the pent-up demand for consumer goods, could lead to extemely high inflation if price controls were loosened.
''The investment alternatives now in the Soviet Union are extremely limited,'' said Eric Stubbs, a professor at the Harriman School of Management and Policy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I. Mr. Stubbs, a member of the American team that will travel to Moscow in April, said Soviet officials were eager for financial innovations that might absorb some of the 600 billion of rubles held in low-interest savings accounts or in savings outside the banking system.
 
Supported by Officials
The idea of using new financing techniques to develop local projects has the support of Andrei V. Orlov, deputy chairman of the Commission on Economic Reform, and Georgi A. Arbatov, a member of the Soviet Parliament and director of the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. ''Many of our economists are looking at ways to apply bond financing to various capital needs in both public-purpose and private-sector projects,'' Mr. Arbatov said in a letter to Mr. Sachs last year.
The two officials signed an agreement authorizing Mr. Sachs to proceed with development of various financing proposals. In that letter, the Soviet officials agreed that ''the development of a system of public finance in the Soviet Union is a critical component of economic reform.''
The officials promised to arrange the cooperation of various agencies in the Soviet Government whose policies and laws must be changed to proceed with demonstration projects.
 
Local Decision-Making
Besides the economic benefits of the various projects, participants in the program expect it will help Soviet officials develop the habit of economic decision-making at the local level rather than by planners in the national Government.
While the cooperation of central planners is essential, the new financing arrangements mean they would lose some of their control over the nation's economic activity. For example, an enterprise that invests in bonds would receive interest in rubles that could be used to buy equipment needed for expansion - without obtaining prior approval for expansion from Government central planners.
''I am sure we will have to overcome the resistance of various bureaucracies, but the opportunities are good and the financing mechanisms are important,'' Mr. Plekhanov said.
 
Two New Strategies
Mr. Arbatov said that the inability of Soviet citizens and enterprises to freely exchange their rubles for Western currencies or goods within the Soviet Union was a major difficulty facing any financier trying to raise large sums by borrowing. To attract buyers for the bonds needed to finance local projects, Mr. Sachs and his associates have so far developed two strategies new to the Soviet Union.
One idea is to issue bonds that pay interest in certificates convertible into Western currencies. Because Western currencies are needed to pay for many high-technology imports, the bonds might appeal to Soviet enterprises that have excess rubles but do not have Government authority to spend on Western goods.
To encourage Government officials to part with some of the scarce Western currency needed for interest payments, the bonds might be used to pay for a factory producing something that is currently imported and that must be paid for with hard currency. For example, bonds might be used to pay for a factory making high-quality scissors, eliminating or reducing the need to spend Deutsche marks on scissors imported from West Germany.
 
Some Type of Savings Bond
A second proposal is some type of Soviet savings bond, or allocation bond, with proceeds of the sale earmarked for particular local projects. These bonds could pay interest in what the American financiers call ''allocated'' rubles. The allocated rubles would be given priority when presented to Government agencies that control the sale of scarce materials and equipment.
''There are many Soviet enterprises that have accumulated large amounts of rubles which are all but useless because they do not have Government allocations to buy needed supplies,'' Mr. Sachs said. By investing their rubles in the new allocation bonds, those enterprises could put their rubles to work and gain access to materials they seek.
J. Chester Johnson, a member of Mr. Sachs's team and president of Government Finance Associates, a Princeton, N.J., financial adviser to local governments, said the American team did not want to encourage unwise use of bond financing. ''We want to make sure that everybody understands that bonds are good for capital projects, but not as a means to pay for day-to-day operations,'' he added.
Mr. Sachs made his first connections in the Soviet Government last summer, at a rock and roll concert that attracted 100,000 fans to Lenin Stadium in Moscow. Acting as liaison between the concert promoters and the Soviet Government, the 37-year-old Mr. Sachs met Stas Namin, a well-known Russian rock performer and impresario and also the well-connected grandson of Anastas I. Mikoyan, for decades a top Soviet official and diplomat.
 
Housing Experience Cited
Exploiting his new-found connections, Mr. Sachs talked with Mr. Arbatov about his experiences in New York as a co-founder with Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, of HELP, a nonprofit organization that develops housing for the homeless, and as a developer of community residences for mental patients once confined in hospitals.
After a second trip to the Soviet Union in November, he returned to the United States with a written agreement authorizing him to assemble a team to propose and help evaluate financing proposals that Soviet officials might put into effect. For now, Mr. Sachs said, the team was working without pay.
''The big banks and investment houses have spent millions of dollars trying to develop business in the Soviet Union, but they have to realize that the economy is run by a Government bureaucracy, not other businessmen doing deals American-style,'' Mr. Sachs said. ''The people I have brought together all have a background in public finance, so when it comes to talking and negotiating with government officials they are like fish in water.''

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Is Criticized on Safety

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Some environmental and safety officials say the recent rash of oil spills and accidents at petrochemical plants may be traceable to financial pressures on the petroleum industry in the 1980's that led companies to reduce skilled technicians and put an emphasis on cost cutting rather than flawless performance.
The industry vigorously denies that it cut corners as well as costs.
''First and foremost, the industry's abiding concern is the safety of its workers,'' the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's principal trade group, said. ''Secondly, there is an obvious economic incentive for avoiding accidents and thereby preventing worker injury, and loss of equipment and product.'' 
Lee Raymond, the president of the Exxon Corporation, said, for instance, that the issue of whether cost reductions hurt the company's ability to operate its plants safely is a legitimate question; his conclusion, not surprisingly, is that they did not.
 
'Soul Searching'
''We have done a lot of soul searching about this and we do not think so,'' he said in an interview.
But the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, a Federal agency, is conducting a special investigation of recent petrochemical plant explosions, and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union made safety an issue in recent contract talks.
The 1980's were a difficult decade for the industry. Some companies were taken over, others were threatened by raiders, and as prices fell all companies came under pressure to improve profits by cutting costs. The American Petroleum Institute says the number of refinery workers in this country declined to 122,000 in 1988 from 162,000 in 1980.
Last year, the industry has been rocked by a series of highly publicized accidents, including the 11-million-gallon oil spill in Alaska by the Exxon Valdez, an explosion at Phillips Petroleum Company's petrochemical plant in Pasadena, Tex., that killed 23 people and left 125 injured and the leak of more than 500,000 gallons of home heating oil into the Arthur Kill waterway between New Jersey and Staten Island. Two more people were killed in a blast at an Exxon chemical plant in Louisiana on Dec. 24.
 
No Industry Statistics
The industry says it does not keep statistics on accidents and injuries at its refining and chemical processing operations. But the Occupational Health and Safety Administration reacted to the Phillips blast by ordering a special study of petrochemical plants, with particular emphasis on the role of contract workers. ''We want to take a good close look to find out what caused these accidents,'' said Stanley Elliott, deputy director for field operations at the Federal agency.
Joseph Kinney, director of the National Safe Work Place Institute, an advocacy group, asserted recently: ''There is a clear relationship between the incidents of explosions and the downsizing of the petrochemical industry. Some of the so-called corporate fat that was cut was maintenance engineers and industrial hygienists.''
A spokesman for Phillips said the company had 13 full-time safety specialists at the Pasadena complex at the time of the explosion, compared with five in 1984. But he said the company did not know how many were involved in maintenance compared with previous years, because much of that work was now performed by outside contractors.
 
Contract Workers
The issue of contract workers is a volatile one to the refinery workers' union, whose membership declined 20 percent in 10 years as the companies replaced full-time workers with those hired by contractors. The companies save money this way by avoiding union rates.
Union officials asssert that plant managers, under pressure to improve financial performance, have also pushed experienced managers into early retirement and entrusted key maintenance jobs to contractors.
''The 80's saw profit centers shift downward,'' said Richard Leonard, director of special projects for the union. ''First-line supervisors were put on cost accounting and they are all trying to look good by saving money. So you have people with no appreciation of risk taking great risks to save money.''
Mr. Leonard said early retirement programs offered by many companies to reduce their white-collar work forces had reduced the technical expertise needed to run highly complex refineries and chemical plants. ''They stripped out a lot of seasoned managers,'' he said.
 
Union's Point of View
The union asserts that more than 60 workers have been killed and more than 200 seriously injured in petrochemical plant explosions in the last five years. The union says there were just 18 fatalities in the previous five years.
In contract negotiations earlier this year, the union pressed for the appointment of special environmental monitors in plants, whose job it would be to try to spot unauthorized emissions or potentially unsafe practices. But it dropped the issue in return for higher pay and benefits. Union officials say they will continue to raise environmental and safey issues in informational campaigns.
Environmental advocates and industry watchers say they see some of the same factors behind the oil spills.
''The spill clearly relates to cost cutting,'' John Adams, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council said, speaking of the Arthur Kill incident. ''Remember, they cut the crews on the ships before the Alaska accident. With 15 million people living around New York harbor, they should have put in redundant systems so they would not worry about shutting a pipeline for a few hours or days.''
 
Exxon's Budget Problem
Meeting with New Jersey state officials shortly after the spill in early January, Exxon executives said a budget problem had prevented them from replacing a balky warning system that had been sending false signals for years. Plant operators accustomed to ignoring the signal made the spill worse by continuing to pump oil after the alarm sounded.
''During the 1980's both the oil industry and government agencies reduced funding and personnel for oil spill response,'' said Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin in Cambridge, Mass. ''Exxon alone lost 10 senior environmental people, so when the Valdez grounding occurred, they did not have the expertise they had in the 1970's.''
Mr. Raymond, Exxon's president, said that eliminating layers of management had speeded communications, permitting faster responses to troubles as they arise. Still, one of the company's responses to the Arthur Kill spill and a chemical plant explosion in Louisiana on Dec. 24 was to add a layer of management. Exxon has appointed a corporate vice president for safety and environment, reversing the policy of managing these matters within operating divisions.

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Drop Is Seen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Interest rates have peaked and should start falling this spring, a group of private economists predicted today.
Members of the Shadow Open Market Committee said they believed a variety of consumer and business loans would decline in coming months, reflecting a sluggish economy and declining inflationary pressures. 
The economists forecast that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, should drop from 10 percent to 9 1/2 percent or perhaps as low as 9 percent by summer.
Fixed-rate mortgages, which are about 10.25 percent, will fall to 9.8 percent by midyear and remain below 10 percent for the rest of 1990, the outlook predicted.
Jerry Jordan, a senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, who compiled the group's forecast, said that weakness in the economy would encourage the Federal Reserve to loosen its grip on credit in coming months.
The panel forecast that the Federal funds rate, an indication of the Fed's intentions about interest rates, would dip from 8.25 percent down to 7.5 percent by midyear.
The shadow committee meets twice a year to assess actions of the Federal Reserve whose chief policy-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet next week.

Moody's Reduces Ratings On Massachusetts Debts

 BODY:
The rating on $9.09 billion in Massachusetts general obligation debt and debt issued by state agencies with backing by the state, was lowered to Baa, from Baa-1, Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday.
The lower rating is still considered investment grade, but any drop in grade means that the state may have to pay higher interest rates on the money it borrows in the bond market. 
Moody's said the rating change was the result of the failure of Massachusetts to resolve its growing fiscal problems. The rating agency said that the state, whose debt is now the lowest rated, had the ability to service the debt but lacked the willingness. The rating change more than anything reflects the state's lack of action in meeting and containing an annual deficit that is expected to increase to $700 million by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30, Moody's said.
The rating agency reduced the state's general-obligation debt in November 1989, to Baa-1 from A, indicating that Moody's was concerned about the state's fiscal problems. Continued inaction, Moody's said, has reduced confidence that responsible action will be taken to control the situation.
Among the agencies whose debt was downgraded yesterday were the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, various university building authorities, various regional transit authorities, the Convention Center Authority, the Government Loan Bank and various local housing authorities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Elections in East Germany Lift Mark Against Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance against other major currencies yesterday in trading dominated by the West German mark.
Currency dealers said the support for conservative parties in Sunday's general election in East Germany spurred the buying of West German marks and drove down the dollar. As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6860 marks, down from 1.6980 marks Friday. 
The new East German Government, backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, was considered likely to take quick steps toward monetary union, free-market reforms and unification of Germany.
 
Gains Against Yen
The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, however, as dealers grew impatient waiting for Tokyo to raise the country's key interest rates. A Japanese news report that increases could be enacted today, which came late in yesterday's United States trading session, failed to have much impact.
Confidence in the yen was also shaken by the stock selloff in Tokyo, which reduced the value of the Nikkei stock average by 4.1 percent.
One dollar bought 153.05 yen late in New York, more than the 152.65 yen late on Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.55 yen, up from 152.50. In London late yesterday, the dollar also closed at 153.55 yen.
The British pound declined on the eve of today's national budget speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, who is not expected to present measures that can revive Britain's economy. Dealers reported the Bank of England sold dollars and bought pounds to defend the pound's value.
A pound bought $1.6135 late in New York, weaker than the $1.6190 on Friday. Earlier in London, a pound cost $1.6110, compared with Friday's $1.6235.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Friday, included: 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5095; 5.7025 French francs, down from 5.7360; 1,246.75 Italian lire, down from 1,253.00, and 1.18225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18285.
 
Gold Up Slightly
In the precious metals market, gold prices posted minor gains in domestic and overseas dealings. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery settled at $400.70 an ounce, $1.10 higher than Friday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $400.80 for an ounce of gold late yesterday, 80 cents more than Friday's late bid.
In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.101 an ounce, up from Friday's $5.093.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Soybean Prices Up Sharply On Developments in Brazil

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 19

 BODY:
Prices of soybean futures rose sharply today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid talk of lower-than-expected Brazilian soybean yields and diminishing fears that Brazil's economic reforms will lead to a flood of soybean marketings.
On other commodity markets, coffee, sugar and cocoa futures fell sharply, and petroleum futures were mixed.
Soybean futures settled 6 cents to 8 1/4 cents higher, with March at $5.90 a bushel. Wheat, corn and oats futures were also higher. 
The soybean market opened lower on expectations that sweeping economic reforms announced last week in Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean producer, would stimulate the country's farmers to sell soybeans.
 
Currency Devaluation Feared
Of greatest concern was a plan to replace Brazil's currency, the cruzado novo, with a new currency, the cruzeiro, which would feature free-floating foreign exchange rates. Many experts believe the cruzeiro will be sharply devalued, which would prompt farmers to sell soybeans to obtain dollars or other hard currency.
But analysts saw no significant increase in Brazilian sales over the weekend or yesterday, said Steve Freed, a grain market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Meanwhile, analysts said Memphis-based Sparks Commodities Inc. released an estimate of the Brazilian soybean crop that put production at 19.5 million metric tons instead of the 20.5 million projected last month by the Agriculture Department.
Sparks would not confirm the number, but analysts said indications of lower-than-expected Brazilian soybean yields - the harvest began about two weeks ago - had prompted much speculation that the crop would be smaller than the Agriculture Department's estimate.
Selling associated with the Brazilian economic reforms dominated the coffee, cocoa and sugar markets. Brazil is a major producer of all three commodities.
On New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, coffee futures finished 1.5 cents to 2.67 cents lower, with March at 87 cents a pound; sugar settled 0.02 cent to 0.26 cent lower, with May at 15.87 cents a pound; cocoa futures settled $20 to $36 lower, with March at $1,095 a ton.
Near-month crude-oil futures edged lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concerns about high OPEC production. Gasoline futures also fell while heating oil firmed on indications of tight near-term availability.

HEADLINE: O'Neill Decides He Won't Run For a Third Term in Connecticut

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 20

 BODY:
Gov. William A. O'Neill said today that he would not seek a third full term in office, citing the ''political realities'' facing him and saying he had no taste for the negative campaign tactics he believed necessary to win re-election.
Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat who governed the nation's most affluent state throughout the 1980's, suffered a sharp drop in popularity last year after pushing nearly $1 billion in tax increases through the General Assembly to counter a decline in revenue caused by the economic slowdown in the Northeast.
His decision not to seek re-election comes as other Northeastern governors and mayors are grappling with similar budget problems. In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio, at the start of a four-year term, has proposed $1.4 billion in tax increases and sharp cutbacks in spending. In New York City, Mayor David N. Dinkins has proposed additional taxes to close a widening budget gap in the next fiscal year. 
 
A Daunting Issue
For officials facing re-election this year, the issue of raising taxes has been especially daunting. In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo only this week began discussing possible tax moves, including a rise in the gasoline tax. In fiscally troubled Massachusetts, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced last year that he would not run again.
In Connecticut, politicians say the tax issue was only one factor for Mr. O'Neill.
''I also think people just got tired of him,'' the state Republican Party chairman, Richard Foley, said today.
Mr. O'Neill, had maintained for months that he would run. His withdrawal leaves Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden as the only Democrat with an organized campaign, further muddling a race already complicated by the entry of former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a liberal Republican, as an independent candidate. The leading Republican contender is Representative John G. Rowland, a conservative from Waterbury.
At a news conference at the Governor's mansion, Mr. O'Neill said, ''I have decided that I can best serve the people of Connecticut, who twice have elected me their Governor, by completing this term of office unfettered and unimpaired by the demands of a campaign for re-election.''
Mr. O'Neill a 59-year-old former bar owner from rural East Hampton, has spent the last year battling the economic slowdown that has struck New England, New York and New Jersey.
 
Increase in Sales Tax
Last year he acted much sooner than many other governors by imposing the largest tax increase in Connecticut's history, including raising the sales tax to 8 percent, the nation's highest. The state does not have an income tax.
This February he proposed a budget that eliminated 2,000 workers and cut $600 million in spending and he warned that more cuts were possible if the state's revenues did not improve. But his proposed budget does not call for further tax increases, and it is balanced by taking hundreds of millions in dollars from special reserve accounts.
He also showed that he had some political fight left in him when he vetoed fare increases in Connecticut for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad over the objections of the railroad's governing body in New York.
''I firmly believe I could win this re-election,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
 
Open-Heart Surgery
Shortly after taking office, Mr. O'Neill had open-heart surgery. He also had polyps, one cancerous, removed from his colon several times during the last three years.
His announcement today came just hours before his party began the selection of convention delegates at the local level. Many delegates now are expected to remain uncommitted until the delegate primaries on May 15.
Besides Mr. Morrison, State Representative William J. Cibes Jr. of New London announced his candidacy at the State Capitol today, two hours after Mr. O'Neill's speech.
Other possible candidates include the Senate President pro tempore, John B. Larson of East Hartford, and Mayor Christopher Droney of West Hartford, who is the brother of the state Democratic Party chairman, John F. Droney Jr. The Democrat long considered Mr. O'Neill's heir apparent, Representative Barbara Kennelly of Hartford, who has said she would not be a candidate, repeated that position today.
Like most politicians in both major political parties, Mr. Morrison, a liberal who has been urging Mr. O'Neill not to run for re-election for several months, was gracious upon hearing Mr. O'Neill's announcement. ''I want to thank Mr. O'Neill for making the decision he has at the beginning of the delegate selection process,'' he said.
He also stepped up criticism of Mr. Weicker, painting him as a Republican running as an independent. Besides Mr. Rowland, other Republican candidates include the Senate minority leader, Reginald J. Smith of New Hartford; Joel Schiavone of New Haven, and Joseph McGee, a Fairfield banker.
The co-chairman of the Weicker independent candidacy, Thomas D'Amore Jr., a former state Republican chairman, said Mr. O'Neill's decision had little direct impact on Mr. Weicker's bid. ''We wish him well,'' he said. ''He was always a good man.''
As for the effect on the Democratic Party, the state's dominant party for the last 20 years, Mr. D'Amore said: ''It certainly makes things very dynamic and fluid. I don't know what's going to happen on the other side.''
Mr. O'Neill took office on Dec. 31, 1980, after Gov. Ella T. Grasso resigned in failing health. ''We walked in with humility and pride, and we walk out with humility and pride,'' said Governor O'Neill, flanked at the news conference by his wife, Nikki.
During his current term, he often responded to questions about a 1990 re-election race by saying he would run barring serious health problems. At his news conference, he said no such problems existed. ''The modern process of campaigning is a rigorous one,'' he said. ''It exacts a toll on the body and the spirit which, at this point in my career, I do not choose to pay.''
''It would be a very, very difficult campaign,'' he added later. ''I think it would have to be a negative campaign, and I'm not sure that at this point in my life I wanted to start competing in that type of operation.''

HEADLINE: VENEZUELA AGREES TO DEBT PROPOSAL

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Giving a lift to the Bush Administration's debt policy, Venezuela and its bankers announced agreement yesterday on the basic terms of a plan for debt reduction and new loans.
The proposal, which covers about $20 billion in outstanding loans, offers banks that have loans to Venezuela a variety of plans to chose from. One option would reduce a loan by 30 percent and offer guarantees on principal and interest payments. This is just under the 35 percent level set in last year's deal with Mexico, the first agreement reached under the Brady plan, named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
Another option provides for the Venezuelan Government to buy back existing loans at a deeper discount, expected to be 60 percent to 65 percent, to allow banks to choose to remove Venezuelan loans from their books if they are willing to take the loss.
 
Less Administration Pressure
The goal of the Administration's debt strategy, announced a year ago, is to resolve the third world's $1.3 trillion debt problem with an emphasis on reducing existing debt rather than just making new loans. The Administration put pressure on banks to reach an agreement with Mexico but had a less central role in the Venezuela talks.
Miguel Rodriguez, Venezuela's Minister of Planning, said at a news conference in New York that the agreement was a ''crucial aspect'' of the economic plan President Carlos Andres Perez announced last year to fight inflation and open the economy to international trade and investment.
That program, including an increase in gasoline prices, set off riots in February 1989 in which more than 300 were killed. In response, Mr. Brady named Venezuela as a top candidate for the new debt strategy, although many bankers contended that Venezuela had created many of its own economic problems and had the resources, in oil and elsewhere, to recover economically without a substantial reduction of its debt.
The proposal for Venezuela's debt is the fourth initial agreement completed under the Brady plan, and it includes several new twists that show how each deal has been tailored to the country's problems and the bankers' desires. Final details of a deal for Philippines are thought to be nearly complete, and a deal is expected to be completed for Costa Rica, although talks have been delayed.
The Treasury officially welcomed the announcement. ''I think it's significant that in no more than nine months we've had four major deals,'' said Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford.
 
A New Idea
One new idea in the Venezuelan proposal is an option for temporary - but very large - interest-rate reductions on existing debt. For two years, interest rates can be cut to 5 percent, almost half current levels. They would then rise gradually, reflecting the contention of many bankers that Venezuela faces a much less severe long-term economic crisis than Mexico does.
Another proposal, also reflecting this theme, will give banks that accept the 30 percent permanent debt reduction option the ability to get additional payments from the Venezuelan Government after six years if oil prices rise beyond a set level, expected to be near $26 a barrel.
Venezuela also hopes to attract a substantial block of new loans from its bankers, something Mexico was unable to do in its deal.
Unlike the Mexican deal, the bankers have more options to choose from and are not basically being forcing to pick debt reduction or new loans.
M. Peter McPherson, executive vice president at the Bank of America, a member of the Bank Advisory Committee and a former Treasury Department official, said in an interview that the Venezuelan deal showed that ''the Brady plan clearly has got life in it.''
 
Moving Too Slowly
Critics of the Brady plan, announced in March 1989, have argued that it has not moved fast enough. Others have argued that the debt reduction, in the case of Mexico, was not enough.
A final deal with Venezuela will take the fourth-largest debtor in the world off the negotiating list, with Mexico, the second largest, already gone. Brazil, the largest, remains, but there is hope now that the country's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, will make the economic reforms needed to open the way to debt talks. But the situation in Argentina, where there was similar hope last year with the election of Carlos Saul Menem, has deteriorated.
''We are confident that with the implementation of the plan, our economy will begin to show the substantial benefits of our adjustment efforts,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.
Venezuelan officials and the 16-bank advisory committee, headed by Chase Manhattan Bank, will now work on the final details of the plan to be sent to its more than 300 creditor banks around the world. This process is expected to take several months.
The impact on Venezuela will not be clear until the banks choose among the options.
 
Two Main Options
There are two main debt-reduction options. One is for a 30 percent reduction, combined with guarantees on principal and interest that will be paid for by Venezuela, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and several countries, including Japan and Spain. The amount of these guarantees was not announced, and it could be a difficult issue.
Under this option, the banks can choose to reduce the face value of their existing loans and be paid interest at the rate of the London Interbank rate plus 13/16 of a percentage point. The London Interbank rate is now 8.75 percent.
Banks can also keep the face value of their loans, but accept a cut in the current interest rate to a fixed level of 6.75 percent.
In both cases, the banks would get special security that would guarantee the additional payments from the Venezuelan Government if Venezuela's crude oil price passes a set rate, adjusted for inflation, after six years. The additional payments would be made each six months for 24 years, the remaining life in the 30-year bonds, when the oil price is over the threshold. These certificates can be traded separately from the debt reduction bonds, which a banker said adds to their attractiveness.
 
At a Deep Discount
The other debt reduction option is a debt buyback under which the Venezuelan Government would offer to buy back existing loans based on a discount set by the Government, expected to be around 60 to 65 percent.
Under the temporary debt reduction proposal, the banks would accept an interest rate cut to 5 percent in the first two years, 6 percent in the third and fourth years, and 7 percent in the fifth year. For the remaining 12 years of the bond, the interest would be the London Interbank rate plus 7/8ths of a percentage point.
For the five years of the lower interest rates, Venezuela will provide a fund that will guarantee the interest.
As part of the deal, Venezuela also agreed to pay all of its back interest on existing loans by the end of March. The country announced yesterday a $400 million loan from the Bank for International Settlements to help make this interest payment.

HEADLINE: South Africa Seen as Ready to Sign Nuclear Pact

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 17-

 BODY:
After talks here in 1988 and last year, officials of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union say they believe that South Africa is poised to sign the 1970 treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
At the last talks in December, officials said, Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha of South Africa left the representatives of the three Governments with the clear impression that his Government would agree to adhere to the treaty at another meeting in Vienna this spring.
South Africa is one of a small group of countries that have refused to give up the option of acquiring nuclear weapons by signing the treaty. Some of the nations may already have such weapons or be able to produce them. In August 1988, Mr. Botha said South Africa has the ability to produce a nuclear bomb ''should we want to.'' Asked if South Africa already had nuclear weapons, he said he would not elaborate on his statement. 
There was no immediate comment from South Africa.
A total of 137 countries now adhere to the treaty. Those that do not include Israel, Pakistan and India. In 1987, South Africa said it was considering signing the treaty, a move that helped Western countries block an African drive to expel it from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based organization that inspects plants of countries that have signed the treaty to insure that they are used only for peaceful purposes.
South Africa then asked for discussions about signing the treaty with the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union, the three countries that can, under the accord, keep nuclear weapons in return for a pledge to work for disarmament and a ban on testing.
The development that appears to have swung South Africa around in favor of signing the treaty, officials say, was an assurance from the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union that for procedural reasons the International Atomic Energy Agency would not be in a position to start inspecting South Africa's plants for about two years after it signed.
Britain also assured South Africa that if it signed the treaty, European countries were likely to lift their ban on nuclear cooperation with South Africa.
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader who was freed from prison last month, has been urging the West to maintain economic sanctions until South Africa's white-dominated Government carries out its promise to abolish apartheid.
During the discussions, officials say, South Africa sought assurances that if it signed the treaty it would gain access to Western technology, be able to take part fully in the scientific work of the atomic energy agency and benefit from the help it gives its members.
Although the agency's African members have been trying to expel South Africa from the agency since 1987, their drive has been successfully blocked so far by the United States, the Soviet Union and their allies, who want as large a membership as possible.
The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union told South Africa that the three would not agree to any further talks on any topic related to the treaty because it cannot be changed in any way to accommodate new members.
They said they would meet with South Africa again only to accept its adherence to the agreement.
The international agency now inspects South Africa's two nuclear power reactors at Koeberg near Cape Town at the insistence of France, which supplied them. It also inspects the small Safari research reactor.
But the South African authorities never allowed any outside inspection of their pilot uranium enrichment plant, which could be used for military ends. South Africa may also have other nuclear plants as well.
Diplomats say they have evidence that South Africa has never tried seriously to develop nuclear arms.
Agency officials say South Africa sees itself as a growing industrial power in Africa and has expressed interest in expanding its nuclear generating capacity to cope with demand.
Although South Africa has much coal, there is concern about reliance on coal-fired generating capacity alone.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS TO ASK FOREIGN AID SHIFT

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
In their first formal challenge to the Administration's foreign-aid priorities, Senate Democrats plan to propose that more than half of the $800 million in emergency aid that President Bush has requested for Panama and Nicaragua be redirected to assist the new democracies in Eastern Europe.
The Administration had sought $500 million for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua as part of a supplemental foreign-aid bill for fiscal 1990. But Congressional officials said the Democratic plan, which will be offered later this week, would allocate only $300 million for the two Central American nations and earmark the remaining $500 million for an Eastern European ''emerging democracies fund.''
The fund's money would not be designated for any particular Eastern European country but would be available to finance various economic development and technical assistance projects as needs arise. 
 
Help for Israel in Limbo
President Bush did not request any supplemental spending for Eastern Europe in 1990, though his 1991 budget seeks $300 million. The supplemental spending bill includes items to be added to the budget for the current fiscal year, 1990.
As part of the 1990 supplemental package, lawmakers had hoped to include $400 million in loan guarantees to help the Israeli Government resettle Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union.
But after Administration testimony today, it appeared that the loan guarantee legislation would remain in limbo as Congress awaits clarification of the Administration's position on new settlements in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Questioned on that point at a Senate subcommittee hearing today, the Deputy Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, told Senators that the loan-guarantee legislation ''would have our support on the assumption that we can obtain adequate assurances from the Government of Israel on the use of these funds.''
Lawmakers said that Mr. Eagleburger's comment left them in the dark as to the Administration's position on the issue in the wake of statements several weeks ago by President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Mr. Baker appeared to suggest that all aid to Israel be contingent on a pledge that no new settlements be opened in the occupied territories.
While the longstanding United States position has been that American assistance to Israel cannot be used in the occupied areas, Washington has not previously tried to tie the aid to the broader issue of new settlements.
 
Silence on 'Assurances'
President Bush then added to the confusion by saying the United States did not believe ''there should be new settlements in the West Bank or East Jerusalem.'' After a series of moves over plans for Middle East peace, including some related to the inclusion of negotiators with links to East Jerusalem, Israel's coalition government collapsed.
Under questioning today by members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Mr. Eagleburger declined to specify what ''assurances'' the United States was seeking from Israel, and Senators on the panel said they would need to know more before the loan guarantee legislation could move forward.
But the primary focus of Mr. Eagleburger's appearance on Capitol Hill today was Central America, not Israel. Although there is broad, support from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress for assistance to Panama and Nicaragua, Mr. Bush's proposal has run into stiff opposition from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the full Appropriations Committee, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Byrd have been working for several weeks on the plan to change the distribution of the aid to Eastern Europe and Central America, and at a White House meeting with the President this morning, Senate Republicans as well as Democrats warned Mr. Bush that his aid request was in trouble. ''There is a lot of confusion, that was evident from the meeting,'' said Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, the senior Republican on the foreign operations panel.
 
Military Cuts Opposed
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said Senators in both parties told the President that they object to the Administration's plans to pay for the additional aid for Panama and Nicaragua by taking money out of the military budget. One Republican Senator, who asked not to be identified, told the President that some of the Pentagon deletions the Administration has suggested amount to line-item vetoes of provisions in the 1990 military budget.
But the hearing in Mr. Leahy's subcommittee, which followed the White House meeting, offered a preview of the larger foreign-aid battle to come. Mr. Leahy told Mr. Eagleburger that the $800 million the Administration has requested for Panama and Nicaragua is ''simply too much money'' for ''two countries of slight economic, security and foreign policy importance to U.S. national interests.''
Mr. Leahy raised particular objections to the part of the Administration aid package intended to help Panama repay its overdue loans to the World Bank and other international development banks, calling it ''a crazy scheme.''

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Neutral-Germany Stand By Soviets Is Softening

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Soviet foreign policy experts have indicated that Moscow might eventually compromise on its demand that a united Germany be a neutral nation outside NATO.
Noting the new signals, Bush Administration officials said today that the Soviets would revise their position if their security concerns could be satisfied through other means, perhaps including limits on the number and location of German and foreign troops in a united Germany.
In an interview on West German television March 8, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev flatly rejected the idea that a united Germany could be a member of NATO. ''We will not agree to that,'' he said. ''This is absolutely ruled out.'' 
On Monday, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, reaffirmed that a united Germany ''should not be a member of NATO.''
But Nikolai S. Portugalov, the adviser on German affairs to the Communist Party Central Committee, hedged his position. He said on Monday that NATO membership for a united Germany is unacceptable right now, but added that this is only Moscow's ''starting position in the negotiations'' on German unification.
Vyacheslav I. Dashichev, who works at the main Soviet research institute dealing with Eastern Europe, went one step further in an interview in today's issue of the West German newspaper Die Welt.
''You have to bind a united Germany into the framework of NATO,'' said Mr. Dashichev, an official at the Institute of the Economics of the World Socialist System, in Moscow. ''There is the image of a cannon not being fixed to the deck of a ship, and some people compare a neutral Germany to such a cannon.''
American experts on Soviet-German relations predicted that Moscow would accept NATO membership for a united Germany as long as it is a temporary status, pending creation of new security arrangements for Europe.
Arnold L. Horelick, an expert on Soviet foreign policy at the Rand Corporation research center, said:
''The Soviets will press for a neutral Germany, but they are realists. They understand that the alternative to agreeing to some form of German membership in NATO would be to restore a confrontational environment in Europe, which would set them at odds with the West and a united Germany. At the moment, their ability to pursue such a confrontation is weaker than ever. In the end, they will probably be obliged to accept some form of German membership in NATO.''
Mr. Horelick, who served as the chief Soviet analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency from 1977 through 1980, said the Soviets would use their insistence on German neutrality as a device to win concessions that ''encumber and attenuate German membership in NATO.''
For example, he said, the Soviets might seek assurances limiting the size of the armed forces of a united Germany, restricting the deployment of NATO troops in Germany and prohibiting nuclear weapons on German soil.
The Soviet Union wants to see Germany locked into a new security arrangement under the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
American officials say they would welcome a larger role for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in protecting human rights, promoting democracy and encouraging free-market economic policies in Eastern Europe. But they do not see it as the foundation of a new security regime.

Inviting Vermont To Learn How to Ski

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAYSTON, Vt.

 BODY:
Her legs still wobbling from her maiden voyage down the Easy Street trail, Debra Maloney-Evans finds she is actually enjoying herself. For Mrs. Maloney-Evans, this slushy Sunday at Sugarbush's Mount Ellen Ski Area is her first outing on Alpine skis in nearly 20 years, and she admits to having had her doubts.
''I've never been this close to the mountain to know whether or not I could ski it,'' said the 36-year-old nurse, who grew up one mountain range away in Northfield. ''From a distance, the mountain looks so intimidating. I wondered what people would be wearing. Growing up, you had the sense it was kind of snobbish.'' 
She, her husband, Peter Evans, and their three children were on skis courtesy of a program called Let's Get Vermont Skiing, run by the Vermont Ski Areas Association. The association's 17 members all offer free beginner lessons, lift tickets and rental equipment to Vermonters on most Sunday afternoons.
Contrary to the common perception outside New England that skiing is second nature to Vermonters, many of them don't ski. State residents represent about 20 percent of the skier-day volume in the state, said Tom Meyers, the association's spokesman, The purpose of the free skiing program is ''to expand the market,'' he explained, adding that since it began six years ago, about 15,000 Vermonters have taken advantage of it.
''It's also to give local people an opportunity they might not otherwise have,'' he said. ''There's a sense that skiing has become very expensive, and in some cases it has.''
But many say the price of a lift ticket - more than $35 for a one-day ticket on the weekend at many areas - is not the reason many Vermonters don't ski. They point to economic and cultural tensions between ski areas and the local populations.
In 1965, the year David Munford stopped Alpine skiing, Vermont ranked 41st in the nation in terms of per capita income. At the same time, the ski industry was booming, with affluent weekend skiers flocking up the newly opened interstate highways from states like Connecticut (first in per capita income), New York (fourth) and Massachusetts (12th).
''When I was growing up in Middlebury, about half of my friends skied,'' said Mr. Munford, a graduate student in education who is a part-time lift operator at the Middlebury College Snow Bowl, a small ski area. ''The reason several of us quit permanently was that equipment was becoming a status issue. You were made to feel inferior if you didn't have the right equipment. It turned me off. I felt out of place in my own home.''
Mr. Munford says the tensions have been aggravated by the explosion of the number of second homes built here by out-of-staters, largely around the ski areas, and what he calls the ''neo-Colonialist attitude'' of resort owners toward the service workers, most of whom are local.
''There's a split between the haves and have-nots, and it's becoming more obvious,'' he said. ''The average income of skiers is being displayed in more and more high-tech equipment, and it creates resentment. Vermonters are expected to stay away from their vacation homes except to mow the lawns.''
Peter Evans, an elementary school principal, is typical of the Vermonters who sign up for the Let's Get Vermont Skiing program. By the end of the first hour, he had mastered the wedge, which was known as the snowplow when he used to ski back in grade school and junior high.
''They're supposed to be beginners, but we can tell that most of them have been on something that slides,'' said Chip Nicholas, assistant director of the Sugarbush Ski School. ''We find that they learn very fast.''
Mr. Evans has adopted more of a live-and-let-live attitude toward ski resorts than he used to have. ''It used to be that we just never came here,'' said Mr. Evans. ''We felt that it wasn't really Vermont, that it was something that had been sold out.''
But at the age of 37, with three school-age children, he has come to appreciate Alpine skiing as a family activity.
''I'm still concerned about the valley,'' he said, ''but what's being done here in terms of development is being done well. There was a time I wouldn't have come here because I didn't like what was going on. Now, I'm taking the attitude we should enjoy the resources we have.''

HEADLINE: What Multinationals Do Isn't Tax Cheating;
Weak Evidence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I write to flesh out your Feb. 18 front-page article on tax cheating by United States subsidiaries of foreign corporations. You quote an unnamed Internal Revenue Service official as saying that ''suspected underpayments amount to at least $12 billion.'' The alleged cheating was ascribed to subsidiaries of foreign companies paying their parent corporations too much for goods and services. The main suspects are United States distributors of products made in Japan. 
The article was widely reported, is affecting events and has triggered at least one Congressional investigation. The allegations have also been taken up by protectionists who see the cheating as an unfair subsidy to foreign imports. I cannot evaluate the allegations, but some of the circumstantial evidence of cheating presented by the Internal Revenue Service is less compelling when it is explained.
I.R.S. statistics, you report, show that over a decade (presumably ending in about 1987), although foreign assets in the United States more than tripled and the United States gross income of foreign-owned companies more than doubled, the total taxes that these companies paid hardly changed.
I have three observations: (1) Foreign investment in recent years has been heavy in commercial real estate, which has been a disaster in many parts of the United States. Thus taxes in this area have not kept pace with assets. (2) Gross income for United States corporate tax purposes means sales (or other revenues) less cost of sales. Any manipulation of the purchase price of goods bought from a foreign parent would increase cost of sales and decrease gross income. Since gross income has more than doubled in the decade, that tax revenues are about the same cannot be attributed to pricing manipulation. (3) During the decade in question, the United States corporate tax rate was reduced more than 29 percent (from 48 percent to 34 percent). For corporations as a whole, the rate reduction was offset by other changes, most significantly reduced depreciation write-offs and elimination of the investment credit. But these offsets had little effect on importers, distributors and retailers because those taxpayers did not have large investments in plant and equipment. Everything else being equal, the reduced tax rates meant lower taxes.
Increased interest payments are probably the main reason tax collections remained flat while gross income doubled. But there is no allegation of cheating in this area. The I.R.S. has no trouble getting information from United States subsidiaries of foreign companies about interest expense. And it has plenty of power to adjust interest deductions where interest rates on loans from related parties are higher than the going rate. Prospectively, beginning in 1990, there are new interest stripping rules that substantially limit the interest United States subsidiaries can deduct on loans from related foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Out of the Pits: Why P.S. 182 Can Read

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Public School 182 in the East Bronx learned yesterday that it had made a phenomenal comeback - the educational equivalent of moving from the league cellar into pennant contention.
One year ago the school, whose pupils are largely Hispanic and black from poor and lower middle-class homes, was near the bottom third of the New York City school system. It ranked 404th among 616 elementary schools in the citywide reading scores.
Only 36 percent of its children could read at or above a level considered appropriate for their grade. 
 
'Everything Clicked for Us'
Yesterday, when the latest rankings were published, the school finished among the top third of the schools, placing 169th on the list, with 60.4 percent of the children reading at or above grade level.
''Everything clicked for us last year,'' said the principal of P.S. 182, Jeanne LoCascio. ''But we've been working on this for a long time.''
She attributed the turnaround mainly to a daily after-school tutoring program.
More than 370,000 children in Grades 3 to 9 took the Degrees of Reading Power examination in May 1989. The results were released last fall, but yesterday the 618 elementary schools and 180 junior high schools were ranked by the proportions of children reading at or above grade level. Overall 47.4 percent of the city's students read at or above grade level, a measure derived from the average performance of national samplings of students at each grade.
As they do every year, schools in economically comfortable neighborhoods in northern Queens, Staten Island, Riverdale in the Bronx and the East Side of Manhattan topped the rankings. But many educators were impressed more by the progress of schools like P.S. 182.
P.S. 182's gain of 24.4 percentage points, the third largest of any city school, is no mystery to Mrs. LoCascio, who has been the principal for five years. Last year the school was able to get money to provide after-school tutoring for its poorest readers five days a week.
Four seasoned teachers, assisted by honor students from nearby Adlai Stevenson High School, worked with 60 children for two hours each day, teaching them how to break up an unfamiliar word into its component sounds and how the meaning of a word might depend on its context. They also had the children practice reading the kinds of paragraphs that appear on the citywide reading test.
 
Practice Avoids 'Freeze Up'
''They practiced the format of the test, so when they sat down, they weren't stunned by it,'' Mrs. LoCascio said. ''Some children who are really capable in reading freeze up during the test and don't really show us what they know.''
At P.S. 182, which is in a sparsely populated, frontier-like section of the Bronx known as Clason Point, an emphasis on reading has permeated the school for several years.
Lorraine Shirley, the school's librarian, can be seen planting herself into a snug rocking chair in a corner of of the library and reading an Italian folk tale to third graders sitting cross-legged on carpets before her.
When a visitor asks fourth graders to describe the books they are reading, Brian Carr, a slender youngster with an engaging gap in his front teeth, delights in spinning the tale of ''James and the Giant Peach.''
Brian breathlessly describes how James's parents are eaten by an escaped rhinoceros, how James meets up with green things, witches, centipedes and ladybugs and finally how James ends up inside a giant peach that is rolling down a hill.
''I read books on dinosaurs,'' says a classmate of James, Russell Johnson. ''Most dinosaurs died because an asteroid hit where they lived and no more plants could grow and that's what dinosaurs eat, so they died.''
 
Reading in Every Class
Every class, from science to social studies, is used as an opportunity to get children to read and think about what they are reading. Claire Harris, the school's remedial-reading teacher, works individually with children from poor families under the federally financed program known as Chapter 1.
Even the school's parents join in. They are asked to read to their children for at least 15 minutes every night. Children whose parents fill out a calendar charting the reading sessions are rewarded at a school assembly.
Also last year, the first beneficiaries of an I.B.M.-sponsored ''Writing to Read'' program, in which children write stories on computers, finally took the third-grade reading test, the earliest grade counted in the citywide rankings. Mrs. LoCascio believes many children who may worry about their penmanship find computers less intimidating than paper.
At P.S. 182, classes are grouped according to competency in reading. Teachers say that such ''tracking'' allows them to focus their lessons to a discrete audience. ''It's very hard to individualize 28 reading levels,'' says Sheila Rubin, who teaches the top second-grade class.
 
A Welcome Atmosphere
More basic still, the school is orderly and quiet, and its floors and yellow-and-gold tiled walls have a welcoming shine. A colorful sign near the entrance tells visitors, ''A Teacher Affects Eternity.'' The school is small - only 580 children from kindergarten through fourth grade - and Mrs. LoCascio knows almost every child and much about their families.
''When I walk into the building every day,'' she said, tears welling in her eyes, ''I say, 'God, how wonderful it is.' Being a principal or teacher right now is a very hard job. It really is. But I love it.''
There are some anomalous fluctuations in school reading scores from year to year, but Mrs. LoCascio, who has worked in New York City schools since 1957, feels her school's progress is genuine. She worries that the school's rankings next year may not be as high as this year's. The after-school tutoring program has been cut back to two days from five each week because it did not receive the same grant it did last year.
 
Coaching of Pupils Defended
Although some educators criticize schools that spend class time preparing children for the reading test, Mrs. LoCascio and some of her teachers disagree. Such coaching, Ms. Rubin said, still offers children skills they need to read.
Mrs. LoCascio's husband, Vincent, is a principal in an adjoining Bronx district, and his school ranked 423d, with only 37.6 percent of its children reading at or above grade level.
But Mrs. LoCascio thinks there's a broad lesson to be learned in the disparity between the schools that may explain why other schools do not make as much progress as hers. Her husband's school is badly overcrowded, with 1,600 children in a building meant for 1,000.
''He tells me I run a country-club school,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Education;
Great Expectations Hobble Black Superintendents

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
When summer returns to the oak-shaded streets of Jackson, Miss., Benjamin O. Canada hopes to be settling into his job as Superintendent of that city's public schools.
As the newly named chief of Mississippi's largest school district, he will face a formidable challenge: the education of 33,000 students, 78 percent of whom are black and disproportionately threatened by drug and alcohol abuse, teen-age pregnancy and economic disadvantage.
But Dr. Canada and his administration may face a more insidious set of problems as well. He is Jackson's first black Superintendent.
For the last 20 years, blacks have made significant gains in securing superintendent positions across the United States. At the same time, many have also seen their tenures grow troubled and end prematurely. 
In many instances, black superintendents, who make up about 3 percent of the nation's superintendents, seem to have become lightning rods for all that is wrong in urban public schools. They usually preside over schools that have crumbling walls and tax bases and are producing too many high school graduates who read at only grade-school levels.
And they increasingly find themselves under fire. Sought after most often by school districts in ruin, yet held to what they see as a higher standard than their white predecessors, they face double-edged criticism, from whites who raise questions about their authority and from blacks who are impatient for radical improvements.
''There is a double standard at play,'' said Charles D. Moody Sr., vice provost at the University of Michigan and founder of the National Alliance of Black School Educators. ''There is a conflict in expectations. The black superintendent is expected to be able to do more with less, and undo overnight years and years of things.''
 
Expecting and Demanding More
It is a double standard, many black superintendents note, that is held not just by whites but also by black constituents, who tend to look to the black superintendent as miracle worker.
''Blacks expect more and demand more,'' said Hugh J. Scott, dean for programs in education at Hunter College in New York City and author of the 1980 book ''The Black Superintendent: Messiah or Scapegoat?''
On Feb. 13, the Boston school board voted to dismiss the district's Superintendent, Laval S. Wilson, whose contract was to expire in June 1991. Dr. Wilson accepted a $260,000 buyout of his contract on March 13, said the board president, Daniel R. Burke.
About eight weeks before the Boston board's action, the six white members of the 11-member school board in Selma, Ala., voted not to renew the contract of its school superintendent, Norward Roussell. The contract expires in June.
The two dismissals drew national attention to the problems of black superintendents, especially those in racially mixed districts. They also renewed racial tensions in Boston and Selma, stirring allegations of racism by frustrated black parents and students.
 
Clashes Over Management
School officials said race had played no part in either dismissal; disagreements between the superintendents and their boards over management styles were cited instead.
''The basis for the renegotiation, buying out Dr. Wilson's contract, had no basis in race whatsoever,'' Mr. Burke said. ''It became an issue for some people both in the community and in the school department.''
Mr. Burke said Dr. Wilson was dismissed because the board and the district's needs had changed. He said times required a more decentralized leadership, something that Mr. Burke said was antithetical to Dr. Wilson's style.
Whether leadership or race was the ultimate issue in Dr. Wilson's case, educators and civil rights leaders maintain that race often adversely affects the relationships between black superintendents and the boards, teachers, parents and students with whom they must work.
''Being a superintendent is a tough job anywhere in the country today,'' regardless of color or race, said Milton Bins, deputy director of the Council of Great City Schools, a Washington-based education advocacy group. ''It's one of the most pressurized of situations.'' But when blacks assume the top posts, he said, ''all of a sudden they are expected to be the great deliverer.''
 
When a Black Is Sought
Complicating the issue, Mr. Bins added, is the tendency for blacks to be sought by school systems gripped by crisis or teetering on its edge. Education experts and former black superintendents say blacks are not usually seriously considered for a top post in education unless the district's student body is predominantly black or Hispanic. They also say a black superintendent is more likely to be hired by a district where students' achievement scores are faltering badly and financial resources are eroding.
Some notable exceptions have been Kenneth Burnley in Fairbanks, Alaska; Matthew Prophet in Portland, Ore.; Percy Clark in Lawrence Township, Ind.; and the late Richard R. Green, who headed the public schools in Minneapolis for eight years before he briefly took charge of the New York City school system, the largest in the country, in 1988.
Dr. Moody, who conducted surveys in 1970 and 1985, said the number of black superintendents rose to 125, from 16, among the country's 16,000 school districts in those 15 years.
Hispanic superintendents are also rare; 97 percent of the country's superintendents are white, according to a 1988 study by the Washington-based Center for Education Information.
Dr. Moody found in 1985 that 78 percent of black superintendents were in their first superintendency. He found, too, that 80 percent of them worked in districts where the majority of students were non-white and that most of those districts were overseen by predominantly non-white boards.
But Dr. Scott of Hunter College said a black superintendent who answers to a majority black board could no more count on solid support than could a white superintendent who must answer to a white-controlled board. Further, he said, the administrative staff and middle managers whom the black superintendent inherits are usually white and sometimes resistant to the new superintendent's authority.
 
Tough for a Trailblazer
Mr. Bins of the Council on Great City Schools said blacks in positions of high leadership, like superintendents, generally found themselves confronting racially based scrutiny, one way or the other. He said this occurred partly because blacks were still relatively new to such roles and often the first to hold such jobs in their districts.
''The first black anywhere catches hell,'' said Dr. Scott, who was Washington's first black Superintendent, serving from 1970 to 1973. ''The expectations for Richard Green were enormous.''
''You have to convince them that you are going to turn around the system without tearing it up and doing them in,'' Dr. Scott said of whites who may be leery of blacks' motives and abilities. ''At the same time you have to be a solid educator. I'm not so certain that there are enough people who combine all those skills to make it.''
The black superintendents in Boston and Selma were each the city's first.
 
Difference in Atlanta
''My situation is different,'' said Jerome Harris, a black who is Superintendent in Atlanta, whose school and political leadership is mostly black. ''We are educationally bankrupt. I have to make change, and change is painful.''
Critics of Dr. Harris, a former community district superintendent in Brooklyn, say he has moved too forcefully in making policy and personnel changes, upsetting local blacks who are trying to retain their school jobs, the jobs of friends and the way things have been done in Atlanta schools for years.
Yet Dr. Harris, who has been Superintendent for almost two years, said he did not plan to alter his approach, because he was trying to make teachers and administrators forge a more emotional attachment to their jobs and to the students.
''They come to work with a job,'' he said. ''I come to the job with a mission.''
Dr. Roussell, the Superintendent leaving in Selma, said he, too, particularly wanted to improve the educational effort shown to black students by the school system, in which they are in a vast majority.
''In the predominantly white schools the facilities were better and better maintained,'' Dr. Roussell said, noting that many of those schools had computer laboratories while no predominantly black schools did. ''In the predominantly black schools there was furniture that was 30 to 35 years old, maps way outdated and books in short supply.''
Almost immediately, Dr. Roussell said, he began challenging these inequities. One of his most controversial moves included making college preparatory courses more available to blacks. He said he believed that black students were being unfairly denied entry into the schools' advanced-study programs.
''I don't think kids ought to be educated for obsolescence,'' Dr. Roussell said. ''So anything that did not give young people a challenge to further their development, I tried to deal with that.''
''It cost me my job,'' he said, because many whites believed that the change threatened to dilute a privilege their children were enjoying.
Jamie Wallace, the executive vice president of the Selma-Dallas County Chamber of Commerce, disagreed. A close observer of the situation that led to the board's refusal to renew Dr. Roussell's contract, Mr. Wallace said the Superintendent's style of management ''was not agreeable with the majority of the board.'' He said it was ''unfortunate'' that people viewed the dispute as racially motivated.
 
Evidence of a Pattern
Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy at George Washington University in Washington, said the resistance that black superintendents faced was part of a historic pattern. When blacks assume non-traditional jobs, he said, the few who make the early breakthroughs usually clear the way for new generations of blacks who find greater acceptance.
Dr. Levitan said the history of black elected officials provided an excellent example. David N. Dinkins as Mayor of New York and L. Douglas Wilder as Governor of Virginia were both placed in office by predominantly non-black electorates, whereas black public officials in the past were usually elected by black majorities.
''It's too early to judge,'' Dr. Levitan said, ''but maybe we are finally divesting ourselves of racial prejudice and are judging people on the basis of ability.''
Dr. Canada, who will take over in Jackson this summer, hopes so.
''I'm saying up front that I'm coming in as a Superintendent, not as a black Superintendent,'' said Dr. Canada, who is leaving a predominantly white district in Tucson, Ariz., where he was a Deputy Superintendent. ''It is up to the community to give me the same opportunities it would give anyone.''

HEADLINE: Fleurian Beats Fog-Bound Becker

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY BISCAYNE, Fla., March 20

 BODY:
While Boris Becker gave too convincing an imitation of a noontime somnambulist, Jean Fleurian, an eccentric Parisian wearing his last pair of sneakers and shorts too new, too large and held up by a safety pin, was wide awake.
So fearful was he of being stuck in the stomach by the pin, said Fleurian, who played the match with a plane ticket back to Paris in his pocket, that he kept his body language to a minimum and stuck to economical winners.
Because he also was afraid of ''waking up'' his opponent, Fleurian relied on passing shots that allowed the No. 2 player in the world to remain in his own private haze. The histrionics that prompted his Davis Cup teammates to label Fleurian a Rambo earlier this year were curtailed for a day in order to help Becker doze. 
 
'Completely Different'
''He was a completely different player today, very slow to react, and that was my chance,'' Fleurian said of his unanticipated straight-set upset at the Lipton Championships today. ''I knew I could do something and I knew it was the day to do it.''
Becker's inattention to what turned out to be a tiger of an opponent produced a 7-6, 6-1 victory for the 24-year-old Fleurian, whose career hit a crescendo in the second set, revealing the West German in his poorest performance against an underdog in nearly two years.
As he had two weeks ago after a straight-set loss to Andre Agassi in the semifinals at Indian Wells, Calif., the 22-year-old Becker blamed his demise on an inadequate supply of concentration. Along with blistered toes and an aching back, Becker has been bothered by a chronic acquiescence to distraction. When he ought to be applying tunnel vision to his game, his mind is meandering, especially if his ferocious cannonball serve happens to be sputtering.
Like a sleepwalker, Becker had strolled onto the court for the completion of his fourth-round match with the unheralded Fleurian, a match twice interrupted by rain on Monday. The match resumed today with Becker up by 3-1 in the first set, but when he came back to complete it, he did so minus a sound strategy or the desire to officially wrestle away Ivan Lendl's No. 1 computer ranking.
 
An Absent Mind
''My mind was not really on the court,'' said Becker, who didn't bother to hide the fact that the loss had stunned him. ''It was, I don't know where, and I have to find it sometime this day. Am I disappointed? Yes.''
Becker, who took a wild card into this tournament at the last minute last week after deciding not to play in the Davis Cup for West Germany, had been in typical form when the match began on Monday. Fleurian admitted he was outclassed and, after canceling his Monday night flight when the match was left unfinished, promptly booked the same flight for tonight because he was so certain his career-high ranking of 46 didn't pose a threat to Becker.
But from the start today, Fleurian noticed the blank look on Becker's face and the holes in his game. Becker held four set points in the first set and fumbled them all, committing an emblematic double-fault on the fourth, then falling, 7 points to 3, in the tie breaker to the revitalized Frenchman.
''After the first set, where I had many chances, he started to tee off almost immediately,'' Becker said. ''Everything went in. He didn't give me any chance to come back.''
 
Gimpy Becker Serves
Fleurian cranked out winners on every gimpy serve sent his way, and after breaking Becker and holding serve with a forehand winner, he claimed a 3-1 advantage in the second set. He then broke Becker again in the fifth game when, after the West German fought his way to deuce, Fleurian followed a sprawling backhand volley winner with a blistering forehand return on a serve that by all rights was a winner itself.
Fleurian, a sun worshiper who spent the last five years tuning his game and a tan in Florida, held serve for 5-1 and then broke Becker for the match, assisted by another double-fault and a backhand that veered out of bounds after the befuddled West German mislaunched it.
''I am the sort of player who goes through stages in a year, and right now I have a low,'' said Becker. He said he could live with his valley of a performance here, where he briefly reigned as the second seeded player, so long as he peaks in time for the French Open and Wimbledon.
''That's basically the bottom line,'' Becker said of his penchant for reserving his nonpareil play for the Grand Slam tournaments.

HEADLINE: New Generations Bring New Vision To Food Business

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
THE food business in America came of age over the last decade. In some families involved in the industry, members of a younger generation were also coming of age. Today many of them are in charge.
These sons and daughters, members of a second and, sometimes, a third generation in a family food or wine business, are often innovators, introducing new products, creating new images and cultivating new markets. They want to make their mark, but they also have enormous respect for their parents' and grandparents' accomplishments and the traditions the businesses represent.
The current social and gastronomic attitude that has given prestige to being a chef, a meat purveyor or a baker has made it exciting for the younger generation to work in their parents' food businesses. The children or grandchildren are frequently college educated and well traveled, unlike the older generation, which was often forced to go right to work because of economic necessity. 
In 1975, Seth Greenberg began working full time at William Greenberg Jr. Desserts, Inc., the retail pastry company his father, now 65 years old, started in 1946 in Manhattan. He was also attending New York University at night, but left after three years. ''The hands-on experience of working in the business became more relevant than studying it in school,'' the son said.
The company, which has several stores, is best known for its simple but rich chocolate cake, butter cookies and sticky buns. The son, now 32, said he has earned the respect of employees and customers for innovations like computerization, expanded mail-order business and cholesterol-free cakes. ''I'm no longer regarded simply as my father's son,'' he said. He also does about half the cake decorating, formerly his father's exclusive domain. Customers usually do not know the difference.
In Cambridge, Mass., Ronnie Savenor, 32, and his brother, Alan, 40, have been running Savenor's, the 60-year-old butcher shop and market that is best known as the place where Julia Child shops, since their father, Jack, retired four years ago. ''It was a trauma to turn it over to them, but I'm happy they're doing it with such style,'' their father said.
Last summer the shop, now in its third generation of Savenors, was completely remodeled and the emblem changed with the legend ''The Culinary Edge'' added. ''We decided the place needed to be brightened up,'' said Ronnie Savenor.
The brothers also placed more emphasis on the fish counter, relocating it more prominently. ''My dad was less interested in fish, and it's very important today,'' he said. He said the market would still offer traditional, personalized service. ''I could have done anything with my life, but I was given a gift horse and I'm lucky I enjoy what I do,'' he said.
Abram Orwasher was practicing law five years ago when he joined the 74-year-old bread bakery started by his grandfather, Abraham, and run by his father, Louis, now in his 70's, on New York's Upper East Side.
''This business and its reputation for quality means a lot to our family and I want to see it have a future,'' the 39-year-old son said. ''Fortunately there is a demand for quality today.'' Abram Orwasher has introduced some new products, like muffins and pumpkin and cranberry breads for Thanksgiving, and is thinking about expanding. ''I've done some automation on the business side, but today the real challenge is to keep the traditional side going, not to modernize the brick ovens. Someone who is not a member of the family may not understand that.''
Longstanding family food businesses like these are commonplace in Europe. There are fewer of them in America because the second generation is often still in diapers. In the instances where the children have grown up in the business and finally chosen it as a career, they have usually come with a broader perspective.
In 1974, after his father, Joe Czarnecky, now 79, suffered a heart attack, Jack Czarnecky, who had a degree in bacteriology from the University of California at Davis, came back to Joe's, the family restaurant founded in 1916 in Reading, Pa., to help out.
''I never thought I'd wind up in this business,'' he said. ''My dad would have had to sell the restaurant if I had not come back. But I'm here because this is where I want to be.''
The younger Mr. Czarnecky, 39, with his wife, Heidi, changed the focus of the restaurant, which has long been famous for serving exotic mushrooms in dozens of preparations, from continental to American. He added an extensive list of American wines and gained a nationwide reputation with his cookbook, ''Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery'' (Atheneum, 1986).
''He's taken it way beyond what we could ever do,'' his father, Joe, said. ''He has the same philosophy, the respect for quality, but his vision is greater.''
Five years ago when N. Lee Comisar retired, his sons Marc and Michael E. Comisar, now both in their late 30's, began running Maisonette the premier French restaurant in Cincinatti. It was founded by their grandparents in 1949.
The sons, who acquired experience on the West Coast and in Europe, keep trying new menu items, have modernized the color scheme from red and lime green to salmon pink and are aggressively pursuing clients for business functions.
Transitions like this one can be made smoothly with years of planning, sometimes circumstances make them more abrupt and the changes seem even more dramatic.
When Joyce Chen, 73, who pioneered cookware products like polyethylene cutting slabs and owned a northern Chinese restaurant in Cambridge, began suffering from Alzheimer's disease and had to retire three years ago, her children, Helen, 43, Henry, 44, and Stephen, 47, took over the business, the Joyce Chen companies, which their mother founded in 1958. Not only have they have added a second Chinese restaurant in Boston, Joyce Chen's Cityplace, expanded the mail-order business, and hired a publicist, they have introduced new cookware and prepared foods, some of which their mother might not have endorsed.
''I began looking at what the market wanted, not just what pleased me, the way my mother did,'' her daughter said. She has added a wok with a nonstick coating to the cookware line. ''My mother did not believe the traditional wok, which had to be seasoned and stabilized on a ring, was suitable for American kitchens,'' she said.
Mrs. Chen sold what she called a Peking pan, a deep skillet with sloping sides. ''But the stores that carried the Joyce Chen line were selling other people's woks so it seemed silly,'' Helen Chen said.
''People sometimes call me Joyce,'' she added, ''but it doesn't bother me because I'm doing my own thing as well.''
Joy Sterling, 36, who left a successful career as assignment manager for ABC News in Los Angeles five years ago, is now in charge of sales and marketing for Iron Horse Vineyards in Sonoma County, Calif., the highly respected winery her parents founded.
''When you join a family business, the outside world looks upon it by saying, 'Isn't that cute; she's obviously retarded and her parents gave her a job,' or they think you've been handed life on a silver spoon,'' she said. ''I had to know that I could work for strangers, but I finally decided I wanted a different life, so I came back to the winery.''
She sees her joining the business ''as a validation of what my parents did when they bought Iron Horse Vineyards in 1974,'' Ms. Sterling said. ''It proves that it's more than a hobby and it won't end. Now it's up to me to make sure that Iron Horse will continue to be enticing and economically viable for the next generation.''

HEADLINE: Banks Balk at Costs of Japan

SERIES: Struggling in Japan: U.S. Companies That Pull Back - First of two articles.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 20

 BODY:
United States trade negotiators have been hammering away for years to open Japanese markets, yet many American companies, even giants like Citibank, the nation's largest bank, find Japan a daunting challenge. They have discovered that the real problem is not so much governmental or cultural barriers, but that doing business here is too costly and competitive to justify a major effort.
Several American companies have recently been selling operations in Japan, because of the enormous prices an established company can command, or they are scaling back because the competition is so fierce. Still others, unable to crack the market by themselves, are forming alliances with Japanese companies.
The sobering experience of American commercial banks in Japan provides a vivid illustration. Tokyo has eased restrictions on foreign banks operating here in the last couple of years, yet there has been no real payoff for American banks. Citibank is alone in trying to establish a beachhead in Japan's large consumer banking market. But even it is straining because of the enormous cost of building a business. Japan Banks Surge in U.S. Indeed, most American banks have been cutting back in Japan even as Japanese banks have made large acquisitions in the United States and are aggressively expanding in the American market. 
The Japanese are better able to afford costly expansion at home and abroad mainly because the value of their shares and other assets have soared in the last decade along with the stock and real estate markets in Tokyo. In addition, those assets are worth more in terms of the dollar, because the yen has strengthened considerably since 1985.
Japanese-owned banks now control more than a quarter of California's rich banking market and are amply represented in other big American urban centers. In contrast, all of the 82 foreign banks operating in Japan make just 1.66 percent of the loans, a rate that has declined for two years.
American banks have been forced to write off billions of dollars for bad loans to third-world countries and domestic real estate developers, leaving them short of capital and much less willing to make big investments that do not produce quick returns.
The Chase Manhattan Bank has slashed its Japanese loan portfolio to about $200 million, from some $4 billion several years ago, and has closed a branch. Chemical Bank is focusing on businesses that require little capital and little risk, like acting as a foreign-exchange broker for clients. The Bank of America, which has been in Japan for decades, plans to move its Asian headquarters to Hong Kong next month because of the very high cost of doing business in Japan.
 
'Who Can Afford It?'
''It is very, very hard here for a foreign bank to make a buck, and it is getting even harder,'' said M. L. Greenberg, head of Asian operations for the Bank of America. ''No American bank owns even a part of a Japanese bank, but who can afford it?''
Even an American powerhouse like Citicorp, the holding company for Citibank, is far smaller than the Japanese giants that dominate this market. It has scaled back its expectations as it has adopted a new strategy to crack the retail market. Yet it is sticking with its effort because it is the only United States banking company committed to building a worldwide consumer business.
Because of Japanese resistance and, more important, the extraordinary price it would have to pay, Citibank has abandoned efforts to acquire a Japanese bank with a branch system.
 
Very High Prices
Since Japan's stock prices soared in the 1980's, banks here sell for as much as 60 times their earnings - five to six times the price an American institution would command. And the high prices act as another barrier to entry by foreigners.
''If you look at the economics of a bank acquisition in this country, it just cannot be justified,'' said Masamoto Yashiro, head of Citibank's consumer banking operations here since January 1989. ''An acquisition becomes attractive only if prices are not out of this world - but they are.''
Just a few years ago, Citibank tried to buy an ailing Japanese institution, the Heiwa Sogo Bank, for its extensive branch system. After they were outbid by Sumitomo Bank, some Citibank executives complained that Japanese bankers would not permit the acquisition of a Japanese bank by an American company. But Mr. Yashiro conceded that the issue was less one of outright barriers than of price.
More recently, John S. Reed, the chairman of Citibank, said it would be willing to acquire branches that might be sold off by Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank, which plan to merge next month. But it seems unlikely that any operations will be sold, at least not at a price Citibank would find acceptable.
 
Expensive Plan to Expand
Instead, Citibank has opted to build a network branch by branch and brick by brick. At its current rate of growth - by four or five new branches a year - it will take nearly five years for the bank's Japanese retail system to match its presence in Hong Kong, a market only one twenty-fourth as big.
''It's quite a difficult strategy because of the overhead you have to take on,'' said James E. Russell, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. In Japan, he explained, the market requires a network of branches staffed with bank tellers, whereas in the United States most customers are accustomed to dealing with the more efficient automatic teller machines.
Citibank began to reassess its retail strategy in Japan when Mr. Yashiro joined it after a career as a marketing executive with Exxon, from which he had retired at age 60. He was given a mandate to analyze Japan's consumer banking market and figure out how Citibank might penetrate it. He recalled that he did not need to spend a lot of time at the task before a realization came to him.
''The answer was clear,'' he said. ''With the kind of crazy multiples we would have to pay to make an acquisition, there's no way we could make it work.
''Corporations hardly need banks any longer in Japan, and the competition in retail banking is heating up.''
 
Old Customs and Work Rules
A key problem was not just the cost of rent, which is astronomical in Tokyo, but what Mr. Yashiro described as the unusually high cost of staff and a number of inefficiencies built into the system by old customs and work rules.
''Japanese manufacturing is supposed to be so efficient, but when it comes to the actual involvement of people, it becomes terribly inefficient,'' Mr. Yashiro complained. ''Every time people touch something in this country, it becomes very expensive.''
As a result, he said, Citibank had to lower its sights considerably or risk throwing money away. ''We have to start off as a niche player,'' Mr. Yashiro explained.
What that means in practice is that Citibank will not move quickly to add to its nine retail branches in Japan. At its deliberate pace of expansion, it will not start to reap economies of scale and any big increases in profits until 1995, Mr. Yashiro said.
Citibank's consumer business here includes the retail branch system, a credit card operation that issues Visa and a card affiliated with Mastercard, and a consumer finance operation.
 
Shying Away From Lending
Leery of the narrow margins and high borrowing costs faced by foreign banks here, Citibank is not emphasizing loans, a staple of Japanese retail banks. Instead, it will merely try to offer services for which it can charge high fees and take deposits, which are classified as liabilities since they involve, in effect, a loan to the bank.
''We've been focusing on the liability side because lending is a cutthroat business in Japan,'' Mr. Yashiro acknowledged. ''It's just too competitive.''
The bank's principal consumer product is a multi-currency account that permits the holder to move money easily from one currency to another and to make remittances overseas. The popularity of the account is a tribute to the worldwide business dealings of the Japanese, the frequency of their overseas travel, and the education of young Japanese in foreign countries.
 
Impasse Over Teller Network
One of the few real roadblocks Citibank ran into came when it tried to join a huge network connecting the automatic teller machines of the big Japanese banks. Citibank was in an unusual position to benefit from acceptance in the network; it would bring just 20 automated machines to the system, but its customers would instantly have access to about 18,000 machines at the Japanese banks.
For four years, the talks went nowhere. Citibank never received a flat no; the talks just ambled in no particular direction.
''I must admit, there is a frustrating side to this country,'' Mr. Yashiro said. ''Sometimes you don't even know what the problem is, it's so amorphous.''
But that logjam was recently broken. Mr. Yashiro says that there has been progress and that the Japanese banks have been cooperative and receptive to Citibank's efforts. The American bank may be plugged into the system early next year, he said.
That would be a coup, but how much it alters the fundamental economics of this difficult market remains to be seen. ''The fact is, progress is going to be slow,'' Mr. Yashiro said.
 
Next: Selling out and going home.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Japan's Yen Strategy May Weaken Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
When a country has two problems, sometimes it must choose to fight only one of them.
Japan yesterday sought to support its falling yen by once again pushing up interest rates, and in the process it may have made its plunging stock market even more vulnerable to further declines.
''The Japanese stock market has never been more at risk than it is now,'' said George Noble, manager of the Fidelity Overseas Fund, which has reduced its holdings of Japanese stocks since late last year.
That growing bearishness comes as Japan, whose stock market led the way up for most of the 1980's, plunged again. The Nikkei 225, down 1.5 percent yesterday, has dropped 21 percent this year, before adjusting for currency fluctuations. In dollar terms, the index is down 26 percent. 
By pushing up interest rates, the Japanese Government hopes to stem the slide of the yen, which has been the weakest of the world's leading currencies for most of the last year. But even bigger rate increases may be needed, since the latest Japanese move only partly catches up with rate rises in West Germany, whose currency has been the strongest. Despite the Japanese move, the dollar rose 1.15 yen yesterday, to 154.20.
For years, Japanese stocks have looked expensive relative to stocks in Europe or America, measured by traditional indicators like price-earnings ratios or their dividend yields. For most of that time the Japanese kept buying their own stocks, and prices kept rising.
But the key fact about recent interest-rate rises is that they have made Japanese share prices overvalued by traditional Japanese measurements as well. Charles Elliott, a Goldman, Sachs analyst in Tokyo, noted that in 1984, the last time Japanese long-term bond rates were around 7 percent, as they are now, the stock market traded at less than 30 times earnings. Even with the latest falls, the current prices are about 50 times profits.
 
Higher Yields in Bonds
Looked at another way, yields on Japanese long-term bonds are close to 13 times higher than the dividend yield on the typical Japanese stock. At the peak of that ratio a few weeks ago, the figure was 14. The only other time that ratio climbed to 13 was a few weeks before the 1987 crash, Mr. Noble of Fidelity noted. After the 1987 crash, as interest rates fell sharply around the world, the ratio fell to as low as 7.
The fall of the yen has been brought on by a series of problems that include the fact that interest rates rose faster in Germany than in Japan, making German investments more attractive. But Japan is also facing the fact that money may not continue to roll in as it has. In January, for the first time since 1982, Japan reported a current-account deficit. The current account includes trade, but also ''invisibles,'' like the money that Japanese tourists spend overseas.
The deficit was widely deemed to be a fluke, and there was a surplus after making seasonal adjustments. But the trend is unmistakeable: the Japanese trade surplus has been falling everywhere. The United States reported yesterday that its trade deficit with Japan fell to $2.9 billion in January, the lowest monthly figure since 1984.
 
Reversal of Trends
A few years ago, the Japanese stock market took off under the benevolent conditions of the ''triple merits'' - falling oil prices, falling interest rates and a rising yen. Now the talk is of ''triple demerits,'' with all those trends running the wrong way for Japan.
The result is that in the Japanese blue chips represented by the Nikkei 225, prices have fallen to the levels of early 1989. Adjusted for the effect of the rising dollar, the Japanese stock market is now at its lowest level since early 1988.
On the Japanese stock market through the 1980's, any weakness was a buying opportunity. But so far this year, the Japanese have instead shown a new willingness to buy assets and stocks in other countries that looked cheap by Japanese standards.
Until the last few days, advocates of Japanese stocks could reassure themselves that the recent weakness was largely a blue-chip affair. The average of the Tokyo stock exchange's second section, generally smaller stocks with shorter histories, managed to rise in both January and February, while the larger stocks were falling. But in the last week, that index, too, has begun to sag, down 4.6 percent since Friday, almost as much as the 5.5 percent fall in the Nikkei 225.
For now, it appears that buying interest in Tokyo is not likely to be rekindled until both the yen and Japanese interest rates stabilize. Neither looks to be on the immediate horizon.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up By 0.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed five-tenths of 1 percent last month as a surge in the cost of clothing more than offset a record decline in the price of fuel oil, the Labor Department said today.
The February increase, though less than half as large as January's 1.1 percent jump, was nevertheless more than most analysts expected and prompted some to assert that the Federal Reserve would have to consider tightening credit when its main policy-making body meets next Tuesday to plot the nation's monetary course for the following seven weeks.
''The Fed is getting behind the eight ball on inflation,'' said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at Carroll, McEntee & McGinley Inc. ''It's creeping higher.''
 
Hopes for Lower Rates Dim
For much of the fall and winter the expectation was that the Fed's next move would be to trim interest rates to head off a possible recession. But in recent weeks these hopes have been gradually abandoned as the economy seemed to be rebounding from a very sluggish fourth quarter in which growth dwindled to a rate of less than 1 percent. 
The concern about inflation raised by the price report led to an early-morning selloff in stocks and bonds. But the stock market then seesawed through the rest of the day before ending lower, while bond prices quickly turned up as talk about big Japanese purchases began to develop. [Pages D8 and D17.] At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said: ''We must remain vigilant against any increase in inflation. But the inflation level has been relatively steady for some time in spite of the weather-related and energy-related surges. Over all, we continue to believe that inflation is low and under control.''
Still, a close examination of today's price data left room for doubt that fresh anti-inflation measures are required. The jump in clothing prices, which the Government attributed largely to early introduction of spring lines, by itself accounted for 42 percent of the overall increase in the Consumer Price Index and some of this reflected a change in the way the numbers are collected. Without clothing, the rise would have been the expected three-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Fuel Prices Off Sharply
After sharp increases in December and January, fuel oil prices tumbled 19 percent in February with the onset of warmer-than-usual weather. The decline was the largest one-month drop since 1935, when the Government first began tracking the price.
Patrick C. Jackman, a senior Department official, suggested that more moderate increases lie ahead because the prices of some goods that have been rising rapidly, including gasoline and tomatoes, have already turned down.
''There doesn't appear to be much that is going to hurt us'' when the C.P.I. for March is reported next month, he said.
Some analysts noted that prices received by producers of finished goods were reported last Friday to have been unchanged for February and that prices for goods at the intermediate stage of production had declined.
Prices at the producer level tend to flow through eventually to consumers but with various time lags. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the producer indexes do not include services.
 
Apparel Up 3.3%
The rise in the February Consumer Price Index was dominated by a 3.3 percent surge in the apparel and upkeep category, the biggest on a seasonally adjusted basis since records began to be kept in 1947. The Department attributed this to exceptionally early introductions of new spring and summer clothing lines with women's and girls' apparel up 5 percent and infants' and toddlers' apparel up more than 10 percent.
Besides the early warm-weather lines, the jump in this component of the Consumer Price Index - accounting for about 6 percent of the total index - also reflected the department's reversion to its pre-1987 practice of immediately reporting the price impact of new lines rather than spreading it over more than one month.
Mr. Jackman said that the phasing-in process of the last few years meant that some clothing was being discounted before original prices could be reported.
Apparel and medical care, which rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, were the only big categories to show more rapid inflation last month than in January. Food, housing, transportation, entertainment and ''other'' goods and services rose more slowly in price.
The Consumer Price Index climbed by the same five-tenths of 1 percent when its volatile food and energy items are excluded, about the same pace as in December and January. Over all, commodities climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, and services rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Food prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent following a 1.8 percent burst in January, with tomatoes soaring another 30 percent after doubling in January, and beef, pork, poultry and seafood all rising substantially. Egg prices, however, dropped 9 percent after rising 15 percent during the preceding three months, while fruits and vegetables rose only 1 percent after a 10 percent January surge.
Housing prices, which account for 42 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in February as household fuels and other utilities eased six-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Higher Cost of Cable TV
The cost of cable television continued to rise sharply, with a 1.8 percent rise bringing the three-month total to 4.8 percent.
In transportation, where prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, motor fuels rose scarcely at all while new cars, used cars and finance charges all declined. Insurance and public transportation, the latter mainly because of a 2.5 percent increase in airline fares, both posted large increases.
''Inflation concerns are still around and they should still be on the mind of the Federal Reserve,'' said Michael P. Daly, an economist for the Cigna Corporation. ''It's not abating - but it's not accelerating either.''
Among the five major metropolitan areas for which price information is collected monthly, the least inflation was a one-tenth of 1 percent increase for New York, where apparel data were not included because of the timing of the survey, while the worse was a 1.1 percent increase for Los Angeles. The rise for Chicago was nine-tenths; for Philadelphia, eight-tenths, and for San Francisco, five-tenths.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widened by Oil Imports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The trade deficit widened to $9.3 billion in January as oil imports surged to refill stocks depleted during December's record cold, the Commerce Department reported today. In December, the trade deficit totaled a revised $7.7 billion.
Exports were also higher, climbing 4 percent above December to an all-time high of $32.1 billion. But the increase in both the volume of oil imports and their price once again pointed up an ominous dependence on foreign oil. Many economists believe that dependence will only increase as the decade progresses, further intensifying trade pressures. 
Imports of petroleum products totaled $5.9 billion, which was $1.8 billion greater than in December.
 
Monthly Oil Record
The volume of imported oil, at 291 million barrels, set a monthly record, topping a previous high set only last August. The average price per barrel of oil in January was $20.13, or $2.16 higher than the December average.
The gain in exports, while broad-based, was particularly robust in the capital goods sector. But it was overwhelmed by a 7.3 percent rise in imports, to $41.3 billion, most of which was accounted for by oil, the trade report showed.
''Our long-term trade outlook is relatively pessimistic,'' said Brian R. Horrigan, director of long-term forecasting for the WEFA Group of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., ''because we expect increasing oil dependency on a permanent basis.''
The American Petroleum Institute has reported that foreign oil accounted for a record 54 percent of consumption in January, as domestic production fell to its lowest level in a quarter century.
Still, many economists said, the unusually warm weather after December could buy some short-term improvement in the trade accounts in coming months. Oil companies have had less of a need to replenish inventories, and prices have tended to weaken since December.
The White House and Administration officials voiced little concern at the January deterioration, especially because it followed a dramatic improvement in December, when the trade imbalance was the lowest in five years, even when revised slightly upward to $7.7 billion, from $7.5 billion. ''Everyone seemed to realize they couldn't maintain that low level, and it was expected there would be an increase in January,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
 
Fluctuations Cited
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said he was ''encouraged'' by the record exports, but noted that the data are subject to wide monthly fluctuations and that totals over longer periods should be used to understand fundamental trends.
In contrast to the experience with most other countries, the deficit with Japan fell in January. Much of the improvement reflected weakness in the American automobile market, which led to a decline in automobile imports from Japan.
From $3.5 billion in December, the deficit with Japan, still the largest with any country, shrank to $2.9 billion, the lowest in five years. Annualized, the $2.9 billion would mean $34 billion, compared with the $49 billion deficit in Japanese trade that the United States chalked up in 1989.
 
'The Right Direction'
''Clearly the deficit with Japan is going in the right direction,'' said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, in an interview. She faces a series of negotiating deadlines in coming weeks over efforts to pry open the Japanese markets for more American wood products, satellites, supercomputers and other exports.
To David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, the decline in the Japanese deficit, which came despite a strengthening of the dollar versus the yen, ''suggests that we're still competitive in the world market and can hold our own.''
While the deficit fell with Japan, it rose with most other countries, including the European Community and such newly industrialized areas as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.
With Taiwan, the deficit topped $1 billion, the second highest after Japan. With all developing countries, the deficit doubled to $5.9 billion, from $2.9 billion.
 
Doubling for China Deficit
Practically doubling was the deficit with China, which jumped to $841 million in January, from $498 million in December.
While oil was the main factor behind the higher trade deficit, the high propensity of the nation to consume imports affected all manufactured goods. Manufactured imports totaled $30.4 billion, up $400 million from December.
Among categories of manufactured goods, clothing and footwear, organic and inorganic chemicals, iron and steel mill products and specialized industrial machinery showed the most striking gains.
Imports of clothing were up 31 percent, to $3.1 billion, and are likely to add fuel to what is expected to be a renewed effort by the domestic textile industry to seek protection from Congress.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
An Old Trade Idea Wins New Favor

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
THE latest round of trade negotiations between the United States and Japan is provoking rancor but few results. The Japanese have charged that America does not invest enough in education and research and development, while the United States contends that Japan's distribution network remains closed.
Although there may be elements of truth in the charges of both sides, they remain outside the realm of the talks, which are supposed to focus on the reported discrimination against American exports to Japan of satellites, forest products, telecommunications equipment and supercomputers.
Some policy makers and critics - discouraged by the slow pace of negotiations and America's big annual deficits - have begun to voice new support for an old idea. Articles have appeared in academic journals, including the Harvard Business Review, and the ideas have been discussed by some Congressional staff members. 
''We need more than short-term bilateral talks on trade,'' said Walter Russell Mead, an economist and author who completed a study of the postwar international economic system published in the summer and winter issues of World Policy Journal. ''We need a reform of the postwar international economic system so that it recognizes how integrated our national economies have become.''
John Maynard Keynes first advocated the idea that is gaining favor today when, representing Britain at the Bretton Woods, N.H., conferences following World War II, he proposed creating an ''international trade organization,'' with responsiblity over long-term trade matters. ''After World War II, Keynes pushed for creating the World Bank, to stimulate global economic growth, and the International Monetary Fund, to make short-term balance-of-payment loans,'' Mr. Mead said, as well as an international trade organization to solve long-term trade problems, but it ''died in the cradle.''
The trade organization, as Lord Keynes envisioned it, would have had an independent secretariat with an international staff and would have served as a forum where countries could discuss trade issues on a neutral turf.
''The secretariat would have been at least able to develop a data base so that during trade negotiations apples could be compared to apples; we don't have that now,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade negotiator in the Reagan Adminstration and a critic of the Bush Administration's policy toward Japan. Supporting the idea of creating a new trade organization, he added that the aim of the organization ''was simple - to bring surplus and deficit countries into balance in a nonpejorative way.''
The trade organization would be able to impose - and collect - tariffs and surcharges on the exports of countries with chronic trade surpluses, like Japan and West Germany, with the tariffs going into a fund for balance-of-payment loans. It would also be able to prompt countries with chronic deficits into devaluing their currencies to make their exports more attractive.
William Diebold, who was with the State Department during the trade organization negotiations and is now a senior fellow emeritus at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: ''A lot of myths have recently been developed about the international trade organization, giving it more power than it was to have had. But had it been created, it probably would have been a place where domestic business practices, like Japan's distribution system, could be discussed in the context of trade so that over the long run specific rules could emerge.''
Congress opposed the organization, largely out of concerns that it would impinge upon American sovereignty, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with less authority, was accepted instead. ''But the GATT's rules are too vague and its secretariat is too weak to do anything but serve as a place to discuss tariffs and trade barriers,'' Mr. Mead said. ''These are no longer the important issues dividing Japan and the United States.''
The proponents of a new trade group argue that it needs research capabilities to allow it to forecast problems like those between Japan and the United States and sufficient authority to deal with world trade problems. Jeffery E. Garten, an investment banker who served in the Ford and Carter Administrations and who supports a new trade organization, said that ''at the next economic summit, the leaders ought to finally acknowledge that the current system is inadequate for dealing with trade'' and appoint a group to report back in a year on how to change the system.
Mr. Mead said that ''as long as trade expands, we can expect more conflicts.'' For that reason, he argues, the functions of an international trade organization should be put somewhere - even in GATT.

Continental Air and Denver Sign Lease on New Airport

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Ending a yearlong stalemate, Continental Airlines said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with Denver officials to lease space at the city's new $2.3 billion airport.
The agreement eliminates a major hurdle facing the airport, which will be the world's largest when completed in late 1993. Continental, the second-largest carrier at Denver, had opposed construction of the new airport, which will replace Stapleton International Airport. The largest carrier, United Airlines, has yet to reach such an agreement with the city. 
The new airport, 18 miles northeast of the city, will be the first major one to be built in this country since 1974. It will be financed with Federal money, airport bonds that will be repaid through various charges to the airlines, and proceeds from the development of land at Stapleton, which will be closed.
City officials hope the new airport, which is expected to generate more than 100,000 jobs, will help lift Denver from its economic slump.
 
Millions in Interest Savings
As part of the agreement, the city will redesign a terminal to satisfy Continental and will finance $100 million worth of support equipment for Continental, saving the airline millions of dollars in interest payments.
Federico Pena, the Mayor of Denver, said he recently met with a board member of United Airlines and hopes to reach an agreement with the carrier in a few weeks. But he said the success of the project does not depend on United's support. ''This ship has left the dock,'' he said.
A spokesman for United declined to comment.
Critics had said that the two airlines opposed the new and bigger airport because they would lose their dominant position in the city. Together, United and Continental control more than 80 percent of the market at Denver. But Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, parent of Continental, said yesterday that the airline had opposed the new airport because of its high cost, not to protect market share.

HEADLINE: House Tax Bill Aims At Foreign Concerns

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders today introduced legislation intended to help the Government collect taxes owed by United States subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies.
The measure was prompted by recent reports that some subsidiaries had consistently underpaid their taxes, and thereby gained a competitive edge against American-owned companies that paid the taxes they owed. It was reported last month that Federal tax officials were investigating many American subsidiaries of Japanese companies on the suspicion that they had underpaid corporate income taxes by billions of dollars.
The bill would also tax the stock gains of some foreign individuals and corporations, in an effort to provide more equitable treatment for foreign and domestic investors. But this provision would not apply to nations, like Japan and Canada, in which such a tax is barred by treaties with the United States. 
 
Curb on Investment Feared
Critics of the bill said it was a politically inspired way to raise revenues without offending American taxpayers. They warned that it would discourage foreigners from investing in the United States, where total foreign investment approaches $2 trillion.
Supporters of the bill cited Internal Revenue Service reports that in 1986 foreign-owned companies reported a negative tax liability of more than $1 billion, while also reporting more than $500 billion in gross income. The I.R.S. found that of the 36,800 foreign-owned companies filing returns in 1986, more than half reported no taxable income.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Illinois Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, said, ''It is critical that we insure that foreign-owned companies are not underpaying their taxes, thereby gaining a competitive advantage over American companies that are paying their fair share.''
To that end, the bill would extend to all pending tax cases the I.R.S. authority, provided by a 1989 law, to examine a foreign company's books and records, and take testimony concerning any transaction. Under current law, the I.R.S. is subject to a three-year statute of limitations, which can be waived by the taxpayer.
 
Broad Underpayments Seen
The Ways and Means panel estimates that the measure would produce $1 billion in revenues over five years. But an I.R.S. official said suspected underpayments, in returns now under review, amounted to at least $12 billion.
Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said the measure was intended to end ''a U.S. tax holiday for foreign competitors.''
The Missouri Democrat said foreign auto makers in the United States paid a total of $12 million in taxes on $7.7 billion in total receipts in 1986.
A Treasury Department spokesman said that ''our attorneys and economists are looking at the bill,'' and that the agency had no comment.
Bradley Larschan, secretary of the Association for International Investment, which represents 25 American subsidiaries of foreign companies, called the proposed bill ''discriminatory against foreign investors.''
''We don't think it's clear that foreign investors don't pay their taxes,'' he said. ''These responses are not based on thorough or detailed studies, and would discourage foreigners from investing in the U.S. at a time when the U.S. needs to continue to attract foreign investment.''
Michael Patton, a tax lawyer who represents foreign clients, said: ''What is really harsh about this provision is that a case could be 10 years old, and a company could have had no notice about what kind of records it should keep. Companies shouldn't be penalized for not keeping records that they weren't told they should have kept in the first place.''
An aide to the Ways and Means Committee said that a foreign company would not be penalized for failing to have a document it was not previously required to have, but that the I.R.S. would have access to all available documents.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
The Search for a Cleaner Way to Make Steel

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
For years, steel industry executives have voiced a need for a way to produce steel without using air-polluting ovens that convert coal into the fuel known as coke to heat the blast furnaces. But the issue has taken on new urgency now that Senate leaders and the White House have agreed, in clean-air legislation, to retain a deadline of 1995 for steelmakers to install stringent anti-pollution technology.
Steel companies in the United States and abroad are taking different tacks in developing processes that are not only cleaner but also more energy-efficient.
Steel is currently made in an energy-intensive, three-step process. First, coal is heated in a tall, narrow oven sealed to keep out oxygen. The process drives out a variety of chemical byproducts in coal, primarily benzene, and produces red-hot coke, nearly all carbon, that burns more efficiently and at a far higher temperature than coal. 
Then the coke is fed into a blast furnace in which iron ore is reduced to almost pure molten iron. In the third step, the iron is dumped into an oxygen furnace and combined with a small portion of scrap steel. Oxygen is injected to raise the temperature to burn out unwanted elements, producing molten steel.
The major environmental problem in the steelmaking process comes from gases - primarily benzene and ammonia - that escape during the coke-making process and when the doors to the coke ovens are opened. (Most of the gases are trapped and the chemicals are recovered for other uses.) The problem worsens as coke ovens age and the seals around the doors wear down.
The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of the nation's major steel companies, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, is researching and developing a ''direct'' steelmaking process that would combine the functions of the three-step process into one and eliminate the dirty coke-making step by using coal as the basic fuel. In the process being developed, iron ore and coal would be heated in a single vessel into which oxygen would be blown. Out of that would flow liquid iron. Sulfur and carbon would then be removed from the iron ore, producing steel.
The experimental process would be cleaner and more energy efficient because the process of converting coal into coke would be eliminated.
But the process faces a number of problems. Foremost is the corrosive liquids produced in a one-step process.
''The major challenge is to produce refractory materials that will withstand the attack from the corrosive liquids,'' said Brian E. Aranha, a manufacturing and technology fellow with the American Iron and Steel Institute. ''It's never been tried before.''
Moreover, steel executives said, it will be a long time before the system can produce steel on a large scale. ''Coke is an essential ingredient to integrated steelmaking and coke will be needed well into the next century,'' said Walter F. Williams, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
 
Feasibility Being Determined
Steel industry engineers are now determining the economic feasibility of the process. ''If we get full success out of the pilot process, we would move to a semi-commercial production by 1996 and a finished product by 2004,'' said Ian F. Hughes, vice president of technology for the Inland Steel Company. ''If we succeed at that, we would be doing brilliantly.''
Steel company executives therefore complain that the present clean-air legislation is too harsh and would result in a shutdown of more than 80 percent of the nation's coke ovens. (A small minority are new enough and far enough from populated areas to meet the requirements.) Meanwhile, 44 alternative processes are being studied around the world to reduce dependence on coke ovens, according to a study by the University of Salford in England. The processes fall largely into two categories: those based on burning coal rather than converting coal to coke and burning the coke, and those that use significant amounts of electricity to create heat for the steelmaking process.
One gaining attention internationally is a two-step process called Corex now being demonstrated in South Africa by a consortium of steel companies led by Voest Alpine of Austria. Under this system, no coke is used. Instead, a blast furnace fueled by coal melts iron ore, producing molten iron. The molten iron then goes through a process similar to the oxygen furnace in conventional steel plants.
 
'Operating Very Well'
The plant ''is operating very well so far,'' said a spokesman for Voest Alpine. It has a capacity of 300,000 tons and has begun production. The spokesman said annual capacity could be increased to 500,000 tons. The plant is not only cleaner but also consumes less energy than a conventional steel plant, he said.
Other systems based on use of coal rather than coke are being developed by Krupp & Klockner of West Germany, Kobe Steel of Japan and British Steel.
Also being studied are several electricity-based processes that use coal for the initial reduction of iron ore and then electricity to provide the heat for the final melting. Many experts consider those projects less efficient on a large scale because of the large amount of power they require.
Many steel industry experts say processes like the two-step Corex technique would be easier to perfect over the short term than the one being studied by the American team. ''The Americans are just not serious players at this stage,'' said Jonathan Aylen, a professor of economics at the University of Salford. ''There are processes that already are working on a pilot scale.''
The problem of emissions is more serious in the United States, Mr. Aylen said, because the average coke oven is older than those in most other countries.
''The typical coke oven in South Korea was built in the 1980's,'' Mr. Aylen said. ''The typical coke oven in Japan dates from the 1970's. And in Europe it dates from the late 1960's. The typical American blast furnace, we don't know, because they are so old. Many are Second World War construction.''
Mr. Williams of Bethlehem Steel said that the average coke oven in the United States was about 30 years old and that coke ovens had frequently been refurbished to reduce emissions.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices moved sharply higher in a volatile session yesterday, as traders gave more weight to rumors of significant Japanese purchases of zero-coupon Treasury bonds than to economic reports that suggested inflation was still a problem.
The Government reports on consumer prices and merchandise trade were not in line with market expectations, and traders reacted by selling securities early in the session.
But the selling stopped abruptly after talk about big Japanese purchases began to develop.
Talk about the Japanese centered on rumors that in the run-up to March 31, the end of their fiscal year, big Japanese institutions have been selling out money-losing positions in Japanese government bonds and offsetting those losses by purchasing large quantities of zero-coupon Treasury bonds. There were also rumors that a big Japanese institution had reallocated assets out of Japanese stocks into Treasury bonds. 
Because zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest, the issues trade at a deep discount. They are redeemed at 100, or par, when held to maturity.
By selling the Japanese bonds, which have tumbled in value since the start of the year, and buying the zero-coupon issues, Japanese institutions are ''taking a loss but not showing it,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc., because they would avoid having to report the loss in the Japanese securities on their year-end balance sheets.
''Much to my chagrin, we have done none of that business,'' Mr. Brachfeld added. ''But I know that an enormous amount of zeros have been sold to Japan in the last month or so.''
 
Japanese Financial Markets
Japanese financial markets were fairly stable yesterday after the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate by a full percentage point, to 5.25 percent.
The move, which had been widely forecast, did not provide much immediate support for the Japanese yen, which remained weak against the dollar yesterday.
Indeed, some credit market participants said the dollar's strength provided additional underpinning for the bond market yesterday.
A strong dollar helps to blunt inflationary pressures. Because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, it is reviled in the bond market.
However, a more direct inflation indicator, the Consumer Price Index, was less encouraging. It showed prices rose by half a percent in February, well down from the energy and food-related spurt of 1.1 percent in January.
 
Jump in Apparel Prices
A big jump in apparel prices had much to do with last month's increase, but a number of analysts said they were not encouraged.
The inflation report was ''basically bearish for the credit markets,'' said Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn.
Excluding food and energy prices, ''consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of close to 7 percent over the past two months,'' Mr. Thunberg added.
''That is excessive by any standards and is higher than the first two months of last year,'' he said. ''It is not imminent, but if these trends continue, I would expect the next move in monetary policy by the Fed to be towards tightening.''
That possibility was seen only briefly in the bond market yesterday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100 17/32, up 7/8 point, to yield 8.45 percent, down from 8.53 the day before. The late price was a full 1 1/2 points above the bellwether issue's low price for the day.
Price movement among Treasury note issues was considerably more subdued.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.52 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 18/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.59 percent.
Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.94 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills were unchanged at an offered rate of 7.90 percent.
Elsewhere, new issue activity in the corporate bond market remained strong yesterday. On Monday four issuers priced just over $1 billion worth of securities.
Among the issuers yesterday was the McDonald's Corporation, which priced $100 million worth of seven-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 3/8 percent notes, which mature March 15, 1997, were priced at $99.918, to yield 9.39 percent, 75 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for five years, is rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Prudential-Bache Securities acted as lead manager for a Bank of New York offering of $100 million worth of floating rate deposit notes.
The notes, which mature Aug. 27, 1991, were priced at 100. The interest rate on the notes, which floats weekly, will be the bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills plus 82 basis points. The first rate will be set on March 27.
The issue is rated AA-3 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Despite the recent flood of new issues, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that demand for securities had been picking up. Prices of most intermediate issues rose by about 3/8 point, while long-term bonds were up by as much as 7/8 point.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds was less robust. Traders said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/4 point on the day.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Central Banks' Intervention Fails to Halt Soaring Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar soared higher in heavy trading yesterday, helped by profit taking in West German marks and in the Japanese yen.
Intervention by several central banks aimed at shoring up the sagging yen failed to alter the dollar's course. The banks reportedly sold dollars on world foreign exchange markets and bought yen. 
Speculation that United States interest rates would not decline soon, which grew when the Government reported an unexpectedly strong inflation rate for February, also encouraged dollar buying.
Currency dealers in the United States described trading in dollars as brisk. They said the Federal Reserve sold dollars against the yen after similar moves by its counterparts in Europe.
''We had a nice rally in the dollar,'' said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in New York.
 
Momentum From Marks
Mr. McCarthy said most of the momentum for the dollar's broad advance came from sales of marks to collect profits amassed during the currency's recent climb.
Traders had scrambled to buy marks before Sunday's East German elections and bought more on Monday when the results indicated a faster move toward a unified Germany. But as the euphoria eased over the outcome of the voting, traders lightened their mark holdings.
As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.7048 marks, up from 1.6860 late Monday.
The Japanese yen suffered despite an increase in a key lending rate. Dealers said the one percentage point rise in Japan's discount rate, to 5.25 percent, failed to evoke a favorable response because the move had been widely anticipated.
One dollar bought 154.20 yen late in New York, compared with 153.05 yen late Monday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 153.65 yen, from 153.55 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 153.85 yen. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Monday, included: 1.5225 Swiss francs, up from 1.5085; 5.7575 French francs, up from 5.7025; 1,258.00 Italian lire, up from 1,246.75, and 1.17765 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18225.
Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late levels, were: 1.6965 West German marks, up from 1.6829; 1.5157 Swiss francs, up from 1.5085; 5.7340 French francs, up from 5.6895; 1.9107 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8970; 1,253.50 Italian lire, up from 1,244.25, and 1.1792 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1836.

Precious Metal Prices Fall, With Gold Leading the Way

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Precious metal prices plunged yesterday as the dollar advanced against most leading foreign currencies. A sharp rise in Japanese interest rates also made platinum, gold and silver more expensive to buy in that nation, which has become a major consumer as well as dealer in precious metals.
Gold prices opened weaker in Japan and Europe, but the heaviest selling came later in New York. At the close of the Commodity Exchange in New York, the spot March gold delivery settled at $392.20 an ounce, down $8.50 on the day. Comex spot silver lost 5.8 cents an ounce, at $5.043. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the spot March platinum contract settled at $490.80 an ounce, down $8.50.
 
Japanese Didn't Sell, Didn't Buy
The strength of the dollar more than anything else knocked gold down, and the silver and platinum markets followed suit,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''While the Japanese did not sell metal in response to the one-point rise in their discount rate to 5.25 percent, the continued weakness of their stock market and the yen, they didn't buy, either.''
One reason, she said, was that the Japanese fiscal year ends March 31. Toward the end of March Japanese investment managers tend to be less aggressive in the marketplace and more preoccupied with balancing accounts and planning for the coming fiscal year.
With the value of the yen falling and interest rates rising, it is now more expensive for Japanese consumers to buy precious metals, or for dealers to import metal and finance inventories, Ms. Raptopoulos noted.
Precious metals are traded in dollars. Thus foreign buyers must first acquire dollars to buy bullion. The recent rise in the dollar's value against the yen and most other currencies has raised costs substantially for Japanese and other foreign metals importers.
Frederick R. Demler, minerals economist at Paine Webber Inc., said: ''The rise in Japanese interest rates could benefit the precious metals market globally if it caused similar moves in domestic interest rates, but we don't see this happening at this time. Investors in precious metals are also unsettled by the recent drop in oil prices, which were supposed to rise and help reignite inflation.''

SERIES: Struggling in Japan; U.S. Companies That Pull Back - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 21

 BODY:
For nearly two decades Avon Products Inc. was one of America's biggest success stories here, a company that spent years tailoring its products for Japanese women and learning how to outsmart a distribution system that has defeated many foreign companies. It paid off: Last year Avon reaped a quarter of its corporate profits in Japan, even though the country accounts for less than a tenth of its sales.
But last year was also Avon's last in Japan. A few weeks ago, worried about takeover rumors and a $1.1 billion debt at home, the company sold its Japanese subsidiary to a little-known Japanese company for $408 million, in the midst of a Japanese consumer spending binge.
Avon is only the latest, if the most dramatic, instance of American companies that are cashing in their Japanese holdings. At a time when the United States is complaining that it is still far too difficult for American companies to crack the Japanese market, a steady stream of those already here are abandoning or reducing their stakes. 
Like Avon, many of them have succeeded here, making a profit or obtaining technology from Japanese partners. But almost all of them are in need of quick cash. And even after the recent fall in the Tokyo stock market, they view selling their Japanese holdings as a quick solution. The decision to pull back is also often influenced by the high cost of trying to expand their business in Japan.
 
An Extensive Roster
The list of such companies now extends to Chrysler, General Motors, CBS, Honeywell and Shaklee, among others. As in Avon's case, the sale of their assets or stakes in Japanese joint ventures was often greeted warmly on Wall Street.
But what makes sense to American investors is often read very differently in Japan, where such sales seem to speak of a lack of corporate commitment. Many Japanese business leaders say the sales prove that American companies are not really dedicated to becoming powerful forces in the world's second-largest economy and that they will often opt for a short-term profit over the long-term benefits of having an established business here.
American trade negotiators say the accelerating pace of the selloffs is beginning to undermine the United States' efforts to encourage Japan to let foreigners in at a faster pace. That fight has been forcefully pressed by T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, who has become the largest shareholder in a Japanese maker of auto parts, the Koito Manufacturing Company, but so far has not been granted a seat on its board.
The American selloffs come at a bad time for Washington. ''How am I supposed to explain this to the Japanese?'' an American official involved in the trade negotiating process asked the other day. ''Am I supposed to simply say that Akio Morita is right?'' Mr. Morita, the chairman of the Sony Corporation, has been a leading critic of American business managers, saying they ''can only see 10 minutes ahead.''
No exact figures are available on the sale of American stakes in subsidiaries or joint ventures in Japan, though investment bankers and others estimate that in the last year more than $2 billion in assets other than real estate have been sold, often to Japanese partners.
 
Foreign Investment Growing
Moreover, the pullback from Japan comes as American companies are generally increasing their investment abroad. The amount of foreign direct investment worldwide by American manufacturing companies increased 20 percent last year, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group.
To be sure, Japan remains a lucrative market for many American companies and the United States remains the largest foreign investor in Japan. For their part, European companies have been investing heavily, beginning a large number of joint ventures or setting up retailing networks in Japan.
If the American experience holds, making those ventures profitable may take anywhere from 5 to 10 years. But once they are established, according to figures collected by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, foreign companies here are often more profitable than their parents or their Japanese competitors. Nonetheless, the expense of gaining additional market share in Japan, combined with the value of land assets here, often make a sale irresistible.
''You can make a very good financial argument for leaving,'' said John Colby, the Japan-based partner for the Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm. ''There is a time to take profits. But from a national policy point of view, it is exceptionally shortsighted.''
 
Cutback by Chrysler
One of the largest sales so far was done last year by the Chrysler Corporation, which sold half of its 24 percent holding in its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors Company, in time to bolster Chrysler's third-quarter earnings. Officially, both companies say the sale had no effect on their relationship. Mitsubishi still supplies Chrysler with engines and with Mitsubishi-made cars that are sold under the Chrysler label. The companies also produce automobiles together at Diamond-Star Motors, a joint-venture plant in the United States.
But inside Mitsubishi's headquarters here, visitors are left with the clear impression that Chrysler's sale will not be quickly forgiven. ''It was not a totally welcomed thing,'' Toyoo Tate, the chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, said in an interview.
Chrysler, Mr. Tate said, ''has been doing its best to stay above water, and we have high hopes that the effort will succeed.''
''I don't like to think that they would reduce their stake any more,'' he said, ''and they have not brought the subject up.''
Analysts, however, have been continually speculating about the sale of Chrysler's remaining shares, especially if Chrysler's financial difficulties worsen.
Mitsubishi executives say the stock sale, together with Chrysler's halting efforts to sell its own cars here - it sold fewer than 1,000 vehicles in Japan last year - has convinced them that Chrysler is not the right partner. That may help explain Mitsubishi's eagerness to join with Daimler-Benz, maker of the Mercedes-Benz, as part of a broader arrangement between the top four Mitsubishi companies and Daimler announced earlier this month.
 
G.M. Trims Its Stake
Soon after Chrysler's sale, General Motors sold some of its shares in Isuzu Motors, reducing its stake from 40 percent, to 38 percent. But G.M. says the move was not intended as a signal. ''I'm quite sure it doesn't mean anything,'' said Richard R. Johnson, general manager of the Japan branch of General Motors Overseas Corporation. G.M., he said, still relies on Isuzu for research.
Automobile analysts, however, note that Isuzu is losing strength in the Japanese market and speculate openly about whether G.M. will further reduce its stake.
But typically it is problems at home, not in Tokyo, that cause American companies to sell their stake. The Shaklee Corporation, a direct-sales distributor of vitamins, cosmetics and household products, sold its Japanese unit to Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Company when Shaklee was trying to forestall a takeover. When that strategy appeared doomed, the American parent company agreed to be bought by Yamanouchi.
In some cases, the sale of a stake in Japan has deprived an American company of huge profits later on. CBS sold its stake in CBS/Sony, a joint venture to produce compact disks and records for the Japanese market, when Sony purchased the American-based CBS Records. Since then, sales of CBS/Sony, along with those of CBS Records, have soared, riding a boom in consumer spending, especially among young Japanese women.
 
Profits for Avon
Some analysts and cosmetics industry executives predict that the same may happen to Avon. In 1989, Avon Japan posted $285 million in sales, giving it about 4 percent of the Japanese cosmetics market. But the high price of cosmetics here - and Avon's use of Japanese ''office ladies'' and housewives to create a direct-sales network that circumvented the country's expensive and multi-layered distributors - generated $15.3 million in profits.
At a meeting with analysts recently, James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, insisted that despite the profits, the Japanese market was now mature and it was time to move on. The company, he said, had three choices: ''We could invest heavily to try to increase share in the face of some tough competition, we could make no new investment there and face erosion in both market share and profit margins, or we could sell to a Japanese company that could make the investments.''
Avon chose to sell, and after a flurry of bids from Japanese companies eager for access to a nationwide network of Avon sales representatives, the winner was the Friends of Freesia Company, a direct-mail company that plans to offer its own household products along with cosmetics.
Avon will continue to receive royalties from the sale of its products. But the long-term cost of its departure, many business experts here believe, will be high. The company will no longer pit its best cosmetics research directly against that of Shiseido and Kanebo, the giant Japanese cosmetics makers that are quickly expanding abroad.
 
Mature Market Is Seen
And with more and more Japanese consumers buying through direct mail and freelance salespeople, Avon may be cutting itself out of a market on the verge of explosion.

HEADLINE: Bamboo Coaxed to Flower in Lab; Global Impact on the Crop Is Seen

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
In a significant advance for the cultivation of one of the world's most important timber and fodder crops, scientists say they have coaxed bamboo plants to flower in the laboratory, a feat never before managed. Bamboo in the field can take more than a century to flower and produce seeds.
The new technique will allow botanists to breed a better version of a plant that has undergirded the economies and cultures of Asia and many tropical nations for hundreds or even thousands of years. And it should allow faster replacement of depleted bamboo forests that are vitally needed. 
''This is a spectacular success for the breeding of bamboo,'' said David Hanke, a botanist at the University of Cambridge and the author of an editorial that accompanied the report being published today in the journal Nature. ''It's a breakthrough that could have real significance for a quarter of the world's population.''
 
A Construction Staple
In many Western nations, bamboo is viewed largely as ornamental foliage. But in China, India, Japan, Malaysia, parts of Latin America and other regions where bamboo is abundant, it provides a vital source of lightweight, rot-resistant wood for houses, smaller public buildings, furniture and even the scaffolding that is used in the building of skyscrapers and supertankers.
Bamboo reeds are crafted into musical instruments, artists' tools, baskets and domestic goods of all kinds. They are pulverized for paper pulp. With four times the protein of other fodder grasses, bamboo hay is a dietary staple for livestock.
''In those regions where bamboo is common, the plant is a godsend,'' said Beecher Crampton, professor emeritus of agronomy at the University of California at Davis. ''It's hard to overstate its importance.''
The new technique should allow botanists to fashion novel hybrids of bamboo that will grow faster, resist diseases and yield a stronger, more versatile wood. Botanists say the technique could allow rapid reforestation of regions where bamboo stands have been depleted or devastated, either through human encroachment or as a result of the natural mass dying cycle that all bamboo forests undergo.
 
More Panda Food
Beyond its economic value, botanists say, the ability to hasten forest regeneration may benefit the endangered giant panda, which feeds on the reedy plant in the fast-diminishing bamboo wilderness of northeast China.
Scientists estimate that there are more than 500 species of bamboo in the warmer regions of the world. The most spectacular examples of the plant, a member of the grass family, are found at the southern and southeastern edges of Asia, where lush yet delicate canopies of bamboo reach heights of 130 feet.
But the quirks of bamboo reproduction have made the plant almost impossible to cultivate or to improve selectively. Most species flower and produce seeds only once in their lifetimes, after growing between 12 and 120 years, the longest generation time over all in the plant kingdom. A forest of bamboo usually flowers simultaneously, a phenomenon called masting. And shortly after flowering, the forest dies en masse, often within a single season. Left behind is a blanket of seeds that can be 20 to 30 inches deep, setting the stage for new forest growth.
Before flowering and perishing, a bamboo tree can also reproduce asexually, by sending up underground shoots, known as rhizomes, which are genetic clones of itself. Many bamboo forests consist largely of trees born of such shoots, and in China, rhizomes are planted to produce bamboo stands that can be harvested.
 
Plants Outlast Researchers
But neither of the bamboo's reproductive methods allows for standard agricultural manipulations. Because the normal seed generation time is so long, botanists in the past have been unable to mix together the genes of different plants and to cull superior offspring; a researcher may reach retirement age long before the bamboo in the lab has reached its moment of flowering. Nor can the seedless clonal rhizomes be used to breed new hybrids.
To solve the problem, A. F. Mascarenhas and two colleagues at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, India, devised a test-tube cocktail that spurs young bamboo plants to flower prematurely. The researchers suspended tiny cuttings of two species of bamboo, Bambusa arundinacea and Dendrocalamus brandisii, in a test tube, and added a culture medium enriched with plant growth hormones, coconut milk and other nutrients. After several weeks and two more applications of the broth, the bamboo slips, measuring only a few inches in length, began sprouting flowers half an inch or so in diameter, the size of adult blossoms.
Under natural conditions, botanists said, the two bamboo species in the experiment would not flower until they were about 30 years of age and 30 to 60 feet tall.
''It's very impressive that they've gotten the shoots to flower before they have any vegetative body to speak of,'' said Richard Howard, vice president for botanical science at the New York Botanical Garden.
 
A Little Luck
It is not yet clear why the brew of hormones and milk encouraged precocious blooming. In the past, coconut milk has been found to have powerful and diverse effects on other plants. ''It's like cookery,'' said Dr. Hanke. ''There's a great deal of empiricism and blind luck in this business.''
So well did the technique work that 60 percent of the approximately 200 coddled shoots propagated healthy-looking seeds about two weeks later, a success rate that botanists say is astonishing. The seeds have yet to be planted in soil and allowed to grow, but experts expect them to be viable.
With the method, the botanists can begin trying to cross the two bamboo species to see what new hybrid appears. Should the crossings succeed, the scientists expect to cultivate other bamboo species in the lab and try more combinations.
They can also begin inserting foreign genes, like genes for disease resistance, into bamboo cells, thereby ushering the versatile bamboo, among the most venerable of plants, into the horticultural future.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Journal;
Is the Skyscraper Looking Daggers at Neighbors?

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 21

 BODY:
The Bank of China moved this week into its new Hong Kong headquarters, a spectacular glass tower designed by I. M. Pei and already heralded as one of the most distinctive buildings in the world.
But Chinese officials here marked the occasion with nothing more than a small newspaper advertisement that announced the move and declared, ''No ceremony will be performed.''
For a building fraught with symbolism for both Hong Kong and China, the soaring skyscraper has opened ''with just a whisper,'' as a foreign diplomat here noted, Paradoxically, the glittering glass tower Mr. Pei built to capture the spirit of the new liberalism of China has been completed just as that country is undertaking a forced march back to old-style orthodox Communism.
 
A Metaphor for Bamboo
''The building was meant to celebrate the modernization of China, and to me it still does,'' Mr. Pei said in an interview here on Tuesday. 
The Canton-born American architect, here to receive an honorary degree from Hong Kong University, said the sectioned building, which tapers as it rises, is a metaphor for bamboo. ''In China, there is a saying that like a bamboo you advance with every stage of growth, meaning you rise to meet challenges.''
The 70-story, 1,209-foot tower, the tallest building in the world outside the United States, rises from the central business district, dominating the skyline in much the way China is expected to dominate life here when it resumes control of this British colony in 1997.
From the beginning in 1982, when the British sold China's state bank a prime building site for millions less than its market value, the tower project has been the focus of fear and speculation. Labor shortages, a problem with the foundation and material difficulties delayed the completion of the $130 million building by more than a year.
 
Some Startling Rumors
At one point, Hong Kong was abuzz with rumors that the tower was sinking and that to accommodate its weak foundation several stories would have to be lopped off.
''The rumors about the building sinking were very strong,'' said Jeffrey Q. Finney, of Knight Frank Kan & Baillieu , which leases space in the tower. ''Then of course there were the rumors about the two poles on the top of the building being special towers to broadcast propaganda or secret spy messages. They aren't.''
Mr. Pei said the poles were simply a finishing flourish to mark the end of the building.
If residents worried about the poles, they have worried even more that the triangles that give the building its distinctive design are bad ''fung shui.''
Hong Kong Chinese are serious about fung shui, the ancient art of arranging buildings and other objects so they are in harmony with nature and bring good luck. Many fung shui experts say the sharp angles of the tower are like dangerous daggers pointed at businesses and homes in the area. Small mirrors have been placed in the windows of surrounding buildings to deflect the evil that is supposed to emanate from the bank.
 
The Angles Explained
Neither the bank nor Mr. Pei consulted a fung shui expert, but Mr. Finney said every business that has moved in has brought in its own experts. ''We're hearing that the overall fung shui inside the building is good,'' he said. ''It's just the people outside the building who have to worry.''
Mr. Pei explained his controversial angles, saying that ''the three-dimentional triangulation in the building has never been done before, and by using this design we transfer all vertical stress to the four corners of the building, making it very stable and wind resistant.''
Rents in the Bank of China are 10 to 20 percent below market price, and other property managers said one reason, aside from fierce competition in a sagging property market, is that the floors inside are strangely shaped, ending in points and angles. ''It looks grand on the outside, but it's hopeless inside,'' an agent said.
Mr. Pei said that while the floors were irregular, ''in an office building what you really rent are windows, and this building has windows and views everywhere.''
He said he designed such a tall structure because building up on the small piece of land was the only way to maximize the space available. But, he said with a grin, ''The second reason the building got higher is that anything less would not be seen.''
 
A Run on the Bank
In Hong Kong, business always takes precedence over pleasure and politics. And Mr. Finney said that companies did not shy away from China's bank building, even when China shocked the world by using guns and tanks on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June, an event Mr. Pei called ''an absolute tragedy.''
''We had three tenants back out after June 4, but for business, not political reasons,'' Mr. Finney said. ''Here it's a question of value for money and what's makes business sense.''
Emotions were high last June, and Hong Kong Chinese, stunned and angered by the military crackdown, staged a run on Bank of China offices in the colony, emptying the cash machines in hours and then lining up to withdraw their money. Liberal political leaders here were finally forced to ask residents to stop their withdrawals as the entire colonial banking system was in danger.
There has been speculation that China may now be a bit embarrassed by this quintessentially Western skyscraper commissioned in the mid-1980's when the country was eagerly embarking upon economic and political changes.
Robert Broadfoot, director of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, does not agree. ''The building is big and tall,'' he said. ''It dominates; it declares China's sovereignty. I think they love it.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan President Re-elected; He Meets Protesters

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 21

 BODY:
President Lee Teng-hui was re-elected today by an overwhelming majority of Taiwan's National Assembly delegates, some escorted to the ballot boxes in wheelchairs, and then promptly met with student demonstrators to discuss their demands for greater democracy.
The 67-year-old, American-educated Mr. Lee is the first native Taiwanese to be elected President. Mr. Lee, previously Vice President, automatically became President two years ago upon the death of his predecessor, Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of the former Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek.
In recent weeks there was intensive jockeying for power in the National Assembly, which elects the President, but Mr. Lee's only challenger withdrew a few days ago. Thus, running unopposed, he received 641 votes, about 95 percent of those cast. The remaining ballots were invalid or blank. 
While Taiwan has taken steps toward democracy in recent years, and held multiparty legislative elections in December, the President is still chosen by the 752-member National Assembly.
Most of the Assembly members are in their 80's and 90's and were chosen on the China mainland before fleeing to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek. These aged delegates, some of whom were too frail to vote, have been at the center of one of the island's most highly charged debates over the election process.
The overwhelming vote for re-election by the National Assembly appeared to be a sign of unity among the elderly delegates who had until recently appeared divided in their support of Mr. Lee.
''I think he will become more powerful,'' said Chang Chungtung, a professor at National Taiwan University. ''He can do more with this new mandate to reduce pressure from other areas.''
Thousands of student demonstrators and a small number of hunger strikers continued their protests in Chiang Kai-shek Square in central Taipei today and pressed their demands for broader and faster changes in Taiwan's political system.
Mr. Lee pledged in a statement to work for constitutional democracy, economic progress, social order and stability.
This evening, he met for about an hour with 50 student representatives at the presidential palace and appeared to agree to their demands, students said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Lee announced that he would convene a conference in the end of June that would enable opposition party members, scholars, legislators and business people to discuss national issues like constitutional changes and policy toward the Chinese mainland. This was one of the demands of the students.
One topic of the conference is likely to be the dissolution of the National Assembly and the growing demand for the presidency to be directly elected by the population at large.
As university students danced in the rain and huddled together under plastic ponchos late into the night, representatives were divided on whether to retreat from the square or to remain longer, students said. Although Mr. Lee agreed to do his best to fulfill their requests, some of their demands will be difficult to meet any time soon because they would involve modifications to the Constitution.
Students and members of the opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, denounced the election, saying it did not represent the wishes of the people.
''This election was ridiculous,'' said Qi Weinen, a 24-year-old student representative from Furen University. ''We want the old representatives to retire as soon as possible. We can't put up with them any longer.''
At dawn today, about 200 members of the Democratic Progressive Party and their supporters gathered to protest the election, but they were prevented by riot policemen from approaching the National Assembly voting hall. Instead, they confronted elderly delegates on their way to the hall, and smashed the car windows of two delegates.
The 11 opposition members in the National Assembly were barred from voting because they refused to pledge allegiance to the Nationalist Goverment.

HEADLINE: El Salvador and Rebels Reportedly Agree to Talks

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, March 21

 BODY:
The Salvadoran Government and the leftist guerrillas have agreed to begin talks and to a tentative time frame for signing a peace treaty, senior Government officials said today.
An official said the ''continuous and uninterrupted'' talks are to begin next month and are expected to lead to an agreement by the fall under which the guerrillas would start incorporating themselves into the political process.
''We're very optimistic,'' said a senior official, who was speaking with the direct authorization of President Alfredo Cristiani. ''This is a major breakthrough.'' Officials said that in a major concession to the rebels, Mr. Cristiani himself would lead the Government negotiating team. 
In a news conference late this afternoon, the Minister of Information, Mauricio Sandoval, announced what he described as major progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations intended to lead to the first direct talks since the rebels staged a nationwide offensive last November.
''The Government is ready to immediately reinitiate the dialogue without any precondition,'' he said. He added that the Cristiani administration hoped the rebels would ''respond to the Salvadoran people, who are clamoring for the reinitiation of the dialogue process.''
But Mr. Sandoval stopped short of formally declaring an agreement to resume negotiations, apparently to avoid breaking an understanding under which Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, will announce the renewal of talks, Cristiani administration officials said.
The leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were not at their Mexico City offices and were not available to comment on the Government's announcement. But in recent days they have repeatedly suggested that they are ready to make more concessions and close to completing arrangements for negotiations.
An aide to President Cristiani said the two sides had not agreed on a date or a location for the negotiations. But he said that that was not a major issue and that the talks would be held in a nearby Latin American capital, apparently a concession by the rebels, who wanted to hold them in New York.
Presidential aides said the talks were intended to enable the guerrillas to take part in municipal and legislative elections next March. The Government, the aides said, has set September as the deadline for concluding a treaty to give the rebels time to transform their army and civilian network into a political operation able to enter the electoral process next January. Concessions have been made on both sides to reach what appears to be the broadest and most complete agreement since the beginning of the civil war.
The talks will have an open agenda, presidential aides said. They said that unlike previous meetings, which were intermittent and little more than a forum for exchanging views, the new negotiations would be ''continuous'' and intended, for the first time, to reach an agreement.
The revival of talks in large part stems from growing pressure by the United States, the financier of the Salvadoran Government, the country's economic desperation and a nationwide longing for peace. The decision to renew talks also reflects a realization by a number of leaders on both sides that neither the Government nor the guerrillas can win an outright military victory.
Government officials said President Cristiani was convinced he had the political capital to overcome any opposition to negotiations among hard-liners in the military and in the governing party, which was founded a decade ago as a paramilitary group dedicated to fighting Communism.
Many right-wing extremists have sharpened their opposition to talks, saying that the defeat of the rebels' Sandinista allies in Nicaraguan elections last month will inevitably lead to the guerrillas' demise. But the President, an aide said, recognizes the guerrillas' strong base here and their ability to survive as an insurgent army even without Nicaraguan Government support.

HEADLINE: Mandela Chides Baker on Talking With de Klerk, but Praises U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINDHOEK, Namibia, March 21

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela scolded Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today for scheduling a meeting with President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa on Thursday, saying that such an encounter would only enhance Mr. de Klerk's stature before he had done anything serious to dismantle apartheid.
With Mr. Baker standing by his side, Mr. Mandela cushioned his public criticism with warm praise for American efforts to combat white minority rule in South Africa, emphasizing that he regarded ''Mr. Baker, the American Government, the Congress and the people of America as true friends.''
The 35-minute meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Mandela today was the first high-level contact ever between a United States official and the black nationalist leader, who was freed last month after 27 1/2 years in prison.
 
From Very Different Worlds
While there were obvious disagreements over how to bring about nonracial democracy in South Africa, both sides seemed anxious that their first meeting be seen to succeed. Each man seemed to take the other's measure and walk away from the session relieved that it went off without serious acrimony and convinced that they can and will do business together in the future. 
Mr. Baker, scion of a Texas banking family, and Mr. Mandela, a lifelong fighter for black majority rule in South Africa, could not come from more different worlds. From the moment the two men shook hands, Mr. Mandela, who is 72 years old, seemed to be in command of the whole scene. But then he has dominated the whole Namibian independence celebration, garnering far more press attention than Namibia's new President, Sam Nujoma.
After the two men met, Mr. Mandela was asked for his views on Mr. Baker's decision to visit Cape Town on Thursday to meet with President de Klerk. Mr. Mandela himself refused to meet Mr. Baker on South African soil.
 
'Regrettable.' He Says
Mr. Mandela said: ''I will tell you. We do not think that there has been any fundamental change in the policy of the national Government. There is nothing which Mr. de Klerk has done up to now which would require a change of strategy on the part of the international community.
''And the fact that the foreign secretary of a superpower now visits Mr. de Klerk creates a great deal of confusion - specifically that the national Government has done something which requires a change of attitude on the part of the international community. We regard that as regrettable.''
The important thing to bear in mind, Mr. Mandela quickly added, ''and I hope this is what you will concentrate upon, is the fact that our discussions were dominated by the spirit of friendship that exists between the African National Congress and the American people.''
''The differences themselves will always be there,'' he said. ''Although we don't agree with the Secretary of State, we understand his position.''
Mr. Baker listened with a blank expression, but had a response that gently suggested that Mr. Mandela was playing to his domestic audience.
Mr. Baker observed that while Mr. Mandela and his colleagues in the African National Congress opposed Mr. Baker's visit with Mr. de Klerk, they were nevertheless cooperating by allowing their supporters in South Africa to meet with the Secretary of State and receive him in the black township of Soweto. As long as Mr. de Klerk continues moving forward on negotiations for a nonracial democracy in South Africa, Mr. Baker said, the Bush Administration feels it is important to encourage him directly.
''Let me simply say,'' Mr. Baker said, ''that Mr. Mandela and his colleagues here have been very generous in seeing to it that we can see their colleagues when we go to South Africa, and for that we are very grateful. We understand the position that he has just articulated.''
 
Efforts 'in Good Faith'
Mr. Baker said the Administration felt that the de Klerk Government was making efforts ''in good faith to move the process forward in South Africa.''
''We believe that it is important to try to encourage that process to move forward,'' he said.
Last month Mr. de Klerk announced a package of changes, including Mr. Mandela's release from prison and the legalization of the African National Congress and other banned organizations.
The meeting today was originally scheduled to take place at the American Ambassador's residence in Windhoek. Five minutes before the start of the talks, an American official emerged and told reporters gathered there that Mr. Mandela had called and asked if Mr. Baker could go to his house because he had ''a very busy schedule.'' Although protocol required Mr. Mandela to come to the Secretary of State, Mr. Baker went, arriving at Mr. Mandela's villa minutes after Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union ended a session with the black leader.
 
Advice, Offered Delicately
After the meeting, a senior State Department official said Mr. Baker, as expected, brought up with Mr. Mandela his feelings that the African National Copngress leader would be well advised to abandon some of his socialist economic principles. But it was clear that he offered this advice delicately.
Mr. Baker, the official said, observed to Mr. Mandela that ''of course we are very biased, and with all of my biases and prejudices hanging out as a former Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, we think the free market model works, and we think it can work for South Africa.''
Mr. Mandela, the official said, brought up the question of American economic aid for the African National Congress. Many of the group's top leaders also attended the meeting today, including Thabo Mbeki, who is in charge of foreign affairs; Alfred Nzo, the General Secretary; Joe Slovo, the head of the South African Communist Party, and Mr. Mandela's wife, Winnie. Only Mr. Mandela spoke.
The official quoted Mr. Mandela as having said that when he goes to the United States some time in the next few months, he will be looking for money to build houses for exiled African National Congress members who are returning to South Africa. Mr. Baker did not make any promises, officials said, but he told Mr. Mandela that the Bush Administration was considering asking the National Endowment for Democracy to channel money to South Africa to support voting registration and general democratic education programs for blacks.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
In a Pact, Poland Opens Doors to U.S. Business

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
President Bush and the Prime Minister of Poland signed a treaty today to increase American investment in Poland. It was the first such United States agreement with one of the newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
In the arrival ceremony for the Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Mr. Bush affirmed support for Poland's security, saying the Polish people had a ''fundamental right'' to live secure within their current borders. He said Poland ''must have a voice'' in any decisions affecting its future. 
Mr. Bush's statement was intended to calm Polish fears that the unification of Germany might lead to German claims on territory ceded to Poland after World War II.
''We want to see the nation of Poland achieve its full measure of democracy and independence,'' Mr. Bush declared. ''In any decisions affecting the fate of Poland, Poland must have a voice.''
 
Opening Doors to U.S. Business
Moreover, Mr. Bush said, ''We see a new Europe in which the security of all European states, and their fundamental right to exist secure within their present borders, is totally assured.''
The treaty the two leaders signed today will gradually eliminate Polish laws that restrict the ability of American businesses to transfer profits from Poland to the United States.
''We can now take this treaty to the U.S. business community and say, 'This is why you should invest in Poland,' '' Mr. Bush said.
Poland looks to private industry and foreign investment as the hope for the future of its economy, which was in ruins after decades of control by Communist officials.
The treaty gives American businesses new incentives to invest in Poland: protection against expropriation, copyright protection for computer software and guarantees that license applications will be swiftly approved. #19-Gun Salute Mr. Mazowiecki was welcomed at the White House today with a 19-gun salute, a trumpet fanfare and music by the United States Army Fife and Drum Corps.
At a signing ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, Mr. Bush said: ''This treaty is very important, important not only in its content but what it says about where Poland is going. It says that Poland wants U.S. investment because this investment is good for the Polish people and vital to the growth and development of the Polish economy.''
''In this treaty,'' he said, ''Poland is taking a number of very substantial steps, steps that will orient the Polish economy toward the Western economic system and toward global markets. These are courageous steps, and we applaud them.''
 
Seeking Courageous People
Mr. Mazowiecki, who was interned for a year after the martial law crackdown in 1981, took office last August as Poland's first non-Communist Prime Minister since the early years after World War II.
He said today that Poland was perhaps not prepared in every respect for the surge of economic growth that it wants and needs.
''Our telephones do not work as they should, and we have many other problems,'' he said. ''But people should not be discouraged by the problems, which are typical of this first phase. We look forward to seeing courageous people who will be willing to come and to move through this half-year of problems.''
A summary of the treaty issued by the White House said that under the agreement ''U.S. investors in Poland will be treated the same as Polish nationals or investors from other countries, whichever is more favorable.''
East and West Germany and the four major Allies of World War II - Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States - agreed in February on a framework for negotiating the unification of Germany. On March 14, the six countries agreed that Poland could have a seat at the table in any discussions of the German-Polish border.
In talks today at the White House and the State Department, Mr. Mazowiecki said that Poland should have a say on other issues affecting its security, Administration officials reported.
Raymond G. H. Seitz, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, said it ''would really quite overstate things'' to say that there is still ''some disagreement'' between Poland and the United States about Warsaw's role in talks on the future of Germany.
Without giving details, Mr. Seitz said, ''We understand Polish concerns, and we will listen to Polish concerns and we will respond to Polish concerns in a variety of ways and in a variety of places.''

HEADLINE: Budget Minuet in Albany

 BODY:
New Yorkers, confronted with a deficit-ridden state budget and a declining economy, need answers. Instead they're getting piecemeal proposals from their Governor, and little but evasion from Albany's Republican leaders.
Gov. Mario Cuomo has at last broken his frustrating silence and is dribbling out some sketchy plans for dealing with a budget deficit that's grown $1.5 billion in two months. That's far more than can be said for the Republicans. Led by Ralph Marino of Long Island, Senate Republicans don't even acknowledge the problem. 
They turn a blind eye to evidence that New York's economy suffers from the downswing that's attacking the entire Northeast. They ignore the warnings of their own State Comptroller, Edward Regan, also a Republican, and have nothing to say about the queasiness of bond rating agencies. Mr. Marino says he'll consider only spending cuts, without saying what to cut. He'd prefer to let the Democrats make the case for higher taxes, so Republicans can bash Mr. Cuomo in the coming elections. That's what passes for good politics nowadays. Mr. Cuomo has put something on the table but not everything. He says he has a complete plan but can't disclose it while he's negotiating with lawmakers. His call for an increase in the gasoline tax looks sensible. The rest of his tax menu includes extending the sales tax to cover items like nonprescription drugs, a higher corporate tax rate and a new personal property tax on automobiles. Maybe those ideas make sense and maybe they do not. Right now, it's impossible to judge Mr. Cuomo's trial balloons until he turns them into tangible proposals with price tags and consequences attached.
As the Governor acknowledges, the state's fiscal woes go beyond coping with one sizable deficit. The region's economic downswing would fall more softly on New York if the state hadn't got into bad habits. In recent years it borrowed heavily and accumulated an unprecedented $5 billion debt, repeatedly rolled one year's deficit into the next and relied on fiscal gimmicks.
That's why it's troubling that Mr. Cuomo wants to use some of the same tactics to plug budget holes - including the use of one-shot revenues like borrowing from reserve funds. Quick fixes have become all too common in New York.
Mr. Cuomo says he has a three-year program that addresses the state's long-term fiscal problems. He wants to convert $2 billion in short-term borrowing into long-term bonds, impose a spending cap and reduce state borrowing. That's a start, but the public has to hear a lot more.
New Yorkers are shrewd enough to see through the tactics of the Republicans, whose strategy is to sit, wait and pounce on anyone willing to embrace unpopular positions - like taxing and cutting. But New Yorkers need someone to make the hard choices. If the Governor is waiting for the most propitious moment to make public a comprehensive plan, instead of trickling out bits and pieces, that moment has arrived: the deadline for a new state budget is only 10 days away.

HEADLINE: Converting to Peace

 BODY:
Shareholders in Fortress America aren't waiting for Washington to convert from cold war defense to a diversified economic offense. If ''peace dividend'' is the political phrase of the moment, the next one is ''conversion.'' Paying attention to retooling of defense industries from military to consumer production is good sense. As people in California have found, it is also good politics. 
Economic conversion was once anathema to the military-industrial complex of Southern California, notably in conservative Orange County, where nearly 100,000 workers depend on defense-related jobs. But recently in Orange County, defense contractors, unions, community leaders and the director of the Pentagon Office of Economic Adjustment met to discuss how to survive, diversify and thrive in the post-cold-war era.
Contractors want to get ahead of the defense-cut curve and plan for new civilian contracts. Labor wants to protect laid-off defense workers. The business community wants to build a diversified economic base. And Larry Agran, the Mayor of Irvine, wants to show President Bush the potential political dividend of the peace dividend. ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize there's a great public benefit'' from investing it in health care, transportation, housing and the environment, he says. Though a liberal Democrat, Mr. Agran thrives as a maverick in Republican territory. Environmentally conscious conservatives applaud when he says that the Federal Government shouldn't spend ''billions to put guided nuclear missiles on rail cars; what we need is to put thousands of commuters on rail cars.''
Orange County is growing out of dependence on military contracts. But other, older areas face layoffs as bases and plants close. Conversion takes on a wholly different meaning in the Rust Belt than the Sun Belt. If anything, it is more needed in aging cities than in new suburbs.
Conversion efforts have sprung up in Ohio, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Long Island. ''This is where the solution happens, in communities,'' says the Pentagon adjustment director, Dr. Robert Rauner.
Political leaders will be reluctant to cut Pentagon spending, even where they believe cuts to be wise, until they're confident their communities won't face economic ruin. What Mayor Agran demonstrates with his Orange County conference is that the problems of conversion can be attacked successfully without being attacked by the Stealth bomber. Washington might usefully hold its own national conversion conference.

HEADLINE: TV Debates Need Third Party Candidates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Timothy J. Russert of NBC News hits the nail on the head in ''For '92, the Networks Have to Do Better'' (Op-Ed, March 4) when he observes that ''no one was satisfied with the 1988 coverage.''
Half the people qualified to vote in the 1988 election failed to do so because issues were never dealt with. But the debate format suggested by Mr. Russert, which could end up with a monologue and an empty chair, confirms serious misunderstanding of the nature of this problem. 
A debate means nothing when it's between two individuals who endorse one philosophy of government. Most Americans realize that, regardless of the party in power, nothing ever changes. The deficits continue to rise, even with Republicans in charge; and attacks on our civil liberties persist even with Democrats in charge. Foreign meddling is never seriously challenged by either party.
Economic interventionism, inflationism, worldwide police activity and obsession about drugs with disregard for civil liberties, are endorsed by Democrats and Republicans alike. Mild variations of these beliefs offer nothing to 50 percent of the American people, who have come to see politics as a joke and have been denied alternative views by the media.
The Libertarian Party and the New Alliance Party were on virtually every ballot in the country in 1988, a major undertaking considering the horrendous obstacles placed in the way. Yet, these two new parties representing clear alternatives were ignored by 95 percent of all media outlets. The Libertarians, with their principled stand on liberty, and the New Alliance Party, with its principled stand for a socialist agenda, have a lot to offer to spice up the debate and arouse the American people's interest.
If any party can achieve enough ballot status to win the election, theoretically, its candidate deserves a spot in the debates. I can guarantee there would then be no boring debates and no need to have a monologue with an empty chair.

Rockefeller Plea: Turn From Greed To Public Service

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
It might strike cynics as paradoxical to hear David Rockefeller complain about capitalistic greed, but with communism - and New York City's streets - disintegrating, he wondered, what kind of example are Americans and New Yorkers setting for the rest of the world?
''I'm distressed,'' he said, ''by the fact that the institutions that are associated with our society have not been setting a very good example.''
Specifically, he complained about corporate shortsightedness and selfishness. ''Unless the coming generation of leaders in our society sets a good example and not one that people are repulsed by,'' he said, ''we won't be copied and I don't know what will happen.'' 
Mr. Rockefeller was addressing six potential leaders who hope to emulate his success in public service, at least. They are finishing their year as the first David Rockefeller Fellows, a program created by the New York City Partnership to instill in the next generation of local executives the same commitment to corporate citizenship and a stake in the city's future that New York officials tapped during the fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
Mr. Rockefeller recalled the significance of that commitment as he expressed concern about the impact of crime and crumbling streets on the city's future.
''There's hardly anyone I know who hasn't themselves or haven't had close friends who have been mugged, robbed or what not and it doesn't even attract attention,'' he said. ''Even if you have a car you may break an axle.''
 
He cautioned that
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who he said comes from the same background as people who have been disadvantaged and correctly feel they deserve more, will be tempted to do more ''and the only way he can do it is to take measures that will undermine the economic base.'' So far, he said, the Dinkins administration has responded responsibly.
''I don't envy Mayor Dinkins his job,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.
The Partnership was established by Mr. Rockefeller in 1979 to apply the expertise of private industry to public problems. The fellows are being exposed to those problems and potential solutions in education and economic development.
When the program was announced last year, the first applications were all from public or nonprofit agencies - not the companies from among which the Partnership had hoped to recruit. But all six finalists were from private industry. Recruiting for the second class of fellows is to start next month.
It is difficult to measure whether the chill on Wall Street has increased the appeal of volunteer or even full-time public service, but, by some accounts, it has, modestly.
''The 80's were not a great period for schools of public policy,'' said Matthew P. Drennan, director of the public administration program at New York University's Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service. ''But, more and more, students don't see spending their lives increasing a corporation's market share of soap or selling bonds as what they'd like to do.''
He said 124 students have applied for next September's class, compared with 100 the year before. Forty-eight have applied for the school's urban planning program, compared with 36 in 1989.
''The public sector gives young people responsibility far beyond their experience,'' Mitchell Moss, director of the school's Urban Research Center, said.
The partnership's program, in which the fellows volunteer their time, has introduced its participants to ''a new vision of corporate citizenship,'' in the words of Jan C. Childress, coordinator of area development for the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. He said he had already received broad exposure to the city through his full-time job.
''Above and below ground,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.
Several fellows said they were discouraged in their initial attempts at volunteer work. Mr. Rockefeller recalled that he fared better in his first efforts after college, serving as secretary to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia - the first of a series of quasi-public posts as he rose to become chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank.
One was his appointment by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the first chairman of the White House Fellows program. His record, Mr. Rockefeller recalled, was mixed. Among the applicants who were rejected was Elizabeth H. Dole, who is now the United States Secretary of Labor. Among those accepted was David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
His public service, Mr. Rockefeller said, enhanced his life and benefitted his career. Some critics complained that he spent too much time away from the bank, he said, but ''I don't feel particularly apologetic.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins's 2-Pronged Budget Strategy

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In revealing a new gap in New York City's budget for the coming fiscal year, Mayor David N. Dinkins on Monday not only put pressure on the Governor, legislators and other politicians to help him now, but may also have made it easier for himself in deciding how to spend money later.
Like a company that reports bad news in one quarter to clear the books in the hope of better days ahead, Mr. Dinkins announced the new $700 million gap to get his bad news out of the way quickly. The addition is on top of the $1.1 billion gap that the city said it was expecting six weeks ago.
On Monday, the Mayor attributed almost half the new gap to revised projections showing an additional $335 million shortfall in tax revenues. 
But the Mayor effectively decided to further widen the gap by declaring that the city could no longer count on receiving $303 million from the sale of the old site of the New York Coliseum in time to help in the fiscal year that starts on July 1. In doing so, he pleased fiscal monitors, who had criticized him for counting on the money in the first place.
By law the city has to balance the budget each year by closing any gap between planned spending and expected revenues. By removing the Coliseum money now and vowing to balance his budget anyway, Mr. Dinkins put pressure on the opponents of the Coliseum deal, including some Upper West Side politicians who support him, to reach an agreement that would allow the sale to proceed.
He also virtually guaranteed that if the money becomes available later and is put back into the budget, he would decide how to spend it and then be able to take credit for doing so.
 
Change in Jobs, Change in Stance
Mayor Edward I. Koch had originally included the Coliseum money in the operating budget to support a host of programs, but the deal to sell the parcel on Columbus Circle has been held up by lawsuits and revisions in the design of a skyscraper proposed for the site.
As Manhattan Borough President in the Koch administration, Mr. Dinkins had opposed putting the money in the budget. But as Mayor, he said that because the city was depending on it, it had no choice, and he included it in his preliminary budget of $27.8 billion issued on Feb. 1.
Since he won office on a platform of liberal change, Mr. Dinkins has been hemmed in by the city's worsening fiscal condition and by spending for programs under way. He has been forced to defer major plans and to include just a few small, mostly symbolic, social-service initiatives.
In a stern memo to his commissioners on Monday, Mr. Dinkins said he preferred that they eliminate some programs outright rather than keep them barely operating. That is the surest way to trim the budget, and that would give him more flexibility if money becomes available. Then, with those programs no longer even nominally on the books, Mr. Dinkins could propose new programs more easily.
 
'Gruesome Things in There'
In the meantime, of course, the Mayor faces the prospect of no immediate improvement in the economy, and he has to contend with the pain of the new cuts, which could range from delaying the hiring of police officers to closing firehouses to further cutting the number of street sweepers. ''None of it is good,'' he said on Tuesday.
To hammer home his threat, he warned that $500 million more in service cuts, on top of hundreds of millions already made or announced since last fall, would be needed to close the new gap. On Tuesday, Budget Director Philip R. Michael said virtually all agencies had been asked to prepare cuts amounting to 4 percent of their budgets. ''There will be gruesome things in there,'' he said.
But by taking the Coliseum money out of the budget now, Mr. Dinkins forces the City Council, which will vote on the budget in the summer, to share the burden of balancing the spending plan. If Mr. Dinkins kept the money in the budget and it fell through later, he alone would have to shoulder the responsibility for cutting programs.
 
Postponement of Hearing
''It took a lot of guts and it was a good move, and I think it will serve him well,'' said one state official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Mayor also said on Tuesday that his administration was considering asking the Council to postpone the date for submitting the budget, from April 26 to early May, in part to have more time to assess the effects of the state budget due to be adopted next month.
Because of Mr. Dinkins's announcement, the Council said it would delay hearings on the preliminary budget that were to have begun yesterday. That in turn lets the Mayor keep his options open a bit longer.
Several mayoral aides said on Tuesday that the main reason for Mr. Dinkins's latest pronouncement was the continuing bleak prospects for tax revenues. The aides added that he also wanted to remind the state, which is struggling with its own huge budget gaps, that the city needs help and to warn the opponents of the Coliseum deal of the consequences of their actions.
Moreover, by removing the Coliseum money now, the aides said, the Mayor risks relatively little political capital. He appears fiscally responsible and could fault others if the new cuts have to be made. Even if the city does not reap the money from the deal for two or three years, Mr. Dinkins would be able to claim credit for getting it.
The executive director of the State Financial Control Board, Allen J. Proctor, who last week criticized the administration for counting on the Coliseum deal and not cutting the budget enough, praised the Mayor's move.
''We welcome the city's announcement,'' he said. ''Our evaluation of the budget pointed to a number of areas of concern, and the city's steps have substantially reduced the amount of risk.''

HEADLINE: 3 Officers Acquitted in Fatal Struggle With Disturbed Brooklyn Man

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
As dozens of fellow police officers cheered, three officers were acquitted yesterday of assaulting an emotionally disturbed 40-year-old who died shortly after a struggle with the officers two years ago in Brooklyn.
The three officers went to the home of the man, Juan Rodriguez, an unemployed electrician, in response to complaints by neighbors that he was acting violently. Mr. Rodriguez collapsed in the subsequent struggle. An autopsy indicated that he had suffered head injuries and died of a heart attack. 
''I believe that the police officers in this case were confronted with an extremely difficult situation,'' Judge Alan Marrus said in Criminal Court in Brooklyn. He described Mr. Rodriguez as a disturbed man who had broken two doors in his apartment building and terrorized his neighbors.
Supporters of the three officers broke into long, loud cheering when Judge Marrus, who tried the case without a jury, announced the verdict.
The officers are Thomas Mascia, Christopher Rising and Joseph Tripp. They are on modified duty pending the outcome of a departmental investigation, a police spokesman said.
 
Standard of Reasonable Doubt
In announcing the verdict, Judge Marrus said, ''The evidence has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers recklessly or negligently caused physical injury to Mr. Juan Rodriguez.'' Noting that the prosecutor had contended that the officers had treated Mr. Rodriguez as ''a subhuman being'' and would have treated a middle-class person differently, the judge said the contention was ''entirely speculation.''
The judge said officers responding to difficult situations ''should not be second-guessed into a guilty verdict for a crime based on speculation.'' If there was any failure by the authorities, he added, it was ''a lack of sensitivity to the Rodriguez family.'' He observed that when Mrs. Rodriguez had frantically inquired about her husband's condition, she had received a ''cold shoulder from the authorities.''
''I want to express publicly my sympathy to Mrs. Rodriguez and her family for the tragic loss that they have suffered,'' the judge said. ''But I cannot base a verdict on sympathy. I have to base it on evidence.''
The prosecutor, Steven Schwartz, argued in his summation that the officers had assaulted Mr. Rodriguez because he was a poor disturbed Hispanic man. Defense lawyers said the officers had acted properly in restraining someone acting violently.
District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said after the verdict that he had ''allocated the full resources of this office'' to prosecute the case.
''The death of Juan Rodriguez was a tragic incident,'' he added. ''I offer my condolences to his family.''

HEADLINE: Counting the Homeless: A Lonely, Iffy, Wary Job

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Under a steady drizzle, Edward Diaz and Elizabeth Cruz walked briskly along deserted streets and pathways on the Lower East Side of Manhattan shortly after midnight yesterday, two lonely figures in search of a third.
They looked in the lobbies and ground-floor areas of staircases in residential buildings. They looked across playgrounds and parking lots. Frustrated, they even strayed from preassigned sites to check rooftops. 
''Normally there are about a hundred homeless people in this area,'' said Ms. Cruz, who lives in the neighborhood. ''Where are they? Good question.''
 
Rain Hampers the Count
For one full night, thousands of people with a permanent roof over their heads set out to count those without one, trying to back up with numbers the faces they see every day in street doorways, on subway cars and in park benches.
For New Yorkers like Ms. Cruz and Mr. Diaz, two in a nationwide contingent of 15,000 workers who carried out the Census Bureau's count of homeless people, the night ended in disappointment as rain drove many of the homeless away from their regular sleeping quarters.
Other counters contended with danger. The Census Bureau's director, Barbara E. Bryant, said yesterday that no worker was injured on the job. But in Austin, Tex., three enumerators had their car windshield smashed in a wooded area where homeless people camp, and at 2:15 A.M. in Coney Island another team scattered when it heard shots while surveying an abandoned building.
But for many, the experience was a revelation, dispelling preconceived notions about a population they barely knew. And it drove home the seriousness of the homelessness problem. Some counters said they were moved to offer pocket money or a cup of coffee to the most destitute.
A few were horrified to find people sleeping across armrests on benches or exposed to the rain and cold with hardly a shirt on.
 
Teen-Ager at Penn Station
''Can you believe a 15-year old lives at Penn Station?'' said Alex Fernandez, 19, who counted people at transit stations and who was stunned by what he found. ''That is not sad. That is neglect.'' Marty Wolf, 51, an Upper East Side resident, said she used to think people were homeless because ''they were lazy people who don't want to work.'' She said her perceptions changed when she saw shelter residents leaving for work or coming back from work.
''The majority were simply normal people who don't have a place to live,'' she said.
The census-takers had a wide range of backgrounds. They included a Transit Authority bus driver, an unemployed construction foreman, a State Department of Taxation compliance agent and a recently arrived Russian Jewish emigre, homemakers and students. They also included the homeless, most of them recruited at shelters.
The workers were paid $8 an hour for work done in shifts, mostly between 6 P.M. Tuesday and 11 A.M. Wednesday. They also received night differential pay and a $50 bonus for completing their assignment.
 
Some Refuse to Be Counted
Although money was an incentive, many of the workers said they had applied for the job out of curiosity or because they strongly believed in the importance of the count. Most found that they were welcomed, although some encountered grumbling and sometimes outright antagonism.
At the Bellevue Men's Shelter in Manhattan, with a population of nearly 1,000, Barbara Remington, a 60-year-old artist, approached as many as 20 residents who refused to be interviewed.
''I think it's going to be pretty meaningless,'' she said of the demographic count.
Inna Orel, 36, who arrived in New York City barely three months ago, said her overtures to those she tried to count at Pennsylvania Station were often met with a shout to go away. But she enjoyed the overall experience.
''To see New York, to get acquainted with this side of life that usually I don't have a possibility to see, it was a great experience,'' she said.
Carmen M. Luna, 39, a widow and mother of two teen-age daughters, said that whatever apprehensions she had about participating in the count vanished as compassion overtook her.
 
Danger Discounted
Ms. Luna said she had been prompted to apply for the job because ''I feel that there are so many Hispanics that are homeless that need to be counted, so they can get the proper amount of benefits.''
''My parents were terrified, because they thought it was too dangerous,'' she said, ''but I figure if we all take that attitude, we won't solve anything. ''
Dwayne Mayes, 27, who lives in a shelter in Manhattan and worked as both an enumerator, said he supported the count despite criticism by those who feared an undercount would jeopardize financing of programs for the homeless.
''Hopefully it will make people realize that there's a population of homeless people who are not dehumanized and that still maintains self-respect,'' he said. ''Being counted means social services will be provided. We are here, and we are counted now.''

Schwinn Is Building Bikes The U.S. Way in Hungary

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
''A friend of mine came into this factory the other day and said, 'Boy, it's changed; it's hardly recognizable,' '' said Laszlo Nogradi, general manager of the Schwinn Bicycle Company's 14-month-old joint venture in Hungary.
Since arriving in Hungary, Schwinn has put sophisticated welding and painting machines in the crowded, bustling, high-ceilinged factory in Budapest. The Chicago-based company has also accelerated the pace of two 100-foot-long assembly lines where shiny bicycle frames move past, as workers attach wheels, chains, pedals, gears and brakes.
For Schwinn, the joint venture seems to be a perfect marriage, and company officials are delighted with their move into Eastern Europe. ''We came to Hungary because we made a decision that we needed to become a more global company,'' said Steven M. Bina, director of Schwinn's European operations. ''We wouldn't be here if there wasn't money to be made.'' 
Schwinn is one of some 100 American companies that have set up joint ventures in Hungary, and its experience is typical. With modest investments in modernization and the introduction of some Western personnel management techniques, they have created far more efficient and profitable factories, although cramped conditions and 19th-century layouts remain.
American investors are swarming to do deals in Hungary, thanks to its attractive joint venture laws, tax breaks for Western investors, and liberal rules allowing foreign investors who create jobs here to repatriate their profits. There are big joint ventures like General Electric's $150 million investment to buy a majority stake in Tungsram, Eastern Europe's largest light bulb company, and smaller ones like Levi Strauss & Company's $1 million investment in a jeans factory.
In late 1988, Schwinn wanted to expand its presence on the Continent and was looking for a low-cost way to do that. At the same time, Csepel Bicycle, Hungary's largest bike manufacturer, with annual production of 200,000, was seeking a wealthy Western partner to help upgrade its operation.
With a new age dawning in Eastern Europe, Csepel officials knew that their heavy bikes with a clunky design and dull paint could not compete.
''We wanted to improve the quality of our bikes, and we wanted someone with expertise to help us do that,'' said Mr. Nogradi, who wears a blue work uniform around the factory.
Schwinn, a family-owned company that controls 51 percent of the joint venture, has pumped millions of dollars into improving the Hungarian plant. It will not say just how much it has spent, but a new high-temperature welding system cost several hundred thousand dollars and the ''electrostatic'' painting system cost more than $1 million.
Schwinn has changed the order of production so that all metal-cutting is finished before, not after, a fine, even spray of peacock blue or ruby red paint is put onto electrically charged bike frames.
''We've tried to liven things up.'' from the dull colors of Communist days, said Mr. Bina, a tall, athletic native of Iowa with a brown mustache.
The most significant change, however, is in personnel management. The joint venture is producing as many bikes as the old Csepel plant, but with 15 percent fewer employees, thanks to a new American-style incentive-based wage system.
Workers can get bonuses of up to 40 percent of their base pay if their work exceeds a management-set goal. To win the loyalty of the 380 workers, the Schwinn-Csepel venture has pegged its average wages - about $210 a month - some 30 percent higher than the national average, but it prohibits its employees from holding the second and third jobs that many Hungarians work.
Schwinn did extensive testing of the work force it inherited, demoting some people and promoting others. It put most of the employees on probation for three months while evaluating them.
''We didn't have to drag anyone kicking and screaming,'' Mr. Bina said, adding that by and large Hungarians seemed eager for change, even if it entailed some pain at first.
Before the joint venture was formed, the plant managers earned just 15 percent more than the average workers. Now the differential is several times that, and Schwinn offers sizable wage increases to workers capable of taking on more responsiblity.

HEADLINE: Volatility Jolts Stocks In Tokyo

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, March 22

 BODY:
The deeply troubled Tokyo stock market went through its most volatile day ever today as the plummeting value of the yen and Government efforts to strengthen it set share prices swinging wildly and left investors and market professionals stunned.
Those gyrations left the closely watched Nikkei 225-stock average down 963.85 points, at 29,843.34. The 3.1 percent decline was the Tokyo market's 10th-worst percentage drop.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange went into a nose dive this morning and declined 6 percent by its midday break, in spite of the fact that only half the shares could open for trading because of huge imbalances of sell orders. By itself, that would have represented the second-largest decline in the market's history, and it followed a string of steep dives in the last two months that have turned what had been virtually the world's most stable major market into its shakiest. 
 
Government Actions
But shortly after the lunch hour both the Bank of Japan and the United States Federal Reserve were reported to have begun large-scale interventions to strengthen the yen. The Japanese central bank spent more than $1 billion, currency traders said, buying yen and selling dollars, while the Fed intervened heavily in Singapore.
In addition, Government officials leaked word that Finance Ministry officials had contacted leading Japanese corporations and financial institutions and encouraged them not to sell yen and buy dollars.
The Japanese Government also confirmed American reports that Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of Finance, would leave Friday for Washington, where he would discuss the exchange rate situation with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and other top American officials. By repeating these reports, the ministry's actions were taken as a hint that there may be further coordinated intervention to stabilize the markets.
 
Dollar as High as 155.40 Yen
Along with the intervention, those reports knocked the dollar back from a peak of 155.40 yen - it's highest point against the yen in three years -down to 154.70 yen, still its highest level in more than a year.
In a chain reaction, that move caused Japanese bond prices to strengthen, which caused a rebound in share prices of more than 1,000 points at one time. In effect, the market went through its second-steepest decline and its second-sharpest upward jump, both in the same day.
It was the first time since December 1988 that the index had fallen below 30,000. The 3.1 percent decline today left the market down a steep 8.5 percent this week.
At midday, the index had fallen 1,836 points, spurring the Government action to avoid having the rout turn into a crash.
Analysts, traders and economists said that buying support had all but dried up, paralyzing the market. In addition to the number of individual shares that could not open this morning because of the wave of sell orders, the stock-index futures market was unable to trade because of the pressure.
''It is getting panicky,'' said Toyoharu Tsutsui, a managing director in the equity department of CS First Boston (Japan), said of the morning session. ''It is an ugly situation. There are no buyers at all. None.''
A senior securities executive said of the morning plunge, ''There is a total loss of confidence, period.''
The latest blow came in the reaction to the move by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday to raise the official discount rate a full percentage point, to 5.25 percent. It was the fourth increase in that benchmark short-term rate in the last 10 months. The rate has now more than doubled since May. The increases, the central bank has said, have been intended to nip inflationary pressures in the bud and to bolster the sagging yen.
The Fed's action in Singapore was said to have been effective in turning the dollar around - temporarily. Many market experts said they still expect further declines in the yen and the Tokyo stock market.
''We don't see this thing turning around quickly,'' added Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia. ''The authorities have taken insufficient measures.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japanese to Meet on Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that a meeting Friday between Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his Japanese counterpart is intended to head off major trade disputes this summer and to consider moves to check the recent fall of the yen.
The five-hour talks in Los Angeles between Mr. Brady and the Japanese Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, come as the United States and Japan move into a critical phase of their economic relationship. The talks, disclosed by Secretary Brady on Tuesday before he testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee, follow by less than three weeks a hastily arranged meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif.
At that meeting, Mr. Kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions a top priority of his Government, but questions remain about whether the verbal commitments will be turned into significant market-opening moves. 
 
Proposals From Tokyo
Makoto Utsumi, the deputy minister for international affairs of the Japanese Finance Ministry, was in Washington this week to help prepare for the Los Angeles talks. American officials said that he brought with him a series of preliminary proposals - prepared in Tokyo after Mr. Kaifu's meeting with Mr. Bush - that are aimed at defusing some of the major trade problems.
Mr. Utsumi and American trade and Treasury officials discussed the proposals Tuesday at a northern Virginia conference retreat named Airlie House. Among the Japanese concessions discussed were stiffening penalties for antitrust violations, relaxing restrictions on opening large retail stores, increasing spending on public works, abolishing tax breaks that could bring down the price of urban land and encouraging buying of American super computers and satellites.
 
Part of Previous Effort
The concessions discussed, execpt for those involving supercomputers and satellites and some others, were among those already being sought by the United States under the negotiations known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, an effort begun last summer in Japan that is intended to open Japanese markets and make industry in both countries more competitive.
But one American official said that Mr. Utsumi was told that the Japanese proposals he outlined Tuesday at the Airlie House were still inadequate.
''We have had some progress in the discussions,'' said one Administration official in Los Angeles. ''But it's clearly been insufficient and we are looking to have an in-depth exchange on the trade issues.''
At the same time, the official stressed that the meeting was not intended for ''any great deal-making'' but rather for ''advancing the dialogue on these critical trade issues at a very important time.''
Treasury officials also said they doubted there would be ''any new policy approaches'' to the problems of the sinking yen. As one official put it: ''The meeting was called simply to touch base and have an exchange of views.''
 
Statement to Be Sought
''At this stage,'' the official said, he did not see the need for any formal statement from the Los Angeles meeting to try to influence the markets to halt the slide of the yen. Japanese officials have said, however, that Mr. Hashimoto is likely to seek such a statement from the Treasury Secretary.
The yen, now trading at around 154 to the dollar, is at its lowest level against the dollar in more than three years and has also dropped against other leading currencies.
The Los Angeles meeting is preliminary to a broader gathering on April 7 in Paris of the finance ministers of the Group of Seven nations -the United States, Japan, France, Britain, West Germany, Canada and Italy.
The Group of Seven meets several times a year to try to coordinate international economic policies. The April meeting was called chiefly to take stock of German unification and its impact on world economies.

Money-Fund Yields Are Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were up for the week that ended yesterday.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund increased by 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.96 percent. The 30-day average yield rose by a basis point, to 7.94 percent. 
The assets of taxable funds rose by $629 million for the week, to a total of $384.3 billion, with institutional assets down by $221 million, to $80.4 billion, and consumer assets up by $850 million, to $303.9 billion. Analysts at Donoghue's said that amount of money going into consumer funds was considered normal.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased by a day, to 44. The analysts noted that the number maturity days was at a high level not seen for some time. The fund managers, they say, are not concerned about a rise in short-term rates and have been increasing the days to take advantage of current yields.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, Donoghue's found that the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., remained on top, where it has been for five weeks. The fund reported a return of 8.83 percent, up from 8.79 percent last week.
 
Tax-Exempt Yields Rise
The yields of tax-exempt funds were also up for the week.
Assets increased by $256 million, to $77.9 billion, with the average seven-day compounded yield up by 14 basis points, to 5.42 percent. The sharp increase in yields, some analysts at Donoghue's said, reflects yields in the tax-exempt market trying to catch up with the rest of fixed-income market.
For investors seeking a comparable return in taxable securities, the equivalent return for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is 7.52 percent, with 8.60 percent being the equivalent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
Donoghue's said the top-performing tax-free fund this week was the Spartan Pennsylvania Municipal Money Market Portfolio, distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation in Boston. The return was 6.07 percent, about 65 basis points higher than the average.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed that yields on bank money market accounts and six-month certificates of deposit were unchanged at 6.25 percent and 7.88 percent, respectively. The C.D.'s with longer maturities were up modestly, with a one-year certificate up by 4 basis points, to 8.01 percent, and a two-and-a-half-year up by 5 basis points, to 8.01 percent. The average yield on five-year certificates rose by 3 basis points, to 8.06 percent.

HEADLINE: World Trade Grew in 1989

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 21

 BODY:
International trade volume could slow slightly this year, with inflation and rising interest rates in industrialized nations hampering expansion, the world's main trade forum reported today.
Experts at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also reported that the value of international merchandise trade exceeded $3 trillion for the first time in 1989. 
GATT experts predicted the volume of goods traded internationally would grow by 5 percent to 6 percent in 1990, the eighth straight year of expansion. The value of goods traded on world markets last year rose by 7.5 percent from 1988, to $3.1 trillion, the report stated.
In 1989 the United States regained its position as the world's leading exporter after three years in second place behind West Germany, the report said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Off in Light Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell in light trading yesterday, as dealers took profits after Tuesday's rally.
In part, activity was more subdued than in recent sessions because Japanese financial markets were closed yesterday. Rumors that large Japanese institutions have been big buyers of zero-coupon Treasury bonds were instrumental in fueling the run-up in prices on Tuesday.
Even with the price dip, traders said that market psychology has shifted slightly over the last few days. 
''The market is kind of fun right now,'' one government bond trader said. ''People have come back into the market and are trading again. Every day there have been buyers, and that is making for better trading.''
That attitude could change over the next few weeks, since the Treasury is expected to be a heavy seller of new securities.
The auctions will begin next week, and yesterday the Treasury announced it will sell $10 billion worth of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $8 billion of four-year notes on Wednesday.
Following the announcement the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.66 percent, and the four-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.70 percent.
 
Traders Increasingly Optimistic
With note yields at current levels, traders said demand for the new issues should be strong. And some economists, citing an increase in the nation's savings rate, are becoming increasingly optimistic that the Federal budget deficit, which is running at an annual rate of about $150 billion, could possibly be financed without the help of foreign investors.
''The budget deficit is easily financed, and increasingly the money will come from internal savings,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Mr. Yardeni said that personal savings amounted to $206 billion last year, compared with $102 billion in 1987.
''I expect the savings rate will continue to rise this year, and that is one of the reasons I like bonds,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''Also, the economic fundamentals are not as bearish as many investors have concluded.''
That view was not manifested in Treasury bond prices yesterday, which gave ground after several days of strong gains.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100 1/8, down 3/8 point, to yield 8.48 percent. #10-Year Note Issues Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 19/ 32, down 7/32, to yield 8.56 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 13/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.63 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were flat.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.94 percent, unchanged on the day. And six-month bills were unchanged at a late offered rate of 7.90 percent.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a $1.4 billion asset-backed financing for Citicorp.
The issue consists of four parts, including $750 million of three-year securities and $500 million of seven-year securities.
The 9.30 percent three-year securities were priced at $99.859 to yield 9.342 percent, 70 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on the 8 3/8 percent three-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The 9 1/2 percent seven-year notes were priced at $99.406, to yield 9.57 percent, 95 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent seven-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Those two issues carry AAA ratings from both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction.
An underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers priced a $100 million offering of two-year notes for the Union Camp Corporation.
The 9 1/2 percent notes were priced at 100, or par, 97 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent two-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues in the secondary market dipped by about 1/8 point.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was very lethargic, according to participants. Prices of most issues were unchanged to down 1/8 point.

The Dollar Rises Modestly; Gold Declines a Bit in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved up modestly against most major currencies, including the yen, the pound and the West German mark, in slow trading yesterday, as traders sought a safe investment haven. Gold prices posted minor declines in domestic dealings after much larger losses overseas.
One reason that investors sought safety was increasing tensions in Lithuania, which declared its independence from the Soviet Union on March 11. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered Lithuanians yesterday to turn in their weapons, a day after the Baltic republic's Government demanded an end to Soviet military maneuvers. 
Despite Japan's one percentage point increase in a key interest rate on Monday, the dollar rose to 154.37 Japanese yen late in New York, from 154.20 yen late Tuesday. Tokyo markets were closed for Japan's national holiday on the vernal equinox.
 
Effect of Uncertainties in Britain
Also contributing to interest in the dollar was the uncertain outlook for Britain's governing Conservatives, because of rising prices, high interest rates, the deterioration of the Government-run health service and a new tax on every adult to finance municipal services.
The British pound slipped to $1.5955 late in New York, a weakening from late Tuesday's $1.6005. The pound closed yesterday in London at $1.5965, down from Tuesday's $1.6105. It stood at $1.7145 on Feb. 22.
Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Bank in Chicago, said activity in the dollar was subdued, lacking significant corporate or interbank trading. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Tuesday, included: 1.7100 West German marks, up from 1.7048; 1.5225 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.768 French francs, up from 5.7575; 1,259.75 Italian lire, up from 1,258.00, and 1.17875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17765.
Selected rates for the dollar late in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's levels, were: 1.7070 West German marks, up from 1.6965; 1.5192 Swiss francs, up from 1.5157; 5.7575 French francs, up from 5.7340; 1.9230 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9107; 1,257.25 Italian lire, up from 1,253.50, and 1.1769 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1792.
Gold bullion prices fell back after traders took profits on the metal, which had crept above $400 an ounce on Monday.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery settled at $391.80 an ounce, 40 cents lower than Tuesday. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $391.90 for an ounce of gold, 50 cents lower than Tuesday's late bid.
Gold closed in London, the major foreign market, at a bid of $391.75 an ounce, down from $398. Silver was mixed. In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.055 an ounce, up from Tuesday's settlement of $5.043. Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.06, down from Tuesday's late bid of $5.09.

HEADLINE: Nunn Opens a Double Attack In Military Spending Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee sharply criticized the Defense Department today for spending plans that he said were based on outdated assumptions about the military threats facing the United States.
But he also assailed some of his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill, saying that the deep cuts in Pentagon spending they were seeking could bring disruptive problems for the military.
The Armed Services chairman, Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat whose views on military issues are influential among his Democratic colleagues, intensified the debate over Pentagon spending with a speech on the Senate floor. He said the Defense Department had failed to develop a new military strategy in response to changes in the Soviet Union and Europe. 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney rejected Mr. Nunn's criticism. In a luncheon address at the National Press Club, Mr. Cheney defended his spending requests and said he had given the services guidance for planning the military budget through 1997 that assumes continued political change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and new arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington.
In a broad rebuttal to recent Congressional criticism, Mr. Cheney complained in his address that lawmakers were offering ''complaints instead of solutions.''
Mr. Cheney noted that his speech was prepared before Mr. Nunn spoke. ''But obviously, if the shoe fits, wear it, Sam,'' Mr. Cheney added.
Mr. Nunn's speech was his first important address on military policy since the Pentagon's budget request for the 1991 fiscal year was submitted to Congress in January. He emphasized that neither the Pentagon nor his fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill who have called for deep reductions in military spending had made the systematic, thoughtful analysis needed to reassess the nation's security needs and to begin an orderly reduction of military forces.
The Pentagon has proposed a 1991 budget of $295 billion, a 2.6 percent decrease from the 1990 level once the effects of inflation are taken into account. That does not include about $11 billion in spending for nuclear weapons program by the Department of Energy. The New York Times has reported that Administration officials have suggested that President Bush would be willing to reduce military expenditures for the 1991 fiscal year by $7 billion. But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and the chief Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, have denied that Mr. Bush has agreed to this.
In his speech today, Mr. Nunn specifically assailed proposals by fellow Democrats to make cuts of up to $20 billion.
 
Comments Aimed at Sasser
In comments clearly aimed at Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Nunn said reductions of that magnitude would place too much emphasis on achieving immediate cuts and would force large and disruptive layoffs of military personnel, creating serious morale problems and hampering the United States' ability to respond to future threats.
Mr. Nunn did not outline his own proposals for reshaping military strategy and spending, saying he would address that in future speeches. But implicit in his remarks today was a view that both the Pentagon and its critics had focused too much on the short-term issue of identifying savings in the 1991 budget instead of rethinking fundamental military issues and developing a long-term approach.
''With threat, strategy and program assumptions that are, at a minimum, two years out of date, we are left with very important blanks in the fiscal 1991 defense budget,'' Senator Nunn said of the Pentagon's budget proposal.
''I am constantly being asked for a bottom-line defense number,'' Mr. Nunn said. ''I don't know of any logical way to arrive at such a figure without analyzing the threat; without determining what changes in our strategy should be made in light of the changes in the threat; and then determing what force structure and weapons programs we need to carry out this revised strategy.
 
No Clear Consensus
''To decide on the size of the defense budget without first going through this process would be little better than pulling a number out of the air.''
The differences between Mr. Nunn and Mr. Cheney, and Mr. Nunn and Mr. Sasser, reflect the absence of any clear consensus in the capital about how to respond to the changes in Europe.
Senator Sasser rejected Mr. Nunn's charge that his proposed cuts would severely disrupt the military.
''Certainly it is true that there will be disruptions as we move from a wartime buildup to a peacetime economy. There are always disruptions when Government reduces spending,'' Senator Sasser said.
''The issue is whether spending $300 billion annually for defense is justified in a post-cold war world. I think Senator Nunn has laid out a compelling case that it is not,'' he added.
 
Cheney Calls His Budget Prudent
Defense Secretary Cheney said today that his budget proposals were a prudent response to political changes in Moscow and Europe and that deep cuts would be risky.
But Mr. Nunn said that Mr. Cheney's 1991 budget and his five-year military spending plan for the fiscl years 1991 through 1995 contained ''five big blanks.''
Mr. Nunn said the Pentagon's assessment of the military threat ''is rooted in the past.'' Pentagon officials have said that 1991 is a transitional year, asserting that changes will be made in the assessments of foreign threats once reviews are completed of issues like how much warning the United States might have a Soviet attack.
''The development of a new military strategy that responds to the changes in the threat has not yet occurred,'' Senator Nunn added, dismissing arguments by Mr. Cheney that the Pentagon has made adequate adjustments for the political changes in Europe by preparing plans to reduce American troops in central Europe to 195,000.
Mr. Nunn also complained that the Pentagon's five-year spending plan is incomplete because it has identified only $70 billion of the $167 billion in budget cuts needed to meet its own projected spending requests. The Pentagon acknowledges that it is still preparing a detailed five-year plan. But Mr. Nunn said, ''I am certain that more programs will have to be terminated than the Defense Department has recommended so far.''
Mr. Nunn also complained that the Pentagon has not told Congress what the size and structure of the military will be over the next five years and has not completed important reviews of major weapons systems.
In response to this criticism, Pentagon officials note that the Defense Department has proposed eliminating 5 of the Army's 28 active and reserve divisions and doing away with 5 tactical air wings, among other cuts. But many Pentagon officials concede that further cuts in the size of the military are likely to be needed.
Those officials also acknowledge that they are still conducting reviews of some major weapons programs, asserting that it takes time to adjust American weapons programs to a changing world.
''I hope these blanks will be filled in by the Defense Department, but the Congress will have to act if the Defense Department doesn't,'' Senator Nunn warned. ''At this time, we have no indication of when or if this information will be provided.''

HEADLINE: Baker Reports a Pledge by de Klerk

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa had told him that his Government was on an irreversible course toward creating a nonracial democracy.
Addressing reporters in Cape Town after a one-hour meeting with Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Baker gestured toward the South African President and said: ''May I repeat what you told me at the conclusion of our meeting? 'That we are engaged here in South Africa in an irreversible process that we will follow to its logical conclusion.' ''
Mr. de Klerk's use of the word ''irreversible'' was clearly not accidental. Leading American proponents of continued economic sanctions against South Africa like Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania, have repeatedly said that these punitive measures must not be ended until apartheid is on an irreversible track toward dissolution. South Africans said that only lately has Mr. de Klerk begun to use this expression in his public statements. 
 
Baker Deeply Impressed
After the talks in Cape Town today -Mr. Baker also met with black opposition leaders and with Foreign Minister R. F. Botha - reporters traveling on Mr. Baker's plane were told that the Secretary of State was deeply impressed by Mr. de Klerk's stated commitment to end in the very near future the state of emergency declared in 1986.
As impressed as Mr. Baker was Wednesday by the black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, he was said to be no less taken with Mr. de Klerk in their first meeting.
The reporters were told that Mr. Baker, a novice in African diplomacy, might be somewhat naive in his assessment, but nevertheless felt that Mr. de Klerk was ''absolutely serious.''
The reporters were told that in the view of those aboard the plane the South Africans are committed. and that changes that were taking place in other parts of the world were likely to be repeated in South Africa.
 
Two Sides Still Far Apart
On April 11, Mr. de Klerk and the African National Congress will begin talks on removing obstacles to formal negotiations on power sharing - obstacles like the state of emergency and the continued confinement of political prisoners. Both sides have been making conciliatory statements, but they remain far apart on what a ''new South Africa'' should look like.
Mr. Baker's visit was the first by an American Secretary of State to South Africa since Cyrus R. Vance came in 1978. Mr. Baker left reporters with the impression that the visit signaled the beginning of a new relationship, on a much higher level, between the Bush Administration and South Africa provided that Mr. de Klerk continues moving forward. Mr. Baker and Mr. de Klerk discussed a date for his proposed visit to Washington. The final announcement will be made after consultations with the White House.
Mr. Baker was understood to have told aides that when Foreign Minister Botha told him at a meeting in Rome in February 1989 that a de Klerk Government would be committed to ending apartheid and instituting majority rule, he did did not believe the South African. Reporters were told today that Mr. Baker ''believes them totally now when they say they have made a commitment and will follow through on it.''
Mr. Baker was said to have told Mr. de Klerk that the South African's moves - releasing Mr. Mandela, legalizing the African National Congress and agreeing to open talks with the it -were ''courageous in light of the obvious political pressures he is subject to.''
Earlier today, after talks with leaders of the African National Congress, Mr. Baker held an impromptu news conference accompanied by the black nationalists. A senior official of the congress, Govan Mbeki, used the opportunity to criticize the Secretary of State for meeting Mr. de Klerk on South African soil, echoing criticisms made by Mr. Mandela on Wednesday in Windhoek.
''We are not happy that he has come here to consult with the South African Government,'' Mr. Mbeki said, adding that such a move would only ease pressures on Mr. de Klerk before he has made any real changes in the system of apartheid.
Mr. Mbeki said that the African National Congress's message to Mr. Baker, the American Government and the American people was that they ''should continue to impose the pressures which they have been on the South African Government and not relax them at all until such times that positions will have been made clear.''

HEADLINE: In Namibia, South African Is Center of Attention

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINDHOEK, Namibia, March 22

 BODY:
President F. W. de Klerk has used the celebration of Namibian independence to engage in perhaps the most extensive and varied international diplomacy that a South African leader has undertaken since apartheid was ushered in 42 years ago.
Mr. de Klerk came here officially to surrender South Africa's stewardship over Namibia. But he stayed on to score a series of diplomatic coups, as heads of state and foreign ministers all but queued up to inquire what he was doing at home.
President de Klerk had discussions here with the Presidents of Egypt, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, Mali, Zambia and Yugoslavia, and the Prime Minister of Cape Verde. He had met previously with the leaders of Mozambique and Zambia, but met the others for the first time. 
He also held first meetings with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Ireland, Finland, West Germany, Sweden and Spain, as well as other officials from France, Italy and Norway. And he spent an hour with Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations, which has supervised Namibia's transition to independence.
 
Mandela Draws Spotlight
The only other visitor to Namibia enjoying such attention was Nelson Mandela, who held meetings in which he put across the views of the African National Congress, which has fought to end white minority rule in South Africa. In recent statements, Mr. Mandela has called for the continued isolation of South Africa to speed political change there.
A South African diplomat said Mr. de Klerk's talks, which took place over little more than two days, entailed the most concentrated diplomatic activity by a leader of his Government since before South Africa quit the Commonwealth under pressure in 1961.
But a South African journalist said he believed that such exposure was last accorded to Prime Minister Jan Smuts, who was defeated in 1948 by the National Party, which established apartheid and remains in power.
Mr. de Klerk saw Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who represented the United States at Namibia's independence celebration, back in South Africa today.
Before the two took separate flights to Cape Town this morning, Mr. de Klerk suggested at a news conference here that South Africa was breaking out of its isolation in the world because he had undertaken the gradual dismantling of apartheid.
 
'We Mean What We Say'
His meetings, he said, showed that ''the international community now accepts that drastic change is going to take place in South Africa, that we mean what we say when we say that we want to negotiate.''
''From that acceptance flows a much more constructive and positive approach by the international community,'' Mr. de Klerk said.
In virtually all of his meetings, Mr. de Klerk was asked to explain the changes he was instituting in South Africa. This afforded him an opportunity to explain that he wanted to negotiate with all leaders of the country's black majority and not only representatives of the African National Congress, who are scheduled to meet him April 11.
The South African President also emphasized that South Africa was essential to the economic development of southern Africa, which includes Namibia.
He reminded some black leaders that it was in their interest to cooperate with South Africa, now that the concern of the West was turning to other areas like Eastern Europe.
 
United Front Suggested
''The nations of southern Africa are in danger of becoming marginalized internationally unless they present a united front and benefit from the resources of the region as a whole,'' Mr. de Klerk said in a statement today summing up his meetings.
His contacts were significant more for their variety than their contents. Only one black African country, Malawi, has diplomatic relations with South Africa. But Mr. de Klerk had talks with seven black heads of state or government, including Namibia's new President, Sam Nujoma.
He also met with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity, which has excluded South Africa from membership because of its racial policies.
The most interesting meeting, a South African official said, was the two-hour meeting that Mr. de Klerk had with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, during which they compared notes on the changes set in motion in their two countries. Mr. de Klerk today described his talks with Mr. Shevardnadze as ''enlightening and informative''.
 
A Meeting With Nujoma
The Soviet Union broke off diplomatic ties with South Africa in 1956, and Moscow became a political and financial patron of the African National Congress. The two countries recently renewed contacts at lower level in connection with the political settlement in southern Africa that linked Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.
Mr. de Klerk also said he had a short but rewarding meeting with President Nujoma, whose South-West Africa People's Organization fought a guerrilla war against South African rule in Namibia for 23 years. The South African President said it was clear from Mr. Nujoma's side that their countries ''should remain good friends.''
Namibia has not established diplomatic relations with South Africa, but its economy remains tied to its neighbor. The two countries look likely to exchange trade missions that will function unofficially as legations.
South Africa has such trade missions with Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho.
''Having been involved in every sphere of life in Namibia, the fact that we are no longer here leaves a sort of a vacuum,'' Mr. de Klerk told reporters.
''There are many spheres where we have an involvement, where we have an interface with Namibia and it is necessary to structure our cooperation.''

HEADLINE: Bush Position on Art Group Evokes Protests From Right

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The refusal by the Bush Administration to endorse restrictions on the content of Federally financed arts programs sparked fierce protests from the social and religious right today in what may turn out to be the first major test of the President's ability to keep ardent conservatives as happy members of his party.
Already edgy that the Republican Party is softening its opposition to abortion, social and religious conservatives responded angrily today to Mr. Bush's announcement Wednesday that the Administration would not support their call for legislation to deal with what they consider objectionable art.
The White House switchboard was deluged with telephone calls from around the country protesting the Administration position, the first time that Mr. Bush has directly defied the wishes of the social conservatives who were a crucial element of Ronald Reagan's coalition but have been feeling increasingly isolated of late.
Legislation to control the content of Federally financed art work is favored by standard-bearers of the moral and religious right like Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and the Rev. Pat Robertson. 
 
Conservatives Press on Issue
In speeches, fund-raising letters and on Mr. Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, conservatives have been pressing the case that the National Endowment for the Arts has been giving taxpayer money to support art that, in their view, is obscene, promotes homosexuality or is in other ways objectionable.
Some conservatives said they would fight the White House, while others, like the Rev. Louis Sheldon, head of the Traditional Values Coalition, an evangelical lobbying group in Anaheim, Calif., said they could not believe that Mr. Bush knew what members of his Administration were saying in his name or that he had seen the sort of art being financed by the Government.
''If I found out he had approved it, I would ask him to retract it,'' Mr. Sheldon said today about the statements from both White House spokesmen and from John E. Frohnmayer, head of the National Endowment for the Arts.
In the face of the protest, Mr. Frohnmayer issued a statement today emphasizing that he was just as opposed to obscenity as the conservatives who were demanding legislation.
''I will be diligent that obscenity will not be funded by the endowment,'' he said.
 
Criticism From Robertson
On his 700 Club television program today, Mr. Robertson avoided any mention of Mr. Bush, but attacked both the endowment and the Democratic chairman of the subcommittee considering arts legislation, Representative Pat Williams of Montana. Both Mr. Williams and Mr. Frohnmayer had criticized Mr. Robertson on Wednesday.
Mr. Williams praised Mr. Bush for a ''very courageous'' decision that ''isolates a small minority of right-wing religious zealots.''
Mr. Robertson, who ran against Mr. Bush in the 1988 Republican primaries, bridled at that characterization and said his information came from mainstream publications.
Politicians say the brewing fight between the White House and the right on the arts issue illustrates a much larger strain in the Republican coalition as candidates from Pennsylvania to California secure their conservative credentials by tough stands against crime and taxes while then moving to the middle on social issues like abortion.
The President and his handpicked party chairman, Lee Atwater, have been encouraging this move with speeches about how the Republican Party is a ''big tent'' with room for all positions.
 
Broad Position Is Defended
''It's the price of becoming a majority party,'' said Otto Boss, campaign director for Senator Pete Wilson's Republican bid for Governor of California. Senator Wilson has been attacked by some conservatives for his stand in favor of a woman's right to abortion and his acceptance of at least some rights for homosexuals.
''If we're going to be a majority party, we're going to have to have some breadth,'' Mr. Boss added. ''We are essentially in California a conservative party and we have a conservative heading it in Pete Wilson. But then there'll be various shades of gray along the way.''
That attitude is clearly shared at the White House and Republican headquarters, but Mr. Bush, who was always viewed with suspicion from the right, has managed, nevertheless, to stay on good terms with the religious right, which helped elect him.
But now the confrontation is more direct, and the cultural schism Mr. Bush so successfully overcame in his 1988 election drive has again become manifest.
''I think it's a disgrace,'' said Michael Schwartz, a resident fellow at Paul M. Weyrich's Free Congress Foundation, a conservative research group, speaking about the Administration's decision. ''I think George Bush keeps the wrong company. The social set in which he customarily travels would look on someone like Jesse Helms as an ignorant redneck and someone like Robert Mapplethorpe as a great creative spirit. They're entitled to their opinion, but they have no right to take public funds and subsidize this kind of stuff.''
It was an exhibition of the late Mr. Mapplethorp's photographs, which include pictures of naked men and children, that has helped stir the furor directed at the National Endowment for the Arts. The endowment helped pay for the Mapplethorpe exhibition.
Many political analysts saw the Administration's stand on the arts as part of a larger effort to appeal to a crucial generation of voters, what Linda Divall, the Republican pollster, described as the ''emerging coalition of baby boomers who have an interest in more than just the economy and foreign policy.''
Mr. Schwartz said that he understood this appeal but that he thought the party was making a mistake. ''It's very alienating to people like me,'' he said. Mr. Schwartz, a Democrat, said he voted Republican in the last three Presidential elections because of the party's stand on cultural issues. ''I don't have to vote in the next Presidential election.''

HEADLINE: Marathon Oil to Sell a Cleaner-Burning Gasoline

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 22

 BODY:
The Marathon Oil Company, in an effort to popularize a cleaner-burning gasoline, says it will begin selling in limited quantities the first reformulated unleaded gasolines that can be burned by virtually all car engines.
Two previously announced efforts to sell reformulated fuel have been more limited in scope. In California ARCO offers a reformulated leaded gasoline that can be used by cars made before catalytic converters were required equipment. Conoco and Phillips Petroleum have been selling a reformulated unleaded gasoline in Denver, but only in the regular or lowest octane grade. 
 
Available on Monday
Marathon, a subsidiary of the USX Corporation, said on Wednesday that it would begin selling what it calls ''Amaraclean'' gasoline in regular (87 octane), midgrade (89 octane) and premium (92 octane) at 161 service stations in the Detroit area starting Monday. Marathon said it would absorb the additional cost of producing the new gasoline for the time being, but later consumers would inevitably pay extra for the fuel if it was widely accepted.
''People might think that because this is reformulated they will have less performance - that isn't true,'' said Richard White, Marathon vice president of marketing. ''We want to make sure people want clean air and will try our gasoline.''
While Congress debates a clean-air bill, some legislators favor a provision that would force the auto industry to produce vehicles that could burn methanol or some other cleaner-burning fuel to reduce pollution. The petroleum and auto industries oppose such a measure, contending that cleaning up gasoline can accomplish the same thing at far less cost and trouble.
Emissions from engines using Marathon's fuel will be lower in carbon monoxide and in unburned hydrocarbons that cause the formation of ozone, a prime component of smog. Marathon said the new gasoline would result in a 20 percent reduction in unburned hydrocarbon emissions and a 14 percent reduction in carbon monoxide.
 
Three Improvements
The Marathon gasoline makes three improvements in clean-air technology. By adding methyl tertiary butyl ether, the fuel contains more oxygen and burns more completely, thus reducing carbon monoxide emissions. The fuel also contains less butane, which evaporates easily and contributes to the production of smog. Some hydrocarbons that do not burn well, like benzene and toluene, are reduced, according to Ed Ledico, a technical specialist for Marathon.
Marathon gasoline is sold at about 4,500 service stations nationwide but the company is currently limiting sales of the new fuel to the Detroit area because of its limited capacity to produce methyl tertiary butyl ether.
Donald R. Buist, director of the Ford Motor Company's environmental and fuel economy office, said, ''We are pleased that Marathon has taken a very positive step to develop a fuel that is cleaner burning than those used today.'' He added that a group of Big Three auto makers and 14 oil companies was studying various cleaner gasolines and alternate fuels on different types of engines and expects to report the findings of its research later this year.

HEADLINE: A Warning From Argentina

 BODY:
In the best of times, Argentine politics tends toward melodrama. In the worst, it tends toward military coups. Eight months into President Carlos Saul Menem's term, times are getting very bad. It is in the U.S. interest to help Mr. Menem master his gathering problems. But the main responsibility is necessarily his alone. 
Six months ago Mr. Menem seemed a savior. Taking office amid hyperinflationary chaos, he boldly pledged to shrink a bloated public sector and free protected markets. A Peronist, he built a Peron-like coalition of labor, business and military backers. His popularity hit 70 percent.
Today that support has crumbled, as has Government credibility, following repeated shifts in policy and personnel. There have been three Economy Ministers, four central bank presidents, three emergency economic plans. Inflation again rockets out of control. The middle class fears ruin. Business has withdrawn its confidence. Labor threatens defiance. Poverty and hunger stalk a fertile land.
It could be worse, as an article on today's Op-Ed page suggests.
The author, Ernesto Barreiro, sparked a military mutiny in 1987 by refusing to report for trial. He had been charged with torturing detainees at an interrogation center he commanded during military rule. The mutiny won Major Barreiro, and other military defendants beneath the rank of general, immunity from human rights prosecution.
The major and like-minded junior officers staged two further revolts. From the war paint smeared on their faces during these uprisings, they took the name ''carapintadas,'' meaning painted faces. They endorsed Mr. Menem's candidacy, and were rewarded with an amnesty covering all crimes during military rule.
Mr. Menem also ordered carapintada leaders retired from active duty. That left them more time to agitate politically. As the Op-Ed article suggests, they do not seek direct military rule. Their hope is to exercise power informally from within a figurehead Menem regime.
That's unacceptable for most Argentines, who blame the military for the disasters of the 70's and 80's. The carapintadas seek to deflect blame elsewhere - to the generals, to former President Alfonsin, to interests resisting the Menem reforms.
Meanwhile, Mr. Menem himself feeds military fantasies. Last month he authorized the armed forces to take responsibility for internal security in case economic problems spark social unrest. A similar decree by the previous Peronist Government opened the door to the 1976 coup.
Remilitarization of Argentina's Government still seems unlikely. But desperation grows daily. The U.S. and governments across Latin America have every interest in Mr. Menem's quickly regaining his political balance and serving out his full elected term. On economic questions, there is scope for Washington to help. But the survival of constitutional government in Argentina depends on Mr. Menem's supplying the bold and imaginative leadership he promised at the start of his term.

HEADLINE: Facing Facts in Connecticut

 BODY:
Gov. William O'Neill of Connecticut has decided not to run for re-election, with good reason. His mishandling of the state's budget crisis last year, highlighted by a billion-dollar increase in taxes, sent his popularity into a nosedive. Foreseeing a mud-slinging campaign for which he has no stomach, he wisely opts for honorable retirement. His successor will have to pick up the pieces.
Mr. O'Neill succeeded Ella Grasso upon her death in 1981; he was her Lieutenant Governor. He grew in the job, and Connecticut grew in his time. Twice re-elected, he oversaw a marked improvement in the state's school system and critical road and bridge repair. But when the Northeast's economy softened he failed to anticipate the consequences and offered no leadership in reshaping state finances. More than ever, conditions demanded a personal income tax. Mr. O'Neill offered instead an unpopular miscellany of higher taxes.
The Governor recently sought to repair his fallen image with a blitz of campaign-style advertising. But when Lowell Weicker, the maverick Republican ex-Senator, said he would run as an independent candidate and immediately shot to the top of the popularity charts, Mr. O'Neill got out.
Regrettably, his delay discouraged some strong Democrats who might have run if he had decided earlier. Only Representative Bruce Morrison was brave enough to challenge Mr. O'Neill head-on. He now emerges as the Democrats' front-runner, but the list of contenders grows daily. Among them, only William Cibes, a professor at Connecticut College, campaigns openly for tax reform. On the Republican side, Representative John Rowland leads at this stage, but he may be challenged, too.
In the end it will be a three-way race. Connecticut will be best served by candidates who face up to the fiscal facts.

HEADLINE: AT HOME ABROAD;
Promise at Midnight

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: WINDHOEK, Namibia

 BODY:
It was a scene of amiable chaos.
Hosni Mubarak and Nelson Mandela and Yasir Arafat trying to find their seats in the jammed V.I.P. section of the stadium. Herero women walking by in their long Victorian dresses and bonnets. Ululating cries from the distant stands. 
The schedule slipped. It was well past the appointed hour of midnight when the South African flag was lowered and the new blue, red, green and gold of Namibia raised. But it happened.
After 70 years under South African control, after guerrilla war and torture and exile, Namibians had their own country. And the symbol of the South African flag going down let emotion loose in that stadium: not just happiness, I thought, but a kind of amazement that the struggle and international diplomacy and politics had finally worked.
Bience Gawanas, who spent 12 years in exile, tried to explain what she felt. ''It was just nice to see that flag coming down. It was the difference between what I was and what I am.''
But why should the world care all that much? Namibia is a remote country, with only about 1.3 million people in a mostly desert land twice the size of California.
The answer is that several factors give Namibia's independence significance beyond the usual power calculations. One is the role of the South African Government.
For decades South Africa resisted international efforts to make it disgorge Namibia, which it had taken over from Germany after World War I. When South Africa finally accepted a plan for elections supervised by the United Nations and leading to freedom, it stalled and evaded on carrying out the plan.
But last April Pretoria finally said yes. It held to that through crises in the election process. And President F. W. de Klerk came here for the ceremony. He spoke just before the South African flag was lowered.
It was not an easy moment for Mr. de Klerk. The crowd, impatient to see the flag go down, had begun to chant ''Down, down.'' But he spoke graciously, and he won his audience over. At the end there was more than routine applause.
Mr. de Klerk said the road to Namibia's independence had been ''long and arduous.'' Many had died in the process, ''and it is fitting that we should remember them tonight.'' He clearly meant people on both sides. The audience responded to that acknowledgment of history.
Namibian independence showed that South Africa would keep its commitments, Mr. de Klerk said. The statement was a little hard to take after all the years of obstruction. But Mr. de Klerk was really making a point about the process of negotiation that is about to start in South Africa itself. He was saying: You can trust me.
Another factor of note in the Namibian story is the role of the international community, including the United Nations. The United States had an important part in the diplomacy of the last dozen years, as did other Western powers. U.N. forces have been a great success here over the last year: very possibly an example for other difficult political transitions.
Finally, there is the part played here by the idea of a written Constitution enforced by judges: that very American idea. It is not too much to say that constitutionalism made possible agreement among Namibians.
The small population of this country is made up of 11 ethnic groups, divided by race, language, culture, politics. The largest party, Swapo, has most of its support among the Ovambo people of northern Namibia. It won the election for a constituent assembly that drafted the Constitution. But approval needed a two-thirds vote, and Swapo fell short of that.
''Not getting two-thirds was the luckiest thing that ever happened to us,'' a Swapo lawyer said. He meant that the drafters of the Constitution had to get a consensus. In the end the assembly approved it unanimously.
The key element, the reassuring one, was the inclusion of a bill of rights. Many of its guarantees are familiar to Americans: freedom of speech, press, religion, association, the right to just compensation for property taken by the state.
That last provision was reassuring to the 100,000 whites, a small but economically dominant group. But the Constitution also prohibits discrimination by race or sex, whether done by the state or private parties, and it explicitly allows affirmative action. It prohibits capital punishment. Constitutions can be just pieces of paper. But this one has strong provisions for enforcement by judges. There is a recent tradition of judicial intervention on behalf of human rights, and all parties seem to feel safer on that ground.
Here again Namibia could have a larger meaning. If the Constitution works, if peace holds in this divided country, South Africa could look for a similar path.

HEADLINE: Terrain Turns Bumpy in Connecticut Race

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
Connecticut's political terrain has undergone two profound changes this month with former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s return from retirement to run for governor as an independent and Gov. William A. O'Neill's abrupt announcement that he would not seek re-election.
The withdrawal on Tuesday of Mr. O'Neill, who had indicated as recently as five days earlier that he would ''absolutely'' run, left the Democratic Party in disarray. It now has no groomed successor, consensus on a leading candidate, or even a contender with statewide recognition.
Mr. Weicker, meanwhile, a maverick liberal Republican who is now a candidate without a party, is seen by several polls as the front-running candidate, even though he has just started organizing a campaign and has been attacked by figures in both major political parties. 
''This is very strange,'' said State Representative Jonathan Pelto of Storrs, the political director of the Connecticut Democratic Party. ''You have to go back to the Senate race in 1970 to find something like this or, in a gubernatorial race, back to 1939 when the Socialist Mayor of Bridgeport ran.''
This week both parties are selecting delegates to their July conventions. Among Republicans, Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, a 32-year-old conservative, appears to be the leading candidate.
Others include the Senate minority leader, Reginald J. Smith of New Hartford; Joel Schiavone, a wealthy developer from New Haven, and Joseph McGee, a Fairfield banker. Among Democrats, a primary appears to be all but certain. Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, a liberal who announced his candidacy in January, was the only Democrat prepared to challenge Mr. O'Neill.
The Governor would have been seeking a third full term in office.
State Representative Willian J. Cibes Jr. of New London formally entered the Democratic race on Tuesday.
Mr. O'Neill's withdrawal also left several people who would have been seriously interested in launching a campaign months ago pondering whether there was time and support to begin now.
They include Mayor Christopher F. Droney of West Hartford, the brother of the state Democratic chairman, John F. Droney Jr., and the Senate president pro tempore, John B. Larson of East Hartford, a moderate who, with Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Hartford, was considered a likely heir to Mr. O'Neill. Ms. Kennelly said she would not be a candidate.
''Everyone is saying, 'Hold your breath and wait to see what the fallout is after everything shakes down,' '' said the Mayor of Hartford, Carrie Perry Saxon, a Democrat who would have supported Mr. O'Neill or Ms. Kennelly but is now firmly uncommitted.
But the press secretary for Mr. Morrison's campaign seemed to delight in the party's turmoil. ''I seem to remember an old Chinese saying,'' said the press secretary, Paul Donnelly. ''There is great disorder under heaven, and the situation is extremely favorable.''
 
'Win-Win Proposition'
Republicans had mixed emotions about Mr. O'Neill's withdrawal. Many thought he would have been an easy candidate to defeat, considering that recent polls gave him the most negative ratings of his nine years.
''It looks like a win-win proposition to us, either Bill O'Neill remained in the race or there is the chaos that results from his withdrawal,'' said Mr. Rowland's press secretary, Jack R. Goldberg. ''Bill O'Neill would have been a good target for us to run against, but the discontent with him also spills over to the Democrats as a party. They have to run on his record.''
Mr. O'Neill, 59 years old, cited two principal reasons for his withdrawal: a distaste for negative campaign tactics and ''political realities,'' a euphemism for his recent decline in popularity, which is widely seen as linked with nearly $1 billion in tax increases that he approved last summer, the state's slowing economy and voters' desire for a change.
His backers said his decision was made so late largely because of a split between the Governor's supporters and aides, who were divided about his prospects for re-election. ''This was the only time I've disagreed with the Governor since I've been chairman,'' said John Droney, a staunch supporter.
 
'Far More Exciting Race'
Mr. O'Neill, who has not endorsed any Democrat, also said that Mr. Weicker's campaign was not a factor in his withdrawal.
''It made it a far more exciting race, and I'm sure it still will be,'' the Governor told reporters on Tuesday. ''It would have been a spirited campaign, and I would have loved to have debated Lowell Weicker.''
Mr. Weicker, a three-term Senator who vowed to leave politics after losing his seat in 1988 to the State Attorney General, Joseph I. Lieberman, is expected to pick his party name and a running mate within the next month.
Already he has been painted by Mr. Morrison as a Republican running as an independent and by Mr. Rowland as a liberal running as an independent. Republicans believe Mr. Weicker will split the Democratic vote to the advantage of their candidate. Democrats believe Mr. Weicker will draw support from both parties.
''He's got to be considered the leading candidate for governor,'' Mr. Pelto said.
The co-chairman of the Weicker independent candidacy, Thomas J. D'Amore Jr., a former Republican state chairman, said Mr. O'Neill's decision left the Democratic leadership confused. ''There is no bench - no depth,'' he said.
He cautioned, though, that it is early in the campaign and the Democrats have won every gubernatorial race since 1970. There are about 700,000 registered Democrats in Connecticut, 550,000 unaffiliated voters and 450,000 Republicans.
''It's a formidable organization,'' he said. ''We'll have to wait and see what comes out of all this.''

HEADLINE: LAW: At the Bar

BYLINE: By David Margolick

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
When J. Willard Hurst attended Harvard Law School in the 1930's, the study of legal history was nonexistent. Oh, yes, some professors had studied obscure legal doctrines and there was one superannuated scholar studying history, but it was Roman history, and he stalked Langdell Hall like a ghost.
Why this dearth, given the inherent overlap between law and history? The explanation came a century ago from Christopher Columbus Langdell, Harvard Law School's intellectual architect: The law was a self-contained science and the law library its laboratory. One need not study how law actually affected people or how legal institutions evolved; all wisdom could be gleaned from appellate decisions. This approach not only gave law professors a shot at omniscience but also spared them from having to learn other disciplines, set foot in a courtroom or state legislature, or even step outside. 
From the moment he arrived here at the University of Wisconsin Law School 53 years ago, and was mandated to bridge the gap between law and society by studying how laws were enacted and applied, Professor Hurst changed all that. By his intellect and example, he is universally credited with legitimizing legal history. Even in retirement he remains one of the few legal scholars whose work can be measured in shelf feet -and shelf feet of bona fide research rather than of cut-and-pasted cases and comments. In an era when academia, like sports, has been watered down through expansion, he is an old-fashioned towering figure.
In some ways, he is also an anachronism. He is the one of the last disciples of Louis D. Brandeis (whom he once served as law clerk), having inherited Brandeis's interest in grass-roots democracy. He is a disciple of the LaFollettes, who charged Wisconsin's academics to view the state as their campus and their laboratory. He is the last of the Legal Realists, the Depression-era scholars who tried to place law in a larger social context.
Mr. Hurst is one of those rare figures in academia who is as well-known for his modesty as for his scholarship. And even as he approaches 80, he still casts his long shadow over the field. ''You're either a Hurstian or a reviser of Hurst,'' said Lawrence M. Friedman of Stanford Law School, one of a generation of legal historians either tought or influenced by Professor Hurst.
Mr. Hurst had the academic pedigree to do whatever he wished. He graduated at the top of his class at Harvard, edited its Law Review, served as research assistant to Felix Frankfurter before clerking for Brandeis in 1936.
It was Brandeis who urged Mr. Hurst to head for Wisconsin and study its democratic institutions. While there Lloyd Garrison, then the school's dean, urged him to create a program in ''law and society,'' investigating how the state's legal system and economy cross-pollinated.
The spectacle of law professors doing social research was rare and at times ridiculous, like the Yale scholar who once charted parking-meter use in New Haven. Mr. Hurst focused on the lumber industry in Wisconsin, all to determine how industry both used and molded the laws of contracts, property and other areas. Mr. Hurst discovered Chippewa Falls long before Woody Allen found Annie Hall there; the work of the courts there was, to him, more interesting, less abstract and certainly less pawed over than that of the United States Supreme Court.
Mr. Hurst's was a largely uncharted route to respectability. Once, when he told a leading law dean he was working on ''legal economic history,'' the dean harrumphed: ''You'd never get away with it at my place!'' But rather than feel excluded from the mainstream, Mr. Hurst simply created his own.
''For me personally, he was an incredible inspiration,'' Morton Horwitz of Harvard said. Robert Gordon of Stanford added: ''Every scholar needs heroes, and Willard is one of the few authentic heroes of our field.''
As his studies continued and broadened, recognition came. Three times he turned down the deanship of Yale Law School, as well as a chair at Harvard. ''I guess I was just too pleasure-loving,'' he recalled. ''I was having too good a time in Wisconsin.''
Mr. Hurst is one of those people who, beneath a deceptively elderly exterior, retain all the fire, impatience and curiosity of youth.
He still goes into his office, still sifts through piles of manuscripts, still grumbles over all the issues -political action committees, Ralph Nader, antitrust laws - younger legal historians are still neglecting.
He takes great pride in his students - which all younger legal historians necessarily are - even when they criticize him. ''Part of your function as a teacher is to send out people who've done more than you,'' he said.
That may be the only scholarly endeavor in which Willard Hurst has fallen short.

HEADLINE: James H. R. Cromwell Dies at 93; Married 'Richest Girl in World'

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
James H. R. Cromwell, a wealthy businessman who was briefly a politician and diplomat and best known in the 1930's and 40's as the husband of ''the richest girl in the world,'' Doris Duke, died of a pulmonary ailment on Monday at the Marin Terrace retirement home in Mill Valley, Calif. He was 93 years old.
Mr. Cromwell was connected to three of the greatest fortunes in America through two of his marriages and one of his mother's. While Jimmy, as Mr. Cromwell was known, was in his teens, his mother, Lucretia, married E. T. Stotesbury, a Philadelphia multimillionaire and banking partner of J. P. Morgan. 
Mr. Cromwell's first marriage, in 1920, was to Delphine Dodge, the daughter of Horace T. Dodge, the automobile magnate. The two were divorced in 1928. Marriage to Doris Duke Miss Duke, who became his second wife in 1935, inherited a tobacco fortune from her father, James Buchanan Duke, the founder of Duke University.
Mr. Cromwell was in the public eye steadily before and during World War II while he was married to Miss Duke. Unlike the vast majority of their peers in the Social Register, they were fervent supporters of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.
In 1933 Mr. Cromwell published a book, ''Voice of Young America,'' in which he advocated measures like guaranteed bank deposits, abandonment of the gold standard, compulsory unemployment insurance and Federally aided public works, all of which came to pass under Roosevelt.
Four years later, in a treatise, ''In Defense of Capitalism,'' he shocked business leaders by advocating tight control of money by the Federal Reserve System.
In 1940 Roosevelt appointed Mr. Cromwell Minister to Canada, an ambassadorship at a time when the only Ambassador to a country in the British Commonwealth was the one accredited to the Court of St. James's.
 
A Bid for U.S. Senate
Mr. Cromwell resigned the post after five months to run for the United States Senate from New Jersey; he and Miss Duke lived in a mansion in Somerset County. His only bid for elective office ended in decisive defeat.
The Cromwells separated soon afterward and in 1943 became involved in acrimonious divorce proceedings that went on for five years. Miss Duke, asserting that her husband wanted a $7 million ''endowment,'' won a decree in Reno, but it was voided by a court in New Jersey. Mr. Cromwell then obtained a divorce that became final in 1948.
That year he was married for a third time, to Maxine MacFetridge, the daughter of a cement company manager. She died in 1968. In 1971 he married Germaine Benjamin, the widow of a financier. She died in 1987.
Mr. Cromwell was born in Manhattan, the son of Oliver Eaton Cromwell, a member of an old New York family. He went to Lawrenceville School and spent two years at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Cromwell, an athletic man, piloted racing boats, played tennis with Bill Tilden and was a talented amateur boxer, once staying three rounds with Tommy Loughran, later the world light-heavyweight champion. Mr. Cromwell served in the Marine Corps in World War I. Mr. Cromwell's Career Mr. Cromwell began his business career with Drexel & Co. in Philadelphia. While married to Miss Dodge, he started an automobile finance company, Cromwell-Dodge. In the 1950's he was involved in oil and gas production in the West and in Canada; he retired in the early 1980's.
He lived for many years in Southampton, L. I., before moving to the West Coast two years ago.
Mr. Cromwell is survived by a daughter from his marriage to Miss MacFetridge, Hope Hampton of Belvedere, Calif., and five grandchildren.

Adele, an alluring little restaurant in a former carriage house in Park Slope, is striving to offer a romantic neighborhood alternative.
This year-and-a-half-old venture is the creation of John Sielski, an experienced restaurant manager who started at Huberts when it was still in Brooklyn (it is now on Park Avenue in Manhattan), and Jim Dozmati, who was a garden designer by profession. Their 19th-century carriage house - a blacksmith and carpenter were still toiling there when they took over - seats 40 with room to spare under the high pressed-tin ceiling. A crackling fireplace, candlelight, flower-patterned wallpaper and classical music contribute to the amorous mood. 
The eclectic American fare has become more impassioned and confident in recent months compared with visits last year. The chef, Melicia Phillips, who came from a three-year-stint at Chanterelle, turns out a wisely limited but diverse menu with Italian and French accents. Starters can be as simple as blood-warming duck consomme with al dente julienne of vegetables, or as urbane as a velvety and well-seasoned foie gras-and-avocado terrine. Soups are taken seriously here. Cream of leek, squash and carrot is lusty and delicate at the same time; cream of mussel soup is on the rich side, but so scintillating with saffron that it is hard to be temperate. The menu is getting a spring cleaning, so some of the dishes I sampled in the last six weeks may be in storage by now. If the squab salad with a compote of butternut squash and apples is available, go for it. The lightly bound terrine of lobster and shrimp is another good starter. Wild mushroom cannelloni has double-barreled flavor, boosted by its mushroom broth. And for two-fisted eaters, there is a pancakelike fritter of potato and bacon set over a sweet-sharp abundance of red cabbage, a harmonious combination.
For a small, relatively new restaurant, Adele has a varied and uncommon wine list. Among whites to consider are the 1988 Saint-Aubin, Les Remilly, Domaine Aime Langoureau ($22); the 1988 Silverado sauvignon blanc from Napa ($15), and the 1988 Kendall-Jackson chardonnay, vintners reserve ($18). In reds, there are a light but ripe 1983 Givry from Domaine Chenard for $22 and a slightly headier 1977 Gigondas at $18.
Entrees have a clean and unfussy appeal. Roasted guinea hen, meatier and more flavorful than so-called free-range chicken, is paired with cabbage, green beans and carrots. Shell steak has a deep-aged flavor and comes out nicely blackened yet moist under a slab of garlicky herb butter. Braised venison with spatzle and Brussels sprouts had a wonderfully mellow red-wine sauce, but the meat was on the dry side. Roast duck was better in its faintly sweet apple-cider sauce, accompanied by sauteed watercress and gratin of turnip.
Sea scallops arrive under an avalanche of deep-fried leeks and are ringed with a pleasantly sour-edged sorrel sauce. Salmon is nicely broiled, but the sauce of cucumber juice and fish stock tasted about as pallid as it sounds. On another visit, a leek and butter sauce did the fillet justice.
Don't expect ginger ice cream here to be like the lean, palate-cleansing scoops doled out at Japanese restaurants. If it weren't for the ginger, this could be spread on toast at breakfast. Brandy-soaked cherries nestled in pastry cream over puff pastry is a less cloying winner, as are cinnamon-dusted apple fritters with a prune-and-currant compote. Among the lightest offerings are a lovely millefeuille of strawberries with strawberry puree, and pear poached in red wine with cinnamon.
Adele may not pose a threat to the Rainbow Room or the River Cafe as a destination for major-league wooing. But it's a fine place to build up to it.

HEADLINE: A Home for a Bustling Borough's Memorabilia

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
How do you tell the 350-year-long story of New York's most populous and arguably most colorful borough in a small gallery with a relatively minuscule budget?
That was the challenge facing the Brooklyn Historical Society, which opened a compact museum of Brooklyn history last fall on the ground floor of its landmark Brooklyn Heights building. The 4,000-square-foot Shellens Gallery, at 128 Pierrepont Street (at Clinton Street), is at once an imaginative compendium of old Coney Island waxworks, Brooklyn Dodgers memorabilia, props from ''The Honeymooners'' and about 1,000 other objects, and a scholarly, social-historical exploration of how Brooklynites have lived, worked and played.
''We wanted to find things that are familiar, fun and interesting - like the Dodgers, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Navy Yard - and use them as wedges to be able to talk about broader issues like work, industry and transportation,'' said Ellen Marie Snyder-Grenier, a curator who planned the exhibition with David M. Kahn, the society's executive director. Consequently, the gallery's exhibits are organized around five of the borough's most recognizable aspects - the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the people of Brooklyn. 
 
A 7-Foot Zinc Eagle
At the entrance to the exhibition area looms a seven-foot zinc eagle that once perched near Washington and Johnson Streets at The Daily Eagle, the Brooklyn newspaper that was published from 1841 to 1955. A nearby model of the Brooklyn Bridge arches leads to displays about the 107-year-old bridge and other aspects of the history of transportation and residential development in Brooklyn. A case full of bridge souvenirs (including a popular Italian chewing gum called Brooklyn) stands beside bucolic 19th-century paintings of the Fulton Ferry and historic maps and promotional brochures for neighborhoods, then new, like Park Slope and Brownsville.
The long, illustrious and ultimately sad tale of Brooklyn's former industrial might is told in an exhibition area that vaguely resembles the hull of a battleship. Photos, mortar shells, lunch pails and other artifacts chronicle the life of the Navy Yard, the sprawling shipbuilding complex that operated on the East River from 1801 to 1966 and employed 70,000 people during World War II. Exhibits about the local labor movement and early pollution are complemented by a display overflowing with beer bottles, pharmaceuticals, shoes, clocks, pencils, clothing and other objects made in Brooklyn.
A third of a century after the final out of their final inning at Ebbets Field, the Brooklyn Dodgers still have a mystique that is evoked in another corner of the museum. Die-hard fans will find autographed baseballs, baseball cards, photos and banners, as well as a base, a brick and seats taken from Ebbets Field before it was demolished in 1960 to make way for an apartment building.
 
Essence and Counteressence
To many people, the quintessential Brooklynite was (and is) Ralph Kramden in Jackie Gleason's television series ''The Honeymooners.'' Despite the presence of a stage set lent by a ''Honeymooners'' fan club, the purpose of the next exhibition area is to debunk stereotypes about Brooklyn residents and present an overview of the borough's remarkable ethnic diversity. A make-believe newsstand with a dozen contemporary ethnic newspapers makes the point. Cultural artifacts relating to Brooklyn's Jewish, black, Italian, German, Irish, Polish, Dutch, Scandinavian, West Indian, Hispanic, Asian and Soviet communities are also on view.
Just beyond a giant pink-and-silver costume from Brooklyn's annual West Indian Day Parade, scaffolding suggestive of the Cyclone roller coaster signals the beginning of the Coney Island display. This section on Brooklyn amusements includes lithographs of elegant 19th-century beach-front hotels, a carousel horse and other souvenirs from turn-of-the-century amusement parks, several ghoulish heads from the defunct World in Wax museum at Coney Island and Playbills from long-gone theaters.
One of the most elaborately festive of New York's many festivals is the subject of a temporary exhibition called ''The Giglio: Brooklyn's Dancing Tower.'' The show, on view through May 15, explores the customs associated with the annual feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Paulinus in the Italian community of the Williamsburg section. It culminates with 125 people carrying a 3,000-pound tower called a giglio.
 
The Next Show
This changing-exhibition area will be used for shows on 19th-century portraiture (opening May 25); the borough's many Hispanic communities and Brooklyn's role in the manufacture of penicillin.
The society, which was founded in 1863 as the Long Island Historical Society, long had exhibitions relating to world and natural history, but in 1926 its gallery was converted into commercial space because of economic problems. During the next half century or so, the society functioned largely as a research institution, and its elegant 150,000-volume library remains a leading repository of Brooklyn history.
Although a few temporary shows were mounted in the early 1980's after Mr. Kahn became director, it was not until the society's name change in 1985 that planning began for the history museum. The project cost $1.8 million, with $400,000 coming from the estate of Ruth Ann Shellens, a Brooklyn businesswoman and real-estate investor. The society plans to expand the exhibition area by the turn of the century, Mr. Kahn said, contingent on the success of a $5 million capital campaign slated to begin this fall.
The society also presents about 80 lectures, tours and other public programs a year. Gallery hours are noon to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $2.50; $1 for children, and free on Tuesdays. Lectures are free with admission, and most walking tours are $8. Information: (718) 624-0890.

HEADLINE: Concern Over Tokyo Stocks Sends the Dow 32.31 Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday amid widening concern over the plunging stock market in Japan and new fears that the American economy could be heading into a recession.
Heavy computerized program selling helped bring down the market, traders said.
At shortly after 2:15 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average had slid 50 points and then recovered somewhat to close at 2,695.72, down 32.21.
Volume amounted to 175.9 million shares, up from 131 million the day before, but with 1,200 stocks down and only 368 ahead. 
Just 10 issues managed to reach new highs, while 73 touched new lows.
A wave of program trading lifted the Tokyo stock market toward the end of trading today although the market remained shaky and volatile.
The Nikkei index closed at 30,372.16, for a gain of 528.82, or 1.8 percent. [Page D6.] Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said a big factor in the American selling wave was a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday raising the possibility that banks may make credit much harder to get and thereby push an already weak economy into recession.
''Traders are getting a little nervous,'' he said, ''and these days it doesn't take much volume to move the market.''
The selloff in Japan raised new fears that because of the exceptionally close financial ties between the United States and Japan, far more drastic corrective measures there could make problems here far worse - and then push down the stock market even more.
In an analysis of the mounting inflationary crisis in Japan, Hugh Johnson, head strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said, ''What's wrong is that interest rates in Japan are rising.''
He also noted that money growth in February was higher than in January and the yen was ''weak and getting weaker,'' all of which, he said, add to inflation.
''That means,'' he said, ''that to beat back inflationary pressures, the Bank of Japan has to raise rates again. And if it does, the outlook will darken the economy further and their economy will affect ours.''
Noting that the Japanese market had plunged 23 percent on the Nikkei index this year, he remarked, ''Investors are very concerned about Japan when their market decline is as disorderly and volatile as it is; it makes investors nervous that something is fundamentally wrong, that there is some serious fundamental problem in the Japanese economy.''
 
Japan Effect on U.S. Economy
Echoing the old saying that when the United States sneezes, other countries catch a cold, he said, ''Serious problems in the Japanese economy could affect the United States economy.''
Computerized program selling played a major role in bringing down the market, said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks such movements.
At first glance, he said, it did not appear that the programs were that important, but he subsequently revised his view, maintaining that the duration and intensity of the selling represented ''real selling.''
In what Wall Street has come to accept as just a market phenomenon, traders set up either buy or sell programs to take advantage of a price spread between, say, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index and the S.&P. 500 futures.
Mr. Birinyi said he spotted two ''buy'' programs lasting 11 minutes and 14 minutes, one before 10 A.M. and the other before 3 P.M. He said he also traced six ''sell'' programs, including one of 20 minutes before 1:30 P.M. that brought down the market 10.59 points. Another 13-minute program sent the market tumbling by 13.51 points.
People on Wall Street said that traders change the programs from ''buy'' to ''sell'' almost instantly because they watch the screen on their quotation machines and touch off one or the other program as the market shifts.
In a reflection of the market weakness, the Dow industrials all declined, except for Boeing, which rose 1/8, to 71 1/4. The plane maker said it would add four million square feet of space in Everett, Wash., to meet the demand for new 747's and 767's.
Among the industrials, Coca-Cola fell 1 1/2, to 72 1/2, in heavy trading; Goodyear fell 1 1/4, to 37, and American Express fell 1 1/8, to 26 5/8, on 2.3 million shares, the third-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Dow Transportation Stocks
The Dow transportation stocks slid 13.16, to 1,158.78, with Delta Air Lines down 1 5/8, at 71 1/4; UAL down 1, at 152; USAir down 1, at 29 3/4, and Federal Express down 1 3/8, at 53 7/8.
Among other weak stocks, Genuine Parts fell 1 3/4, to 37 3/4, and Wells Fargo 2 1/2, at 69 5/8, in heavy trading, on the possibility of new problem loans and speculators selling short.
J.P. Morgan, the banking company, topped the Big Board list of most-active stocks, falling 3/8, to 34 3/8, with 6.1 million shares changing hands. But traders said the selling was dividend-related.
Walt Disney shares slid 3, to 111 7/8, in heavy trading amid talk that Disney, which has a big following in Japan because of major operations there, could face Japanese selling if Japanese investors needed money to meet margin calls.
With gold advancing slightly, gold stocks also advanced. ASA, with interests in South Africa, rose 1 1/4, to 55 1/2 and Newmont Gold rose 5/8, to 49 1/2. Computer stocks weakened, with Compaq off 2 5/8, at 97 5/8, and Microsoft off 2, at 111 1/4.
Other indexes also declined. The S.&P. 500 fell 4.05, to 335.69; the Amex market-value index 2.67, to 360.48, and the Nasdaq 4.79, to 434.51.

HEADLINE: Ingersoll Scrambles to Avoid Default

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 22

 BODY:
After successfully expanding his newspaper empire through much of the 1980's, Ralph Ingersoll 2d was scrambling today to avoid a default on some of his company's high-yield ''junk bonds.''
The bonds, issued by Mr. Ingersoll's Community Newspapers Inc. in connection with its 1987 acquisition of four Ohio newspapers and a shopper's newspaper on Long Island called The Pennysaver, trade at deep discounts from their face amounts.
The discount reflects investors' belief that the acquired newspapers are not meeting their financial targets and that Community Newspapers, as a result, might not be able to pay its debts. The publisher also started a daily newspaper in St. Louis to compete against The Post-Dispatch. 
''Community Newspapers cannot meet its debt-service obligations,'' said Stephen Unterhalter, a senior analyst at R. D. Smith & Company, a New York-based dealer in distressed securities. ''It is not in default yet, but it is obvious that it is about to be.''
That conclusion stems from a so-called reset feature on some of the bonds. By requiring Community Newspapers to pay much higher interest beginning on June 30, it would almost surely lead to a missed payment. Apparently to avoid such a default, Mr. Ingersoll said on Wednesday that Community Newspapers would seek to buy back the bonds at 25 cents to 55 cents on the dollar.
Asked about the buyback plan, Mr. Ingersoll said in a telephone interview today from his office in Princeton, N.J., that it was partly to avoid the default that would almost surely result if the interest rate were reset. Bondholders had also asked to be bought out, he said.
''They started calling us directly, seeking to sell bonds, so we said, 'Maybe it would make good sense for everybody if we got a loan and went out and bought back some of those bonds,' '' Mr. Ingersoll said.
Mr. Unterhalter said he understood that financial difficulties were being experienced by Community Newspaper's Ohio properties - The Lake County News-Herald in Willoughby, outside Cleveland; The Lorain Journal, also outside Cleveland; The Mansfield News-Journal, between Cleveland and Columbus, and The Dover-New Philadelphia Times-Reporter, near Canton.
The company is a unit of Ingersoll Publications Inc., which owns more than 25 daily newspapers and 150 weekly newspapers in the United States. Ingersoll publishes papers like The Glendale (Calif.) News Press, The New Haven (Conn.) Journal-Courier and The Trentonian in New Jersey.
''The basic problem is that the projections Mr. Ingersoll gave the banks for cash-flow growth were far greater than has actually materialized,'' Mr. Unterhalter said of Community Newspapers, noting that in 1988 the company lost $43.6 million and that its results for the first nine months of 1989 were lower than 1988's comparable figures.
Another high-yield bond analyst, who asked not to be identified, said that the Ohio acquisitions ''were a very aggressive plan to begin with, and they just have not increased cash flow in Ohio nearly as much as they had anticipated.''
But in the interview, Mr. Ingersoll attributed his problems to The Pennysaver, the shoppers' newspaper on Long Island. He said that he had spent millions to convert The Pennysaver from an advertising circular to full-fledged weekly community newspaper, but that the outlays had not brought sufficiently higher revenues.
''We have had some significant operating disappointments on Long Island,'' Mr. Ingersoll said. ''The expenses went up, and the economy on Long Island collapsed.''
While Mr. Ingersoll has experienced setbacks on Long Island, securities analysts suspected a negotiating ploy to drive down the price that bondholders may ultimately be willing to accept for their securities. Mr. Unterhalter said that he had valued Community Newspapers on a liquidation basis and had concluded that its senior bonds were worth about 80 cents on the dollars - roughly 50 percent more than Mr. Ingersoll and Warburg, Pincus Capital Partners, a New York-based investment firm that is a partner, were offering.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Transition In East Germany

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Berlin wall, built to keep East Germans from fleeing to the West, now stands as a powerful symbol of the coming unification of the two Germanys.
Every day, thousands of East Germans, West Germans and foreigners trek to the wall to read the graffiti, chisel out or purchase chunks of the wall, and feel the miraculous historic change that is still taking place here.
The graffiti have preserved both the euphoria and the anger that burst forth last Nov. 9 when the borders with West Germany were opened to the East Germans. Some of the writings declare the Germans' contempt for the former Communist leader, many in English. ''Honecker pea brain,'' says one. Other writings are simply the traditional markings of visitors in a strange place: ''Goldberg USA'' and ''Scotty Joe was here.'' And some offer short editorials: ''How do you spell freedom? USA.'' But in the wake of the victory of the conservative alliance in East Germany's election this week, euphoria has given way once again to anxiety over how to stanch the flow of East Germans to the West, and how to meld the two economies. 
The German Democratic Republic, the somewhat euphemistic title for East Germany, seems likely to become the first Communist country to make the complete journey to a market economy. It may provide some important lessons for other Communist countries on how to do it.
Many tricky problems will need to be solved. The first is to turn disordered currencies into hard currencies. That is easier for the East Germans with their West German brothers.
Although the initial view among German economists was that it would have been wiser to postpone currency reform until the economic and political institutions of a free nation were in place, most of those economists are now moving to support Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to merge the two currencies by July 1. They see the conversion to the strong German mark as a means of quickly setting East Germany on the course to self-propelled economic growth. The strong currency is also likely to attract greater West German and other foreign investment to East Germany.
There is also a powerful political reason for speeding up currency reform: It is seen as a means of slowing the migration that has been playing havoc with the East German economy and disturbing many West Germans who have begun worrying that the new arrivals are putting excessive burdens on their labor market, housing and budget. The phrase heard often in West Germany today is: ''The boat is full.''
Last year, an estimated 344,000 East Germans crossed to the West. So far this year an additional 150,000 have left, at a rate of about 2,000 a day.
Chancellor Kohl, having won his decisive victory in the East German election, is now swinging to solidify his political support in West Germany. That support will depend not only on his slowing the influx of East Germans but also in preventing inflation and a weakening of the German mark.
The West German mark will be exchanged for the East mark at a 1 to 1 ratio, but only for a limited amount of marks held by East Germans. This policy will be aimed at preventing an inflationary flooding of the economy of the merged Germanys with the overhang of hundreds of billions of East marks. There is also the aim of not rewarding those speculators who have acquired masses of East marks in the black market in hopes of making a killing by converting them into West German marks at a higher official rate.
A way to avoid this is to permit the conversion only of East marks held in savings deposits in East German banks on Nov. 8, the day before the borders were opened and the Berlin wall was breached. Additional East marks are likely to be exchanged at a lower rate than 1 to 1 sometime in the future for permitted amounts of currency and for use in investment, to help the East German economy.
Along with the dash to currency union by July 1, there is also likely to be widespread price decontrol in East Germany soon afterward. This decontrol will probably not be complete. Price controls and state subsidies seem bound to remain for a while on bread, milk and some other necessities. Well-informed West German officials believe that rent controls and subsidized subway fares will also continue for a long time. Such controls and subsidies would be used as a means of keeping the East Germans where they are.
''Stay home,'' Mr. Kohl told them after the election, thereby provoking harsh criticism from his Social Democratic challenger in West Germany, Oskar Lafontaine, who declared that Mr. Kohl had ''betrayed'' the population of East Germany.
The conservative Government of West Germany, nevertheless, seems certain to be generous, within budgetary constraints, toward the East Germans, although it hopes that other foreign countries and corporations will also provide aid and investment capital in the East.
The East German case is likely to be not only the first but also the easiest transition from Communism to capitalism. For, as Kurt Richebaecher, a leading German economist, puts it: ''There is a big brother, West Germany, who brings tremendous assets to the task - a strong currency, the biggest trade surplus in the world, a vast pool of surplus savings to draw upon, as well as technical and managerial know-how.''

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Rise in Japan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, March 23

 BODY:
The stock market remained shaky and volatile early today after Thursday's wild swings, but a wave of program trading late in the day lifted prices for the day.
This afternoon, a sudden surge of buying related to the stock index futures market sent the Nikkei 225-stock index up 528.82 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 30,372.16. Earlier, at the opening, the index rose sharply initially, then fell as much as 630 points before recovering to close the morning session at 29,798.15, down 45.19 points. 
On Thursday, the index had plunged 963.85 points.
''It would have been listless if not for the program trading,'' said Liam Newberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''That created the illusion of a recovery, but we don't see an end to the declines yet.''
The market also benefited from some bargain-hunting for blue-chip shares by foreign investors, an inflow of money from a few Japanese mutual funds and a slight decline in short-term interest rates, analysts said.
Analysts generally described the market as having achieved an uneasy and possibly temporary peace after the turmoil of recent weeks. Prices have fallen more than 20 percent this year.
Another closely watched factor was the foreign exchange market, where the dollar's steep rise has abated, at least for the time being.
In addition to intervening heavily in the foreign exchange market to try to stabilize the sagging yen, the Bank of Japan has been injecting money into the money market. That has eased short-term interest rates slightly, causing a rebound in bond prices and taking some of the selling pressure off stock prices.
The market has also grown quiet in advance of Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to the United States later today, where he is expected to meet with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to discuss ways of shoring up the falling yen.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Loses 'Biggest' Title

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, battered by weeks of selling, lost its title yesterday as the world's biggest stock market. 
Economists at Nikko Securities International estimated the dollar value of all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell yesterday to $2.9 trillion, while the New York Stock Exchange opened the day with a value of $2.92 trillion.
But as American trading began, the newly proclaimed world's largest market also began to crumble.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of 32.21 points, at 2,695.72.
The New York Stock Exchange lost its longstanding title as the world's largest stock exchange when the market crashed in October 1987.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Rise on Rumors

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved higher again yesterday, as traders were buffeted by rumors throughout the session.
For the first time in many days, short- to intermediate-term notes outperformed bonds.
Dealers said that note issues were helped by rumors that Japanese and American monetary authorities had reached an agreement to lower the value of the dollar, and that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy to achieve the objective.
Bond prices, which were sharply higher early yesterday, retreated later after news reports that a column of Soviet armored personnel carriers had driven through Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. 
 
No 'Flight to Quality'
''You might think that would have prompted a flight to quality,'' one government bond trader said, since news of military unrest in the past has often caused investors to seek safe haven in Treasury securities.
''But it prompted the reverse instead, on the thinking that problems there would threaten the general warming trend between East and West, and that cuts in defense spending might not be as big as the market has come to look for.''
Yesterday's rumors were merely the latest in a week that has been dominated by mostly loose talk.
''The market has traded up this week, but in an unsettled fashion,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Traders have been saying all week that the rise in prices has been backed by increased interest from retail investors. But Mr. Sullivan said the heightened demand might be more imagined than real.
''All in all, you have to think that some securities have left the Street, but we don't think the buying has been as powerful as some have assumed,'' he said. ''We are in contact with retail accounts who are skeptical that the market can improve much from here, and are sort of sitting on their hands.''
 
Stability Falters
The rise in Treasury note prices yesterday ended a sustained period of stability among short- to intermediate-term securities. And it helped to flatten somewhat what had become a steep differential between yields on bonds and notes.
Because of the higher risk of owning a long-term security, the yields on bonds are generally higher than those offered on notes. But recently, bond yields have fallen well below those offered on note issues.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 99 26/32, up by 5/32, to yield 8.60 percent. Meanwhile, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 23/32, up by 1/4 point, to yield 8.55 percent.
Bond prices also rose, but the gains lagged behind those in the note sector.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 100 6/ 32, up by 2/32, to yield 8.48 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates fell. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.89 percent in late trading, down by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates dipped by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.82 percent. One-year bills were offered at 7.71 percent, also down by 8 basis points.
 
Corporate Issues Up
Issues of new investment-grade corporate bonds were strong again yesterday, continuing a trend that has been in place all week.
Among the companies that priced new issues was E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, which offered $150 million in floating-rate notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The underwriting is the first Merrill Lynch has handled for Du Pont.
The rates on the notes, which float weekly and pay monthly, will be set at 75 basis points above the bond equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills. They mature on April 3, 1994, and are noncallable for two years. The first rate will be set on April 2.
The notes are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. $150 Million Offering Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as the lead manager for a $150 million offering of 10-year subordinated notes from the Household Finance Corporation.
The 9.55 percent notes, which mature on April 1, 2000, are noncallable for life. They were priced at $99.716, to yield 9.595 percent, or 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the traders said that prices of most issues rose by about a quarter of a point.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was quiet yesterday, according to participants. The prices of most issues rose by an eighth to a quarter of a point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on March 12. The report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Fall Sharply After Labor Disputes End

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of copper futures fell from five-month highs on New York's Commodity Exchange yesterday in response to an easing of labor tensions in Canada and Peru and a sharp drop in stock prices.
Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 3.5 cents lower, with the contract for spot delivery at $1.291 a pound.
On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; cocoa futures surged; sugar retreated; energy futures fell, and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher. 
Copper futures had surged as much as 4.6 cents Wednesday on speculation that union workers at a Noranda Inc. copper smelter in Quebec would reject management's final contract offer, setting the stage for a strike.
But workers approved the contract by a narrow margin, and reports of the results early yesterday morning gave the copper market its initial downward shove.
 
Settlement in Peru
Later in the morning, the port workers' union in Peru announced it had ended a nationwide strike after two days, freeing Peruvian copper exports to move again.
A miners' strike against the Southern Peru Copper Corporation, the country's largest producer, continued into its 11th day but analysts said the company had copper stockpiled. The strike is threatening to spread, though, with a national miners' work stoppage set for Monday.
Yesterday's 32-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial stock average prompted further selling. Because copper is used heavily in construction and industrial production, copper prices are extremely sensitive to economic signals.
Soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on strength in the soybean-meal market. Wheat futures retreated while corn advanced.
The markets displayed only slight interest in news that United States and Soviet negotiators had reached tentative agreement on a new five-year grain pact.
Wheat futures settled 1/2 cent to 1 1/2 cents lower, with May at $3.58 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1/2 cent to 1 1/2 cents higher, with May at $2.58 3/4 a bushel; oats were 3/4 cent to 1 cent higher, with May at $1.49 3/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 1/2 cent lower to 2 3/4 cents higher, with May at $6.05 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Korea, U.S. In Beef Pact

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 22

 BODY:
South Korea has resolved a dispute with the United States over beef imports, averting possible trade sanctions, trade ministry officials said today.
Under an agreement reached on Wednesday in Washington, Seoul will increase its beef import quota to 58,000 metric tons this year from 50,000 last year, the officials said. The quota will rise to 62,000 metric tons in 1991 and 66,000 in 1992.
''U.S. negotiators originally asked us to submit a schedule for total liberalization of beef imports, but later agreed to accept our offer to increase the annual quota,'' a ministry official said.
He said Seoul and Washington would hold talks before July 1992 to discuss the removal of South Korea's beef import barriers. Washington had threatened to impose a ban on some South Korean imports unless Seoul opened its markets to more American beef.
After a ban from May 1985 to August 1988, Seoul agreed to allow in 14,200 metric tons of beef imports in the remainder of 1988 and 50,000 metric tons last year. The bulk of Korea's beef imports come from the United States and Australia.
A panel for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruled last year that South Korea unfairly discriminated against beef imports.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND JAPANESE IN COMPUTER PACT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The United States and Japan said today that they had reached preliminary agreement on measures that would significantly open the Japanese market to the most powerful American-made computers.
The agreement will make it easier for American companies to sell such supercomputers to the Japanese Government and public universities in Japan, trade officials from both nations said.
The agreement should eliminate what has become, in effect, a requirement that companies doing business with the Japanese Government offer deep discounts on supercomputer prices. The Japanese budget for supercomputers is so low that successful bidders have had to offer discounts of up to 80 percent of the list price. 
The United States is continuing to try to persuade Japan to buy American-made commercial satellites and to open up the Japanese market to American wood products, two other areas in which Washington has accused Tokyo of unfair trade practices. The satellite talks are reportedly stalled and the talks on wood products may resume next month.
The agreement on supercomputers, reached here late Thursday night and announced today, has not been signed and is subject to review and approval in Tokyo and Washington.
Supercomputers are used by scientists and engineers to forecast the weather, to design aircraft and automobiles, to explore for oil and to predict the behavior of the economy and financial markets, among other tasks.
American computer companies like Cray Research Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation cautiously welcomed the agreement but said they did not know whether it would result in additional sales, as the American negotiators intended.
Members of Congress also welcomed the agreement, but said they wanted to see results.
 
Empty Promises
''Japan must recognize that promises without performance are simply unacceptable,'' said Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Finance subcommittee on trade, said that in the past ''American trade negotiators have fallen in the trap of declaring success too soon.''
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, looked on the positive side: ''American supercomputer manufacturers already compete successfully in the Japanese private sector. The real test of this agreement, therefore, will be the actual success of our companies in the Government procurement market.''
The new agreement ''should give us full and effective access to that market,'' Mrs. Hills said.
 
Four Purchases Planned
The pact does not require Japan to buy a specific number of machines from the United States. But the Japanese Government plans to buy four supercomputers this year, an American trade official said. Such machines cost $7 million to $30 million each, he said.
The agreement appears to be one of the first fruits of meetings in California three weeks ago between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, trade negotiators said. The talks were prompted by a sense of alarm among officials in both countries that a continued impasse in trade negotiations would permanently damage their alliance.
An American trade official said the Japanese negotiators came to the talks on supercomputers, held here Wednesday and Thursday, ''with instructions to make a deal.'' As a result of high-level political pressure, he said, the Japanese showed a more forthcoming attitude.
 
Meeting Called Helpful
The Bush-Kaifu meeting definitely helped, he said. The Japanese negotiators ''said O.K. more often.''
A 1987 agreement between the United States and Japan called for an open, ''nondiscriminatory procurement process.'' Nevertheless, in May 1989, President Bush charged that Japan was maintaining an array of unfair trade barriers, and supercomputers were one of three areas chosen for special investigation. Japan faced the prospect of retaliatory trade sanctions, including high tariffs, if it did not relax the retrictions identified by the United States.
Mrs. Hills said it was ''too early to say'' whether the pact would resolve the case against Japan, filed last year under the so-called Super 301 section of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.
Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for Cray, said: ''We haven't had a chance to study the initial draft of the agreement. We just hope it will contain the provisions we need to open up the Japanese market.''
 
'The Real Test'
''The real test,'' he said, ''is whether this agreement, unlike the one signed in 1987, actually results in true competitive equity. By that, we mean actual sales and market-share increases for the American supercomputer industry.''
Mr. McGrath said Cray had 80 percent of the world supercomputer market outside Japan but only 66 percent when the Japanese market is included.
In 1988, 31 supercomputers were sold in Japan, 26 by Japanese manufacturers and 5 by American companies, according to Dataquest Inc., a market research concern in San Jose, Calif.
American companies supplied only 6 percent of the supercomputers bought by the Japanese Government and publicly financed universities in Japan, the United States trade representative's office said.
Under the agreement, the Japanese Government accepted the American contention that it should buy supercomputers on the basis of a combined assessment of price and value. In the past, American officials said, Japan bought the cheapest supercomputer that met its specifications, turning down superior American machines that were slightly more expensive. The main Japanese computer manufacturers, which all produce supercomputers, are Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and the NEC Corporation.
 
Bursts of High Speeds
In addition, an American trade official said, Japan agreed that it would no longer use ''theoretical peak performance'' as a factor in buying supercomputers. Japanese companies have designed computers to meet such standards; as a result, some Japanese supercomputers can reach extremely high speeds, but only for a fraction of a second.
American negotiators argued that supercomputers should instead be judged by their overall performance in solving practical problems.
Under the agreement, the Japanese Government is supposed to throw out ''excessively low bids.'' These are below-cost bids sometimes offered by Japanese companies that hope the deals will give them prestige and influence, and perhaps access to new software. Japan is to publicize the names of companies that submit such bids. American trade officials said such publicity would embarrass Japanese companies by indicating that they had engaged in unfair trade practices. The agreement, however, does not define excessively low bids.
American companies can file complaints with an ombudsman in the Prime Minister's office if they think they have been shut out of the market as a result of excessively low bids.
The American delegation in the talks was led by William Piez, a deputy assistant trade representative, who had been an economic officer at the American Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese delegation was led by Mitoji Yabunaka, an official at the Foreign Ministry. I.B.M.

Nearly half a century after a company here began processing fuel for nuclear weapons, St. Louis and several western suburbs are battling over a new disposal plan for millions of cubic yards of dirt contaminated with uranium, thorium, radium, actinium and other radioactive elements that are polluting the water, soil and air.
Not even in Denver, where plutonium particles escaped from the nearby Rocky Flats Plant, or in Salt Lake City, where a pile of uranium wastes was recently moved from the city to the desert, has a major metropolitan area contended with radioactive wastes on the scale facing St. Louis.
 
'Oldest Radioactive Waste'
''We have a million cubic yards of radioactive waste on this side of the Missouri River, a million and a half on the other side, and they don't know where to put the first cupful,'' said Kay Drey, a nuclear opponent here who is providing technical assistance to several suburban leaders. ''This is the oldest radioactive waste of the atomic age, and there still is no safe place to put the stuff.'' 
The Federal Government, which has spent a decade and $75 million studying the extent of the contamination, has not settled on a solution, but officials are leaning toward a plan that they say can accommodate half the waste: consolidating debris from a former uranium processing plant downtown and a handful of other sites onto 82 acres just north of Lambert International Airport in the suburb of Berkeley.
The City of St. Louis owns the land, which is divided into a site where some waste is already stored and an adjoining park that was closed in 1988 because of radiation in the soil.
Showing support for the Energy Department plan, St. Louis's Board of Aldermen has voted to transfer ownership of the land to the department. But the Mayor of Berkeley, William Miller, wants all the wastes removed from the area; he is leading a campaign to collect signatures from 15,000 St. Louis voters and repeal the board's decision.
''It makes no sense at all to have this much hot dirt around so many people and so many businesses,'' Mr. Miller said in an interview. ''Ultimately, we're going to have the responsibility to watch this site. But we have no say in what's done here.''
Mr. Miller's campaign has drawn support from the St. Louis County Municipal League, which represents more than 90 municipalities, and the mayors of Bridgeton, Hazelwood and eight other cities.
 
'A Potential Health Hazard'
The Energy Department's response to such concerns has hardly been reassuring. It has displayed a new candor about the risks that residents face, describing in a January report the extent of contamination around the metropolitan area, with special attention paid to the problem in Berkeley.
The radioactive waste near the airport, along the Berkeley-Hazelwood border, ''represents a potential health hazard to the general public,'' the the report said. ''There is no control of off-site contamination to prevent further spread of this material. The problem is magnified by the extensive commercial development in this area.''
The situation here is one of the most graphic illustrations of the enduring costs paid by an American community for its participation in the cold war. For 24 years, St. Louis was a vital link in the chain of production for atomic weapons because of a chemical process that the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works developed for purifying large quantities of uranium.
The company, one of the city's oldest industrial concerns, produced the uranium used at the University of Chicago on Dec. 2, 1942, to sustain the world's first nuclear chain reaction and for the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
 
Government Approved Dumping
Until 1966, Mallinckrodt processed uranium for nuclear weapons at its main plant along the Mississippi River in downtown St. Louis and in Weldon Spring, 25 miles to the west.
Under the cover of national security secrecy, the Government authorized the company to dump radioactive wastes quietly in the suburbs, including a 21-acre Berkeley field owned by St. Louis. It is that field and the 61-acre park across the street that the Government is considering for a permanent storage site.
David R. Bohm, an assistant city counselor for St. Louis, said the transfer of the land to the Government was subject to conditions. ''For the Department of Energy to gain control of the land,'' he said, ''they must agree that they will not charge the city for the cost of the cleanup. They must also agree not to put any other radioactive wastes there except those from three specific sites in the region.''
The Energy Department has spent $75 million since 1977 to assess the extent of contamination here and to build several small projects at Weldon Spring to reduce water pollution. In the meantime, the estimated cost of cleaning up Mallinckrodt's two plants and controlling the wastes at the site abutting the airport has reached $1.4 billion.
And the department also acknowledges that even though it has settled on a possible solution, new estimates of the size of the problem, inevitable court challenges and an array of other political hurdles mean that it is no closer to a permanent answer than it was when work began in the region 13 years ago. In 1981 the department estimated that there were 556,000 cubic yards of radioactive wastes in the St. Louis metropolitan area, roughly a fifth the current estimate.
''It's the most frustrating part of my life as a public official,'' said Mr. Miller, the 43-year-old Berkeley Mayor. ''People are retiring on the money they're making off this. It's a multimillion-dollar wait-and-see.''
 
Danger Denied in 1946
The wastes became an issue briefly in 1946, when reporters here asked questions about the trucks that were hauling dirt from the plant to land bordering the airport. The concerns disappeared after the Government and Mallinckrodt said the wastes were ''not radioactive or otherwise dangerous.''
From 1946 to 1957, Mallinckrodt hauled wastes from its downtown processing plant and dumped them in shallow pits north of the airport. In some places in Berkeley and Hazelwood, along roads where waste spilled from trucks, the Energy Department has found radiation levels seven times normal. Uranium, thorium and radium have also been found in sediments in Cold Water Creek, which drains the Berkeley park and then flows to the Missouri River.
The park, where children and adults played softball for decades, was closed in 1988 because of the high radiation levels found in the soil. The Energy Department hopes to use the park as the site for a permanent bunker to store the wastes.
While the Government favors this plan as the most economic cleanup method, it is studying a variety of options and says it will not make a decision until 1994 or 1995.
 
Problems Across the River
The problem is not Berkeley's alone. In 1957 Mallinckrodt transferred uranium processing to a new Government-owned plant across the Missouri River in Weldon Spring, and began dumping radioactive wastes into a quarry on the site. Uranium processing was halted in 1966, but the wastes remain. Cleaning them up is now expected to cost $594 million. In 1979 the Energy Department estimated the Weldon Spring cleanup cost at $3.6 million.
And in downtown St. Louis, just south of the McKinley Bridge, the department found radiation levels in excess of Federal health guidelines inside 14 buildings at the Mallinckrodt chemical plant that are still in use.
A fourth contaminated site, the West Lake landfill, has been found about 10 miles west of Berkeley in Bridgeton.
Keith F. Pickett, a spokesman for the company, now called Mallinckrodt Inc. and owned by the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, says the hazard to the company's workers is negligible because most of the contamination is confined to small spots. ''The Department of Energy has assured us and our employees that there is no real risk,'' he said.
 
Excessive Deaths From Cancer
But some workers are worried. In 1980 a study by epidemiologists under contract to the Energy Department found an excessive number of deaths from cancer of the esophagus and leukemia among 2,731 white males who processed uranium for Mallinckrodt from 1942 to 1966. The researchers did not identify a cause of the cancers.
Scientists have long known that high levels of radiation, far above the levels at which the Mallinckrodt workers have been exposed, can lead to malignancies of the blood, bones and organs. At low levels the effect is less certain, although a recent study by the National Academy of Sciences said low doses of radiation were more dangerous than was thought five years ago.
''My concern is that we're getting doses that are bad and nobody wants to tell us,'' said Kathy Collins, a 38-year-old chemical operator at the plant. ''The company doesn't want to talk about this because it's a skeleton in their closet. They hide behind the Energy Department, which tells them there is no problem.''

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS WARM TO MOYNIHAN PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, March 23

 BODY:
The top leaders of the Democratic National Committee, led by the party's chairman, Ronald H. Brown, today strongly endorsed a plan to cut Social Security taxes, despite opposition among the Democratic leadership in Congress.
The endorsement, as well as a similar statement of support from a group of conservative Democrats meeting in New Orleans, breathed new political life into the proposal, offered last December by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.
But it also dramatized the schism in the party between its political wing, which yearns for issues to help it recapture the White House, and its governing wing, which already holds power in Congress and worries about the impact on the Federal deficit of a substantial tax cut.
Mr. Brown, the party's chief political figure, called the Moynihan plan a ''political stroke of genius'' that would help Democrats re-establish themselves as the party of working people, while Republicans pushed a capital gains tax cut that would benefit the wealthy. 
 
Support for Brown Stand
Mr. Brown was joined in support of the tax cut today by both the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee, meeting here, and by the top officers of the Democratic Leadership Council, a caucus of the party's more conservative wing, meeting in New Orleans. The party executive committee unanimously approved a resolution, offered by New York's state chairman, John Marino, urging Congress to adopt a plan cutting Social Security taxes.
The resolution portrayed the Social Security tax as ''a regressive tax which falls most heavily on low- and middle-income workers.'' Rolling it back would produce ''a tax cut for working people and small businesses,'' the resolution said.
Mr. Moynihan's proposal would slash Social Security taxes by $62 billion over two years, thus eliminating a retirement fund surplus that has been used to help offset the Federal budget deficit. His proposal was intended to be something of an economics lesson to show how in the last decade the burden of taxation shifted from income taxes to the Social Security tax and to show how the retirement funds were being used to mask the Government's operating deficit. The proposal offers no suggestions for how to reduce the enlarged deficit that the loss of Social Security funds would cause.
Asked about the concerns that Democrats in Congress have about the deficit, Mr. Brown replied: ''We think the matters of principle have to be decided first.''
 
Bentsen Reasserts Opposition
A leader of the Congressional Democrats, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, quickly reasserted his opposition to cutting Social Security taxes.
''I don't want to get in a bidding war with the Republicans on cutting taxes because I don't know where that one stops,'' said Mr. Bentsen, his party's 1988 candidate for Vice President, ''and we have a responsibiity to get this deficit down.''
Mr. Bentsen said that Democrats would be at a disadvantage in a bidding war with the Republicans because, ''they don't care how far they'll go.''
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland said it was only natural that the party's political operatives would see the Moynihan plan differently from the Congressional leaders.
''They don't have to implement it,'' he said. The party leaders were fulfilling their job, Mr. Hoyer said, by pushing a politically attractive tax cut. But he added: ''What do you do next? How do you meet that shortfall.''
The Leadership Council has often been at odds with the more liberal party members who control the official party structure. But spokesmen for both groups said it was a foul-up in scheduling, not an illustration of disunity, that the party and its often dissident right wing had held separate meetings in separate cities on the same day.
To drive home that point, Mr. Brown boarded a plane and flew from here to New Orleans this morning to speak to the Leadership Council.
''It just makes sense for us Democrats to be on the side of cutting payroll taxes for working people,'' Mr. Brown told the group. ''The Social Security tax is one of the most regressive we have, and Senator Moynihan has touched a real nerve by daring the Adminsitration to come clean and admit to what they've been up to.''
 
Moynihan Presents Case
Mr. Moynihan himself spoke to the council and presented his case that increases over recent years in the Social Security tax, which is deducted from payrolls, was being used to mask the true size of the Federal deficit.
''Ought we to allow it to go on?'' he asked. ''They have been looting these funds.''
The Leadership Council, as part of an ''agenda for the 1990's'' it distributed in New Orleans, said: ''The payroll tax burden on average American families needs to be reduced and progressivity restored to the overall tax structure so Americans are taxed according to their ability to pay.''
The resolution endorsed here by the party executive committee noted that during the Reagan Administration the percentage of Federal revenues coming from the Social Security tax increased while the percentage coming from the more progressive personal and corporate income taxes had declined.
Representative Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, has been trying to fashion a consensus on the tax issue, so far to no avail. Mr. Gephardt said he thought the debate within the party was good and that the eventual outcome would be a plan that embraced the themes being voiced today.

Hard Labor on the Plantation, Updated

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
As black workers cut sugar cane in the 1940's, a narrator notes that these happy laborers are following the ''hereditary urge to go back to the plantation.'' That archival clip, included in Stephanie Black's ''H-2 Worker,'' suggests how little the plantation mentality has changed in nearly 50 years, though today the sugar-cane growers rely on Jamaicans imported to Florida for six months every year.
Ms. Black's documentary follows the men who arrive on H-2 visas, temporary permits that allow foreigners to take jobs for which employers cannot find Americans. According to the film, each year 10,000 Jamaicans respond to the promise of more money than they can make at home, and become virtual prisoners, crowded into dormitories that resemble army barracks, paid at most $5 an hour -minus transportation and housing fees - for grueling field work. 
Though Ms. Black's sympathy with the laborers is manifest, ''H-2 Worker'' is that rare hybrid that succeeds as both film and advocacy. The documentary's look and form is smooth and sophisticated, combining reggae music, voice-overs of letters between the Jamaicans and their families at home, interviews with the workers and with a sugar industry representative, and archival material that sets the current situation in historical context. Ms. Black is not artistically innovative, but she has mastered some fundamental rules of effective documentary film-making. She assumes a calm, objective tone, allowing the visual images and interviews to speak for themselves. She lures viewers to her point of view rather than bludgeoning them.
Maryse Alberti's cinematography is a major element of the film's convincing realism. Ms. Alberti creates rich images of the men in the fields, bending to cut cane that stands taller than they do; even a glimpse suggests the strain on one's back. The dormitory, with laundry strung between the bunks, looks stark and demoralizing, but not exaggeratedly gruesome. Most important, the film never looks picturesque or condescending.
The workers are quietly angry, dignified and often resigned as they describe their thwarted expectations. Some say they were not told of the restrictions: workers cannot leave the camp for more than 24 hours, and cannot go more than 30 miles away. But one man has been returning to Florida for 14 years, suggesting the dilemma facing poor people with limited opportunities. When the workers stage a stoppage to complain about low wages, the police are brought in to remove them from the camp; within a week 300 replacement workers are flown in from Jamaica.
''H-2 Worker'' will be shown tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 6 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the New Directors/New Films series. It does not pretend to offer any answers, but it solidly frames issues about the economy, employment and the treatment of workers who seem just steps away from slavery.

HEADLINE: As Scores Drop, Schools Look for Lessons

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
At Public School 153 in Co-op City in the Bronx, there was the delicious feeling last year that they had beaten the odds. Test scores showed that almost 95 percent of the students read at grade level or above, raising the school's rank to 9th from 328th among the city's 616 elementary schools.
But after the latest test, which used a new, tougher standard, that rank dropped to 115th out of 618 schools, and delight gave way to bafflement.
''I can't give a reason for the change,'' said the principal, Beverly Taylor. 
Hers is not the only school puzzled by sharp drops in reading scores. When the 1989 scores and school-by-school rankings were released this week, 13 percent of New York City's 618 elementary schools were shown to have had changes - up or down -of 10 percentage points or more from the 1988 scores. Only four of the 180 intermediate and junior high schools showed such wide fluctuations.
On the face of it, at least part of the reason for the decline would appear to be the tougher standards. But school officials eliminated that as a factor by recalculating the 1988 scores using the 1989 standards.
Under that recalculation, P.S. 153's score of 94 percent in 1988 would have been 78.8 percent by 1989's standards. But the 1989 score still fell far short, to 66.5 percent, reflecting a loss of 12.3 percentage points.
''Until I analyze the data I won't know if there were any weaknesses,'' said the principal, Ms. Taylor, who often walks the beige and orange halls of the school chatting with teachers and admiring students' art. ''The feeling here is we're doing fine because the teachers work very hard and our focus is not so much on test scores as it is on total education.''
Nevertheless, principals like Ms. Taylor and other school officials are trying to understand the declines by looking at many possible factors.
 
Measuring Beyond Numbers
One is student turnover. In one school with a sharp drop in scores, more than half the student body changed from one year to the next. In two other schools there was an influx of students from a low-income housing project who had much lower reading levels than the students who were already en-rolled. School officials are also searching for ways to measure themselves beyond using only numbers.
The Board of Education wants principals and teachers to look at other school characteristics and use the reading scores as just an additional piece of information about their school. When it released its reading-achievement rankings this year, the Board for the first time took note of other factors, like school attendance, teacher experience, proficiency in English and the percentage of students eligible for free lunch, a measure of poverty levels in the schools.
Board officials also routinely caution that standardized tests are imperfect and that scores are only one indicator of achievement.
''Let's face it; this is one day in May when we sit all the kids down and take a test,'' said Robin Willner, the Board of Education's executive director for strategic planning and research development. ''Though these tests have been reviewed and revalidated, they measure a narrow band of skills. We say if a youngster can read this paragraph and answer these questions they can read at a certain grade level. It still doesn't tell us a lot about a kid's analytical ability. It's not about analysis; it's not about creativity.''
Even so, principals acknowledge that the scores are viewed as an enormous reflection of the school's image as good, bad or improving.
 
'Of Course It Bothers Me'
''Everyone wants to be in the 95th percentile,'' said Joseph L. Cugini, the principal at Public School 46 in South Beach, S.I. Scores released last year showed that 64.5 of his students read at or above grade level, compared with the 43.6 percent indicated by the scores released Tuesday.
''Of course it bothers me,'' Mr. Cugini said.
The new standards caused an overall decline in scores systemwide for the 370,000 students in Grades 3 to 9 who took the test in May: 47.4 percent read at or above grade level, compared with 66.9 percent in 1988, when the old standards were used.
''One less correct answer equals several percentage points,'' Mr. Cugini said. ''We have only 245 students in kindergarten through fifth grade and if one child goes down, the percentile goes down.''
Mr. Cugini said his school's high mobility rate might have affected its scores. He said more children are coming to the school from other boroughs and that more come from home without books or where their parents do not speak English.
The test standards were recalculated at a higher level to reflect an improvement in reading nationwide that has taken place since the last national standard was set in 1982. The norms are intended to represent average reading levels based on national samplings of students in each grade. Thus, students would need to perform better to receive the same score and even students who performed about the same would register a decrease in their score.
Mary F. Kelly, an adjunct assistant psychology and education professor at Columbia University's Teachers College, said double-digit reading level changes from one year to the next are unusual. And, she said, lower scores can be demoralizing to parents, teachers and students because the tests are not sophisticated enough to pick up the real gains that also occur.
''Tests are helpful for looking at a kid's progress over time, and they are good, objective measures because you don't have teacher bias,'' she said. ''But it's not good to use a single measure for anything, especially for something as complicated as what goes on in classroom.''
 
'I Love Complicated Words'
A recent visit to the third-grade classroom of Joan Grochowsky at P.S. 153 showed little concern about numbers. There, the students were smoothly reading words like ''ramifications'' and ''consequences'' and talking about the census. They discussed the ramifications of undercounting the elderly.
''I love complicated words in books, like 'elementary' or 'encyclopedia,' '' said Candiece Goodall, who is 8 years old.
Ms. Taylor, the principal, said with a sweep of her arms. ''This is what's important to me - thinking. ''Children have to learn to think analytically, deductively. The tests are good only as a guide for what you need for reading instructon for the next year.''
At Junior High School 217 and Public School 217, housed in the same building on Roosevelt Island, there were reasons why scores dropped that had nothing to do with how teachers taught, said the principal, Dorothy Bowser. The elementary school scores dropped 16 percentage points over last year, and those for the junior high declined 11.1 percentage points. The elementary school was ranked 180th in the city, down from 27th.
''There was a housing development that opened and a number of students came from schools that were economically disadvantaged,'' she said. ''We saw immediately there was a disparity in reading ability. We knew there was going to be a drop.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins Woos His Party To Win Its Convention

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, March 23

 BODY:
Seeking to promote his city's image and economy, Mayor David N. Dinkins, a vision of urban glamour, arrived in Indiana today, intent on persuading the Democratic Party to hold its national convention in New York City in 1992.
With a delegation that included the former Vice-Presidential candidate Geraldine A. Ferraro and former Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, Mr. Dinkins came to the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee for a whirlwind round of hellos and handshakes that he hopes might bring $100 million in revenue to the city and its businesses.
''Why do we venture across the Hudson and into America's heartland?'' he asked before he left La Guardia Airport. ''Let me assure you, we will have little time for sightseeing. The chance for $100 million and 40,000 visitors is worth a weekend trip to Indiana.'' 
At a party with the Democratic national chairman, Ronald H. Brown, in caucuses with female, black and Hispanic party members and as host of a dessert reception featuring apple strudel, apple tarts and apple cake, the Mayor urged the Democrats to take their quadrennial convention back to the Big Apple, where the party nominated Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980.
 
'No City Is More Exciting'
''I believe that no urban center stands taller for the potential of a new Democratic majority than does New York,'' Mr. Dinkins said in remarks prepared for delivery tonight. ''No city is more exciting as a place to convene than New York. And no people are more passionate about the progressive ideas and ideals of our party than the people of New York.''
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch had begun tentative efforts to get the convention. But his stock with the national party was not particularly high, especially after his harsh criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the New York Presidential primary in 1988.
Mr. Dinkins, newly in office but long a party loyalist, has made obtaining the convention a major priority, part of his effort to become a national spokesman for urban concerns and to give New York a psychological and financial lift in times of fiscal austerity. He has set up a host committee of prominent New Yorkers to raise $20 million, mostly in private contributions and in-kind services, to support the convention, which would be held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and Madison Square Garden.
The city is to play host to the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to America that same year, and officials acknowledged that the logistical and security concerns for both events would be costly. But they said the benefits of having the convention and the tourism it would bring outweigh the risks.
''For us, it holds some real economic possibilities, and it comes at a very interesting time,'' said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins's chief political aide, who accompanied him here. ''With all the changes around the world and with people in Eastern Europe who'll be getting the chance to see our democracy in action, we'd like them to see it in New York.''
 
Other Cities in the Running
City officials said they believed their main competition was New Orleans, but Cleveland, Detroit and Houston are also in the running. After learning that Mr. Dinkins was planning to come here this weekend, Mr. Lynch said, some other mayors decided to come, too.
The host committee includes leaders in business, labor and entertainment, including Stanley Hill, head of District Council 37, the municipal workers' union; Preston Robert Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, and Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts. From April 4 to 6, they are to welcome the Democrats' site selection committee to New York for a grand tour. The committee is to recommend a site to Mr. Brown, who is a New Yorker, by May.
Mr. Dinkins said one of the biggest obstacles New York must overcome is the size of Madison Square Garden, where the general sessions would be held, while committee meetings would take place in the Javits Center. But he said New York could offer more space than the Omni in Atlanta, where the 1988 convention was held.
For his part, Mr. Brown said no decision had been made, and he would not speculate on New York's chances. ''New York is one of the finalists,'' he said, ''and clearly a city that I have much attachment to.''
At a reception at the Hall of Fame of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Mr. Dinkins mingled with the Democratic crowd, admiring photographs of committee members' grandchildren as others pointed him out as one of the biggest celebrities in the room.

HEADLINE: 10-Day Vehicle Sales Off 9.5% As Season Gets a Slow Start

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 23

 BODY:
The automobile industry's important spring selling season has started poorly. Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks in mid-March were down by 9.5 percent from a year ago, with all of the Big Three companies reporting declines today.
The sales of cars made in American plants were down by 8.9 percent during the 10 days that ended on March 20. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the cars sold at an annual rate of 6.3 million from March 10 to 20, compared with an annual rate of 6.8 million a year earlier. The seasonally adusted annual rate for the preceding 30 days was 6.5 million. 
Light-truck sales were off by 10.6 percent in the period. Eight selling days were in each period.
The Chrysler Corporation was particularly hard hit, with its car sales falling by 29.9 percent, to 18,108 units, and its sales of light trucks off by 23.3 percent, to 20,199 units. The declines came despite an aggressive advertising campaign aimed at winning back buyers who have favored Japanese models.
At the General Motors Corporation, its automobile sales were off by 10.4 percent, to 82,740 units, and those of light trucks were down by 7.8 percent, to 44,112 units.
The Ford Motor Company reported a 10 percent slide in its car sales, to 51,703 units during the period, and a 5.5 percent decline in its light trucks sales, to 38,481 units.
The lackluster sales in the last three weeks contrast with the industry's fairly optimistic production schedules for the second quarter. Analysts said today that if vehicle sales remained soft in coming weeks, auto makers would be forced to revise their planned output for April through June.
''This defers the optimism,'' said Charles J. Brady, an automobile analyst for Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''We had a situation where sales had been running meaningfully ahead of production, causing inventories to come down to healthy levels. If sales remain flat at this level, production increases in the second quarter will be only marginal.''
 
Ford to Idle Plant
 Ford said today that it would shut down its assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich., for a week beginning on April 2, idling 2,100 workers, because of a shortage of orders from dealers for the Mustang. But the company said its second-quarter production plans already reflected the downtime.
Some automobile executives suggest potential buyers are postponing purchases because they expect an economic downturn.
''There has been a slide in consumer confidence,'' said Joel H. Pitcoff, a market analyst for Ford. ''A surprising number of people are expecting interest rates and unemployment and inflation to go higher.''
General Motors hopes to entice customers back into showrooms with new incentives that were announced on Thursday. The cash rebates are being offered on its new APV mini-vans and two Geo models, the compact Prizm and Storm, as well as other slow-selling cars.
 
Tapping Big Demand
 
 Jim Perkins, the general manager of G.M.'s Chevrolet division, said the company was offering the rebates ''to tap the incredible demand for mini-vans still out there in the marketplace.''
But some of the analysts said the rebates could harm the company by cutting into future sales.
''At this stage of the sales cycle, it is impossible to argue that there is any pent-up demand out there,'' said Michael M. Luckey, the president of the Luckey Consulting Group Inc. in Cresskill, N.J. ''The impact of incentives now is to shift sales from one period to another.''
Together, the sales of cars made by the Big Three were down by 13.2 percent, while those of cars made by Japanese producers in the United States rose by 30.8 percent in the period.
The five Japanese auto makers also accounted for 14 percent of car sales during the mid-March period, compared with a 9.7 percent share a year earlier.
The sales of cars made by Honda of America Inc. rose by 8.4 percent, to 9,808 units. Mazda North America Inc.'s car sales increased by 87.3 percent, to 2,593 units. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. reported sales gains of 70.7 percent over a year ago, to 8,580 units, while Mitsubishi Motor Sales America Inc.'s sales more than doubled, to 1,268 units. The results for Toyota and Mitsubishi reflect new production at their American plants.
The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. was the only Japanese car maker to report a sales decline, as sales of its cars fell by 13.6 percent, to 2,515 units, and the company's light-truck sales slipped by 11.1 percent, to 3,822 units.

HEADLINE: No Shortage, but Costlier Coffee

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
No matter what economic changes are made next in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of coffee and the largest supplier to the United States, American coffee drinkers will almost certainly be paying more next month at the supermarkets.
Two weeks ago, before Brazil's new President took office and ordered dramatic changes to attack rampant inflation, Folger's, a division of Procter & Gamble and one of America's largest coffee roasters, announced a sharp increase in the price it charges stores for its coffees.
Last week, Maxwell House, a division of General Foods and the nation's largest roaster, decided on a similar increase, but did not announce it. ''Nobody asked us until now,'' a Maxwell House spokesman said. 
 
Lower Export Prices Seen
 Both roasters say they will go ahead with the increases even though some coffee traders believe the Brazilian economic changes could lead to lower export prices in the short term. The Maxwell House spokesman said the company's increases were based on future purchases of high-grade, more expensive coffee beans. He said the rise was also based on what he described as ''higher labor, packaging and distribution costs.''
The increases by Folger's and Maxwell House will lift the wholesale price of a 13-ounce can by 25 cents, or 10 percent, to $2.75. Higher-quality Colombian coffee will go up 35 cents, or 12.5 percent, to $3.15 a can.
Early this year, coffee futures prices rose swiftly, to eight-month highs, partly because of uncertainly about shipments from Brazil and other major exporting countries. Esther Eskenasy, a commodity analyst and trader for Cargill Investor Services Inc., said roasters, traders, exporters and others were closely watching Brazil's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office on March 15.
Mr. Collor has already put into effect his plans to tame his country's runaway economic problems. His first actions included abolishing the Brazilian Coffee Institute, which controls the coffee trade and which has an estimated 17 million bags of coffee in storage. Each bag holds 132 pounds of beans. He also introduced a new currency with floating foreign exchange rates and put limits on bank withdrawals.
Coffee traders say the actions will probably increase Brazilian sales in the short term, as growers and others try to raise cash. Since the moves were announced, coffee futures prices for the May delivery have fallen about 6 cents. May prices closed yesterday at 89.3 cents a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, off 4.3 cents for the day.
 
Investing in Coffee
 The May contract traded at a high of $1.5025 on Jan. 3, 1989, but after the termination of the International Coffee Organization quota system last July, the contract dropped; it sold as low at 72.75 cents a pound on Oct. 9, according to Commodity Research Bureau figures.
As recently as two weeks ago, prices were more than $1 a pound, in part because many of Brazil's growers were hoarding their coffee supplies. Even individuals there had invested in bags of coffee as a way to combat inflation, which was measured at 2,571 percent over the last 12 months. One result was an artificial coffee shortage in some markets, like the United States, that depend heavily on Brazil.
But many analysts note that there is no worldwide coffee shortage to explain the steep rise in either the futures markets or by American roasters.
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst and vice president at Paine Webber, said he thought Folger's and Maxwell House ''got carried away.'' He said that the Brazilian Coffee Institute will have about six months to divest itself of the millions of bags of coffee in storage. Since the coffee will probably be fed into the world market slowly, prices may not drop rapidly. In fact, he added, prices will eventually rise as the roasters enter the market to buy additional supplies of high-quality coffee.
 
Some Shortages
 While there is no overall shortage of coffee, traders have been kept guessing by international uncertainty. High-quality coffee is in short supply, and it is that category that American consumers have been increasingly buying in recent years. In addition, perhaps because of the lower prices, total consumption in this country increased a little late last year.
Colombia, the major supplier of high-quality beans for the United States, has already sold most of its exportable coffee for this season, which is one reason why this coffee is going up in price.
Another exporter, Mexico, which had oversold its coffee harvest to the export markets, had to buy up to 400,000 bags from other countries for internal use and to meet other commitments, which also led to upward pressure on prices. Mr. Savaiko said the move became necesssary because of the loss of part of the crop during an unusually cold December.
In addition, there have been reports of civil unrest in the Ivory Coast, which exports coffee to Europe. The reports alarmed European roasters, whose purchases put pressure on prices.
Brazil's 1989-90 coffee crop was ample, totaling 26 million bags, slightly above the 25 million of the previous crop year, the United States Department of Agriculture said.
Arthur Stevenson, a coffee analyst for Prudential-Bache, said production of high-quality coffee grown in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil would drop, carrying prices higher, Miss Eskenasy of Cargill agreed, saying, ''I feel the market will move higher but will do so by stages.'' She added, however, ''Even in Brazil they don't know what will happen to prices.''

HEADLINE: Fed Nominee Backs Policy On Inflation

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
David W. Mullins Jr., the Bush Administration's first nominee to the Federal Reserve Board, testified today that he supports the central bank's current strategy of fighting inflation by keeping interest rates high.
''I would not disagree with the current policy,'' Mr. Mullins told the Senate Banking Committee at his confirmation hearing. ''The current policy has relatively high real rates. I think that is having a moderating effect on inflation, and I hope that will lead to lower rates.'' 
Mr. Mullins, 43 years old, has played a central role in the Bush Administration's economic policy as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance.
 
View of Fed-Treasury Conflict
 In his testimony, Mr. Mullins said recent reports that the Treasury had been unhappy with the Fed policy, preferring lowering interest rates to stimulate economic growth and bring down the value of the dollar, had been exaggerated.
''Fundamentally there is no conflict between growth and reducing inflation,'' Mr. Mullins said. ''Reducing inflation is an important prerequisite for maximizing growth.''
Mr. Mullins's hearing lasted for more than two and half hours, unusually long for a nominee who is facing little or no opposition.
Several senators questioned whether Mr. Mullins would be an independent voice on the Fed board or simply a voice of the Treasury.
 
Questions on Greenspan Article
 Other questions centered on a recent article in The Los Angeles Times suggesting that Mr. Bush did not intend to reappoint Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends in 17 months.
Mr. Mullins said he had met privately before his nomination in December with Richard G. Darman, the head of the Office of Management and Budget; Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. But he said that he was unaware of any displeasure in the Administration toward Mr. Greenspan and that he would be an independent voice at the Fed.
A former professor at the Harvard Business School, Mr. Mullins is a specialist in banking, capital markets and corporate finance. Aside from what he said today, his overall economic and monetary policy views are little known. He first gained national recognition when he served as an assistant on the report on the market crash of October 1987 conducted by Nicholas F. Brady, who is now Treasury Secretary.
When Mr. Brady came to Washington, he brought Mr. Mullins with him to help draft the Bush Administration's savings and loan bailout legislation. Mr. Mullins had primary responsibility for guiding the measure through Congress last year.
 
Defends Bailout Estimate
 He testified today that ''convincing and compelling evidence'' was still lacking that the $50 billion bailout was seriously underfinanced, as L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and many critics have argued.
Mr. Mullins was nominated to fill the remaining six years of the term of H. Robert Heller, who resigned his Fed seat to become executive vice president of Visa International, the credit card company.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the Banking Committee, said he would support Mr. Mullins's nomination. A vote on the nomination could come as early as next week.

HEADLINE: U.S. Resists Japan Plea To Aid Yen

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 23

 BODY:
Japan asked the United States today for help in checking the fall of the yen, but the United States went along only part way, arguing that the reasons for the yen's weakness are largely Japanese and that there is little Washington can do.
The request was made at a meeting here between Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
In a joint statement after the meeting, the two sides reaffirmed a commitment to close economic and monetary cooperation but did not announce any new policy initiatives.
 
 Emphasis on Currency Issues
 Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto specifically mentioned cooperation in exchange markets in the statement after their six-hour meeting. 
The 50-word statement had not been expected and represented a concession to Mr. Hashimoto.
It was sought by the Japanese finance chief in a move to shore up confidence in Tokyo and halt a slide in the markets that has taken the yen to three-year lows and driven share prices on the Tokyo exchange down 25 percent since the first of the year, including a 3.1 percent drop in a volatile session on Thursday.
The meeting, scheduled more than two weeks ago, has attracted extra attention because of this turmoil.
The statement did not appear to break new ground and was similar to the declaration made by President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu after their talks in Palm Springs, Calif., on March 2 and 3.
 
'Speak for Itself'
 American officials declined to say whether there would now be greater joint intervention in the currency markets. Mr. Brady told reporters that ''the statement will have to speak for itself,'' adding, ''We'll continue to do what we have done.''
American willingness to issue a joint statement with the Japanese was a sign of concern that the steep decline in Tokyo stock prices could affect Wall Street and other global markets. As a senior Treasury official put it after the meeting, ''We want to make very sure that this adjustment gets through the system without causing major dislocations.''
Mr. Brady, a former investment banker, told reporters that so far ''the rest of the world's markets have operated pretty much in a stable manner.'' He added that it was ''very important'' that big stock market moves ''go through the world financial system in a way that people can continue to have confidence and conduct business.''
Asked what he hoped the markets would take away from the meeting, a senior Treasury official commented later, ''Stability and some real feeling that school will keep.''
A senior United States official told reporters before the meeting started that there were factors behind the fall of the yen that the United States could do little to alter. He cited investors' re-evaluation of Japanese assets and some increase in inflationary expectations in Japan.
''It's a simple supply-demand relationship,'' the official said.
Mr. Hashimoto, an important figure in the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, is eager to stabilize the financial markets, said Japanese officials, who added that this was important for his political future. Mr. Hashimoto was one of the few Cabinet ministers to be reappointed after Mr. Kaifu's party retained power in the February elections.
American analysts differed on what the United States should be doing. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy group, said it was time to ''dust off'' a 1986 monetary intervention agreement between the United States and Japan ''and start a concerted effort to get the yen rising, which, in view of the underlying strength of the Japanese economy and the trade balance, should be rising.''
Mr. Bergsten said a powerful reason why Americans should act is that the weak yen undermines American competitiveness by making Japanese goods cheaper on global markets.
But John H. Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington policy research group, said, ''I don't think there is much the United States can or should do about it.''
What the United States does not want is turmoil in the foreign exchange markets.
 
Paris Meeting on April 7
 Mr. Brady is holding meetings with individual finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations before the group meets in Paris on April 7. Earlier this month in Europe, Mr. Brady talked to finance ministers of Britain, France, West Germany and Italy. A meeting is expected shortly in Washington with Canada's Finance Minister, Michael H. Wilson.
Today's meeting also took up bilateral trade issues and discussed plans for increasing the resources of the International Monetary Fund and establishing a new multinational bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to help the countries of Eastern Europe that are abandoning Communism.
At the beginning of this month, President Bush and Prime Minister Kaifu met in California, where Mr. Bush pressed Japan to do more to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, which last year totaled $49 billion. Mr. Kaifu promised to make reduction of trade tensions with the United States a top priority.
With the possibility that American retaliatory moves on Japan could be imposed as soon as this summer, Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto today discussed a special campaign by the United States to make it easier to sell American products in Japan.
The campaign, which began last summer and is called the Structural Impediments Initiative, is aimed chiefly at fostering broad structural changes in Japan, like reducing the regulatory delays that hold up the opening of large retail stores, strengthening antitrust enforcement and reducing dependence on exports for economic growth.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said Thursday in Washington that the United States would retaliate if the Japanese did not meet market-opening deadlines, but added that she remained ''very hopeful'' that we will have progress.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Up By 3.3%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
A rebound in dealers' orders for automobiles pushed orders for durable goods up by 3.3 percent last month, the Government said today, but the recovery after January's record plunge offered little hope that manufacturing was pulling out of its slump.
The Commerce Department said that orders to United States factories for items like cars, refrigerators and other goods meant to last at least three years rose to $121.56 billion last month, from $117.63 billion in January. The January decline was revised to 10.7 percent from the previously reported 10.5 percent. 
 
Lower January Rate
 Weak orders for new cars also pulled January's orders lower as manufacturers cut production and offered incentives to help dealers reduce bloated stocks of unsold cars. But workers were hired back in February and auto output rose.
Speaking of the February report, David M. Jones, an economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York, said, ''It simply confirms the fact that the goods-producing sector of the economy remains very sluggish.'' But pointing to the small rise for February, he added, ''There is no threat of recession on the immediate horizon.''
The United States Chamber of Commerce, representing most of the nation's manufacturers, called the February increase ''puny'' and said it was discouraging for producers.
''High interest rates continue to hit this sector the hardest, and there is no let-up in sight,'' said Richard W. Rahn, the group's chief economist.
Orders for military tanks and ships rose sharply in February, but those for aircraft and parts fell for a second straight month.
 
Transportation Orders Up
 Total transportation orders climbed by 11.2 percent last month after dropping by 29.4 percent in January. But excluding transportation, orders rose in February by only 1 percent after falling by 3 percent the previous month.
Orders for durables, a primary part of American manufacturing, are closely watched as an indicator of the economy's health.
Industries making durable goods, which employ about 23 percent of the nation's work force, have been under pressure for months as exports have slumped and employment dropped as the auto makers, for example, laid off workers to cut back inventories.
Car sales fell in February, pulling total retail sales down from January levels, and they were also below the same levels a year ago in early March.
The General Motors Corporation announced new incentives this week to lure consumers. A survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks last week said that the economy was expanding at a slow pace, but added that the automobile industry was vulnerable. Military orders are also under pressure.
 
Unfilled Orders Off 0.4%
 Unfilled orders, an indicator of coming activity, fell by four-tenths of a percent last month - the first decline in the order backlog since last August - after rising by two-tenths of a percent in January.
Shipments of durable goods rose by 5.9 percent in February, after a 4.4 percent decline the previous month.
The orders for military capital goods, like tanks and ships, jumped by 22.6 percent in February after falling by 33.6 percent in January. Non-military orders for such goods fell by 5.7 percent after a 13.7 percent decline in January.
In other sectors, orders for electrical machinery rose by 4.2 percent in February after a 15 percent January decline, but non-electrical machinery orders fell by 1.1 percent after rising by 3 percent in January.

HEADLINE: List of Japan Goals Cited

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 23

 BODY:
The United States Government has given Japan a list of more than 200 suggested policy changes aimed at eliminating barriers faced by foreign companies operating in Japan, a news report said today.
Quoting unidentified United States Government officials, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun said the recommendations ranged from an increase in public works spending to the release of the minutes of business group meetings. The newspaper said the proposals were more detailed and far-reaching than Japanese officials had expected and amounted to a plan to ''remake Japan.''
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Taizo Watanabe, declined to comment today at a regular news conference.
The newspaper said the recommendations were presented as part of talks, begun last year, concerning the two nations' trade imbalance. The United States has called for tighter enforcement of Japan's Anti-Monopoly Law, controls on high land prices and higher public works spending.
The list of recommendations included proposals to consolidate the 13 Government offices that deal with land policy, the creation of a special antitrust division to strengthen enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law and abolishing legislation that protects small shops from competition, the newspaper said.

HEADLINE: East Bloc Trade Shift Seen

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOVER, West Germany, March 23

 BODY:
The United States Secretary of Commerce, Robert A. Mosbacher, said today that a substantial streamlining of Western curbs on high-technology exports to Eastern Europe is likely to be completed by June.
In an interview, Mr. Mosbacher said, ''Cabinet-level discussions will begin soon'' on sharply trimming the list of restricted technologies of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom. He cited telecommunications, computers and machine tools as areas in which restrictions need to be relaxed to reflect the changes in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Mosbacher played down reports of differences between the United States and West Germany on the trade status of Eastern Europe.
Helmut Haussmann, West Germany's Economics Minister, met with Mr. Mosbacher on Thursday. After the meeting, Mr. Haussmann was critical of the Cocom restrictions.
Mr. Mosbacher said, ''I was pleased to find that Economics Minister Haussmann and I agree on the need to differentiate between the trade status of the Soviet Union and that of Eastern Europe as far as Cocom is concerned.''
Mr. Haussmann said, ''Our common security philosophy should be strict controls on a hard core of exports that are really important strategically or militarily, not an export ban for everything that contains a chip.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against the Yen But Gains in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the yen yesterday as investors regained some confidence in the Japanese currency.
Analysts said a rise in interest rates in Japan and a recovery on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after a string of steep losses helped support the yen, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks.
Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc., said traders believed Japanese yields would go even higher, which would make the yen even more attractive. 
The dollar fell to 154.30 yen in New York, from 155.11 late Thursday. In Tokyo early yesterday, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to close at 155.07 yen, and in London, it was quoted at a sharply lower rate of 153.85 yen.
Overseas dealers said the dollar was hit in afternoon dealings by a report, later denied, that Japan was moving to issue dollar-denominated bonds in a bid to add a layer of intervention to help the sagging yen.
The dollar was also hit by selling as investors apparently took profits before talks yesterday between Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his Japanese counterpart, Ryutaro Hashimoto, in Los Angeles.
Although the dollar fell against the yen, it was higher against the West German currency, rising to 1.7135 marks from 1.7028, and it also gained against the French franc, the Swiss franc and the Italian lira.
Mr. Barbanel said the dollar's strong showing against other currencies was due partly to higher interest rates in the United States, and also to concerns about tensions between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. The dollar is seen as a safe haven in times of international political strife.
In New York trading, compared with late Thursday's quotes, the dollar rose to 1.5200 Swiss francs, from 1.5120; to 5.7720 French francs, from 5.7415, and to 1,260.25 Italian lire, from 1,255.50, The pound recovered somewhat abroad from its recent slide on Britain's economic woes and political uncertainty, rising in London to $1.6040, from $1.6015 late Thursday. But it fell in New York to $1.6010 from $1.6040.
Against the Canadian dollar, the United States dollar fell to 1.17505 from 1.17575.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Silver Prices Drop; Grains and Soybeans Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures tumbled yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange, settling $5.30 to $5.60 lower, with the contract for April delivery at $389.40 a troy ounce, the lowest settlement for a near-month gold contract since Nov. 10. European selling was heavy as the dollar resumed its advance against most other major currencies.
On other commodity markets, silver also retreated, grains and soybeans fell, energy futures advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
Silver futures ended 4.1 cents to 4.7 cents lower in New York, with March at $5.043 a troy ounce.
 
Stronger Dollar a Factor
 Gold prices have skidded from nearly $430 an ounce over the last six weeks. April gold fell by $11.50 in this week alone. Gold is traded in dollars on the world market, so a stronger dollar makes the metal more expensive in terms of other currencies, discouraging foreign buying. That factor seems to be playing a larger role in the market at present than does gold's traditional role as a safe haven during times of inflation, which Britain is suffering, and political crises, like that now gripping Lithuania.
''The dollar is becoming the safe haven,'' said John Jonat, a trader in precious metals with Deak International Inc.
Prices of soybean futures fell substantially on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting expectations of traders that Brazilian soy exports may resume soon. Grain futures prices fell modestly. Exports of Brazilian soybean meal and oil have been on hold this week while the Government carries out economic changes aimed at halting runaway inflation in the South American nation.
Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 1/2 cents lower, with May at $3.56 3/4 a bushel; corn futures were 1/4 cent to 1 1/2 cents lower, with May at $2.58 1/2 a bushel; oats were 1 1/4 cents to 2 cents lower, with May at $1.47 3/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents lower, with May at $5.98 a bushel.
 
Fuel Prices Higher
 Petroleum futures advanced in technically inspired trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 39 cents higher, with May at $20.39 a barrel; heating oil was 0.45 cent to 0.70 cent higher, with April at 55.46 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.15 cent to 1.56 cents higher, with April at 57.66 cents a gallon.
Expectations for stronger cash markets next week prompted buying of livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork bellies ended mixed ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly cold-storage report, which showed a lower-than-expected amount of pork bellies in commercial freezers as of Feb. 28.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
With Bulbs, Light and Price Are the Key Considerations

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Consumers who think they can spot the bargains and the pitfalls in the supermarket aisles should pay close attention in the light bulb section, a part of the store where choices are multiplying, where common terms don't mean what people think they do, and the important measure, light, is almost always overlooked.
* Which gives more light for a given amount of electricity, a ''miser'' 55-watt bulb or a regular 60-watt bulb? Either. They are virtually equal.
* Which gives more light, two 60-watt bulbs or one 100-watt bulb? Either. They are about equal, too. 
 
* Can you save money by paying extra for a long-life bulb, which is advertised as lasting twice as long as the regular bulb? Generally no. The long-life bulb generally has a higher purchase price per hour of service, and it gives off less light than a standard bulb of equal wattage.
As is common in supermarkets, a pocket calculator is the surest way to evaluate the choices.
Bulbs are sold by wattage, but a watt is not a measure of light. It is a measure of energy consumed; in this case, of how much electricity the bulb uses. A second figure on the box, lumens, tells how much light the bulb gives off.
Some stores sell a 55-watt bulb meant to be a substitute for a standard 60-watt bulb. This is the first opportunity to misunderstand what is offered.
The packaging that suggests the 55-watt model as a replacement for the 60, and the price, which is sometimes higher, could lead a buyer to conclude that the 55-watt bulb gives off the same amount of light, although it uses 8.3 percent less electricity. In fact, the 60-watt bulb gives off 870 lumens and the 55-watt model, 810 lumens, or about 6.9 percent less light, with a small gain in efficiency.
 
Not All Bulbs Are the Same
 At the national average price of electricity, the 55-watt bulb would use about 30 cents less power over its lifetime. This saving could easily be outweighed by the higher price.
That is not to say that all bulbs are the same. They do vary in number of lumens delivered per watt of energy supplied, an efficiency measure similar to miles per gallon for a car. Generally, the larger bulbs are more efficient. So a 100-watt bulb typically delivers 1,750 lumens, which is just slightly more than two 60-watt bulbs.
A questionable economy is bulbs that are supposed to last longer. Figures will vary with wattage and brand. A standard 60-watt bulb might be advertised as lasting 1,000 hours, and a long-life bulb, 1,500 hours. At $1.75 each, the long-life bulb costs 12 one-hundredths of a cent per hour of service life. At 95 cents each, the standard bulb costs 10 one-hundredths of a cent per hour. And the standard bulb gives off 14.5 lumens per watt; the long-life bulb, 13.7. Still, the long-life bulb is a good choice if it is going into the ceiling fixture of your two-story entryway.
Far more efficient bulbs are available. Halogen bulbs, for example, deliver almost 20 lumens per watt, or one-fourth more light for the same amount of electricity. And fluorescents deliver 40 to 80 lumens per watt, or 2 1/2 to 5 times as much light per unit of electricity. Several manufacturers now make fluorescents that screw into a standard incandescent base, and these are available in hardware stores and home centers.
How important is efficiency in a light bulb? In commercial buildings, where lights are usually on all day, lighting efficiency is becoming a major consideration. For homes, the value depends on the use of the bulb. For example, a homeowner who substituted a 100-watt bulb for two 60-watt bulbs would be saving 20 watts. If the light burns for 6 hours a night, a customer in New York City and Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would save about $6 a year in electricity. At the national average price for electricity, the figure would be closer to $4.
That is a very modest difference. But in other applications, the choice is more important. For example, a consumer who keeps a 60-watt light burning 12 hours a day in a hallway or bathroom spends about $21 a year, at the average electricity price. A screw-in fluorescent would have an operating cost of only about $6.
The fluorescents sell for $20 to $30, depending on model, but they typically last for 10,000 hours, compared with 1,000 hours for the standard incandescent. Over the 10,000-hour lifetime, at the average electricity price, the fluorescent bulb would save the consumer about $34 in operating costs, and because it would outlive about 10 incandescents, it would save, at minimum, another $10.
But earning the savings would take the bulb its entire lifetime. That means that the usefulness of a better bulb depends on what it is being used for.
 
Is It Worth the Price?
 In a 24-hour-a-day application, achieving the entire savings would take 14 months, making the initial investment attractive. But in a spare bedroom used only a few times a year, it could take decades, and the consumer would be better off buying a cheaper incandescent.
In addition, fluorescents will not fit all fixtures and cannot be used outdoors.
For consumers who take the broadest view, there are other more cosmic considerations, not just the cost of electricity. Substituting a more efficient bulb can reduce the amount of coal or oil burned. And the less coal burned, the less acid rain; the less oil used, the lower the trade deficit.

HEADLINE: NO LONG-TERM PLAN ON MILITARY SAVING

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
At a time when receding Soviet military power suggests that hundreds of billions of dollars will be cut from the Pentagon budget in this decade, the Bush Administration and Congress are so absorbed in the politics of the moment that neither has begun to develop a strategy for using the money.
White House officials say no one in the Administration has been specifically assigned to examine how the military savings should be allocated in the last half of the decade, when by the Administration's own accounting the amount will be sizable.
This worries many scholars and some politicians, who fear that without forethought, the windfall will be frittered away. After the Vietnam War, unplanned and unrestrained social spending gobbled up the dollars saved by the American withdrawal. More Than a Mirage? ''The so-called peace dividend,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, ''is not something that will magically appear like Athena fully armed from the brow of Zeus. The peace dividend will become reality when it is decided upon, planned for and managed over a period of years, as a matter of national policy.'' 
President Bush takes the position that the peace dividend is largely a mirage and that the small sums that may prove real in the next few years must be used entirely to reduce the Federal deficit. Some critics argue that the President is ducking the issue.
Others maintain that Mr. Bush is playing a cagy political game, avoiding policy decisions that might dent his popularity.
In any case, without forceful leadership from the White House, Congress is unlikely to act.
The Democrats, who control Congress, are riven by ideological and jurisdictional disputes, and they seem to be splitting into several camps over the issue of how to allocate domestic spending. So far this year, they have been unable to agree on the size and shape of next year's military budget, much less on a long-range view.
''The word 'plan' has gone out of style,'' said James David Barber, a political scientist at Duke University who is an expert on the Presidency. ''What has happened in American politics is its drift to sentimentality and emotion, which substitute for looking at the facts that face you at the moment.''
Uncertainties in world affairs and the national economy mean that the eventual size of the peace dividend cannot be precisely forecast. But it is clear that at least 40 percent of this year's $300 billion Pentagon budget is aimed at fighting a land war in Europe, a prospect that now seems remote, and that the military expansion the Bush Administration was planning as recently as last summer is no longer necessary.
If military spending is reduced by an average of only $10 billion a year, or 3 percent, for the next 10 years, the Pentagon budget in the year 2000 will be $100 billion lower than it is now (in 1990 dollars), and the cumulative saving over the decade will be $550 billion.
The money could be used to cut taxes, to reduce the budget deficit and begin paying off the $3 trillion national debt or to increase spending on domestic programs and international assistance. Or it could be used for some combination of the three. Critics say the Government should now begin a broad debate over these alternatives.
After the Vietnam War, the savings were spent without a plan or much public debate.
From 1968 to 1976, the military budget fell to $195 billion, in 1990 dollars, from $302 billion. Most of the money was used to increase Social Security and Medicare payments. Those expenditures were popular at the time, but they are one of the causes of the large deficit the country now faces.
If Mr. Bush has reflected on the matter, it is not apparent from his public statements. ''I think the American people want a cautious approach on this,'' he said at a news conference last month. ''I don't think any of us can see with clairvoyance what's going to happen the day after tomorrow.''
 
Ostriches and Unknowns
Mr. Bush's position has reinforced the conviction of some Administration officials that long-range planning is futile.
''Surprises tend to be negative, and we cannot plan for the things that will come up and bite us,'' said a top adviser to the President.
But others agree with an under secretary who said he was frustrated by what he called ''the ostrich response'' and added: ''We know we're going to be wrong. We know unknowns will occur. Nonetheless, if you don't think through what the possibilities are, you're liable to have such a narrow focus that you're unable to respond to the possibilities when some of them turn out to be true.''
Politicians outside the Administration say Mr. Bush's unwillingness to address the situation is based on two political factors: his reluctance to risk his popularity by taking positions that could generate opposition, and his feeling that discussion of a large peace dividend over a decade would lead to more demands now for spending on social programs.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a potential challenger in the 1992 Presidential race, said that Mr. Bush was ''the best politician I've ever seen in the White House'' and that ''as a politician, he wouldn't do anything risky or controversial unless he had to.''
To that view, which is widely held in political circles, the Governor added an extra twist. ''Why should he fool with the peace dividend now,'' Mr. Cuomo asked, ''when he can save it till 1991, just before the election,'' and distribute it then for popular domestic programs?
Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, a leading Republican on budget issues, said Mr. Bush's reluctance to discuss the long-range implications of military savings probably resulted from ''a deep concern that advocates of every social program people have been scheming about, from child care to health benefits,'' would lay claim to the money and ''spend it three times over.''
Like many other lawmakers of both parties, Mr. Rudman said authority in Congress was too diffuse to develop a coherent strategy. ''The leadership on this must come from the White House,'' he said.
Congress has been further hampered by its peculiar rules for writing a budget. The Bush Administration has proposed spending $292 billion at the Pentagon next year, about $5 billion more than in the current fiscal year but about $6 billion less than what would be needed to keep pace with inflation.
 
Budget First, Then Plan
Congress is sure to lower that figure, the question being by how much. Some Administration officials suggest they could accept a modest reduction.
Logically, Congress would first address the position it thought the United States should occupy in the new world order, then decide what kind of military would be needed to protect that position and how much it would cost. Finally the legislators would draft a budget for the Pentagon and the rest of the Government. But the rules require the lawmakers to approve next year's budget by next month, long before the foundation has been laid.
Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, complained that he could not begin to take a long-term view because he was ''under great pressure to meet budgetary deadlines.'' He said he would like to be able to prepare a military budget based on an ''overall strategic look from the Armed Services Committee, but we're not getting it.''
The chairman of the armed services panel, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, maintained in a speech on the floor Thursday that he could not provide detailed advice to the budget writers because the Pentagon had not developed a military strategy that took account of changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney rejected Mr. Nunn's criticism and said the Democratic lawmakers were offering ''complaints instead of solutions.''
Mr. Cheney complicated the political situation by publishing a list of military bases that might be closed to save money. A study released this weekend by the Democratic Study Group, an organization of liberal Democrats in the House, concluded that 99 percent of the jobs lost under that plan would be in Congressional districts represented by Democrats.
A Pentagon spokesman said Mr. Cheney's plan was not grounded in politics, but Republican lawmakers acknowledged that there had been much chortling in their cloakroom over the discomfort the base list had caused Democrats.
Democrats in the House have such a large majority that if they are united, they can afford to ignore their Republican colleagues. Various Democratic factions got together last week and agreed on small cuts in military spending next year and larger ones in the years ahead.
 
'A Whole New Global Struggle'
Because of institutional jealousies, senators and representatives rarely work in tandem. Representative Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat on the military appropriations subcommittee, said the agreement of the House Democrats represented ''a recognition that it is suicidal politically and dumb in terms of policy for Democrats to simply be looking at the maximum number of cookies that can be taken out of the Defense cookie jar.''
Senator Sasser said he thought the Democrats in the House were merely postponing the tough choices. But in separate interviews, both he and Mr. AuCoin agreed that the budget problems this year paled next to the need for a long-term strategy. ''The global struggle we've been laboring in for my political lifetime,'' said Mr. AuCoin, ''is being replaced with a whole new global struggle, an economic struggle, and I wonder every day how we, how the United States, is going to figure in it.''

HEADLINE: While Land Prices in Japan Soar, Officials Fight Back With Words

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 24

 BODY:
Each of the last four years, the Government of Japan has declared a well-publicized war on this country's astronomical and still-rising land prices, the world's highest. But despite the strong oratory, the soldiers in the war never seem to leave their barracks.
The rising land prices have become as permanent a part of the landscape as Mount Fuji and the situation has been declared the worst domestic problem. Some people warn that high land prices threaten to split Japan into a two-tier society of haves and have-nots.
Examined closely, this nagging issue has become a mirror reflecting aspects of the Japanese economy that are rarely so clearly visible to outsiders, many experts say. These include the extraordinary influence that interest groups exercise, the inefficiencies at the heart of Japan's economy and the benefits accorded to industry at the expense of individuals. Is There a Scarcity? ''The problem is not scarcity,'' said Yukio Noguchi, a professor at Hitosubashi University and author of a recent book on Japan's land policy. ''There's plenty of land. It's a political and social problem.'' 
Property prices have reached stupefying heights. The Government, for example, recently paid more than $1 million a yard for the land to widen a stretch of road, 99.5 percent of the road's total cost. And a Tokyo finance company just began offering 100-year mortgages so that the burden of paying for a house can be passed from generation to generation - an innovative way to put home ownership within reach of more Japanese.
 
Cheaper in Manhattan
The best residential property in Tokyo now costs about $69,000 a square yard, while the top commercial space runs about $210,000 a square yard. Many small two-bedroom apartments in Tokyo sell for $1 million.
In recent weeks, the plunging Tokyo stock market has provided a pressing reason for Japanese officials to be cautious in trying to attack high land prices. Soaring property prices have been intimately linked to the 1980's boom on the Tokyo stock market and the general health of the Japanese economy.
The steady rise in the value of corporate land holdings provided a good reason for investors to bid up the price of companies' shares. Moreover, Japanese corporations used their land as collateral for low-interest loans, giving them inexpensive money to invest in new technology and new factories, Thus rising land prices helped finance corporate Japan's international expansion during the last decade.
Now, with Tokyo share prices slipping, fears have been expressed by bankers and brokers that land prices might follow stock prices down, precipitating a crash that could spread to financial markets worldwide.
But most experts in the economics and politics of Japanese land prices doubt that such a fall will occur, given the formidable array of special interests behind the current system.
''Europeans and Americans think the Japanese are so efficient in everything they do,'' said Yutaka Harada, a land-policy expert at the Government's Economic Planning Agency. ''But the land problem demonstrates that we are not interested in efficiency at all.''
 
Barrier to Foreigners
Japan's land prices have become an important trade issue as well. American companies say the prohibitive cost of land is a formidable barrier to foreign businesses entering Japan.
The real problem, Japanese experts agree, is not a shortage of land, as is generally assumed, but the web of special-interest regulations and tax laws that now surround land ownership. The result is a strikingly inefficient use of property.
For example, the Tokyo metropolitan region, home to 31 million people, includes 88,000 acres of undeveloped farmland. Even in central Tokyo, farm plots take up roughly 4,500 acres. It is common to see weekend farmers tending rows of cabbages or vines of table grapes amid towering apartment blocks and industrial structures.
In addition, Tokyo is built to less than a third of its modest maximum legal density; the average number of stories in the city's buildings is barely more than two.
There has long been an official chorus of disapproval about Japan's steep real estate prices. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu recently referred to Japanese housing as ''impoverished'' and acknowledged that the problem was creating social resentments.
Michio Fukai, executive director of the Bank of Japan, said in an interview, ''It is an issue of social justice.''
 
Decrees Fail to Work
But the outcry for change has never been matched by credible measures, which is why few believe the Government's latest pledges. As one example, even though the Finance Ministry has issued directives that banks restrain lending for speculative property purchases, such lending soared 14 percent last year, and prices continued to rise.
Also, any restraint exercised by banks was more than offset by sharp increases in property lending by non-bank financial institutions, such as leasing companies and insurance companies. ''Our big headache now is the non-banks,'' Mr. Fukai of the Bank of Japan said. ''We have no direct route to exercise control over them.''
There has been little apparent effect from a plan to have bureaucrats monitor land sales and simply order lower prices in transactions deemed too rich. When prices in Tokyo leveled off in 1988 after rocketing up more than 60 percent in 1987, costs simply shot upwards in cities like Osaka, up 50 percent in 1989, and Kyoto, up 80 percent. And those gains encouraged prices to rebound in the Tokyo area.
The total 1988 market value of land in Japan, a nation roughly the size of California, is estimated at $15 trillion, or five times that of the United States, according to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
 
'Serious Disincentive'
''In the long run this is the most serious economic problem we have because it is such a serious disincentive for people to work,'' said Prof. Noguchi of Hitotsubashi University. ''It has such a big impact on how resources are allocated in Japan.''
In Tokyo, the Japanese policy has resulted in a crazy quilt of small, sometimes minuscule plots, rather than larger sites that allow more extensive development. In the middle of the Ginza, the most expensive commercial district in the world, there are Lilliputian structures on lots as small as 6 feet by 18 feet. A club, called the Mini-Bar, sits in a building barely wide enough for a normal-sized door, but it occupies a rectangle of property worth roughly $3.6 million.
Many economists agree that if the the problem were tackled with more credible policies, like significant changes in property taxes, the sweeping political and social repurcussions would be hard for politicians to face.
''What is needed is a very brave political move,'' said Takao Akabane, the former vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency. ''But most, if not all, of our politicians are short of such courage.''
Among the key problems cited by economists are: -
* Capital gains taxes of as much as 94 percent discourage land sales, with owners preferring to keep land idle rather than sell it for more efficient uses.
* Extremely low property taxes encourage people to buy and hold land as a store of wealth rather than put it to use. Annual land taxes in Tokyo run about one-tenth of a percent of the market value of the land, economists say, compared with about 4 percent in New York City.
* Too much urban land is still designated agricultural land and taxed at a rate about a tenth of regular land taxes. This provides little incentive for the land to be put to other uses.
* Tenants enjoy extraordinary protections against rent increases and eviction in Japan, a situation that discourages landowners from renting or from creating rentable property. ''From an economic standpoint, leasing is irrational behavior,'' said Prof. Noguchi. Mr. Akabane said the basic law was written in 1941 to insure that the families of conscripted soldiers would not lose their homes while their husbands, sons and fathers were fighting in World War II.
* When land is inherited, it is valued at a fraction of the market price and taxed at a low level, which encourages people to keep land idle as a store of wealth and a tax dodge rather than put it to more productive use.
* There is too much concentration of government and business in central Tokyo, straining supply in this area. ''That concentration has been a key reason prices have skyrocketed in this area,'' said Mr. Fukai of the Bank of Japan.
* The money supply in Japan has grown at a spectacular pace since 1985. The rapid growth was intended to cushion the Japanese economy against a recession when the value of the yen was doubled in an effort to reduce Japan's large trade surpluses. A side effect was that extremely low interest rates encouraged property speculation.
The first step in the Government's latest effort to halt the price rise has been to tighten monetary policy sharply. The Bank of Japan has just raised its official discount rate for the fourth time since last May. That has sent long-term rates, at which most real estate loans are made, to their highest level in six years.
 
'Not Optimistic'
''We are not optimistic that we are succeeding yet,'' Mr. Fukai said. ''We are still cautious because of the past experiences.''

HEADLINE: The Green Movement in the Fashion World

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
Saving the planet is very much in vogue. It's also in Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Mademoiselle.
It's the message on fashion runways, in marketing strategies, in jewelry and accessory designs, on shopping bags and totes, in advertisements and on price tags.
A naked fashion model wearing a hat of birch branches and lichen, as shown in Vogue this month, may not be everyone's idea of environmental awareness. But the pervasiveness of ecological themes in the images and marketing of fashion is undeniable. It is also somewhat paradoxical. 
The fashion industry, whose driving philosophy involves encouraging consumers to discard the old (and sometimes still serviceable) and embrace the new (and presumably more stylish), is now trying to push itself to the forefront of efforts to conserve and preserve.
The phenomenon goes well beyond apparel, to fashion in the wider sense. A SoHo furniture store sells only politically correct woods: tropical hardwoods are out. A Madison Avenue boutique stocks only cosmetics made from flowers or plants, including what it calls ''pure fume'' instead of perfume.
This extraordinary convergence of commerce and ecology calls into question fundamental notions about consumerism, responsibility and, ultimately, fashion.
 
Of 'Premeditated Waste'
''The irony is that we're talking about a business based on premeditated waste,'' said Stuart Ewen, the chairman of the Communications Department at Hunter College. ''If you were to do a study of the history of product obsolescence,'' he went on, ''the model would be fashion. The first industry that built in disposability as a feature of economic survival was the ready-made clothing industry.''
The environmental theme in fashion began as wispy touches and graphic exhortations in designer collections, not as some well-thought-out strategy of ''green'' marketing in which the environmental advantages of a product become part of the sales approach.
Tendrils of ivy dangled from the ceiling at a Paris fashion show; a carpet of grass covered a runway in New York; models marched along in T-shirts or carrying signs all bearing slogans like ''Clean Up or Die,'' ''Save the Sphere,'' and ''Environmental Protection Agents.'' And for the last few seasons, there have been the new ''softer'' styles, to suit a gentler, less self-referential age.
 
Leaves, Branches, Earth Tones
Where once the symbols of conspicuous consumption reigned - black, gray and red the prevailing colors, broad shoulders and tapered waists the dominant silhouette, reflecting a culture anxious to project success, control and victory over one's surroundings - now Pan, with cloven hooves, was leaving his mark on the runway. There were dresses with leaves, accessories with branches, and, everywhere, earth tones.
The environmental spin on fashion has now moved into the mass market, where ''clothes with conscience'' make an extra tug at the buyer's self-image.
Apparel companies like Ellen Tracy, Esprit, Bonjour, J. G. Hook and Country Road Australia are now promoting efforts to preserve the environment either through their advertising, their licensing arrangements or their direct contributions to ecological causes.
Bonjour, a jeans and sportswear company based in New York, has embarked on a program to ''change the individual's outlook toward saving the environment'' through educational tags. This summer, the first wave of what Bonjour executives said would be 50 million fashion items a year are to arrive in stores carrying tags with environmental tips from how to save water to how to reduce pollutants.
''I don't know if our campaign will sell a single garment,'' said Charles Dayan, president of Bonjour International. ''But it's definitely not a fad.'' $90,000 Raised for Preservation Hermes, the French luxury goods manufacturer, has raised more than $90,000 for the Rainforest Alliance, a preservation group, at fund-raising parties in its stores around the country. Hermes, whose silk scarves are among the most popular symbols of conspicuous consumption worldwide, has declared 1990 the ''year of the outdoors'' and added a line of nature-inspired products, including a $175 signature scarf.
Whether these tributes to nature will benefit the environment or even raise environmental awareness, with concomitant changes in individual behavior, is not clear. There is some skepticism.
Professor Ewen says the new environmental symbolism should be viewed as part of an overall change in America's economy, from one built on industrial production of hard goods to one based on ''pure representation.''
''Disembodied symbols, unconnected to material reality, whether we're talking about junk bonds, credit or information, are the primary product,'' said Professor Ewen, author of ''All Consuming Images'' (Basic Books, 1988). ''Going back to fashion, the environment has become a commercial cliche separated from real concerns. What can be attached to this year's fashion is merely the symbolism of environmental sanity.''
 
Fake Furs on the Runway
Green marketing is somewhat problematic in fashion. While a chemical company might introduce a line of more biodegradable packaging, apparel makers can offer little in the way of material improvement in their final products except to use natural fibers, and they go to great lengths to do so.
Last week in Paris, Frederic Castet, a French designer, responded to the critics of fake fur, who say it is more environmentally destructive than real fur because of toxic chemicals used to make it. Working with a French textile maker, he showed the first faux fur fashions made from a biodegradable synthetic fur on the runway.
''Some of these things are ridiculous,'' said Michael Leva, a New York designer who supports environmental causes. ''I don't see how you can design a collection that's kind to the environment.''
Lester Brown, the president of the Worldwatch Institute, has one suggestion: ''If the interest in environmental matters translates into fabrics that can be washed instead of dry-cleaned, it would be a contribution.'' Some dry-cleaning processes use chlorinated solvents that are toxic.
 
A Switch by a Master of Change
But Mr. Brown added: ''We need to see some value changes that will weaken the effect of changing styles on people's purchasing decisions. To reduce the stress on the earth, perhaps we will see fashion move toward more durability and simplification.''
The crux of the matter is not so much fashion's industrial processes as its underlying ethos of change. The more fashionable a garment is, the more likely it will soon be out of fashion. The influential Italian designer Giorgio Armani, whose New York store has sponsored ''Don't Bungle the Jungle'' benefit parties, is a master of such change.
Mr. Armani, a proponent of wide sharp-shouldered ''power'' looks for men and women throughout the last decade, has reversed course in the past few years, removing the padding from his jackets. He is now moving instead toward the slouchy, more natural silhouettes of cardigan-like jackets for women and the Ivy League sack suit for men.
It could be argued that if a man stuck with traditional tailoring for the last 10 years, he might have a closet full of serviceable suits rather than a group of outdated Armanis. But the fact that Mr. Armani is able to outdate himself so smoothly is the key to large-scale success in fashion. It thrives on change, but it must at least appear to be rational change.
 
Lag in Clothing Sales
Most designers and apparel executives, however, reject the idea that they consciously manipulate consumer tastes as part of a self-serving system of fashion change.
''I don't do clothes to be influential,'' said Isaac Mizrahi, a leading New York designer. ''I do them because they're beautiful and I can't help it. When I picture the ultimate woman customer, she keeps everything she buys and donates the clothes at the end of her life to a museum.''
Designers and manufacturers are already facing a fashion retailing landscape that has been slow for more than two years. Unit sales of most kinds of clothing are down, although price increases, based on the soaring costs of fabrics, especially silk and wool, have kept dollar volume high.
''Things go out of style too quickly,'' said Norma Kamali, a designer who gave her most recent fashion show in Central Park, where models wore T-shirts reading ''Acid Rain Squad'' and ''Earth Children.''
 
Emotions, Moods, Change
''Fashion appeals to the emotions and moods of human beings,'' Ms. Kamali said. ''These change quickly. That's why we're in such trouble now.''
Ms. Kamali suggested that there may be ''a whole new way of designing and presenting clothes'' that involves fewer designers and fewer stores - a shakeout, she said, that is already happening.
Others doubt that environmentalism will inspire profound changes in fashion. ''You'll notice we're not pushing going back to the fig leaf and the Garden of Eden,'' said an executive at a leading New York fashion house, asking not to be identified by name.
Mr. Mizrahi said, ''There will always be beautiful, luxurious clothes no matter how ecologically sound they are.''

HEADLINE: Prospect of Arms Pacts Spurring Weapon Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union are increasing foreign arms sales in advance of major new agreements to slash the level of conventional forces in Europe, American officials and arms industry executives say.
The superpowers are preparing to sell other countries some of the weapons that would have to be destroyed once a treaty takes effect. In addition, huge amounts of arms and military equipment not covered by the treaty will become available if the two sides cut the number of troops in Europe, as now planned.
As the two countries disengage from regional conflicts, third-world nations feel a greater need to build up their own military establishments, the experts said. Thus, they said, improvements in Soviet-American relations have had the paradoxical effect of increasing the other countries' appetites for missiles, tanks, warplanes and artillery. 
The officials said that Washington would step up sales to increase the security of friends overseas, as a possible substitute for foreign aid and to keep military production lines open at a time when the Pentagon is cutting back its budget. For Moscow, the arms sales are a source of hard-currency income.
 
Concern in Congress
Representative David R. Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for foreign aid, expressed concern about the sales. ''I doubt very much that Congress is going to feel that that is an appropriate response to the changes we have seen in the world during the last year,'' he said.
The Administration recently sent Congress a classified report listing $30 billion worth of possible arms sales by the United States to foreign countries. The report identifies the sales most likely to occur this year: 56 transactions totaling $9.8 billion.
The United States is selling Egypt 700 M-60 tanks no longer needed by American forces in Europe. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said the United States was also talking to Thailand, Oman, Jordan, Pakistan, Tunisia and Morocco ''to ascertain possible interest in acquiring some of these tanks.''
The United States Ambassador to the Philippines, Nicholas Platt, on home leave this week, was working on a proposal to use surplus military equipment from Europe to help offset a $96 million shortfall in foreign aid promised to the Philippines.
 
Moscow's Idea, Too
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, chief of the United States Central Command, which covers the Middle East and Southwest Asia, said the Soviets had similar ideas.
''The primary source of hard currency for the Soviet Union today is in arms sales, and I think it's going to continue to be that way, given the state of their economy,'' he said. ''So I have every reason to believe that if they have a lot of excess military equipment on their hands, we have a lot of countries that have got a lot of cash, and they're going to buy it, and the Soviets are going to sell it to them.''
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact expect to reach agreement this year on a conventional arms treaty that would limit five major types of weapons: tanks, other armored combat vehicles, artillery, aircraft and helicopters. Other weapons would not be covered and would not have to be destroyed.
A State Department official said the agreements would have a ''cascade effect'' as weapons spill down from the United States and the Soviet Union to other countries. Rather than destroying sophisticated aircraft in Europe, the United States could, for example, transfer such planes to Turkey, which would destroy older, less capable planes.
 
Arms Glut Is Predicted
Col. Ralph A. Hallenbeck, who retired in December as chief of conventional arms negotiations for the United States Army, said ''there will be a glut'' of ammunition, rifles, machine guns, antitank weapons, antiaircraft weapons, reconnaissance vehicles and other military equipment if NATO and the Warsaw Pact make drastic troop reductions in Europe, as now planned. ''It is unclear how either side intends to dispose of those weapons,'' he said.
A Pentagon official said it would be difficult to negotiate an agreement with the Soviet Union to prevent the dumping of surplus weapons in third-world countries because Moscow had a ''massive investment'' in such arms, having sacrificed decades of economic development to build them.
Even if Moscow accepted limits on foreign arms sales, Administration officials said they would object. In the next few years, they said, the United States will want to use surplus weapons as a form of security assistance for its friends and allies, a substitute for cash at a time when the foreign aid budget is squeezed by demands from newly emerging democracies.
Asked if it was wise to pour arms into the third world, President Bush said at a news conference last week, ''We still have security needs that we feel are enhanced by transfer of military equipment, sales of military equipment to friendly countries.''
To make up for cutbacks in Pentagon procurement, some defense contractors have tried to diversify their work, emphasizing civilian applications of military technology. Others are stepping up efforts to sell weapons overseas.
Joel L. Johnson, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association of America, a trade association of 53 companies, said, ''Foreign arms sales will become increasingly important to American arms manufacturers as Pentagon purchases decline.''
''As the superpowers pull back from regional conflicts, that is likely to heighten the desire of smaller countries for a more proficient military establishment with better weapons,'' he said. ''International competition for those markets will become tougher and more frenetic.''
 
How One Company Is Affected
The General Dynamics Corporation, maker of the M-1 Abrams tank, illustrates the trend. Under the budget submitted to Congress in January by President Bush, the United States Army will sharply curtail purchases of such tanks next year. But in its latest annual report, published this month, General Dynamics said that foreign sales of the M-1 tank ''are projected to increase dramatically.''
Egypt has agreed to buy 555 of the tanks. The Administration informed Congress in October that it intends to sell 315 of the tanks to Saudi Arabia. In its latest report to Congress, the Administration said it might sell 200 Abrams tanks to Kuwait. Pakistan is talking with the United States about buying some, and General Dynamics is competing with a British company to supply hundreds of such tanks to the British Army.
Alvin A. Spivak, a spokesman for General Dynamics, said that the foreign business, combined with even a small number of sales to the United States Army, could keep open the company's tank-production plants. The plants, in Warren, Mich., and Lima, Ohio, would otherwise face the prospect of shutdown in the next two years.
Under Federal law, the President must send Congress a list each year of all foreign arms sales ''considered eligible for approval.'' The list shows all sales of more than $7 million being seriously considered. There is no guarantee that all the sales will occur. Some will be postponed or canceled, some will be added and prices will change.
While it is not possible to compare the new list with historical data in any reliable way, Administration officials said the total for 1990 would be at least as high as sales in the last few years: $11 billion in 1989, $12 billion in 1988, $7 billion in 1987 and $7 billion in 1986.
 
Seoul Is a Big Customer
The biggest potential customer this year, South Korea, is listed as a likely buyer of 120 F-18 Hornet warplanes, of which 72 would be manufactured in a joint production arrangement with the United States. Seoul could spend as much as $3.5 billion on the purchase and production of the planes. In addition, the list shows that South Korea might buy 81 UH-60 transport helicopters at a cost of $1.2 billion.
The next biggest customers are Saudi Arabia, which expects to buy $660 million of equipment for Awacs radar planes and $3 billion worth of light armored vehicles; Egypt, which plans to buy helicopter gunships, F-16 jet fighters and large amounts of ammunition, and the United Arab Emirates, which is listed as a potential customer for 40 F-18 planes costing $1.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Human Rights Abuses Raising Little Alarm in Peru

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
International organizations increasingly rank this strife-torn Andean nation among the world's violators of human rights.
''Torture, mutilation, 'disappearance,' murder and rape have become a hallmark of the armed forces' 'campaign against terrorism,' '' says Amnesty International's latest report on Peru.
But as violence by terrorists rises, human rights workers and diplomats detect a parallel rise in Peruvians' tolerance for their Government's methods. ''We are now on the level of Argentina, but in the Peruvian consciousness the dead are not weighing as heavily as in Argentina,'' said Nelson Manrique, a historian who studies the main rebel group here, the leftist Shining Path. 
During Argentina's military dictatorship in the late 1970's, security forces killed at least 9,000 people in a war on those accused of subversion. In Peru, a democracy, political violence claimed about 18,000 lives in the 1980's - a figure about evenly divided between victims of security forces and victims of the Shining Path.
Last year, the number of lives lost to political violence jumped 60 percent, to 3,198. The United States State Department said of Peru in an annual report that ''1989 was the most violent year'' since Shining Path announced its ''popular war'' in 1980.
Unlike the victims in Argentina, most of the victims of Peru's war on subversion are poor, rural and of Indian or mixed race. In Argentina, many were middle class, white and residents of the capital, Buenos Aires.
''The central problem is racial,'' said Francisco Soberon, coordinator of the Association for Human Rights, an independent group here. ''The peasant world is seen as a second-class world, so the majority of victims are unable to generate any sympathy.''
Mr. Soberon said 90 percent of the vicitms of Peru's estimated 3,000 political abductions were Indians or people of mixed Indian and European race.
Despite the worsening rights situation here, Peru's unfettered press seems increasingly bored with the issue.
''Human rights worker disappears,'' read a recent newspaper headline, buried at the bottom of page 14, on a missing co-worker of Mr. Soberon.
''Court absolves two terrorists for lack of proof,'' read another headline, reflecting widespread frustration in a nation where 5 percent of people arrested on terrorism charges are convicted.
Picking up the newspaper El Comercio recently, Enrique Bernales, a Socialist Senator who heads a congressional commission on violence, read about a confrontation between a peasant militia and the Shining Path.
''After a pitched battle of several minutes, nine subversives were captured,'' the senator read to a visitor. ''These were decapitated, and their heads were delivered to the authorities.''
''That's called extralegal execution, but you aren't going to see anyone in Lima writing editorials to protest it,'' he said.
Senator Bernales said interest in human rights was partly a victim of the country's economic crisis. Last year, Peru's economy shrank 12 percent and prices rose 2,700 percent.
In addition, concern grew in this capital, home to a third of Peru's 22 million people, that Shining Path was starting to threaten Lima. ''At their worst,'' a Western diplomat said, ''the leftists in Argentina never threatened to encircle Buenos Aires, cut off the food, cut off the electricity and make everyone starve in the streets. It's an issue here.''
On April 8, Peruvians are to vote for president. But human rights seems to be an invisible issue in the campaign.
In an interview, Luis Alva Castro, the candidate of the governing party, attributed foreign interest in human rights to the lobbying of ''overseas representatives of Shining Path.''
Mario Vargas Llosa, the center-right frontrunner, said that as president he would place greater controls on military conduct. The novelist said he would give the military better arms, radios and vehicles and bring schools, roads and clinics to Indian areas.
